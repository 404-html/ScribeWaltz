<v Speaker 2>Let me just throw out there.</v>

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.540

<v Speaker 2>what are you doing today?</v>

10
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go talk to Joe Rogan.</v>

11
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:34.001
<v Speaker 2>Then I launched into my leg 10 minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan pitch and at the end of it the</v>

12
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 2>person I was talking to goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've known him a long time as I've </v>

14
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 2>talked to him like twice.</v>

15
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.953
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just went on a passionate tirade </v>

16
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 2>about them and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

17
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love the way he lives.</v>

18
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:50.384
<v Speaker 2>Like every I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've loved the man since news radio and </v>

19
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:53.174
<v Speaker 2>then I like meeting the man and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and speaking with them on a previous </v>

20
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both his mind but not just that.</v>

21
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And I love your philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the way you do life.</v>

22
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 2>You handle it like the way I would if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was you,</v>

23
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 2>like this is the best compliment I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>give,</v>

24
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:08.954
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not using them gutless and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived through your instagram like I was </v>

25
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how a man lives.</v>

26
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 2>If only I could be this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So coming here is.</v>

27
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It's an absolute fucking pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we're going to your house.</v>

28
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:21.464
<v Speaker 2>But that happened years ago apparently </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved out of the house so people got </v>

29
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 2>creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is too many.</v>

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Too many creepy people like when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want them coming to your house,</v>

31
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 2>but you do want them on the podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

32
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.103
<v Speaker 2>When I went like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must have been awhile ago because </v>

33
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:36.164
<v Speaker 2>Megan was still working for me and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove me and she like had to take a </v>

34
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 2>leak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pissed outside.</v>

35
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Our podcast was so long and then I felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

36
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:47.084
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's why he's not having to be </v>

37
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:48.724
<v Speaker 2>back at the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like bringing him to a satellite </v>

38
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 2>office because he let's his assistant </v>
<v Speaker 2>void in the yard.</v>

39
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling fucking dope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

40
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.653
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you why I made this movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Yoga hosers that just finally </v>

41
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:01.994
<v Speaker 2>came onto Netflix and I took it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sundance in January and they bent me </v>

42
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 2>over and just critically speaking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just hate fucking it.</v>

43
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:10.214
<v Speaker 2>They hated this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people were viewed it from the </v>

44
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>moment we announced it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

45
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.293
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a movie with my </v>

46
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:15.734
<v Speaker 2>daughter and giant depths in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter's going to be a two and right </v>

47
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 2>away I saw like fucking long sharp </v>
<v Speaker 2>knives now and so as expected it goes to</v>

48
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:23.864
<v Speaker 2>sundance and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not saying this movie is for </v>

49
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:26.090
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

50
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 2>It's for like 10 people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the 10 people that love it,</v>

51
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like religion.</v>

52
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:31.324
<v Speaker 2>And so have you always done that though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of do what you like to do </v>

53
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 2>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could turn it around.</v>

54
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.253
<v Speaker 2>Turn on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I like about what you do is you </v>

55
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:38.504
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very much an accepted inside guy </v>

56
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.043
<v Speaker 2>who lives like some guy from Jersey who </v>
<v Speaker 2>is trying to break into the business </v>

57
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.233
<v Speaker 2>like this is useful because you never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand how people </v>

58
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:53.300
<v Speaker 2>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see you know,</v>

59
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 2>how the world sees you because they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you in any given moment,</v>

60
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

61
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>normal or sally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal people live in the real world and</v>

62
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

63
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 3>but your peers and people like we work </v>
<v Speaker 3>in entertainment and shit.</v>

64
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.760
<v Speaker 3>How you tell your very unaffected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a uniquely unaffected Casa.</v>

65
00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Like ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same time.</v>

66
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 3>I know you're very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're effective at doing what you enjoy</v>

67
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.693
<v Speaker 3>and that's why you have such a unique </v>
<v Speaker 3>and loyal fan base is because they know </v>

68
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like in this world,</v>

69
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of unique </v>
<v Speaker 3>visions.</v>

70
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.553
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get brought to producers and </v>

71
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.973
<v Speaker 3>executives and a bunch of people pile in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it becomes more of a an idea where </v>

72
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:34.924
<v Speaker 3>it's trying to appeal to a broader </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience and it switches up and then </v>

73
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:39.724
<v Speaker 3>someone wants to bring a love interest </v>
<v Speaker 3>or there's all sorts of influences that </v>

74
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 3>happen that homogenize as you drink some</v>
<v Speaker 3>milk.</v>

75
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 3>I know that was a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Milk.</v>

76
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh my Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was perfect.</v>

77
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Perfect timing of a standup comic.</v>

78
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Loving my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does really.</v>

79
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 3>That's the best word for it because even</v>
<v Speaker 3>though if it's good like you,</v>

80
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:57.334
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel like that guy like </v>

81
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 3>Tarantino is one of the unique guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

82
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 3>even though it's movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have these gigantic mega blockbusters,</v>

83
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.560
<v Speaker 3>it feels like he's doing his own thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

84
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.403
<v Speaker 3>Feels like this crazy fucker just got </v>
<v Speaker 3>the money and the wheels and they're </v>

85
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.084
<v Speaker 3>listening to him because he's Tarantino.</v>

00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We thought we saw everything.</v>

118
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I always felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people saw me as like,</v>

119
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.053
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did clerks and then he's done about </v>

120
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 3>96 variations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People need to see red state.</v>

121
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 3>If you haven't seen red state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is A.</v>

122
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say too much because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want people to go into it the way I went</v>

123
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go see that fucking movie.</v>

124
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 3>But that's another movie where even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though it wasn't like the same,</v>

125
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>it was</v>

126
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.470
<v Speaker 4>still a unique voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

127
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

128
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it's like to make a </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

129
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:02.474
<v Speaker 4>but it's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lot of people have a lot of say </v>

130
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 4>emerges is bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The budget,</v>

131
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.233
<v Speaker 4>the more you know you have to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of more people and you can't be </v>

132
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.114
<v Speaker 4>unreasonable about if you get him </v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amounts of success like jj </v>

133
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 4>Abrams and you're a nice guy at the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

134
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 4>you know you can get away with being </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

135
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do whatever I want and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like what you want tends to work,</v>

136
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 4>so here go nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but generally speaking,</v>

137
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.434
<v Speaker 4>the more money you accept,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more input you also have to accept </v>

138
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 4>lower the budget and if it's coming out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your pocket,</v>

139
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 4>you don't gotta say Shit to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody can tell you anything,</v>

140
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.973
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're putting together something </v>

141
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 4>small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still a smaller circle of people.</v>

142
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.380
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of answered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's.</v>

143
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 4>You always have to be willing to hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're saying.</v>

144
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.473
<v Speaker 4>If somebody is willing to give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>ungodly matrimony and make pretend mind </v>

145
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not like,</v>

146
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.183
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to give you funds and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to give me eggs and I'm going to </v>

147
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 4>sell those eggs and I'm going to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>more money selling those eggs.</v>

148
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to give you money and you're</v>

149
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.993
<v Speaker 4>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take this goofy fucking idea you have </v>

150
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 4>and try to make it real and turn it into</v>
<v Speaker 4>a movie that may work or may not work.</v>

151
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:00.644
<v Speaker 4>It's all a crapshoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like buying a lottery ticket to </v>

152
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.833
<v Speaker 4>much degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No guarantees that they'll ever be an </v>

153
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.224
<v Speaker 4>audience for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I learned that midway my career and </v>

154
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 4>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

155
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 4>just work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds masturbatory,</v>

156
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 4>but it's like if you are the audience </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're trying to hit,</v>

157
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 4>then you'll always be satisfied.</v>

158
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.313
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you want other people to </v>

159
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:20.894
<v Speaker 4>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's subjective and you may not find </v>

160
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 4>that people dig what you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

161
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 4>if you're looking for monetary success,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>

162
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:28.634
<v Speaker 4>Nobody can guess that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even when marvel releases a new </v>

163
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 4>movie and we know marvel is exceptional </v>
<v Speaker 4>at what they do,</v>

164
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 4>put them in Pixar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marvel,</v>

165
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 4>pixar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and care the best of the best.</v>

166
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.473
<v Speaker 4>Even when they release a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they clench a little bit because </v>

167
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 4>anything could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything could happen at all.</v>

168
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:45.554
<v Speaker 4>So generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a little more insulated from </v>

169
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:48.351
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>

170
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:49.184
<v Speaker 4>we lost money because actually those </v>
<v Speaker 4>marvel movies are so expensive now </v>

171
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 4>because dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

172
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.093
<v Speaker 4>same thing with the animated movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The animated movies are ungodly </v>

173
00:07:58.701 --> 00:07:59.534
<v Speaker 4>expensive to make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they print money and they print </v>

174
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just the first time they come out at</v>

175
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:05.714
<v Speaker 4>the box office.</v>

176
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 4>They print money through all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>licenses.</v>

177
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:09.434
<v Speaker 4>They print money where you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you go like they're doing a </v>

178
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:12.010
<v Speaker 4>sequel to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

179
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 4>why don't they do something new?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they've already built the world.</v>

180
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 4>It's already there in a computer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

181
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need a new script and we're good.</v>

182
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 4>We've done our infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you think about it,</v>

183
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.993
<v Speaker 4>if you building something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you built all this massive </v>

184
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:25.214
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure and spent three years </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting it together and did it once and </v>

185
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.701
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

186
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goodbye forever.</v>

187
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a waste of everything you </v>
<v Speaker 4>put together.</v>

188
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.850
<v Speaker 4>That's why they immediately go for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sequel.</v>

189
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know they're gonna make money,</v>

190
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.633
<v Speaker 4>but B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna make more money because </v>

191
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to invest as much time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and money as they did the first time.</v>

192
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 4>So that's what makes the studio go like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

193
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:44.234
<v Speaker 4>that's easier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's low hanging fruit and everyone's </v>

194
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 4>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

195
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 4>it's not like they're making art films </v>
<v Speaker 4>that only a few people,</v>

196
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:49.424
<v Speaker 4>like generally they tend to make flicks </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a bunch of people want to go see </v>

197
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.383
<v Speaker 4>and that riles up people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>see newer films or something like that </v>

198
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 4>because like why is it always the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie over and over again?</v>

199
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I submit to you,</v>

200
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to see a superhero </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

201
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.293
<v Speaker 4>expect a little fucking sameness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a story of like an exceptional </v>

202
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:07.704
<v Speaker 4>being with powers that others don't and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully that person will use it for </v>

203
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:11.930
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

204
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.773
<v Speaker 4>you can only cut that cheese so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking times where and say it's </v>

205
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:16.464
<v Speaker 4>something new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think to watch men took it to a new </v>

206
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 4>place and I love the watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the end of the day it's just like</v>

207
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.530
<v Speaker 4>people in mass doing the right thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you they fucked in space,</v>

208
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 4>but other than that there was people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>mass trying to do the right thing.</v>

209
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 4>They were murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The murdered each other.</v>

210
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 4>Does that get caught up in Batman v </v>
<v Speaker 4>Superman?</v>

211
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 4>I heard there were some murders in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

212
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:35.851
<v Speaker 4>that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

213
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 4>did they say somebody fucking died in </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison and over Batman,</v>

214
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they went in strange directions,</v>

215
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 4>but after a year of a like just taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>it over a movie that nobody saw,</v>

216
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.060
<v Speaker 4>it didn't really come out.</v>

217
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 4>Eventually restored it and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

218
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:52.990
<v Speaker 4>Yoga is just finally goes to Netflix and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to go back and like,</v>

219
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.323
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me just assure people there's </v>

220
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 4>something you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do it.</v>

221
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 4>Like as long as it doesn't hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>

222
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.743
<v Speaker 4>especially if it's something like make </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like a movie or fucking comic </v>

223
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 4>book or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

224
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.160
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a moment throughout this year,</v>

225
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.073
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

226
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 4>what was I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would I was stoned?</v>

227
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:14.390
<v Speaker 4>Why did I make that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

228
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.233
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking idiot and stuff and I </v>

229
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:18.204
<v Speaker 4>forgot somewhere along the way that like</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I made it and this isn't a cop out </v>

230
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 4>of like I didn't make it for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I did kind of targeting audience for</v>

231
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:24.714
<v Speaker 4>it and I knew going in that it was going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have this weird life to get to where </v>

232
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:28.390
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

233
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I made it for tween girls specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

234
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:33.790
<v Speaker 4>maybe other people could enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is for tween girl the way.</v>

235
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.330
<v Speaker 4>Like when I was a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was clicking on cable.</v>

236
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 4>I found strange brew starring Bob and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Doug Mackenzie and I was like,</v>

237
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've never heard of this before.</v>

238
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.490
<v Speaker 4>How come nobody ever heard of this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is mine.</v>

239
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Like you have a sense of ownership to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

240
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.293
<v Speaker 4>It changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of my favorite movies and </v>

241
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:49.524
<v Speaker 4>informed what I would become in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The conduct kind of comedy that </v>

242
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.750
<v Speaker 4>afterwards by Bob and Doug Mckenzie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about a dude I made Jay and silent</v>

243
00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:58.584
<v Speaker 4>Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to Jay and silent Bob </v>

244
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:00.494
<v Speaker 4>Without Bob and Doug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mackenzie is not a direct line from </v>

245
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.930
<v Speaker 4>cheech and Chong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jay and Bob,</v>

246
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like I want to make a movie.</v>

247
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:07.434
<v Speaker 4>I got a daughter and she's 17 now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for years I was always trying to </v>

248
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 4>take her to like flicks where it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>iron man,</v>

249
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 4>spiderman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>superman,</v>

250
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Batman.</v>

251
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:15.971
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

252
00:11:15.971 --> 00:11:16.804
<v Speaker 4>is are fucking lady up in the mix here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not just like and black widow </v>

253
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 4>somebody who's now they're making a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderful movie.</v>

254
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:24.050
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>

255
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 4>you consider I don't curse the darkness </v>
<v Speaker 4>or you can make light a candle.</v>

256
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:27.991
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

257
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:28.824
<v Speaker 4>like let's make this thing that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to take the kid to that I could </v>

258
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 4>never find and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she got an acting.</v>

259
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:36.420
<v Speaker 4>So she's in it and she's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason I did it,</v>

260
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 4>if wasn't for her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't have tried it and shit.</v>

261
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 4>But she had a small role in Tusk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought she did good.</v>

262
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.124
<v Speaker 4>So I spun off her character and her </v>
<v Speaker 4>friendly rose's character into this </v>

263
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:44.424
<v Speaker 4>whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I was making it as being good </v>

264
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.351
<v Speaker 4>for like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

265
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 4>you want to talk about playing a game of</v>
<v Speaker 4>darts,</v>

266
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:51.150
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're not going after anybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>between girls.</v>

267
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.013
<v Speaker 4>And I knew in that moment I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going be a long time before they </v>

268
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:55.624
<v Speaker 4>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to find it in </v>

269
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 4>theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fucking weird hybrid.</v>

270
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 4>Midnight moved to stone or flick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The villains are one foot tall.</v>

271
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:03.200
<v Speaker 4>Canadian Nazis made a bratwurst called </v>
<v Speaker 4>razzies,</v>

272
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.113
<v Speaker 4>like a fucked up weird ass movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they'll find it like the way I found </v>

273
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:09.184
<v Speaker 4>strange brew on cable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this dream like too simple dreams </v>

274
00:12:11.911 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 4>in regard to this poster I want in </v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to this movie.</v>

275
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.673
<v Speaker 4>I want to post or two girls just </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing next to each other and they're </v>

276
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 4>not like fighting over a fucking boy or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

277
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:19.933
<v Speaker 4>But just hanging out the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Dante and Randall hung out on my </v>

278
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:26.280
<v Speaker 4>clerks poser and then like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it eventually wind up on Netflix or some</v>

279
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 4>streaming service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a midst hundreds,</v>

280
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 4>thousands of other movies and some tween</v>
<v Speaker 4>girls clicking through one day,</v>

281
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:34.054
<v Speaker 4>bored as shit and watched everything and</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly sees the picture of like two </v>

282
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:37.790
<v Speaker 4>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 next to each other,</v>

283
00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:40.540
<v Speaker 4>the hockey stick and little sausage men </v>
<v Speaker 4>and going like,</v>

284
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>

285
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 4>And it becomes their religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their strange brew or something.</v>

286
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't always go for the world.</v>

287
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:47.563
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be nice if you can satisfy </v>

288
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're trying to satisfy yourself.</v>

289
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 4>It sounds very massive betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the same time it's like,</v>

290
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.400
<v Speaker 4>I hope people go on the journey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

291
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 4>but I understand if they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sometimes we go in directions where</v>

292
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 4>the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire audience can follow us.</v>

293
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you got some people who love </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are like,</v>

294
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't dig on mma,</v>

295
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 4>but I love everything else you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they could go partially.</v>

296
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 4>They can't go all the way with you </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>

297
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:13.144
<v Speaker 4>And I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially lately I've been making </v>

298
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 4>movies that are real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fucking dare,</v>

299
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.363
<v Speaker 4>like not daring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I dare you to fucking get </v>

300
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:21.011
<v Speaker 4>through this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

301
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:21.844
<v Speaker 4>it's a real like clearly he's given,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't give a shit about the audience </v>

302
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

303
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 4>He's just making shit to watch their </v>
<v Speaker 4>reaction change and it's not true.</v>

304
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:28.414
<v Speaker 4>There's something there and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know that it's a used to be a </v>

305
00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:31.444
<v Speaker 4>wider bridge people could cross to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me and now the bridge is getting </v>

306
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.580
<v Speaker 4>smaller and smaller because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta like this,</v>

307
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 4>you got to be interested in this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Tusk,</v>

308
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:42.370
<v Speaker 4>the movie I made after redstate is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie about a guy tried to tries to turn</v>

309
00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:43.204
<v Speaker 4>another guy into a walrus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really got to be in the mood to see </v>

310
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:45.694
<v Speaker 4>a fucking weird batshit stupid movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's intentionally like was this </v>

311
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 4>fucking dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's serious and like it plays.</v>

312
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 4>It's so straight and shit like we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>argo.</v>

313
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.740
<v Speaker 4>So clearly I'm in a very experimental,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

314
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 4>let me fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done enough.</v>

315
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 4>I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me fuck around.</v>

316
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:01.360
<v Speaker 4>And it finally paid off as the point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole story.</v>

317
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.590
<v Speaker 4>Like after a year get mass kicked online</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people being like,</v>

318
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.433
<v Speaker 4>he fucking lost it and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that audience is starting to find </v>

319
00:14:09.071 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that it's on Netflix,</v>

320
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:11.194
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden I'm hearing from fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>tween girls that like the movie and </v>

321
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 4>parents have twin girls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

322
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:16.804
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of them are like 40 year old </v>

323
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:20.080
<v Speaker 4>dudes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretend I hope it is.</v>

324
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:22.070
<v Speaker 4>I hope it's all of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit.</v>

325
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.333
<v Speaker 4>It's I'll take them all if they were all</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 year old dudes that said Nice things </v>

326
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After a year of people being like,</v>

327
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 4>it blows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nice to have people being like,</v>

328
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it blows on purpose or oh,</v>

329
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:33.670
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or blah blah blah.</v>

330
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 4>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta ask you this.</v>

331
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.840
<v Speaker 4>How much of your thought process when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you make something is worrying about how</v>

332
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be received or or dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the people that don't like it?</v>

333
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.080
<v Speaker 4>Lately?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Anymore.</v>

334
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.923
<v Speaker 4>About about either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sooner or later there's a factor of </v>

335
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 4>wanting to see because that has to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with whether the thing makes money or it</v>

336
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:56.114
<v Speaker 4>goes at the box office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How something makes money is completely </v>

337
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 4>different now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never counting on like,</v>

338
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.083
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will come out and see it in a </v>

339
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 4>theater and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

340
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:05.384
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of different revenue </v>

341
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 4>streams at this point and stuff thanks </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the digital age,</v>

342
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.120
<v Speaker 4>but at that point when I'm making it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

343
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.271
<v Speaker 4>of course you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

344
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:16.420
<v Speaker 4>somebody going to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you're doing it in a,</v>

345
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

346
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 4>kind of like an abyss and nobody's there</v>
<v Speaker 4>for you or something like that.</v>

347
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

348
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

349
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 4>just stupid questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like?</v>

352
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.040

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

353
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:34.874
<v Speaker 4>I can't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never think about that shit because </v>

354
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 4>sooner or later somebody is going to ask</v>
<v Speaker 4>me a question that I have to,</v>

355
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

357
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 4>You may get it for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you did take a few million bucks.</v>

358
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:47.480
<v Speaker 4>Like how do we sell this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get our money back.</v>

359
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

360
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 4>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you start going,</v>

361
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:53.960
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we get it to the right audience,</v>

362
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:54.794
<v Speaker 4>know more like how do we tailor it or </v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we fucking trick him into seeing </v>

363
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

364
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:01.790
<v Speaker 4>Like put it on front street and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with the fallout.</v>

365
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to have to deal with a lot more.</v>

366
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 4>I used to choose to deal with it a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>more and now it's just like I'm 46.</v>

367
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.203
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was a person who came to one </v>

368
00:16:11.481 --> 00:16:15.050
<v Speaker 4>of the screenings on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had the screening at fuck,</v>

369
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:15.884
<v Speaker 4>I forget where we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say New Orleans and of Yoga </v>

370
00:16:18.351 --> 00:16:20.790
<v Speaker 4>hosers I was doing q and a afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

371
00:16:20.791 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 4>everyone's getting up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

372
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:22.970
<v Speaker 4>it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking stupid.</v>

373
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 4>And asking questions and then one guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets up and he is like tight dude.</v>

374
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:30.220
<v Speaker 4>He's very serious and he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

375
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.123
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You told the big long story before that </v>

376
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:35.290
<v Speaker 4>movie began.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a big intro for the movement,</v>

377
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.880
<v Speaker 4>began to like an hour long story of how </v>
<v Speaker 4>we got there.</v>

378
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.133
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that story did not match the movie I </v>

379
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 4>just watched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

380
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

381
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:45.380
<v Speaker 4>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

382
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:48.080
<v Speaker 4>why did you make that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gone.</v>

383
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.320
<v Speaker 4>I found that unwatchable and everyone in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the audience has gone.</v>

384
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

385
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:53.084
<v Speaker 4>no many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he paid like he overpaid to see this </v>

386
00:16:55.491 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 4>movie if I'm sitting here talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

387
00:16:58.011 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 4>let him say what he wants and I'm a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>boy and fine.</v>

388
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.543
<v Speaker 4>And so he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think you ever should have </v>

389
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:03.680
<v Speaker 4>made it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible.</v>

390
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.581
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

391
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:06.110
<v Speaker 4>you understand that subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

392
00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:09.680
<v Speaker 4>Like you're surrounded by a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that feel like the opposite way.</v>

393
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people were applauding and shit.</v>

394
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 4>And then some guy behind him in line </v>
<v Speaker 4>jumps in front of the mic and goes,</v>

395
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 4>you want me to kick his ass?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

396
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

397
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.843
<v Speaker 4>everyone's entitled to their opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but his opinion is I never should have </v>

398
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:24.510
<v Speaker 4>done this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

399
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.360
<v Speaker 4>my answer to that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's ridiculous.</v>

400
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Like if I wanted to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's the only reason we're here,</v>

401
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:33.950
<v Speaker 4>I just want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can choose not to see it.</v>

402
00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 4>And in this instance I'm really sorry </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you didn't,</v>

403
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:37.274
<v Speaker 4>our tastes didn't coincide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but every time I go to do one of these </v>

404
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:40.550
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it the same way,</v>

405
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 4>whether it was clerks have to the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>recent one,</v>

406
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.813
<v Speaker 4>I just make the movie I want to see and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully others like it and sometimes </v>

407
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's amazing.</v>

408
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:49.350
<v Speaker 4>It feels great and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

409
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:50.184
<v Speaker 4>my fingers on the pulse</v>

410
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes you're fucking alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least you're like,</v>

411
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy with the thing that I made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

412
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 2>but I feel heartbroken that you came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>here looking for something I didn't give</v>

413
00:17:58.171 --> 00:17:59.004
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said I'm going to give you your </v>

414
00:17:59.721 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 2>money back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I gave him 40 bucks and I was like,</v>

415
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>put it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a riser speaker.</v>

416
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>

417
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:07.561
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no man.</v>

418
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:08.181
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it take,</v>

419
00:18:08.181 --> 00:18:09.014
<v Speaker 2>it's not a trick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like Jason Who's going to come </v>

420
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:11.850
<v Speaker 2>out and hit you with a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take it like I feel bad.</v>

421
00:18:11.851 --> 00:18:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I want you to have a good time and shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

422
00:18:14.081 --> 00:18:14.491
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

423
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

424
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes for an excellent story.</v>

425
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I told him his movie fucking blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>to his face and I fucking took his money</v>

426
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 2>and walked out and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

427
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.400
<v Speaker 2>And he went and sat down and crossed his</v>
<v Speaker 2>arms and just stayed there for another,</v>

428
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:27.234
<v Speaker 2>like half hour during the q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for him it was worth the 40 bucks </v>

429
00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:30.744
<v Speaker 2>just like I'm going to visual verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sit here and fucking hate on this </v>

430
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.210
<v Speaker 2>and let you know and then sit down </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

431
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deal with that.</v>

432
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:40.740
<v Speaker 2>But that's the memorable one because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that never happens.</v>

433
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when we toured the movie,</v>

434
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.170
<v Speaker 2>you're touring and you're in a safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>zone.</v>

435
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like going out and doing a club </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

436
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:52.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like people there are there because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love you.</v>

437
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:56.820
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to wonder if this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking tween sausage movie is for me,</v>

438
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 2>like they're already dialed in on some </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the journey,</v>

439
00:18:59.881 --> 00:19:00.241
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

440
00:19:00.241 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I've loved task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or have been with him since clerks or so</v>

441
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:05.190
<v Speaker 2>forth and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm rambling.</v>

442
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

443
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not rambling at all.</v>

444
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship that you have to the people</v>

445
00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 2>that buy your stuff is very direct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

446
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have a podcast,</v>

447
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:17.364
<v Speaker 2>so you talk about things in a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>open and honest way like this and you </v>

448
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expressed vulnerability,</v>

449
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.653
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

450
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.260
<v Speaker 2>makes people super uncomfortable that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your experience,</v>

451
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.000
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

452
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.833
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make me uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the world and just tell people </v>

453
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:34.051
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

454
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up and I'm stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or fat or my small.</v>

455
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:37.411
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

456
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too much.</v>

457
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.550
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two factions.</v>

458
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 2>There's one faction that that enjoys it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>

459
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Smith is just like me.</v>

460
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of fucked up just like I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever gets it together.</v>

461
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.950
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the facts.</v>

462
00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:54.530
<v Speaker 2>And like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish she was like,</v>

463
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 2>will Smith Will Smith just seems to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>his shit together.</v>

464
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:58.883
<v Speaker 2>Always like will smith just keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocking it out of the only reasons </v>

465
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.843
<v Speaker 2>because we share that last name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's an expectation </v>

466
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.720
<v Speaker 2>connecting with a guy who never failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone I've talked to says you should be</v>

467
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:15.430
<v Speaker 2>more like will smith had never failed </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like name and time.</v>

468
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Wilson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

469
00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:18.091
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

470
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always gets jiggy with it,</v>

471
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.960
<v Speaker 2>but there have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been moments where he too,</v>

472
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw him be mortal.</v>

473
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.923
<v Speaker 2>Wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wild West was one of the first ones to </v>

474
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.030
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they still got to a point,</v>

475
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.760
<v Speaker 2>but there've been a couple of flicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

476
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:36.594
<v Speaker 2>including the one he did with his kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got punished for making a movie with </v>

477
00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:43.500
<v Speaker 2>this kid as well and he's raising those </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids in a real interesting way.</v>

478
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:46.960
<v Speaker 2>That's where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where he gets most of his flag.</v>

479
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>His son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his</v>

480
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 4>son's all about star dust and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His daughters not that far off.</v>

481
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.181
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

482
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 4>They're both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're both really creative kids,</v>

483
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:59.401
<v Speaker 4>but they have been raised in a world </v>
<v Speaker 4>level much different than the world that</v>

484
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 4>most people are raised and nothing wrong</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that,</v>

485
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 4>but it's produced very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>results.</v>

486
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's when you're.</v>

487
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess if you had that sheltered,</v>

488
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 4>like your data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some super movie star type character,</v>

489
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:11.224
<v Speaker 4>your transition to regular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinary adulthood has probably like </v>

490
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:16.780
<v Speaker 4>super confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

491
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 4>I got one kid and I'm not fucking will </v>
<v Speaker 4>smith by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

492
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:22.714
<v Speaker 4>I ain't even fucking Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not saying you ain't will </v>

493
00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 4>smith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a kind of.</v>

494
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I got,</v>

495
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:29.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

496
00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:30.434
<v Speaker 4>I've done some shifts and some people </v>
<v Speaker 4>know me and stuff and I got a kid and I </v>

497
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:39.340
<v Speaker 4>was talking to her recently and it came </v>
<v Speaker 4>out that she was like,</v>

498
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.650
<v Speaker 4>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

499
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 4>it can be hard to be your daughter.</v>

500
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

501
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.780
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put you in things.</v>

502
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm Megan and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

503
00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:48.911
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the.</v>

504
00:21:48.911 --> 00:21:49.744
<v Speaker 4>You make it hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that there's this expectation like </v>

505
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 4>you did something and now if I don't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

506
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.370
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

507
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry about that.</v>

508
00:21:58.571 --> 00:21:59.404
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

509
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.280
<v Speaker 4>I did one thing like 22 fucking years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago and,</v>

510
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

511
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.233
<v Speaker 4>Like all you have to do is find one </v>
<v Speaker 4>tricky can take your whole life if you </v>

512
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:06.844
<v Speaker 4>need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I said nobody expects you to be me </v>

513
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:09.004
<v Speaker 4>and this is a common theme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I've had a moment like this </v>

514
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:15.244
<v Speaker 4>before once with like Scott Mosier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy that I do smart cast with and I </v>

515
00:22:18.551 --> 00:22:21.040
<v Speaker 4>made like all the early flicks with </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

516
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:23.020
<v Speaker 4>he would always say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's tough to live in your shadow.</v>

517
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.501
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

518
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 4>Shadow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We make everything together.</v>

519
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we make your stuff.</v>

520
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 4>And every time I think about going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make something,</v>

521
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.200
<v Speaker 4>I got to compare it to the shit that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>made together.</v>

522
00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:34.360
<v Speaker 4>And it makes me go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe I'm not ready to try it.</v>

523
00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:34.961
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I'm,</v>

524
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:35.890
<v Speaker 4>that's not my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

525
00:22:35.891 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it's your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just tough to,</v>

526
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.590
<v Speaker 4>to live in your shadow and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought maybe that was his thing years</v>

527
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.870
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same shit from my wife.</v>

528
00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:45.570
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just tough to live in your shadow.</v>

529
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

530
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:48.340
<v Speaker 4>We don't even do the same things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

531
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 4>but I can't even think about doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things now without thinking,</v>

532
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.733
<v Speaker 4>well he's kind of done something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that or is it going to be compared to </v>

533
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 4>something he does and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're already your mind.</v>

534
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Everything I do fails and nobody ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>holds it as a high watermark.</v>

535
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:03.604
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like they would hold you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some same high standard that they don't </v>

536
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:07.654
<v Speaker 4>even hold me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a bit of that man now my kid </v>

537
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 4>is echoing in a little bit where through</v>
<v Speaker 4>no fault of my own,</v>

538
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:16.360
<v Speaker 4>not like I've created this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

539
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:18.610
<v Speaker 4>like live up to my standard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

540
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:19.930
<v Speaker 4>everyone do what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

541
00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Even with the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never talked to her like a kid.</v>

542
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:25.000
<v Speaker 4>I've always talked to her like an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now even my kid is just like,</v>

543
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.133
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes it tough to go do something </v>

544
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:32.370
<v Speaker 4>because of you and it's not like you did</v>
<v Speaker 4>it but you do a lot and,</v>

545
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.760
<v Speaker 4>and there's a high bar and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ain't got you.</v>

546
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.030
<v Speaker 4>It makes me feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes me go like,</v>

547
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:37.630
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do less.</v>

548
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.970
<v Speaker 4>But then like I got one life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

549
00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 4>Like I got to accomplish a lot before my</v>
<v Speaker 4>man died.</v>

550
00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:43.354
<v Speaker 4>60 seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know how long I'm going to </v>

551
00:23:45.141 --> 00:23:45.974
<v Speaker 4>live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I want to accomplish as much as I </v>

552
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:47.594
<v Speaker 4>can and create and do shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience things and enjoy your time </v>

553
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:51.660
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

554
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 4>and I don't want to take away from all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these other people's time.</v>

555
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want her to enjoy her time and my wife</v>

556
00:23:57.231 --> 00:23:59.840
<v Speaker 4>to enjoy her time and Scott to enjoy his</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

557
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 4>But the sad fact of the matter is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order for you to rise,</v>

558
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 4>usually someone in your life falls and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a precipitous like,</v>

559
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've fucking broken.</v>

560
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:12.290
<v Speaker 4>But they can't be rising like you when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're helping you build your shit.</v>

561
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:15.530
<v Speaker 4>That's something I had to learn to deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>with way early on in my career.</v>

562
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.480
<v Speaker 4>I used to take advantage of people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not in the way of like,</v>

563
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 4>well I'm trying to take advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

564
00:24:19.851 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

565
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 4>we're just working on my thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>what else would we be working on?</v>

566
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:24.404
<v Speaker 4>And Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't this all great that we're working </v>

567
00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:26.054
<v Speaker 4>period and stuff and you forget that not</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody started wanting to do your </v>

568
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Scott's whole thing was,</v>

569
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.443
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't go to film school to become a </v>

570
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:34.094
<v Speaker 4>producer of your movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to film school to write and </v>

571
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 4>direct and I've been having a great time</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing your stuff,</v>

572
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:39.314
<v Speaker 4>but that meant 10 years of me not even </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to do the thing that I went to </v>

573
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.150
<v Speaker 4>keystone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a weird feeling.</v>

574
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.600
<v Speaker 4>Men especially because I never really </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel successful.</v>

575
00:24:47.601 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 4>I've never like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

576
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 4>I understand what I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cast a wide shadow,</v>

577
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it's a very long </v>
<v Speaker 4>shadow because I'm like,</v>

578
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 4>there is no high bar here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids,</v>

579
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:57.810
<v Speaker 4>there's a high bar and as much as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

580
00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 4>a smuggler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no like,</v>

581
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:00.523
<v Speaker 4>well he made the Matrix motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>like how you're going to be the kid or </v>

582
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:03.944
<v Speaker 4>the guy who made the matrix or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the ladies that made the matrix now </v>

583
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be tough.</v>

584
00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:12.140
<v Speaker 4>I imagined growing up their kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amen your,</v>

585
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.040
<v Speaker 4>your parents made the matrix like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

586
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you this because you probably</v>

587
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:16.514
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't know the answer to this before </v>
<v Speaker 3>we get back to the subject because the </v>

588
00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:20.110
<v Speaker 3>subject is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm using you like a therapist</v>

589
00:25:20.111 --> 00:25:22.420
<v Speaker 3>and whatever the fucking happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that lawsuit.</v>

590
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Remember there was a lady who wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 3>book and she said that she had submitted</v>

591
00:25:26.681 --> 00:25:27.514
<v Speaker 3>that book to those brothers that made </v>
<v Speaker 3>the matrix and that is the exact same </v>

592
00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:31.890
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it,</v>

593
00:25:31.891 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it went to court.</v>

594
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.510
<v Speaker 3>It did go to court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

595
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.290
<v Speaker 3>it did go to court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting how similarities</v>

596
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.390
<v Speaker 3>between remember road in the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

597
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember because it was quite a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few years ago,</v>

598
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 3>but I thought maybe you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would know about this.</v>

599
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Snopes says it's false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snopes is a Hillary Clinton.</v>

600
00:25:46.901 --> 00:25:50.630
<v Speaker 3>She'll organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call the white man town.</v>

601
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 3>I'll get political man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the one place people should run.</v>

602
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.000
<v Speaker 3>It's not even real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not real.</v>

603
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.200
<v Speaker 3>It's saw your instagram posts on </v>
<v Speaker 3>election day.</v>

604
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.000
<v Speaker 3>Were you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

605
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.460
<v Speaker 3>It was a picture of the results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

606
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:04.623
<v Speaker 3>I think that might've been the place </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I actually learned about the </v>

607
00:26:06.521 --> 00:26:09.700
<v Speaker 3>results because I enjoy chaos to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain extent.</v>

608
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.250
<v Speaker 3>So I'm looking forward to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really am.</v>

609
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.143
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be living at times is that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would not have been interested in </v>

610
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton doing the same goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that she's been doing.</v>

611
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

612
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big fan of how he behaves as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

613
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 5>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not false that uh,</v>

614
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.940
<v Speaker 5>it's false.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's false that she won the,</v>

615
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.230
<v Speaker 5>the large judgement in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a case,</v>

616
00:26:34.231 --> 00:26:37.470
<v Speaker 5>there was a court case and she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess she never showed up to court for</v>

617
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:38.790
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were a illuminary hearing.</v>

618
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe because she was in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they paid her,</v>

619
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 3>disconnected her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was fucking trapped and shit.</v>

620
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 4>She saw cat on the way there twice and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was like,</v>

621
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's entirely possible that she just got</v>

622
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 4>paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other option.</v>

623
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.580
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

624
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.683
<v Speaker 4>what was she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much was she necessarily what she </v>

625
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want half or she'll give me 50 grand.</v>

626
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:03.020
<v Speaker 4>I'll go away and make a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the Matrix obviously is a pretty God</v>

627
00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:03.854
<v Speaker 4>damn big movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently her story was remarkably </v>

628
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:06.864
<v Speaker 4>close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I look and I'm not taking </v>

629
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:09.474
<v Speaker 4>anything away from them or her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know like they're archetypal </v>

630
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 4>story and that movie is brilliant of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course,</v>

631
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:20.210
<v Speaker 4>but it's like nobody can really go like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

632
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

633
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is Kinda like go to the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a Jesus story on some level,</v>

634
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

635
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.960
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>messianic in nature,</v>

636
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 4>but if you're talking about boogers or </v>
<v Speaker 4>in big batteries,</v>

637
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:34.410
<v Speaker 4>that power of fucking machine that we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>all in and plugs in our head,</v>

638
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.840
<v Speaker 4>then it gets very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very close and that even.</v>

639
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.673
<v Speaker 4>But even that concept,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that of of one day we're going to live </v>

640
00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:44.070
<v Speaker 4>in some sort of a virtual reality that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not new concepts.</v>

641
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.600
<v Speaker 4>Concepts and explored like you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you watched?</v>

642
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Are you watching westworld?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

643
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:51.783
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is discussing that very subject </v>

644
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 4>while being vastly entertaining and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

645
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.740
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a great idea.</v>

646
00:27:58.741 --> 00:27:59.574
<v Speaker 4>But also they are going into the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and there are a few times </v>

647
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 4>as you watched that show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not where you're like,</v>

648
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 4>are we in someone's fucking game?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you start sitting there,</v>

649
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:10.014
<v Speaker 4>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything we know about what we </v>

650
00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:12.594
<v Speaker 4>understand to be reality except to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality is a social contract in many </v>

651
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:21.660
<v Speaker 4>ways like ideas and thoughts that we all</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree on and stuff about what is real,</v>

652
00:28:21.661 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 4>what is important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's why when you meet people who</v>

653
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:27.620
<v Speaker 4>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to have kids,</v>

654
00:28:27.621 --> 00:28:29.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people like that's fucking weird.</v>

655
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.383
<v Speaker 4>It's like no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their reality is kids are not a part of </v>

656
00:28:31.771 --> 00:28:33.360
<v Speaker 4>the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never were like,</v>

657
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.670
<v Speaker 4>it's just not in them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And stuff like that.</v>

658
00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

659
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

660
00:28:38.911 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 4>this year with the election we've seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally,</v>

661
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:42.054
<v Speaker 4>we've seen reality challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that we all understood to be </v>

662
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.390
<v Speaker 4>apparently was not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now,</v>

663
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are vastly different.</v>

664
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where I'm going with that.</v>

665
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Saved me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

666
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.003
<v Speaker 4>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unique thing about it is that we </v>

667
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.353
<v Speaker 4>have been living under this illusion </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it either had to be one of these </v>

668
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:05.364
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Democrat or one of these people </v>

669
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.273
<v Speaker 4>are Republican and that these people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians and these are the people </v>

670
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:13.650
<v Speaker 4>that one presidencies I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

671
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:14.963
<v Speaker 4>I don't want us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a faction out there and I don't </v>

672
00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:17.334
<v Speaker 4>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should really just stay away from </v>

673
00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:20.400
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I will look,</v>

674
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm a guy always tries to find the </v>
<v Speaker 4>silver lining to a situation.</v>

675
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:24.743
<v Speaker 4>So I did not vote for this president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I did not campaign against this </v>

676
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:28.840
<v Speaker 4>president and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

677
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.253
<v Speaker 4>one another way didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So not the first election where I voted </v>

678
00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:37.320
<v Speaker 4>for somebody that did not win that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Being the person I'm out,</v>

679
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:38.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna sit there and be like,</v>

680
00:29:38.701 --> 00:29:40.330
<v Speaker 4>fuck the next four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

681
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.140
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

682
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've lived</v>

683
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 2>through presidencies that I didn't agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with and things work out.</v>

684
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I hope that it's going to work out this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

685
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:51.541
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's new.</v>

686
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.283
<v Speaker 2>We might see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying burn it all down and </v>

687
00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:56.554
<v Speaker 2>see what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've had how many years of of two </v>

688
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 2>party system essentially where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

689
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lip service to a Green Party and</v>

690
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 2>lip service to another party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we for all intensive purposes,</v>

691
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know it was claimed by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party,</v>

692
00:30:08.741 --> 00:30:09.574
<v Speaker 2>but we saw a huge upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a third party candidate could </v>

693
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Speaker 2>happens once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want him in.</v>

694
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.400
<v Speaker 2>If it happens once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means it could happen again.</v>

695
00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.260
<v Speaker 2>There's not a new model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a new path.</v>

696
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.960
<v Speaker 2>He was always a Democrat his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought.</v>

697
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was fine because I grew up in jersey,</v>

698
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:29.950
<v Speaker 2>so I was very familiar with the man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his work throughout my life and stuff.</v>

699
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 2>He was a prominent figure in the press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

700
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:32.854
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always seemed very liberal leaning </v>

701
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 2>and democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

702
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:37.264
<v Speaker 2>what he did is essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he played a certain group of people </v>

703
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:42.904
<v Speaker 2>in this country and he got to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate position and power and we're </v>

704
00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:49.000
<v Speaker 2>not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at 70 years old,</v>

705
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:49.983
<v Speaker 2>you don't think he's a crafty guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's probably pretty good at </v>

706
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.890
<v Speaker 2>getting people to like him as a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who he really is like,</v>

707
00:30:58.891 --> 00:30:59.724
<v Speaker 2>I think you probably got to get to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>him to find out who the fuck he really </v>

708
00:31:01.361 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also feel like to some degree it's.</v>

709
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:05.590
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not taking anything away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

710
00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 2>but anybody could have just popped up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and been like,</v>

711
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not her,</v>

712
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.133
<v Speaker 2>not him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She carries so much baggage and that's </v>

713
00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:17.674
<v Speaker 2>the thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were asking and essentially </v>

714
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on America,</v>

715
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 2>let's vote a woman in.</v>

716
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Come on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just had the black president.</v>

717
00:31:25.761 --> 00:31:27.220
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a woman president.</v>

718
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:28.054
<v Speaker 2>And I think if they'd gone with almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other candidate that didn't have as </v>

719
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 2>much baggage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a different story.</v>

720
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:34.144
<v Speaker 2>But they were asking you to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who I didn't have an issue </v>

721
00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people got a big issue.</v>

722
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 2>If she was a man that it would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant problem,</v>

723
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 2>but we gave her or what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

724
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.300
<v Speaker 2>if she had all those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she,</v>

725
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the shit.</v>

726
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean we saw a guy with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

727
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.693
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying if he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a man and she was up against </v>

728
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:59.080
<v Speaker 2>trump and she had all those problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>just crushed.</v>

729
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:01.540
<v Speaker 2>You have no chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because she was a woman,</v>

730
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.730
<v Speaker 2>oh you think she got further because Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

731
00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.490
<v Speaker 2>And it was a lot of people that will see</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

732
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.353
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to make history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to make history because </v>

733
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.820
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a social standpoint,</v>

734
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:10.893
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama was very important because </v>
<v Speaker 2>here was a super articulate guy who's </v>

735
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:17.890
<v Speaker 2>really calm and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a very,</v>

736
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.420
<v Speaker 2>even a presence about him always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never seen riled up.</v>

737
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 2>You never see him crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even like he gets heckled.</v>

738
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 2>You can just see that thing with a trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporter was heckling him.</v>

739
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 2>And he handled it with Grace Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said graceful God.</v>

740
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like probably the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe them,</v>

741
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that was important for the country </v>

742
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:39.560
<v Speaker 2>because that represented like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

743
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

744
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 6>here's this black guy who's super </v>
<v Speaker 6>articulate and so calm.</v>

745
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:49.850
<v Speaker 6>And so like the way he expresses himself</v>
<v Speaker 6>is so perfect for a president.</v>

746
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.713
<v Speaker 6>So presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a what a what a perfect </v>

747
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.830
<v Speaker 6>example for our country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is us.</v>

748
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.173
<v Speaker 6>And then I think a lot of people felt </v>
<v Speaker 6>like Hillary Clinton would be another </v>

749
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 6>one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

750
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we can have a woman running.</v>

751
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 6>Things were not sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

752
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 6>look we look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we are a really articulate,</v>

753
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:10.423
<v Speaker 6>incredibly well experienced woman who's </v>
<v Speaker 6>been in business for a long time with </v>

754
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Speaker 6>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's deep inside the public service and</v>

755
00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 6>she was a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

756
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 6>but it was just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just too much shit for people.</v>

757
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:29.210
<v Speaker 6>But I think if that was a man and she </v>
<v Speaker 6>had all those same problems,</v>

758
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:30.044
<v Speaker 6>it was a man and tied to some foundation</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was getting all these people that </v>

759
00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:38.510
<v Speaker 6>eventually got arms deals and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>donated and the.</v>

760
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 6>They're all part of this weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>incestuous political world.</v>

761
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:43.363
<v Speaker 6>A man would be skewered with that same </v>
<v Speaker 6>record because trump was running as an </v>

762
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.860
<v Speaker 6>outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

763
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:49.694
<v Speaker 6>what he had going against him as he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>borish and he says ridiculous shit and </v>

764
00:33:53.691 --> 00:33:54.524
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they could,</v>

765
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.393
<v Speaker 6>they could point to that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that recording of him talking about </v>

766
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:00.300
<v Speaker 6>grabbing pussies and they'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

767
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.200
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look who we have here like that.</v>

768
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.333
<v Speaker 6>That was the big thing against him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at least to these people that hate </v>

769
00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:08.990
<v Speaker 6>the system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was an outsider.</v>

770
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.290
<v Speaker 6>If she was a man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she would've represented even more of an</v>

771
00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:13.440
<v Speaker 6>insider,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

772
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 6>I think to a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think her,</v>

773
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.560
<v Speaker 6>her actions and what she's done in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>past versus her as a woman.</v>

774
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.883
<v Speaker 6>That was like sort of a situation there </v>
<v Speaker 6>because like you ever seen the video </v>

775
00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:26.840
<v Speaker 6>where she was talking about a Kadafi </v>
<v Speaker 6>being killed.</v>

776
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 6>No crazy video man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because she's joking around.</v>

777
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:33.620
<v Speaker 6>It's before they interview her and she </v>
<v Speaker 6>goes,</v>

778
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 6>was like before the official interview </v>
<v Speaker 6>starts.</v>

779
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:36.674
<v Speaker 6>Like she.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

780
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.383
<v Speaker 6>she had just found out that Kadafi had </v>
<v Speaker 6>been killed and she was like laughing </v>

781
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:42.110
<v Speaker 6>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She goes,</v>

782
00:34:42.111 --> 00:34:42.944
<v Speaker 6>we came,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we saw he died and she throws her head </v>

783
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 6>back and she's laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was kind of hawkish.</v>

784
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:54.110
<v Speaker 6>She was hawkish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If that was a guy,</v>

785
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.063
<v Speaker 6>if a guy did that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he would have been thought to be a </v>

786
00:34:56.961 --> 00:35:00.200
<v Speaker 6>fucking serial killer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A sociopath.</v>

787
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.030
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If a guy did that,</v>

788
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.580
<v Speaker 6>like say if Joe Biden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we came,</v>

789
00:35:04.581 --> 00:35:08.600
<v Speaker 6>we saw he died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People would be like,</v>

790
00:35:08.601 --> 00:35:10.930
<v Speaker 6>do you want that guy in charge of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking news?</v>

791
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 6>But we let her go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll give her a pass.</v>

792
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.210
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of stuff that she's done </v>
<v Speaker 6>where people give her a pass.</v>

793
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:19.590
<v Speaker 6>They put a more interesting cat and </v>
<v Speaker 6>charge of the duke's.</v>

794
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.850
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there should be no president.</v>

795
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.620
<v Speaker 6>This is what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's like,</v>

796
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:25.454
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who would you think should be the </v>

797
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:28.780
<v Speaker 6>president if you have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 6>trump or if your problem,</v>

798
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.040
<v Speaker 6>no human being should be in control of </v>
<v Speaker 6>$350,</v>

799
00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:36.380
<v Speaker 6>million human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a postural job.</v>

800
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 6>Explain this this way.</v>

801
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the hospital.</v>

802
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Would it be done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we don't have to do it this way?</v>

803
00:35:42.031 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 3>The world is the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have one,</v>

804
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.540
<v Speaker 3>but we can't have an Alpha channel </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out right here were smart.</v>

805
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 3>The Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>

806
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 3>what about education?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Internet mind reading.</v>

807
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially it as it come down to a.</v>

808
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 3>What was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that movie with the girl?</v>

809
00:35:57.721 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Shoots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bows and arrows and shit.</v>

810
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hunger games or games.</v>

811
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Can we district the country and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are heads of district or.</v>

812
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll go to war with each other.</v>

813
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Your App can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

814
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:08.964
<v Speaker 3>so that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the think tech is eating every </v>

815
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:13.340
<v Speaker 3>idea to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one.</v>

816
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.470
<v Speaker 3>States are problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then once people like,</v>

817
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is Texas Sun.</v>

818
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.710
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

819
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.603
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in New Jersey and New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>hated us and fucking everybody hates </v>

820
00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:23.400
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

821
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Hated bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Banya Oh yeah,</v>

822
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:27.000
<v Speaker 3>you hated Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York hated Boston.</v>

823
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut got a pass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

824
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.660
<v Speaker 3>So it was like some little kid with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>limp,</v>

825
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.640
<v Speaker 3>like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't pick on.</v>

826
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Say Connecticut doesn't get mentioned in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tri state area.</v>

827
00:36:34.831 --> 00:36:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Whenever the graph shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be like New York,</v>

828
00:36:36.901 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania.</v>

829
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.880
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

830
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:39.803
<v Speaker 3>I thought Connecticut was New Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ohio and years and years like </v>

831
00:36:42.441 --> 00:36:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut is a highway to highway </v>
<v Speaker 3>between Boston and New York,</v>

832
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.060
<v Speaker 3>but we can like a poet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut's I will everyone connect.</v>

833
00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:49.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

834
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.280
<v Speaker 3>They are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

835
00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:52.310
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I'm talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

836
00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 3>You know I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

837
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Wait no states because we war with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

838
00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you something?</v>

839
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:00.680
<v Speaker 3>Somebody has to govern?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

840
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.670
<v Speaker 3>They have to be policed and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

841
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:03.623
<v Speaker 3>I think the best way to probably handle </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is let every human being have a say </v>

842
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.253
<v Speaker 3>every human being that's of adult age </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think registering to vote should </v>

843
00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 3>be just as fucking easy as getting an </v>
<v Speaker 3>email.</v>

844
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:20.400
<v Speaker 3>It should be just as easy as doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else that you do online.</v>

845
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.590
<v Speaker 3>You had a twitter handle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to vote.</v>

846
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.920
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to use your id,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whatever,</v>

847
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:28.500
<v Speaker 3>whoever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever your name is,</v>

848
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call yourself.</v>

849
00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Who are the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one individual vote.</v>

850
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:34.163
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think and I think as long </v>
<v Speaker 3>as we could figure out how to make that </v>

851
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:38.820
<v Speaker 3>system pure or people can't hack it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

852
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.830
<v Speaker 3>He can't log in from 15 different </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers.</v>

853
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:41.664
<v Speaker 3>If you have a fucking birth certificate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your birth certificate aligns with </v>

854
00:37:45.271 --> 00:37:47.760
<v Speaker 3>this number and that's this and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

855
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 3>as long as they could figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it so people don't hack into it.</v>

856
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.503
<v Speaker 3>Everybody who was an adult should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to vote for the we've gone to </v>

857
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:57.210
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people that have gone to jail,</v>

858
00:37:57.211 --> 00:37:58.044
<v Speaker 3>the idea that someone goes to jail for </v>
<v Speaker 3>four years and now they can't vote for </v>

859
00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:00.924
<v Speaker 3>the rest of their life.</v>

860
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I think that's fucking crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

861
00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 3>You pay your debt to society back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to reenter society.</v>

862
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.533
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You telling me you can't be a 20 year </v>

863
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:10.674
<v Speaker 3>old and do something stupid and rob </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody or something and then I'm </v>

864
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:16.560
<v Speaker 3>supposed to think of you a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the rest of your life.</v>

865
00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:19.170
<v Speaker 3>You're 80 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Rob Somebody when you were 20.</v>

866
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.423
<v Speaker 3>That's still you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dangerous men talk about tear down </v>

867
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 3>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but institutions are a problem no matter</v>

868
00:38:26.011 --> 00:38:27.720
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are always a problem.</v>

869
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I think the real issue is government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

870
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:31.523
<v Speaker 3>Governing us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the real issue is what everybody </v>

871
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 3>wants is safety,</v>

872
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 6>security,</v>
<v Speaker 6>protection,</v>

873
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 6>and unity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what everybody wants.</v>

874
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.733
<v Speaker 6>All the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In terms of restrictions on your </v>

875
00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:46.420
<v Speaker 6>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to just figure it out.</v>

876
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:47.254
<v Speaker 6>Cut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The middle between hurts other people </v>

877
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.593
<v Speaker 6>and hurts yourself and hurt yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're on your own just like you're on </v>

878
00:38:52.901 --> 00:38:56.230
<v Speaker 6>your own with rock climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like you're on your own with bungee</v>

879
00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:57.090
<v Speaker 6>jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So wait,</v>

880
00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.870
<v Speaker 6>give me an example.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bmx Riding,</v>

881
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.223
<v Speaker 6>you're your role as a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Drone in high school they'd call them </v>

882
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:04.890
<v Speaker 6>elective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

883
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:05.873
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How come you could just go to the roof </v>

884
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.470
<v Speaker 6>and jump off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can't do heroin like no one will</v>

885
00:39:11.471 --> 00:39:12.304
<v Speaker 6>stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can go to your roof and practice </v>

886
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 6>backflip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Megan.</v>

887
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 6>So much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm ready to boot,</v>

888
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm ready to fucking jacket needle in my</v>

889
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:19.960
<v Speaker 6>12.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gauge it right now.</v>

890
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 6>You have people tickets telling other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people what to do.</v>

891
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.230
<v Speaker 6>You've got a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got a fucking problem,</v>

892
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.093
<v Speaker 6>even if even if they sort of can get </v>
<v Speaker 6>away with it because it's written down </v>

893
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:31.690
<v Speaker 6>on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you agree to it?</v>

894
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.830
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You weren't.</v>

895
00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 6>Nobody asked you about like child labor </v>
<v Speaker 6>laws.</v>

896
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:36.370
<v Speaker 6>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

897
00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.360
<v Speaker 6>you've never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one's,</v>

898
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.790
<v Speaker 6>no one's pulled you aside and saying </v>
<v Speaker 6>that for years,</v>

899
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:42.760
<v Speaker 6>since I was a child,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no one pulled you aside and decided,</v>

900
00:39:42.761 --> 00:39:43.150
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

901
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.983
<v Speaker 6>you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have decided with them how old you </v>

902
00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:48.000
<v Speaker 6>should be when you drink.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

903
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.110
<v Speaker 6>it's already been done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all.</v>

904
00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:51.183
<v Speaker 6>Most people don't have a say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all written down somewhere and the </v>

905
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:55.144
<v Speaker 6>amount of people that vote versus the </v>
<v Speaker 6>amount of people that are affected by </v>

906
00:39:57.131 --> 00:40:00.910
<v Speaker 6>that vote completely disproportionate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fairly weird,</v>

907
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:02.020
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really weird.</v>

908
00:40:02.021 --> 00:40:07.021
<v Speaker 6>We have a ton of systems that are set up</v>
<v Speaker 6>completely to do two things.</v>

909
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:10.050
<v Speaker 6>One,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to control people and to,</v>

910
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.870
<v Speaker 6>to ensure the survival of these systems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what bureaucracy is.</v>

911
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:16.990
<v Speaker 6>That's a giant problem with government.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the Dea.</v>

912
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.853
<v Speaker 6>The dea wants so badly to keep arresting</v>
<v Speaker 6>people for marijuana because if they </v>

913
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:23.470
<v Speaker 6>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't have to shut up.</v>

914

945
00:41:47.351 --> 00:41:49.240
<v Speaker 6>resisted still.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's guys like that Jeff,</v>

946
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.220
<v Speaker 6>Jeff sessions guy who's coming into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>office with trump who's,</v>

947
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.083
<v Speaker 6>who could be an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it will be because I </v>

948
00:41:55.511 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 6>think trump as a businessperson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a businessperson.</v>

949
00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:00.730
<v Speaker 6>He's not just a business person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a populist,</v>

950
00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:01.330
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's gonna.</v>

951
00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:03.130
<v Speaker 6>He's gonna want people to like them and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

952
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.680
<v Speaker 6>and it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not a logical move.</v>

953
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.470
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's weird as he is,</v>

954
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.333
<v Speaker 6>he's not illogical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Hillary Clinton was illogical and </v>

955
00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:13.330
<v Speaker 6>this is why I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people like [inaudible],</v>

956
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.120
<v Speaker 6>I got a lot of shit from people that are</v>
<v Speaker 6>like super pro Hashtag.</v>

957
00:42:16.121 --> 00:42:18.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm with her and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look man,</v>

958
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.970
<v Speaker 6>she didn't support gay marriage until </v>
<v Speaker 6>2013.</v>

959
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.690
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how crazy that is?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Until 2013,</v>

960
00:42:25.691 --> 00:42:29.830
<v Speaker 6>Hillary Clinton was saying that she </v>
<v Speaker 6>believed that marriage was between a man</v>

961
00:42:29.831 --> 00:42:30.664
<v Speaker 6>and a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a sacred union and it should be </v>

962
00:42:32.081 --> 00:42:36.220
<v Speaker 6>protected and so it's one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Either she actually believed that or she</v>

963
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:39.760
<v Speaker 6>was in bed with people who were forcing </v>
<v Speaker 6>her to behave that way or say that,</v>

964
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.960
<v Speaker 6>or she thought that she had to say that </v>
<v Speaker 6>in order to get elected or.</v>

965
00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.220
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not getting to know.</v>

966
00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.010
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't.</v>

967
00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.630
<v Speaker 6>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't be a part of that.</v>

968
00:42:49.631 --> 00:42:50.320

970
00:42:55.181 --> 00:42:56.610

<v Speaker 7>long time.</v>

980
00:43:19.541 --> 00:43:21.940
<v Speaker 7>And the best thing about that wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like it was great,</v>

<v Speaker 4>earth not knowing.</v>

1029
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:46.291
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1030
00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:48.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to have a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mother.</v>

1031
00:45:48.531 --> 00:45:50.070
<v Speaker 4>I've had her on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about shit,</v>

1032
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.660
<v Speaker 4>but I asked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1033
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:53.580
<v Speaker 4>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys looked randy that night.</v>

1034
00:45:53.581 --> 00:45:54.630
<v Speaker 4>Did you guys have sex?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>

1035
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:55.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was like</v>

1036
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.470
<v Speaker 3>randy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Randy is a weird word.</v>

1037
00:46:01.471 --> 00:46:02.304
<v Speaker 3>What if your name was randy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be All bummed out that people expect my </v>

1038
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.310
<v Speaker 3>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

1039
00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:07.090
<v Speaker 3>I feel randy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1040
00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.420
<v Speaker 3>film in certain places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>others hold on bump.</v>

1041
00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:10.491
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1042
00:46:10.491 --> 00:46:12.930
<v Speaker 3>where are we grabbing pussies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>President,</v>

1043
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.760
<v Speaker 3>president hops grabbing pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1044
00:46:15.761 --> 00:46:17.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that aren't truthful,</v>

1045
00:46:17.601 --> 00:46:18.434
<v Speaker 3>and this is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing I want to say to people </v>

1046
00:46:20.001 --> 00:46:24.330
<v Speaker 3>that think that I hate Hillary Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>will not leave the person alone.</v>

1047
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:27.230
<v Speaker 3>It's your show because this is what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not even a politics thing.</v>

1048
00:46:27.231 --> 00:46:31.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a human thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we owe ourselves like as,</v>

1049
00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:36.291
<v Speaker 3>as human beings to not accept like </v>
<v Speaker 3>blatant lies.</v>

1050
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:39.890
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think it's good for her </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

1051
00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's good for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1052
00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:41.821
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1053
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:42.654
<v Speaker 3>the rob is supposed to be the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in your sixties or something like </v>

1054
00:46:44.571 --> 00:46:45.650
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're done.</v>

1055
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:47.710
<v Speaker 3>You're done developing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're done growing that.</v>

1056
00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:48.920
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1057
00:46:48.921 --> 00:46:51.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're alive if you're alive,</v>

1058
00:46:51.351 --> 00:46:53.540
<v Speaker 3>you're a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have categories of people,</v>

1059
00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:55.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have people that were 20.</v>

1060
00:46:55.281 --> 00:46:55.881
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's young,</v>

1061
00:46:55.881 --> 00:46:57.500
<v Speaker 3>he's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made a mistake.</v>

1062
00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.410
<v Speaker 3>And then we have categories like in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>60.</v>

1063
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never gonna.</v>

1064
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:02.350
<v Speaker 3>Learn anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1065
00:47:02.351 --> 00:47:03.740
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're done developing.</v>

1066
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.780
<v Speaker 3>They're stubborn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're stuck in their ways,</v>

1067
00:47:05.781 --> 00:47:08.180
<v Speaker 3>like let's just accept the fact that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>lies all the time.</v>

1068
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:09.083
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's this video of when they </v>

1069
00:47:10.341 --> 00:47:14.180
<v Speaker 3>were talking about the emails and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's video of the director of the FBI</v>

1070
00:47:14.181 --> 00:47:15.014
<v Speaker 3>talking versus her talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she would say what the director </v>

1071
00:47:17.241 --> 00:47:19.040
<v Speaker 3>said and then he would say what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>really said.</v>

1072
00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.053
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like you see that she's being </v>

1073
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.090
<v Speaker 3>dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good for anybody.</v>

1074
00:47:26.091 --> 00:47:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so good for her.</v>

1075
00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think for a person like her,</v>

1076
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.413
<v Speaker 6>this is probably just a system that </v>
<v Speaker 6>she's been competing in forever and </v>

1077
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.293
<v Speaker 6>that's how this system operates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Makes sure she's really good at it and </v>

1078
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:39.724
<v Speaker 6>she was a lawyer and she knows what you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can say and what you can't say and how </v>

1079
00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:43.804
<v Speaker 6>you can kind of distort things to make </v>
<v Speaker 6>them seem like they were better than </v>

1080
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:49.060
<v Speaker 6>they were still talking about her at </v>
<v Speaker 6>this point.</v>

1081
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:49.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1082
00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:51.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because that sounds like him as well.</v>

1083
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 6>All of them doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you do that,</v>

1084
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 6>when you do that and we see that that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>not good for us.</v>

1085
00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:59.740
<v Speaker 6>If we say yes to that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's bad for us.</v>

1086
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.900
<v Speaker 6>It's bad for us as a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1087
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 6>it does not exist as a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just as a group of human beings.</v>

1088
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.640
<v Speaker 6>We're one person at a very high level is</v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be expressing for us.</v>

1089
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.170
<v Speaker 6>Like if you're going to be the person </v>
<v Speaker 6>who's expressing things,</v>

1090
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.640
<v Speaker 6>that's impossible like exactly as you </v>
<v Speaker 6>said at the beginning.</v>

1091
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I mean it's.</v>

1092
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:20.650
<v Speaker 6>So then what's the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have a binary presidency?</v>

1093
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.740
<v Speaker 6>One President is who speaks for the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For one half,</v>

1094
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 6>one president speaks with the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>hand.</v>

1095
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:27.640
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we should have resident </v>
<v Speaker 6>marrying factions.</v>

1096
00:48:27.641 --> 00:48:28.474
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we should have a unique </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual or even a small group that </v>

1097
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:35.440
<v Speaker 6>runs this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's done before we got here.</v>

1098
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:36.303
<v Speaker 6>Native apart from is it was done in </v>
<v Speaker 6>small groups because everybody was a </v>

1099
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:41.950
<v Speaker 6>small group.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There were tribes and at the end,</v>

1100
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.813
<v Speaker 6>even if you came over on a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you came out in our boat with all those </v>

1101
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:49.090
<v Speaker 6>other psychopaths that we're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 6>hop across the ocean with you.</v>

1102
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 6>How many could get on the boat?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A thousand.</v>

1103
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.933
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the most amount of people they </v>

1104
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:55.180
<v Speaker 6>had on like one of those boats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Once you google that,</v>

1105
00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.740
<v Speaker 6>like you got to really have a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 6>adventure to get over here to be a crazy</v>

1106
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Speaker 6>person.</v>

1107
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.060
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's all really hated small towns,</v>

1108
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:06.070
<v Speaker 6>small groups,</v>
<v Speaker 6>little villages.</v>

1109
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:08.410
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's essentially what we had </v>
<v Speaker 6>representative government.</v>

1110
00:49:08.411 --> 00:49:11.890
<v Speaker 6>The first place was because these guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>in Utah couldn't really talk to the guys</v>

1111
00:49:11.891 --> 00:49:13.900
<v Speaker 6>in DC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like somebody had to talk for you.</v>

1112
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:15.970
<v Speaker 6>You're over there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll take you months to get there.</v>

1113
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 6>So they have to decide how the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing runs.</v>

1114
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:21.640
<v Speaker 6>So you have to vote in your little spot </v>
<v Speaker 6>and this guy sends his vote.</v>

1115
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.300
<v Speaker 6>One hundred and two passengers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ,</v>

1116
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.233
<v Speaker 6>which watch one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the mayflower hundred and two </v>

1117
00:49:27.311 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 6>passengers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

1118
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.740
<v Speaker 6>Half died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first we got 151 shit.</v>

1119
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:39.670
<v Speaker 6>Half died the first winter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They fucking froze to death.</v>

1120
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:40.563
<v Speaker 6>Just think about that when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how come I can't fucking get Wifi and </v>

1121
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:44.700
<v Speaker 6>the subway train God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One hundred,</v>

1122
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 6>two people sailed the ocean blue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

1123
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:48.670
<v Speaker 6>That it probably was back then.</v>

1124
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:51.340
<v Speaker 6>And then came here with an idea to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>it up.</v>

1125
00:49:51.341 --> 00:49:53.070
<v Speaker 6>Let's start America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1126
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.820
<v Speaker 6>imagine what the ocean was like back </v>
<v Speaker 6>then.</v>

1127
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.863
<v Speaker 6>Probably amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>None of those little plastic bead </v>

1128
00:49:58.781 --> 00:50:03.040
<v Speaker 6>islands out in the middle of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I have to not only beautiful but very</v>

1129
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:05.410
<v Speaker 6>disturbing and birds choke on it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

1130
00:50:05.411 --> 00:50:06.244
<v Speaker 6>I read an article that said that </v>
<v Speaker 6>seagulls are birds in general are </v>

1131
00:50:09.221 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 6>attracted to the smell of plastic will </v>
<v Speaker 6>be.</v>

1132
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:12.363
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've read it something they're saying </v>

1133
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:14.023
<v Speaker 6>because a lot of plastic has food on it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like even if it's like a in a </v>

1134
00:50:16.451 --> 00:50:18.900
<v Speaker 6>microscopic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would make sense to me.</v>

1135
00:50:18.901 --> 00:50:20.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.660
<v Speaker 6>Well a lot of our plastic comes in </v>
<v Speaker 6>contact with food for sure.</v>

1137
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:23.523
<v Speaker 6>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read another thing about a certain </v>

1138
00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:27.130
<v Speaker 6>type of bird that lives on this one </v>
<v Speaker 6>island.</v>

1139
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.063
<v Speaker 6>It's a real epidemic that these mama </v>
<v Speaker 6>birds are bringing back plastic and </v>

1140
00:50:32.211 --> 00:50:33.950
<v Speaker 6>feeding it to their babies.</v>

1141
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:37.850
<v Speaker 6>This is super villain plot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's awful.</v>

1143
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.713
<v Speaker 6>There's these bodies of these birds and </v>
<v Speaker 6>their stomachs are filled with plastic </v>

1144
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're rotting.</v>

1145
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:47.780
<v Speaker 6>Their bodies are decomposing and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>plastic is just sitting there exposed.</v>

1146
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's super dark.</v>

1147
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.673
<v Speaker 6>Can we talk about some of your hardship?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was in Hawaii recently married and I </v>

1148
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:58.760
<v Speaker 6>was with this dude when he was on a very</v>
<v Speaker 6>positive thing either.</v>

1149
00:50:58.761 --> 00:50:59.594
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's been a commercial fisherman for a </v>

1150
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:03.200
<v Speaker 6>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His name's Steve.</v>

1151
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:04.690
<v Speaker 6>Shout out to Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1152
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.270
<v Speaker 6>Steve and scooter took me out fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1153
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 6>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1154
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 6>when we were fishing he was telling me </v>
<v Speaker 6>that he's been doing this forever and he</v>

1155
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:15.010
<v Speaker 6>lived in Costa Rica and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ran a,</v>

1156
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.873
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a fishing camp out there and now </v>

1157
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:19.880
<v Speaker 6>he's doing it out of Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

1158
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:20.714
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how much of a difference have you seen </v>

1159
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:23.040
<v Speaker 6>like over the last,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1160
00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:24.020
<v Speaker 6>few goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1161
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 6>it's huge.</v>

1162
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.040
<v Speaker 6>It's a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like a tree now,</v>

1163
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.380
<v Speaker 6>like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 years ago.</v>

1164
00:51:28.381 --> 00:51:30.380
<v Speaker 6>Like 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the amount of fish he's like,</v>

1165
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:34.130
<v Speaker 6>it's just totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like way less fish.</v>

1166
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:34.993
<v Speaker 6>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then he sort of explained to me all </v>

1167
00:51:36.501 --> 00:51:41.501
<v Speaker 6>the different methods that these </v>
<v Speaker 6>commercial fishing corporations use like</v>

1168
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:45.590
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how they go like hundreds of miles off.</v>

1169
00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:46.424
<v Speaker 6>See they have these massive nets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They capture these tuna and they can </v>

1170
00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:52.574
<v Speaker 6>them on the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they have this system where there </v>

1171
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.660
<v Speaker 6>are just thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 6>pounds.</v>

1172
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.210
<v Speaker 6>Tuna just scooping it up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>killing them.</v>

1173
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.500
<v Speaker 6>Canning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1174
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:06.860
<v Speaker 6>you don't think about it when you go to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the store and you see canned tuna,</v>

1175
00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 6>you think I'd like some canned tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember starkist,</v>

1176
00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:14.890
<v Speaker 6>I could go for a tuna salad sandwich </v>
<v Speaker 6>early with whole wheat and some nice uh,</v>

1177
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.810
<v Speaker 6>Alfalfa sprouts on them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do this.</v>

1178
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.873
<v Speaker 6>Then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and of this or how about a grilled </v>

1179
00:52:21.501 --> 00:52:22.334
<v Speaker 6>cheese sandwich with tuna where you </v>
<v Speaker 6>butter the outside of the bread and you </v>

1180
00:52:24.861 --> 00:52:25.694
<v Speaker 6>put some tomato on that bitch and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>put some tuna and you put a bunch of </v>

1181
00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:32.450
<v Speaker 6>slices of a sharp Cheddar and you cook </v>
<v Speaker 6>that Shit.</v>

1182
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:33.820
<v Speaker 6>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1183
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.673
<v Speaker 6>the problem is you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>you've surrounded the meal with so many </v>

1184
00:52:36.351 --> 00:52:37.184
<v Speaker 6>cool adjectives and made it us that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>forgot to tell them this is a dead fish </v>

1185
00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.950
<v Speaker 6>killed at sea and candidacy dude with </v>
<v Speaker 6>relatives looking up,</v>

1186
00:52:45.951 --> 00:52:48.080
<v Speaker 6>going like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's hell hell on a boat.</v>

1187
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what kind of bitch ass shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about.</v>

1188
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:52.850
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about tuna melt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's delicious.</v>

1189
00:52:52.851 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 6>American sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck?</v>

1190
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:55.603
<v Speaker 6>Truly American fucking this guy was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was describing it to me and I was </v>

1191
00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:58.933
<v Speaker 6>seeing it in my mind like a horror film </v>
<v Speaker 6>playing I was seeing in my mind like </v>

1192
00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:07.040
<v Speaker 6>that obviously the oceans giant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's gigantic,</v>

1193
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:12.041
<v Speaker 6>but it's been going on these large scale</v>
<v Speaker 6>efforts for so long that it's just chop,</v>

1194
00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.293
<v Speaker 6>chop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>chop and away the number of fish and he </v>

1195
00:53:15.741 --> 00:53:19.040
<v Speaker 6>was really scared of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was really scared of it.</v>

1196
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:19.933
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't know how much longer it's </v>

1197
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:21.884
<v Speaker 6>going to last.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there could be an insufficient or </v>

1198
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 6>lifetime the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1199
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of speculation that by </v>
<v Speaker 3>2050 we literally would have killed like</v>

1200
00:53:31.201 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 3>most of the fish in the sea if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue escalating the way we have from</v>

1201
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.830
<v Speaker 3>1960 to 2016 population now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven billion.</v>

1202
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just assume it's going to double,</v>

1203
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by 2050.</v>

1204
00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:48.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know what the number is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the projected population by 2050.</v>

1205
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I got to imagine it's was the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting questions,</v>

1206
00:53:51.611 --> 00:53:52.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a weird thing?</v>

1207
00:53:52.501 --> 00:53:53.334
<v Speaker 3>I always ask people shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who is that guy who played that </v>

1208
00:53:55.981 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 3>wizard once to what's the population?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could it be by the year 20,</v>

1209
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:01.734
<v Speaker 3>50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're making big decisions </v>

1210
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:05.100
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost 10 billion.</v>

1211
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:10.130
<v Speaker 3>So I was 11 billion by 2100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

1212
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Nine point $7 billion in 2050.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's not enough fish,</v>

1213
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.130
<v Speaker 3>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it go to soylent green?</v>

1214
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Were like we got to start consuming the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

1215
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:23.783
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a method now apparently where </v>

1216
00:54:25.951 --> 00:54:29.040
<v Speaker 3>they can make petri dish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1217
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 3>like stem cell created meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how the fuck they do it.</v>

1218
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:35.460
<v Speaker 3>I have zero understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

1219
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:36.294
<v Speaker 3>but I know that they did it a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and it was so expensive that they </v>

1220
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:43.730
<v Speaker 3>did it like one cheeseburger would to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cost like a quarter million dollars,</v>

1221
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.753
<v Speaker 3>like so expensive to produce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was more of like sort of a test </v>

1222
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.220
<v Speaker 3>subject like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we know that we can do this,</v>

1223
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.233
<v Speaker 3>let's make the process more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's figure out how to large scale </v>

1224
00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.330
<v Speaker 3>people if they can do that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they can do that,</v>

1225
00:54:57.331 --> 00:54:59.820
<v Speaker 3>they can literally grow meat with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1226
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.340
<v Speaker 3>There won't be a body attached to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>

1227
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.233
<v Speaker 3>It would just be me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand how it works so I </v>

1228
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:05.730
<v Speaker 3>don't understand.</v>

1229
00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you fuel that meet with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how does it grow?</v>

1230
00:55:08.911 --> 00:55:09.744
<v Speaker 3>Like what is he eating or while it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing it has to take something in </v>

1231
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:13.223
<v Speaker 3>order to get larger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just pulling air out and </v>

1232
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:15.834
<v Speaker 3>getting bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are you feeding it and how's </v>

1233
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:19.830
<v Speaker 3>that work and is that ethical and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we watch?</v>

1234
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we watch made it works?</v>

1235
00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.930
<v Speaker 3>You can suck my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far can you take this warm?</v>

1236
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of questions that we would</v>

1237
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 3>want to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's some westworld shit.</v>

1238
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:34.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean that they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can make a leg of a fucking cow,</v>

1239
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.330
<v Speaker 3>you can make a leg of a fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just do it.</v>

1240
00:55:37.331 --> 00:55:40.440
<v Speaker 3>It just takes some time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy with a metal femur.</v>

1241
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:43.230
<v Speaker 3>He has an artificial femur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got bone cancer.</v>

1242
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.891
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1243
00:55:43.891 --> 00:55:44.724
<v Speaker 3>and so one of his legs is a is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a metal rod that goes down to his </v>

1244
00:55:49.171 --> 00:55:53.130
<v Speaker 3>knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they replaced his femur with a bone</v>

1245
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.353
<v Speaker 3>with a metal bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can start doing that to the </v>

1246
00:55:57.241 --> 00:56:00.870
<v Speaker 3>whole body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means if you can make some sort of</v>

1247
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 3>a nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like halfway to a person.</v>

1248
00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:08.820
<v Speaker 3>You can make meat and you can make </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial bones.</v>

1249
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 3>You make an artificial scarcity and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover it with meat.</v>

1250
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:13.730
<v Speaker 3>You've got a westworld thing going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1251
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:18.000
<v Speaker 3>True hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They showed you the westworld characters</v>

1252
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.000
<v Speaker 3>underneath their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all robotic.</v>

1253
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.260
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about is an organic form </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

1254
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the westworld thing</v>

1255
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 6>is a little off on how it's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>

1256
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.860
<v Speaker 6>I think it's probably gonna go down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's going to go look at hbo show.</v>

1257
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:31.910
<v Speaker 6>Got It wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they're bullshitting us.</v>

1258
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:32.943
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a part of the elite </v>

1259
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:34.774
<v Speaker 6>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They found they figured out a way to </v>

1260
00:56:36.311 --> 00:56:37.144
<v Speaker 6>make a human heart in a petri dish of </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking beating human heart with stem </v>

1261
00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 6>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

1262
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See if he could find associated at all.</v>

1263
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:48.240
<v Speaker 6>It's insane to the Russian scientist or </v>
<v Speaker 6>the German size,</v>

1264
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.850
<v Speaker 6>the one that you just cut off dog heads </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm sure.</v>

1265
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure ever see that gun never held us</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a burn victim.</v>

1266
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:57.710
<v Speaker 6>Three P or re heal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What Day is it?</v>

1267
00:56:57.711 --> 00:56:58.780
<v Speaker 6>Says?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that.</v>

1268
00:56:58.781 --> 00:57:00.190
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>

1269
00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:01.024
<v Speaker 6>It's sprays.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stem cells like a little mister and </v>

1270
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:07.720
<v Speaker 6>those stem cells cling to the zones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The tissue,</v>

1271
00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:12.721
<v Speaker 6>especially like when they're recently </v>
<v Speaker 6>injured and it heals up super quick.</v>

1272
00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:17.110
<v Speaker 6>Holy Crap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking crazy,</v>

1273
00:57:17.111 --> 00:57:17.741
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1274
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:21.100
<v Speaker 6>that was one of the most devastating </v>
<v Speaker 6>injuries a person could get because it's</v>

1275
00:57:21.101 --> 00:57:21.934
<v Speaker 6>a giant Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a big burn like that or see </v>

1276
00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 6>gestating minute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>

1277
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:32.140
<v Speaker 6>Permanent results within days as a stem </v>
<v Speaker 6>cells regenerate the skin,</v>

1278
00:57:32.141 --> 00:57:33.820
<v Speaker 6>leaving no scars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking,</v>

1279
00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:35.890
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're giving your own stem cells,</v>

1280
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.780
<v Speaker 6>nobody can get all shitty about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1281
00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:38.614
<v Speaker 6>the stem cells that they're using now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can get them from women when they </v>

1282
00:57:40.781 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 6>have secession sections,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they take it out of the placenta.</v>

1283
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.300
<v Speaker 6>I've had a shot into my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a shoulder injury.</v>

1284
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:49.930
<v Speaker 6>I had a shot into my shoulder and to </v>
<v Speaker 6>heal like wolverine.</v>

1285
00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.793
<v Speaker 6>It's the craziest fucking thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like that close to getting </v>

1286
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 6>shoulder surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had this real issue with my shoulder,</v>

1287
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:56.854
<v Speaker 6>like probably that I had probably </v>
<v Speaker 6>dislocated it at some point in time and </v>

1288
00:57:59.831 --> 00:58:00.664
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know and then just years of </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing Jujitsu and lifting weights and </v>

1289
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:08.920
<v Speaker 6>fighting out a arm bars and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was just always bothering me.</v>

1290
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.670
<v Speaker 6>So I go to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get an Mri and he says,</v>

1291
00:58:12.671 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>

1292
00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:15.550
<v Speaker 6>you got a tear here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got a tear here,</v>

1293
00:58:15.551 --> 00:58:18.120
<v Speaker 6>he got a tear in your labor room,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got a tear in your biceps tendon,</v>

1294
00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:20.740
<v Speaker 6>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might need surgery,</v>

1295
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:25.790
<v Speaker 6>like see how long you can go now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just do little rehab and you know,</v>

1296
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.600
<v Speaker 6>and if it gets to a point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>unmanageable,</v>

1297
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:32.830
<v Speaker 6>then you'd go under the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I go and it's always annoying me,</v>

1298
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:33.843
<v Speaker 6>like it was always [inaudible] at me and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then I go and get these shots in my </v>

1299
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 6>shoulder and like three weeks later I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1300
00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:40.960
<v Speaker 6>am I imagining this or is this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing?</v>

1301
00:58:40.961 --> 00:58:41.794
<v Speaker 6>Feel Great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll just get you skipped over the big </v>

1302
00:58:43.331 --> 00:58:44.420
<v Speaker 6>step.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you get to the shots?</v>

1303
00:58:44.421 --> 00:58:47.380
<v Speaker 6>And the shoulder was the doctor like Dr </v>
<v Speaker 6>the UFC doctor,</v>

1304
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.513
<v Speaker 6>the UFC doctor who had had um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dr Davidson had shoulder surgery and </v>

1305
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:56.710
<v Speaker 6>after shoulder surgery he was still in </v>
<v Speaker 6>pain months,</v>

1306
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.950
<v Speaker 6>months later.</v>

1307
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:57.783
<v Speaker 6>And he went and got the stem cell shots </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he said within weeks his shoulder </v>

1308
00:59:01.691 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 6>felt amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it was crazy.</v>

1309
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.060
<v Speaker 6>So who tells him about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how he's a doctor,</v>

1310
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:07.943
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so he's just up on the late in the </v>

1311
00:59:08.621 --> 00:59:09.880
<v Speaker 6>doctor community.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll look,</v>

1312
00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:11.200
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these are stem cells aren't good.</v>

1313
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:12.034
<v Speaker 6>You get yelled at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of pro athletes are doing it and </v>

1314
00:59:14.911 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 6>they're doing it to help their body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or no,</v>

1315
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:17.740
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

1316
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.110
<v Speaker 6>there's a bunch of ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could get it from your own fat.</v>

1317
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 6>They suck your fat to do a light bulb on</v>

1318
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.821
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1319
00:59:22.821 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just keep sucking it out.</v>

1320
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:26.024
<v Speaker 3>And you go intravenous with the stem </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells so I can out intravenous stem </v>

1321
00:59:28.491 --> 00:59:30.200
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more net boom.</v>

1322
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Say it again because that I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>

1323
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.300
<v Speaker 3>getting new right now on American </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

1324
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 3>A million times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's illegal right now in America.</v>

1325
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:38.830
<v Speaker 3>But Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sells.</v>

1326
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:39.471
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1327
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:40.071
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To,</v>

1328
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:40.904
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to intravenously inject it back into </v>

1329
00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 3>your body has supposed to have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnificent effect.</v>

1330
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.383
<v Speaker 3>Intravenous stem cell injections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Explain to your whole body like </v>

1331
00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:50.960
<v Speaker 3>intravenous drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like heroin.</v>

1332
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.240
<v Speaker 3>They can somehow or another do that with</v>
<v Speaker 3>stem cells and you're like,</v>

1333
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.900
<v Speaker 3>I've known to people that have done it </v>
<v Speaker 3>boss route and end bill's area.</v>

1334
00:59:57.901 --> 00:59:59.390
<v Speaker 3>And they're both like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

1335
00:59:59.391 --> 01:00:00.224
<v Speaker 3>this was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boss said that felt like he had energy </v>

1336
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.070
<v Speaker 3>coming off his fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1337
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.911
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1338
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:06.440
<v Speaker 3>my whole body was charged.</v>

1339
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1340
01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 3>this is closest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get to superhuman ability,</v>

1341
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's with our own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With your own stem cells,</v>

1342
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.060
<v Speaker 3>you can do it with your own stance </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1343
01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:15.350
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one method.</v>

1344
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:16.184
<v Speaker 3>Another method that another friend of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine did is they drilled into the bone </v>

1345
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:24.140
<v Speaker 3>in his hip and they pulled marrow out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and use that marrow,</v>

1346
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:28.220
<v Speaker 3>use the stem cells from his hip marrow </v>
<v Speaker 3>and inject that into his knee.</v>

1347
01:00:28.221 --> 01:00:30.100
<v Speaker 3>And it had a pretty remarkable effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1348
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:35.430
<v Speaker 3>It's the opinion is divided over which </v>
<v Speaker 3>stem cell therapy is the most effective,</v>

1349
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.023
<v Speaker 3>but one of them that seems to be very </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective is one that I did and that's </v>

1350
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:42.743
<v Speaker 3>in section.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take a woman who's given birth by </v>

1351
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.440
<v Speaker 3>section and if they're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they have to be within a certain</v>

1352
01:00:48.441 --> 01:00:49.274
<v Speaker 3>age limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they take their placenta and they </v>

1353
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:51.824
<v Speaker 3>extract stem cells from the placenta and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have some sort of a process </v>

1354
01:00:55.491 --> 01:00:56.420
<v Speaker 3>that I'll never understand.</v>

1355
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.403
<v Speaker 3>And then they inject the stem cells into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the injury itself and your body starts </v>

1356
01:01:01.281 --> 01:01:02.114
<v Speaker 3>regenerating tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the difference between this </v>

1357
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.233
<v Speaker 3>and any other sort of form of therapy is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it actually allows your body to </v>

1358
01:01:09.891 --> 01:01:10.724
<v Speaker 3>regenerate tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So things that are torn can actually </v>

1359
01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:17.240
<v Speaker 3>heal and thick and strengthen like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing what those burn victims.</v>

1360
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.083
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't listen to me because I don't know </v>

1361
01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:19.784
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know how it's been explained to </v>

1362
01:01:21.471 --> 01:01:22.740
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1363
01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:25.850
<v Speaker 3>it had a pretty profound effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1364
01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:29.300
<v Speaker 3>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've got nothing wrong with you and</v>

1365
01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:31.680
<v Speaker 3>you just inject stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1366
01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1367
01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Well he had something wrong with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1368
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 3>You who's recovering from a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious injury.</v>

1369
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.810
<v Speaker 3>Bas rutten was at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

1370
01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well one of the things we're finding out</v>

1371
01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.750
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1372
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:43.723
<v Speaker 3>with mice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking the blood of young mice </v>

1373
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.863
<v Speaker 3>and they're injecting it in older mice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these older my start acting like </v>

1374
01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:54.440
<v Speaker 3>young mice again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they start literally like going back</v>

1375
01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:55.274
<v Speaker 3>in age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is some crazy vampire show </v>

1376
01:01:58.310 --> 01:01:59.100
<v Speaker 3>really is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1377
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.580
<v Speaker 3>That's very close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is totally vampire shit.</v>

1378
01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Do University off the blood of young </v>
<v Speaker 3>mice isn't an excellent fucking.</v>

1379
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:07.340
<v Speaker 3>It is novel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we got your next movie.</v>

1380
01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a great punk rock band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1381
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:15.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a great idea for a movie gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1382
01:02:15.891 --> 01:02:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1383
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to the guy made test so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can make that work.</v>

1384
01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what the battery is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1385
01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:22.893
<v Speaker 3>Elizabeth batteries like one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>infamous serial killers in human </v>

1386
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:26.484
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And her gig was she would kill young </v>

1387
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:30.930
<v Speaker 3>women in bathing their blood blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1388
01:02:30.931 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Then I did her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

1389
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.620
<v Speaker 3>she was a noble woman and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1390
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 3>where was she from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slovakia.</v>

1391
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hungry.</v>

1392
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1393
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.693
<v Speaker 3>she just killed a ton of pretty girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would go find these peasant girls </v>

1394
01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:47.400
<v Speaker 3>and bring it back to a castle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>torture them,</v>

1395
01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:48.243
<v Speaker 3>kill them and cut them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all the people that worked with are </v>

1396
01:02:50.461 --> 01:02:54.690
<v Speaker 3>just horrified buyer because she just </v>
<v Speaker 3>had like a dungeon of dead women and she</v>

1397
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:57.780
<v Speaker 3>would just slaughtered them and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>bathe in their blood and.</v>

1398
01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:00.240
<v Speaker 3>But because of the fact that she was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>noble woman,</v>

1399
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 3>she never even got executed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just put her in house arrest,</v>

1400
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.290
<v Speaker 3>so they locked her in some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>chamber up in the top of some castle,</v>

1401
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:09.540
<v Speaker 3>like some monster by herself until she </v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

1402
01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:12.540
<v Speaker 3>How old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was old when she died.</v>

1403
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:13.340
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1404
01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.173
<v Speaker 3>she didn't die at 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as she's a real mom question that </v>

1405
01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:18.434
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1406
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.820
<v Speaker 3>it's good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was 54 when she died,</v>

1407
01:03:20.821 --> 01:03:22.290
<v Speaker 3>which back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which right now,</v>

1408
01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:26.490
<v Speaker 3>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've loved 16,</v>

1409
01:03:26.491 --> 01:03:28.560
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you liver love that.</v>

1410
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Didn't make it to 54 and just realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the blood bather butchered.</v>

1411
01:03:32.581 --> 01:03:33.414
<v Speaker 3>All those women made it to 54.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old was she when they locked her in </v>

1412
01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:38.370
<v Speaker 3>the hole?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the process work?</v>

1413
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.230
<v Speaker 3>No Blood?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1414
01:03:40.231 --> 01:03:42.360
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work because she didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck she was doing.</v>

1415
01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:43.194
<v Speaker 3>She had the right idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in a way like there's the right </v>

1416
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.120
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was the mice before the mice,</v>

1417
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.250
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You dumb cunt.</v>

1418
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 3>They just believe that young kids to </v>
<v Speaker 3>donate blood,</v>

1419
01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.490
<v Speaker 3>to do what she did wrong was bathed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the blood.</v>

1420
01:03:59.491 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 3>What he's supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what she did wrong.</v>

1421
01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:03.380
<v Speaker 3>She's a fucking fucking serial killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>

1422
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:04.223
<v Speaker 3>But her idea was somehow or another that</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was going to get the younger </v>

1423
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.333
<v Speaker 3>juvenile age and that's been a theme </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have sort of like repeated </v>

1424
01:04:13.111 --> 01:04:14.580
<v Speaker 3>over and over again and it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder,</v>

1425
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:16.440
<v Speaker 3>maybe we mean no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1426
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:17.363
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the maybe it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous and I'm and bloods of </v>

1427
01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.613
<v Speaker 3>illiquid and you can contain it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure it and we just get our heads </v>

1428
01:04:23.461 --> 01:04:25.620
<v Speaker 3>wrapped around this idea that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes you younger.</v>

1429
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe like we inherently knew that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the source of aging.</v>

1430
01:04:29.251 --> 01:04:34.080
<v Speaker 3>It's the blood and then chased it away </v>
<v Speaker 3>during civilization just because like,</v>

1431
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.910
<v Speaker 3>well there's only one way around that or</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of others.</v>

1432
01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not something that we knew or</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know.</v>

1433
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.010
<v Speaker 3>But it's inherent knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe your system,</v>

1434
01:04:44.011 --> 01:04:44.844
<v Speaker 3>sort of like how your body knows when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's thirsty to drink water without </v>

1435
01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:50.100
<v Speaker 3>anybody even telling you like you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinda know.</v>

1436
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:50.963
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like certain things that you </v>

1437
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:53.370
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a snake,</v>

1438
01:04:53.371 --> 01:04:55.440
<v Speaker 3>even if you've never seen one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to back up.</v>

1439
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.453
<v Speaker 3>There's things that you just know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be highly possible that we'd </v>

1440
01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:00.384
<v Speaker 3>have some sort of a subconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of some aspects of our </v>

1441
01:05:04.951 --> 01:05:07.630
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some needs that our body has that we,</v>

1442
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:08.543
<v Speaker 3>we've never been able to see it written </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere because no one's written it </v>

1443
01:05:10.921 --> 01:05:11.754
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you kind of know things and </v>

1444
01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:15.540
<v Speaker 3>maybe somewhere just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1445
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 3>maybe somewhere in the back of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human DNA.</v>

1446
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.430
<v Speaker 2>We know that the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the blood goes bad,</v>

1447
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.370
<v Speaker 2>your body starts to get old and starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fall apart,</v>

1448
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>but if you pump that young blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>backhand Doodoodoo Doodoo too.</v>

1449
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Like we just kind of has to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>

1450
01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the scary thing,</v>

1451
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the number one thing that</v>

1452
01:05:34.121 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>people are hoping science can stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>people getting old and dying.</v>

1453
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:40.070
<v Speaker 2>That's the number one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you said,</v>

1454
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I understand going like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man.</v>

1455
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.793
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be great if we could do all </v>

1456
01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:47.230
<v Speaker 2>this without a president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's tough to be like,</v>

1457
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:48.640
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did this all be better?</v>

1458
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:51.670
<v Speaker 2>If we couldn't die?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it would be better.</v>

1459
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everything.</v>

1460
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.320
<v Speaker 2>There's everything ages in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

1461
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:58.230
<v Speaker 2>The road goes in one direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sewer,</v>

1462
01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.073
<v Speaker 2>slow it down and you can make the path </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable for yourself as comfortable </v>

1463
01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 2>as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the journey even more so,</v>

1464
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you could extend the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road forever.</v>

1465
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.843
<v Speaker 2>You know that certain jellyfish are </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a mortal explain they live </v>

1466
01:06:11.531 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 2>here so don't have a head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart and lungs,</v>

1467
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.083
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we really can regenerate all the </v>

1468
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:20.890
<v Speaker 2>tissue in your body and let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for trauma,</v>

1469
01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.490
<v Speaker 2>except for accidents and somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody killing you,</v>

1470
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.780
<v Speaker 2>there could be only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there's no physical reason why they</v>

1471
01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:29.614
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be able to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop the aging clock and literally turn </v>

1472
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:34.630
<v Speaker 2>it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No physical reason.</v>

1473
01:06:34.631 --> 01:06:36.670
<v Speaker 2>What about the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both that.</v>

1474
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is also an Oregon does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

1475
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:43.270
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a real question as </v>
<v Speaker 2>to where you know,</v>

1476
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.133
<v Speaker 2>where your memories are actually stored </v>
<v Speaker 2>and who are you and once they start </v>

1477
01:06:46.481 --> 01:06:51.470
<v Speaker 2>getting to that ray Kurzweil's shit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>storing consciousness and some sort of a</v>

1478
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.830
<v Speaker 2>data bank watch black mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

1479
01:06:53.831 --> 01:06:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I heard I have to.</v>

1480
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:55.900
<v Speaker 2>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would love it.</v>

1481
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I watched one episode when they made the</v>
<v Speaker 2>politician,</v>

1482
01:06:58.211 --> 01:07:00.380
<v Speaker 2>fuck the pig was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad ass.</v>

1483
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.233
<v Speaker 2>Amazing episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck you watched that you were </v>

1484
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:07.430
<v Speaker 2>good enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That brilliance and be like,</v>

1485
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was their first episode.</v>

1486
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Let me see what the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I'm opposed to it.</v>

1487
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I just had to wait to have this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode and the second season about,</v>

1488
01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:19.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't telegraph it up front,</v>

1489
01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.560
<v Speaker 2>the smart tv that make it work for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>

1490
01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:26.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially the idea is they take people</v>

1491
01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:27.004
<v Speaker 2>who are dying and you can download your </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness into this digital </v>

1492
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.580
<v Speaker 2>playground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look the way you want.</v>

1493
01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:35.180
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1494
01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every spring break you've ever seen and </v>

1495
01:07:37.241 --> 01:07:38.074
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these two people meet up and </v>

1496
01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:43.660
<v Speaker 2>they're both young women and you find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out one is an old woman and the other,</v>

1497
01:07:43.661 --> 01:07:44.470
<v Speaker 2>they're both old women.</v>

1498
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:47.080
<v Speaker 2>One's been a vegetable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she was like a teenager.</v>

1499
01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:52.370
<v Speaker 2>But in this virtual world they can drop </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be free and to be whoever they want.</v>

1500
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 2>But it's generally considered like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1501
01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:57.613
<v Speaker 2>if you could choose to just die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pass onto whatever you think is out </v>

1502
01:08:02.081 --> 01:08:03.940
<v Speaker 2>there if there's a heaven or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1503
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.860
<v Speaker 2>or you could choose to go to the server </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they call it and stuff.</v>

1504
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.230
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1505
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.250
<v Speaker 2>the two women who fall for one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

1506
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.040
<v Speaker 2>one is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay here forever.</v>

1507
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:15.681
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1508
01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:19.840
<v Speaker 2>we can be like this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the older woman was like,</v>

1509
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I had a life with a husband and a kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I watched him get old and die and he</v>

1510
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 2>chose not to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to choose to live forever.</v>

1511
01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:34.490
<v Speaker 2>And her friends like where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know where you're going.</v>

1512
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:35.323
<v Speaker 2>But what if he's not there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gets you nowhere or alert </v>

1517
01:08:44.451 --> 01:08:45.284

<v Speaker 2>but I got to keep going with this </v>

1518
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>because it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we got to talk about the arrival.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:10:39.441 --> 01:10:44.360

<v Speaker 2>you got the arrival,</v>

1567
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Sheen Son.</v>

1570
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and then Dave Foley released me.</v>

1574
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.630

<v Speaker 2>big news radio fan.</v>

1576
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:08.174
<v Speaker 2>But even going back pre news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the reason I get to news </v>

1577
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:13.060
<v Speaker 2>radio's because that was a massive kids </v>

1579
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.053

<v Speaker 7>on the game show recently that the </v>

1580

<v Speaker 7>and they're like,</v>

1612
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.333
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just not like a doubt he'd even </v>

1613
01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:27.504
<v Speaker 7>remember meeting me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I did meet him on that Hollywood </v>

1614
01:12:29.191 --> 01:12:31.950
<v Speaker 7>game night show and talked to them for a</v>
<v Speaker 7>long time.</v>

1615
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.580
<v Speaker 7>But I'm a deep fan going way back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's awesome.</v>

1616
01:12:35.581 --> 01:12:37.260

<v Speaker 7>sorry,</v>

1617

<v Speaker 7>you like.</v>

1618
01:12:39.341 --> 01:12:40.174
<v Speaker 7>Do you meet that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's literally one of the smartest </v>

1619
01:12:43.111 --> 01:12:46.530
<v Speaker 7>people I've ever met in my life arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's talk about the new arrival.</v>

<v Speaker 7>You gotta see it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You would love it,</v>

1621
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.780

<v Speaker 7>I wanted to talk about data.</v>

1622
01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:51.230
<v Speaker 7>Let's go deep on.</v>

1623
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.930
<v Speaker 3>He's a secret producer of Newsradio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

1624
01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Explain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this deep cuts newsradio?</v>

1625
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm I'm listening mode.</v>

1627
01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:02.070
<v Speaker 3>This is not a knock against the writers </v>
<v Speaker 3>as writers are brilliant.</v>

1628
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 3>Paul Sams go created it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another one,</v>

1629
01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 3>the smartest people I've ever met and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just completely unique,</v>

1630
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.113
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of guys that pretend </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be that eccentric Weirdo writer Guy </v>

1631
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:18.510
<v Speaker 3>Paul Sams is that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such an eccentric guy.</v>

1632
01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Like they didn't start writing until </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 3:00</v>

1633
01:13:20.791 --> 01:13:22.100
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would hang out,</v>

1634
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.943
<v Speaker 3>play video games and foreign each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other's faces and they literally didn't </v>

1635
01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:26.994
<v Speaker 3>start writing until the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>night because Paul like had a strategy </v>

1636
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:30.773
<v Speaker 3>of getting like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really tired and silly and then </v>

1637
01:13:33.151 --> 01:13:36.510
<v Speaker 3>they would write all night and then a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of times we would get like the first</v>

1638
01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:38.430
<v Speaker 3>draft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day of the table read,</v>

1639
01:13:38.431 --> 01:13:41.310
<v Speaker 3>we would get the first draft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would just be like,</v>

1640
01:13:41.311 --> 01:13:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Josh Lieb would come down barefoot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1641
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.473
<v Speaker 3>these guys would be up all night and Lou</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin and all these writers and I was </v>

1642
01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:50.070
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys fucking crazy.</v>

1643
01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Like you didn't even sleep like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes like,</v>

1644
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:53.280
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been writing all night.</v>

1645
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.173
<v Speaker 3>This is how we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were just silly because they </v>

1646
01:13:56.221 --> 01:13:58.260
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were almost without doing drugs.</v>

1647
01:13:58.261 --> 01:14:03.261
<v Speaker 3>They were getting high by keeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] for inhibition</v>

1648
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:05.103
<v Speaker 7>there up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The more they're like anything goes and </v>

1649
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:09.440
<v Speaker 7>as you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if your welfare or your,</v>

1650
01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the middle the day,</v>

1651
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:16.591
<v Speaker 7>perhaps you're less a apt or less,</v>
<v Speaker 7>less likely to be like,</v>

1652
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.110
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got a fucking stupid.</v>

1653
01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:22.980
<v Speaker 7>I don't want someone to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you asshole.</v>

1654
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 7>That's a fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nobody wants to get judged.</v>

1655
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:27.730
<v Speaker 7>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I smoke weed.</v>

1656
01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:29.920
<v Speaker 7>Not because it gives you a better ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but because it's,</v>

1657
01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:30.813
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it lowers your inhibitions where you're </v>

1658
01:14:31.871 --> 01:14:32.570
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

1659
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:35.050
<v Speaker 7>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If people think it's stupid,</v>

1660
01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if that don't work,</v>

1661
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 7>I'll try something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll say another way.</v>

1662
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:40.840
<v Speaker 7>You can express yourself more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Honestly.</v>

1663
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:41.674
<v Speaker 7>You feel freer to express yourself more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I must be the same idea that people </v>

1664
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 7>fucking up and then just getting them </v>
<v Speaker 7>tired and they'd be like now.</v>

1665
01:14:47.111 --> 01:14:47.590
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1666
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:50.500
<v Speaker 7>It's a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It really is very,</v>

1667
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:51.830
<v Speaker 7>very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very,</v>

1668
01:14:51.831 --> 01:14:52.664
<v Speaker 7>it was very silly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a silly show and that's one of </v>

1669
01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:56.140
<v Speaker 7>the reasons why I think there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 7>silliness going on,</v>

1670
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:59.350
<v Speaker 7>but which is a strong suit when you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can't,</v>

1671
01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:04.380
<v Speaker 7>when you don't have the card to play of </v>
<v Speaker 7>like let's say cock or fuck shit.</v>

1672
01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:07.190
<v Speaker 7>Like you can't even do the basic cards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you like,</v>

1673
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:08.043
<v Speaker 7>what do you replace those cards in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>deck width and that show replaced it </v>

1674
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:10.931
<v Speaker 7>with like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1675
01:15:10.931 --> 01:15:11.764
<v Speaker 7>we're going to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're going to up the silly question in </v>

1676
01:15:13.511 --> 01:15:15.610
<v Speaker 7>a way that doesn't look like other </v>
<v Speaker 7>sitcoms.</v>

1677
01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.320
<v Speaker 7>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like they're silly.</v>

1678
01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 7>Was bill getting a cane where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a real fucking silly episode.</v>

1679
01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:24.700
<v Speaker 7>They built a whole episode around him </v>
<v Speaker 7>walking to everybody loves a cane.</v>

1680
01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:26.630
<v Speaker 7>Like that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not the same bill.</v>

1681
01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:27.610
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was very,</v>

1682
01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:30.330
<v Speaker 7>very top shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like your last name's girly,</v>

1683
01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.280
<v Speaker 7>like just repeating that for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for,</v>

1684
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:35.890
<v Speaker 7>for five fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was like every time it happens.</v>

1685
01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.100
<v Speaker 7>Like your last name's grilling.</v>

1686
01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.670
<v Speaker 6>That's genius.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That show was,</v>

1687
01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.820
<v Speaker 6>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a very weird show.</v>

1688
01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.120
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of ways I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Paul was a,</v>

1689
01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.073
<v Speaker 6>he's such a unique guy that he would </v>
<v Speaker 6>essentially let anybody come up with </v>

1690
01:15:50.131 --> 01:15:53.370
<v Speaker 6>another line if like they were doing a </v>
<v Speaker 6>table read or a,</v>

1691
01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.690
<v Speaker 6>not a table read rather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

1692
01:15:54.691 --> 01:15:55.980
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a run through.</v>

1693
01:15:56.370 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 6>If you would get a hold of the script,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dave would come up with an alternative,</v>

1694
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.593
<v Speaker 6>an alternative line.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like right away the show was in </v>

1695
01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:05.994
<v Speaker 6>trouble like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because like the first year that we are </v>

1696
01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:10.620
<v Speaker 6>filming,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it wasn't really doing very well in</v>

1697
01:16:10.621 --> 01:16:13.380
<v Speaker 6>the ratings and they couldn't figure out</v>
<v Speaker 6>how the show.</v>

1698
01:16:13.381 --> 01:16:15.150
<v Speaker 6>I bet you that number would be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1699
01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.080
<v Speaker 6>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We moved nine times in f five,</v>

1700
01:16:19.081 --> 01:16:20.730
<v Speaker 6>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

1701
01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.440
<v Speaker 6>there was this um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or four years,</v>

1702
01:16:22.441 --> 01:16:25.770
<v Speaker 6>whatever we did and it was this moment </v>
<v Speaker 6>when they were,</v>

1703
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:28.380
<v Speaker 6>they were just trying to figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 6>constantly.</v>

1704
01:16:28.381 --> 01:16:33.381
<v Speaker 6>It was a lot of work and they would all </v>
<v Speaker 6>get together and try to rewrite scenes.</v>

1705
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:36.600
<v Speaker 6>But Dave Foley would rewrite scenes like</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the floor.</v>

1706
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:37.703
<v Speaker 6>And as the show kept going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it became more and more of a thing like </v>

1707
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:42.540
<v Speaker 6>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was like a secret producer.</v>

1708
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:45.540
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but not that it was a secret because the</v>

1709
01:16:45.541 --> 01:16:49.080
<v Speaker 6>writers were so open minded that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>just wanted to see the best job.</v>

1710
01:16:49.081 --> 01:16:49.380
<v Speaker 6>He's</v>

1711
01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:50.213
<v Speaker 7>the best kind of actor though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's the actor that you love because </v>

1712
01:16:51.931 --> 01:16:52.764
<v Speaker 7>he's a writer as well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it comes to set and he's not just </v>

1713
01:16:54.661 --> 01:16:55.494
<v Speaker 7>doing your script.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He can give you five other scripts just </v>

1714
01:16:57.981 --> 01:17:01.560
<v Speaker 7>as funny if you want them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and if he's like the good ones,</v>

1715
01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.620
<v Speaker 7>he's not jamming my shit's better than </v>
<v Speaker 7>yours and your throat.</v>

1716
01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:07.530
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if there's an opening gracefully,</v>

1717
01:17:07.531 --> 01:17:08.364
<v Speaker 7>it goes in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that in the beginning of my career </v>

1718
01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 7>is</v>

1719
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.800
<v Speaker 4>to reject people that were like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm like,</v>

1720
01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:14.090
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's not my writing,</v>

1721
01:17:14.091 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 4>then what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the older you get,</v>

1722
01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:17.460
<v Speaker 4>the more comfortable getting you </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized,</v>

1723
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:19.190
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get credit regardless.</v>

1724
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.053
<v Speaker 4>Like go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember for me it was Chris </v>

1725
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.800
<v Speaker 4>Rock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a moment in dogma,</v>

1726
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:28.250
<v Speaker 4>a Chris Rock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a line in the script,</v>

1727
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:32.200
<v Speaker 4>a line in the movie where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1728
01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he falls out of heaven.</v>

1729
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:37.300
<v Speaker 4>He's Brewfest the 13th apostle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then having this conversation though</v>

1730
01:17:37.301 --> 01:17:38.134
<v Speaker 4>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and Linda Fiorentino playing </v>

1731
01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Bethany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jane Santa Barbara there.</v>

1732
01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.650
<v Speaker 4>And he references knowing Jesus and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>

1733
01:17:45.651 --> 01:17:47.870
<v Speaker 4>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you knew Christ.</v>

1734
01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:48.511
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1735
01:17:48.511 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he used the n word.</v>

1736
01:17:50.181 --> 01:17:50.720
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

1737
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.800
<v Speaker 4>it's been 12 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nigga,</v>

1738
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:54.860
<v Speaker 4>12 bucks now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't write that line.</v>

1739
01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.650
<v Speaker 4>I wrote dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every piece of it,</v>

1740
01:17:56.651 --> 01:17:57.710
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't write that line.</v>

1741
01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:00.290
<v Speaker 4>I would never put that light in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Rock and be like,</v>

1742
01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:04.910
<v Speaker 4>look what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My line was Nomi owes me 12 bucks.</v>

1743
01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:08.990
<v Speaker 4>Chris was able to dress it up in such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way and I told them,</v>

1744
01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:10.050
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1745
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:11.690
<v Speaker 4>Because I was crying when he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1746
01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 4>that's hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I was bittersweet about it because I</v>

1747
01:18:14.391 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't include it.</v>

1748
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:16.610
<v Speaker 4>And I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1749
01:18:16.611 --> 01:18:17.444
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the funniest thing I think I've </v>

1750
01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:20.210
<v Speaker 4>ever put on film and I can't use in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie because why?</v>

1751
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 4>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't write it.</v>

1752
01:18:22.161 --> 01:18:22.994
<v Speaker 4>How am I supposed to do the credits now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Written by Kevin Smith and one line by </v>

1753
01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:25.940
<v Speaker 4>Chris Rock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1754
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you know how this works?</v>

1755
01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.160
<v Speaker 4>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get credit for it.</v>

1756
01:18:30.161 --> 01:18:31.340
<v Speaker 4>He's going to fit with funny.</v>

1757
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:33.230
<v Speaker 4>Take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need credit for that.</v>

1758
01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:34.820
<v Speaker 4>I say a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1759
01:18:34.821 --> 01:18:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh really?</v>

1760
01:18:35.751 --> 01:18:37.350
<v Speaker 4>And then the next guy I worked with was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1761
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:38.223
<v Speaker 4>that was a will ferrell on Jay and </v>
<v Speaker 4>silent Bob Strike almost an alien idea </v>

1762
01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:47.231
<v Speaker 4>that you would not accept a really funny</v>
<v Speaker 4>addition to had to do the job dude,</v>

1763
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.343
<v Speaker 4>because I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I came through indie film and so I </v>

1764
01:18:50.511 --> 01:18:52.730
<v Speaker 4>didn't come up through the world of </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>

1765
01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I backdoored into the world of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I came up through any film and indie</v>

1766
01:18:56.541 --> 01:18:57.650
<v Speaker 4>film was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey man.</v>

1767
01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh tour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1768
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:01.700
<v Speaker 4>And direct your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your statement and stuff.</v>

1769
01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:03.590
<v Speaker 4>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since nobody taught you,</v>

1770
01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.360
<v Speaker 4>there's nobody to teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This shit is no book.</v>

1771
01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.850
<v Speaker 4>You have your own process where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1772
01:19:07.851 --> 01:19:09.080
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1773
01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:11.510
<v Speaker 4>I guess to be pure it should all be my </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1774
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 4>That way when I see it say written by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Smith,</v>

1775
01:19:13.761 --> 01:19:16.310
<v Speaker 4>it's not a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like I was raised Catholic.</v>

1776
01:19:16.311 --> 01:19:19.700
<v Speaker 4>So for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

1777
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:20.534
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was a virgin until I was </v>

1778
01:19:22.311 --> 01:19:25.280
<v Speaker 4>about 17.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1779
01:19:25.281 --> 01:19:30.281
<v Speaker 4>I lost my virginity at 13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was inside a girl at age 13.</v>

1780
01:19:31.461 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 4>She was also the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not creepy.</v>

1781
01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.350
<v Speaker 4>It's creepy to talk about now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but never.</v>

1782
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.213
<v Speaker 4>I never came.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in Catholic school there's no class </v>

1783
01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 4>where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1784
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:43.910
<v Speaker 4>sex is penetration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't tell you shit,</v>

1785
01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.260
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1786
01:19:45.261 --> 01:19:49.310
<v Speaker 4>well we make rules for yourself and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just buy them as those are the rules.</v>

1787
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:50.780
<v Speaker 4>So for years I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1788
01:19:50.781 --> 01:19:51.221
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1789
01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:54.950
<v Speaker 4>I never came inside a girl so I've not </v>
<v Speaker 4>had sex yet.</v>

1790
01:19:54.951 --> 01:19:57.320
<v Speaker 4>And then when I finally had sex I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1791
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:59.540
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess penetration counts.</v>

1792
01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:00.374
<v Speaker 4>And hence I had sex a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a problem for a minute with my </v>

1793
01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:04.340
<v Speaker 4>current girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

1794
01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:05.360
<v Speaker 4>you said you were a virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1795
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:07.560
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was like,</v>

1796
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 4>you better inside</v>

1797
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.960
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't come.</v>

1798
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the like if you don't come </v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't count.</v>

1799
01:20:12.331 --> 01:20:13.640
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where'd you get that?</v>

1800
01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Super impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime a 13 year old doesn't come,</v>

1801
01:20:17.131 --> 01:20:18.980
<v Speaker 2>should be super impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1802
01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I kind of put out to fear you've got the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic fear of not like,</v>

1803
01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:24.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll have a baby.</v>

1804
01:20:24.901 --> 01:20:27.240
<v Speaker 2>But the very catholic fear of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm sending,</v>

1805
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:28.410
<v Speaker 2>not even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1806
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1807
01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:32.220
<v Speaker 2>she may have to get an abortion than </v>
<v Speaker 2>your Catholics.</v>

1808
01:20:32.221 --> 01:20:33.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think any faith,</v>

1809
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could send,</v>

1810
01:20:35.221 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with Catholicism,</v>

1811
01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:39.050
<v Speaker 2>they had a built in get out of jail free</v>
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>

1812
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Like you can do what you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you come into church,</v>

1813
01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:45.300
<v Speaker 2>you'd tell the strange man your dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>little secrets in a booth with no lights</v>

1814
01:20:45.301 --> 01:20:48.510
<v Speaker 2>and you leave and everything's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be fine with Jesus.</v>

1815
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 2>It made sense all throughout my </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>

1816
01:20:50.401 --> 01:20:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I was a catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1817
01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:52.861
<v Speaker 2>um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1818
01:20:52.861 --> 01:20:55.680
<v Speaker 2>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were we before we got into the.</v>

1819
01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to be anywhere man.</v>

1820
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like,</v>

1821
01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:02.440
<v Speaker 2>we were on a good thread man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about you.</v>

1822
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.760
<v Speaker 2>It is what you think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you build the rules for yourself.</v>

1823
01:21:05.761 --> 01:21:07.510
<v Speaker 2>So I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1824
01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:12.640
<v Speaker 2>if I include Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock's amazing Ad Lib in my movie,</v>

1825
01:21:13.261 --> 01:21:16.920
<v Speaker 2>then I've taken from another writer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hence it can't say written,</v>

1826
01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:21.940
<v Speaker 2>but absolutely in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand why you would think that he</v>

1827
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:23.004
<v Speaker 2>got that out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make sense to me just because </v>

1828
01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.093
<v Speaker 2>I was really lucky in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only real comedy that I did that </v>

1829
01:21:28.771 --> 01:21:30.530
<v Speaker 2>lasted any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1830
01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.411
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1831
01:21:31.411 --> 01:21:34.470
<v Speaker 2>was news radio and it was a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment like that.</v>

1832
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Where this based on you though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1833
01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:36.684
<v Speaker 2>Like Joe Garelli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the character was very loosely based on </v>

1834
01:21:39.511 --> 01:21:40.344
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your stand up and said fucking do that </v>

1835
01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:43.704
<v Speaker 2>on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul was just like really good at </v>

1836
01:21:45.271 --> 01:21:46.104
<v Speaker 2>picking out the goofy shit that you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like exaggerating it because I was </v>

1837
01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:50.964
<v Speaker 2>always into stupid ufo stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it would always be some conspiracy </v>

1838
01:21:54.901 --> 01:21:59.280
<v Speaker 2>theory or some gadget because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>always been a dork when it comes to like</v>

1839
01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:00.143
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by all sorts of gadgets </v>

1840
01:22:02.401 --> 01:22:03.234
<v Speaker 2>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like flashing in moments </v>

1841
01:22:05.881 --> 01:22:06.714
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this and it's just a card and </v>

1842
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.293
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1843
01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:10.483
<v Speaker 2>from the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know which one it was like </v>

1844
01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:16.830
<v Speaker 2>during raise period and stuff is all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>girly moments are washing over me as you</v>

1845
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.450
<v Speaker 2>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably don't even remember him,</v>

1846
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:20.970
<v Speaker 2>but I bet you I no more about that show </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you.</v>

1847
01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:23.270
<v Speaker 2>If you and I went head to head Newsradio</v>
<v Speaker 2>Radio Trivia.</v>

1848
01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.670
<v Speaker 2>I bet you I bet you would to like Andy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick was a perfect sample.</v>

1849
01:22:26.671 --> 01:22:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Andy Dick is a super exaggerated version</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Andy Dick,</v>

1850
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 2>of Andy Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what his character was.</v>

1851
01:22:32.431 --> 01:22:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Matthew when I think it was just a super</v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated version of Eddie Dick,</v>

1852
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:36.623
<v Speaker 2>but like in ways andy almost sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>at his craziest was like more of an </v>

1853
01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:42.480
<v Speaker 2>exaggeration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a totally different way.</v>

1854
01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:44.760
<v Speaker 2>He was partying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting crazy,</v>

1855
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:45.983
<v Speaker 2>but that the silliness of that character</v>
<v Speaker 2>was really handy tech and really it </v>

1856
01:22:49.341 --> 01:22:53.330
<v Speaker 2>wasn't him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that because I'm.</v>

1857
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:54.683
<v Speaker 2>Matthew takes off like he's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he becomes the matthew that he is </v>

1858
01:22:59.221 --> 01:23:02.310
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About six episodes,</v>

1859
01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:06.310
<v Speaker 2>four to six episodes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see him start</v>

1860
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:09.120
<v Speaker 3>to become the matthew that you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

1861
01:23:09.121 --> 01:23:10.690
<v Speaker 3>when you think of news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1862
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Matthew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1863
01:23:12.011 --> 01:23:13.660
<v Speaker 3>so it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with you.</v>

1864
01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 3>Well you weren't even the first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1865
01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a different guy.</v>

1866
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:18.750
<v Speaker 3>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ray Romano,</v>

1867
01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.220
<v Speaker 3>was he the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ray Romano,</v>

1868
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:22.810
<v Speaker 3>who was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1869
01:23:22.811 --> 01:23:25.690
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy before me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what happened.</v>

1870
01:23:25.691 --> 01:23:26.524
<v Speaker 3>Ray Romano was casting it originally and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I guess while they were shooting </v>

1871
01:23:30.101 --> 01:23:30.934
<v Speaker 3>the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decided to go a different </v>

1872
01:23:32.081 --> 01:23:33.940
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that means.</v>

1873
01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:37.750
<v Speaker 3>So they brought in another guy and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy did it and then after the pilot they</v>

1874
01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:38.584
<v Speaker 3>said we want to replace that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then they had this open casting </v>

1875
01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:43.360
<v Speaker 3>call thing and then I got involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1876
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:45.130
<v Speaker 3>And what had you been doing at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>point?</v>

1877
01:23:45.131 --> 01:23:45.964
<v Speaker 3>Stand up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about moving back to New </v>

1878
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:48.063
<v Speaker 3>York and thinking I should've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have got a fucking apartment </v>

1879
01:23:49.361 --> 01:23:49.900
<v Speaker 3>in la.</v>

1880
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:50.733
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I came out here for a show </v>

1881
01:23:53.861 --> 01:23:56.230
<v Speaker 3>called hardball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a show by this guy.</v>

1882
01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.133
<v Speaker 3>I'm Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these two guys who wrote for married </v>

1883
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:01.534
<v Speaker 3>with children and they also wrote for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they role for the simpsons and </v>

1884
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:08.650
<v Speaker 3>they wrote for a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were really funny guys.</v>

1885
01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.133
<v Speaker 3>They came up with a great pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and Jim Brewer and a bunch of other </v>

1886
01:24:13.331 --> 01:24:18.260
<v Speaker 3>great guys were in it and then Fox got </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahold of it and just sort of fist it and</v>

1887
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.370
<v Speaker 3>just came in it's eyeballs and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>twisted it all around,</v>

1888
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:26.320
<v Speaker 3>a really hacky it just a really hacky </v>
<v Speaker 3>version,</v>

1889
01:24:26.321 --> 01:24:28.540
<v Speaker 3>what it once was and then eventually got</v>
<v Speaker 3>canceled.</v>

1890
01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 3>So I thought being a young dumb guy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1891
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:32.981
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1892
01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:34.780
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this show is definitely gonna be a hit.</v>

1893
01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:35.890
<v Speaker 3>I should get an apartment.</v>

1894
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to live out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might as well got a year lease,</v>

1895
01:24:38.021 --> 01:24:39.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's going great.</v>

1896
01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 3>And then all the sudden the show gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>canceled.</v>

1897
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:42.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing out here?</v>

1898
01:24:42.171 --> 01:24:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't have any friends out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody.</v>

1899
01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.050
<v Speaker 3>My friends were all back home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1900
01:24:47.051 --> 01:24:49.690
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just moved back to New York and then</v>

1901
01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:51.123
<v Speaker 3>I got a development deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like NBC got in touch with my </v>

1902
01:24:54.581 --> 01:24:55.414
<v Speaker 3>management and they asked me if I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do my own show or if I wanted to do </v>

1903
01:24:59.981 --> 01:25:02.440
<v Speaker 3>this show that they have already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1904
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:06.700
<v Speaker 3>this show called news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got to watch the pilot before,</v>

1905
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what it was before anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever saw it.</v>

1906
01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:10.084
<v Speaker 3>I got a vhs tape of the pilot before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever aired on TV and so I got to watch </v>

1907
01:25:14.231 --> 01:25:16.510
<v Speaker 3>that and then I auditioned for it.</v>

1908
01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:17.523
<v Speaker 3>So it was a big advantage and that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of understood like the style </v>

1909
01:25:21.431 --> 01:25:22.264
<v Speaker 3>rhythm of the show that they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was really interesting was what </v>

1910
01:25:24.431 --> 01:25:25.940
<v Speaker 3>he did was the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1911
01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:29.290
<v Speaker 3>the first audition wasn't funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>

1912
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.880
<v Speaker 3>It was just a scene and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is weird.</v>

1913
01:25:31.881 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the pilot was really funny,</v>

1914
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:34.264
<v Speaker 3>but this seems like they did it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose to see if people would ham it </v>

1915
01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:37.804
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they did just didn't want anybody </v>

1916
01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.153
<v Speaker 3>wasn't playing it real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they weeded people out by making </v>

1917
01:25:43.091 --> 01:25:45.850
<v Speaker 3>something that wasn't really that funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking crazy.</v>

1918
01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:49.510
<v Speaker 3>And then the second time I come back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hilarious.</v>

1919
01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:52.480
<v Speaker 3>The second time the banter is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

1920
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:53.800
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1921
01:25:53.801 --> 01:25:56.680
<v Speaker 3>these clever pitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I see what they did,</v>

1922
01:25:56.710 --> 01:25:57.543
<v Speaker 3>they just whittled it down for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who down to people who could play it </v>

1923
01:26:00.101 --> 01:26:01.690
<v Speaker 3>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1924
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not insidious in</v>

1925
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.530
<v Speaker 4>a negative way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's ingenious.</v>

1926
01:26:06.531 --> 01:26:10.040
<v Speaker 4>Maybe is the word I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So instead of insidious that's like,</v>

1927
01:26:10.041 --> 01:26:12.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm just like,</v>

1928
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:13.583
<v Speaker 4>we cast clerks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still kept the same weight when we </v>

1929
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:19.580
<v Speaker 4>cast clerks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a first avenue playhouse,</v>

1930
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.250
<v Speaker 4>was a little theater dinner theater in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Atlantic Highlands,</v>

1931
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:23.323
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we put an ad out like I think in </v>

1932
01:26:25.761 --> 01:26:26.594
<v Speaker 4>the free paper and I hung up ads any </v>
<v Speaker 4>place where like college kids </v>

1933
01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:32.750
<v Speaker 4>congregated and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mom with college at the time,</v>

1934
01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:33.584
<v Speaker 4>now it's a mum with university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have this open casting call and </v>

1935
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we were,</v>

1936
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:39.763
<v Speaker 4>as people are coming through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing people do things that like </v>

1937
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:47.450
<v Speaker 4>we're blowing us out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no experience.</v>

1938
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:48.523
<v Speaker 4>Maryland Gagliardi the girl that plays </v>
<v Speaker 4>Veronica and the movie she got cast </v>

1939
01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:52.304
<v Speaker 4>because she like cried during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>audition and I remember like looking at </v>

1940
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:57.140
<v Speaker 4>my friend's going like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who could do this?</v>

1941
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:58.183
<v Speaker 4>Who could just like cry like this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>none of them audition with comedy like </v>

1942
01:27:01.821 --> 01:27:04.430
<v Speaker 4>Bryan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio and underplayed Dante audition with</v>

1943
01:27:04.431 --> 01:27:07.100
<v Speaker 4>a piece from like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be afraid of the dark at.</v>

1944
01:27:07.101 --> 01:27:09.830
<v Speaker 4>No not there'll be afraid of the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck yeah.</v>

1945
01:27:09.831 --> 01:27:14.150
<v Speaker 4>Maybe don't be one more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alan Arkin is like a stocking.</v>

1946
01:27:14.151 --> 01:27:14.984
<v Speaker 4>Audrey Hepburn and she's blind and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like robbing the place alone in the </v>

1947
01:27:18.141 --> 01:27:18.974
<v Speaker 4>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this will go,</v>

1948
01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 4>but it's a real like killer monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing like his character.</v>

1949
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 4>So we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's fucking.</v>

1950
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 4>We can act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he could act like that,</v>

1951
01:27:26.091 --> 01:27:28.850
<v Speaker 4>he can fucking say I'm not even supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be here today.</v>

1952
01:27:28.851 --> 01:27:30.650
<v Speaker 4>And stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1953
01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I could see that was my process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just I'm blown away.</v>

1954
01:27:33.711 --> 01:27:36.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm easily impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like so people come through.</v>

1955
01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:38.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cried like,</v>

1956
01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:39.250
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

1958
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.923

1959
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:46.220
<v Speaker 4>something is real when it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no doubt,</v>

1960
01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:46.940
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

1961
01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:48.830
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the ability.</v>

1962
01:27:48.831 --> 01:27:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Men is not a part of the problems and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>

1963
01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:54.590
<v Speaker 4>You have to be a little fucking cuckoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Genesis Rodriguez,</v>

1964
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:57.400
<v Speaker 4>who was an actress in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>

1965
01:27:57.401 --> 01:27:58.190
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1966
01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:01.120
<v Speaker 4>she came from Telanovela.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she,</v>

1967
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:03.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Spanish Tele Novella.</v>

1968
01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:05.480
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1969
01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.433
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>crying and I was like,</v>

01:28:08.721 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 4>that was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1972
01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.570
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1973
01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:14.720
<v Speaker 4>it's like you orchestrated a tear for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right line.</v>

1974
01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:16.520
<v Speaker 4>It just rolled and hit at the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1975
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:17.930
<v Speaker 4>And she's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1976
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.793
<v Speaker 4>she's going on Tele.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to know how to cry like </v>

1977
01:28:20.871 --> 01:28:22.250
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every episode,</v>

1978
01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:25.460
<v Speaker 4>somebody crying and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she also described the process.</v>

1979
01:28:25.461 --> 01:28:26.294
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1980
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:27.530
<v Speaker 4>well first she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1981
01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:29.770
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just give me a sec,</v>

1982
01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:30.604
<v Speaker 4>say something funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so Jason Muse was there and Jason </v>

1983
01:28:32.941 --> 01:28:33.774
<v Speaker 4>who started telling him it was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>funny story and she just starts bawling </v>

1984
01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 4>and laughing while she's balling but </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally looks like she's crying.</v>

1985
01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.770
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucked up and shit.</v>

1986
01:28:42.771 --> 01:28:43.604
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to do that on Telanovela while </v>

1987
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:50.990
<v Speaker 4>somebody is on an in an earwig in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>ear reading you the dialogue,</v>

1988
01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:53.480
<v Speaker 4>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get scripts,</v>

1989
01:28:53.481 --> 01:28:54.800
<v Speaker 4>this thick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thick is a dick.</v>

1990
01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.850
<v Speaker 4>So they can't learn all that dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they shoot like 20,</v>

1991
01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 4>30 pages a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they stick in their ears,</v>

1992
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.580
<v Speaker 6>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little a receiver</v>

1993
01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:07.360
<v Speaker 4>and essentially the directors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>control room and you know,</v>

1994
01:29:07.361 --> 01:29:09.250
<v Speaker 4>they should have like a soap opera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's multiple cameras,</v>

1995
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:13.960
<v Speaker 4>but they are giving them the lines and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they are saying it's simultaneously.</v>

1996
01:29:13.961 --> 01:29:16.240
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you fucking do that as your brain</v>

1997
01:29:16.241 --> 01:29:17.590
<v Speaker 4>work like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

1998
01:29:17.591 --> 01:29:20.170
<v Speaker 4>say anything to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give me a nice long sentence.</v>

1999
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:21.423
<v Speaker 4>And so I went for the sentence in </v>
<v Speaker 4>English language has all the letters in </v>

2000
01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:24.224
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the quick Brown Fox jumps over the lazy </v>

2001
01:29:25.901 --> 01:29:28.540
<v Speaker 4>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as I got to quick,</v>

2002
01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:30.220
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

2003
01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.150
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2004
01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:36.180
<v Speaker 4>she started following me and finished at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the exact same time like it was,</v>

2005
01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty fucking impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't seem crazy by stretching the</v>

2006
01:29:42.011 --> 01:29:42.940
<v Speaker 4>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked her,</v>

2007
01:29:42.941 --> 01:29:44.050
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can you fucking do that?</v>

2008
01:29:44.051 --> 01:29:44.980
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2009
01:29:44.981 --> 01:29:46.300
<v Speaker 4>It's just a family thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

2010
01:29:46.301 --> 01:29:48.340
<v Speaker 4>my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said her dad,</v>

2011
01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:49.900
<v Speaker 4>her dad's a big performer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>singer.</v>

2012
01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.260
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my dad can make his hair stand up on his</v>

2013
01:29:53.261 --> 01:29:56.200
<v Speaker 4>arm and get goose bumps just by looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>

2014
01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2015
01:29:57.461 --> 01:29:57.851
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

2016
01:29:57.851 --> 01:29:58.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a,</v>

2017
01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.880
<v Speaker 4>what a weird super power to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>

2018
01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:01.923
<v Speaker 4>cool,</v>

2019
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.903
<v Speaker 6>well there are definitely things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>weird things like that where people </v>

2020
01:30:05.641 --> 01:30:09.240
<v Speaker 6>inherit them from their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like ice data girl who couldn't even see</v>

2021
01:30:09.241 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 6>a needle in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She would faint,</v>

2022
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.030
<v Speaker 6>like if she saw someone getting a shot </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the movie,</v>

2023
01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:16.880
<v Speaker 6>she was squeamish,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she was like woof.</v>

2024
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:20.580
<v Speaker 6>And Her dad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who I believe was a dentist.</v>

2025
01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:22.800
<v Speaker 6>So like you would think the guy saw a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of needles.</v>

2026
01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.430
<v Speaker 6>That guy will do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he,</v>

2027
01:30:26.431 --> 01:30:28.770
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if he saw something bad he would faint.</v>

2028
01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:29.973
<v Speaker 4>So even though he normally saw neil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he probably stuck needles into guns and </v>

2029
01:30:32.351 --> 01:30:35.020
<v Speaker 4>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In his job he was a dentist.</v>

2030
01:30:35.190 --> 01:30:36.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2031
01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:39.070
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing shit.</v>

2032
01:30:39.071 --> 01:30:41.060
<v Speaker 4>And then watching trauma until she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling</v>

2033
01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:42.880
<v Speaker 6>me that are her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2034
01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:45.730
<v Speaker 6>her brother had like a real severe </v>
<v Speaker 6>sunburn.</v>

2035
01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.170
<v Speaker 6>The point where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blisters,</v>

2036
01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:47.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2037
01:30:47.650 --> 01:30:48.483
<v Speaker 6>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

2038
01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:51.700
<v Speaker 6>you really fuck this up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He saw it and he fainted.</v>

2039
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.680
<v Speaker 6>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell?</v>

2040
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.390
<v Speaker 6>Like he couldn't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just,</v>

2041
01:30:55.391 --> 01:30:56.170
<v Speaker 6>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2042
01:30:56.170 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you love your buddy if you don't like,</v>

2043
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.000
<v Speaker 6>you react like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2044
01:31:01.001 --> 01:31:02.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sunburned.</v>

2045
01:31:02.210 --> 01:31:04.720
<v Speaker 6>It's been so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's his fault.</v>

2046
01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.340
<v Speaker 6>So what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's selection.</v>

2047
01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's something in the system.</v>

2048
01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.960
<v Speaker 6>If something bizarre in the system,</v>

2049
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:11.903
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>act when people tell stories when </v>

2050
01:31:13.061 --> 01:31:13.930
<v Speaker 4>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2051
01:31:13.931 --> 01:31:17.370
<v Speaker 4>and then fucking tour this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that and shit.</v>

2052
01:31:17.410 --> 01:31:20.980
<v Speaker 4>The idea of I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm low tolerance for threshold for pain</v>

2053
01:31:20.981 --> 01:31:21.814
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I like hearing people tell stories </v>

2054
01:31:23.201 --> 01:31:24.034
<v Speaker 4>about injuries.</v>

2055
01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.131
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2056
01:31:25.131 --> 01:31:27.000
<v Speaker 6>I react.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2057
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:28.220
<v Speaker 6>well everybody does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2058
01:31:28.221 --> 01:31:30.800
<v Speaker 6>Like you watched those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I watched some poor guy,</v>

2059
01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.650
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who let this fucking guy do this.</v>

2060
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:34.603
<v Speaker 6>This guy who was like ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 6>overweight and they set up a skateboard </v>

2061
01:31:38.841 --> 01:31:41.690
<v Speaker 6>up on a ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like balancing it on this.</v>

2062
01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:45.020
<v Speaker 6>They just see that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

2063
01:31:45.021 --> 01:31:46.910
<v Speaker 6>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's awful.</v>

2064
01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:51.110
<v Speaker 6>But when you watch someone like that </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you know they're going to get hurt</v>

2065
01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.390
<v Speaker 6>and then when they get it get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really bad.</v>

2066
01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:56.150
<v Speaker 6>You know that feeling that you get like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a sharpness,</v>

2067
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:57.223
<v Speaker 6>like almost like a sharpness and </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourselves where your whole body is </v>

2068
01:31:59.771 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck</v>

2069
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes at great heights,</v>

2070
01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I look inside of a building,</v>

2071
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:05.224
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

2072
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:07.690
<v Speaker 2>that runs right through you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like move back.</v>

2073
01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the adrenaline becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>like stalagmites coming off of a fucking</v>

2074
01:32:12.011 --> 01:32:12.844
<v Speaker 2>ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just they say that that is built and </v>

2075
01:32:14.441 --> 01:32:15.274
<v Speaker 2>even babies have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a test with babies that a long </v>

2076
01:32:18.011 --> 01:32:18.844
<v Speaker 2>table like this and then in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>here instead of it being would that </v>

2077
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 2>plexi glass and it was clear so that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother went under the table and the baby</v>

2078
01:32:27.071 --> 01:32:28.960
<v Speaker 2>at the other and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on and the baby would crawl,</v>

2079
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:31.930
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as the baby got to the clear</v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

2080
01:32:31.931 --> 01:32:36.010
<v Speaker 2>which is still a table right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went back and would not go forward.</v>

2081
01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's built into us for some reason.</v>

2082
01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone posted,</v>

2083
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:44.350
<v Speaker 2>someone posted it shows is that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

2084
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.333
<v Speaker 2>but somebody posted a picture today from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a playground in the 19 twenties and I </v>

2085
01:32:53.321 --> 01:32:56.500
<v Speaker 2>don't know if it's real because I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably shouldn't be talking about it,</v>

2086
01:32:56.501 --> 01:32:57.334
<v Speaker 2>but if it is real like Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these bars were like 50 feet off the </v>

2087
01:33:00.881 --> 01:33:01.510
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

2088
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 2>These kids are just climbing ladders and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2089
01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 2>These metal ladders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>

2090
01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:08.850
<v Speaker 2>The way the setup look like today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a chance in hell.</v>

2091
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:12.490
<v Speaker 2>You let your kids play on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would freak the fuck out.</v>

2092
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Like look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this God damn thing.</v>

2093
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:16.743
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many kids got hurt before they were </v>

2094
01:33:18.101 --> 01:33:20.750
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should died every day.</v>

2095
01:33:20.770 --> 01:33:22.660
<v Speaker 2>We should bring it in and they'll look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that height.</v>

2096
01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.513
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dead because even if it's all </v>

2097
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:28.060
<v Speaker 2>sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still hitting something hard.</v>

2098
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 2>They didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want you to live.</v>

2099
01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Look at the all riding bikes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were no cars.</v>

2100
01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:35.340
<v Speaker 2>So yours is early 1980 [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>callback.</v>

2101
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Is that a body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a one falling from the sky?</v>

2102
01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:38.860
<v Speaker 2>That's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

2103
01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Or the hanging from something as a swing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that swing that swinging off the fucking</v>

2104
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:44.680
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

2105
01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.850
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a body though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

2106
01:33:45.851 --> 01:33:46.684
<v Speaker 2>If you don't look at the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lines are like those falling marks </v>

2107
01:33:49.121 --> 01:33:49.954
<v Speaker 2>at a cartoon because it's hanging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging off a fucking kids are playing </v>

2108
01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.420
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy picture though,</v>

2109
01:33:55.421 --> 01:33:57.460
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2110
01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things were a lot more dangerous and art</v>

2111
01:33:59.621 --> 01:34:01.360
<v Speaker 2>and that's even before our day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2112
01:34:01.361 --> 01:34:03.190
<v Speaker 2>that's before our different back east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2113
01:34:03.191 --> 01:34:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Action Park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2114
01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I was just going to say I broke my arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>on one of those things.</v>

2115
01:34:07.581 --> 01:34:08.351
<v Speaker 2>Did you really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2116
01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:10.930
<v Speaker 2>When I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell off the monkey bars,</v>

2117
01:34:10.931 --> 01:34:14.410
<v Speaker 2>snapped my arm and posted on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snapped it.</v>

2118
01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:16.990
<v Speaker 2>And so you got your first cast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At what age?</v>

2119
01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:19.460
<v Speaker 2>I think I was six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have people sign it?</v>

2120
01:34:19.461 --> 01:34:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a lot of friends?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe I had people sign it many.</v>

2121
01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Was it like there's no room.</v>

2122
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

2123
01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Or was it a lot of like love you mom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

2124
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2125
01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:30.723
<v Speaker 2>Mostly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those things are fucking dangerous </v>

2126
01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:36.880
<v Speaker 2>shit on the bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In New Jersey there's a theme.</v>

2127
01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Park is closed now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all grown up,</v>

2128
01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:41.020
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd go there.</v>

2129
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:46.470
<v Speaker 2>They would do shit like a water slide </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people got fucking hurt on.</v>

2130
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:50.110
<v Speaker 2>They would do these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was before insurance,</v>

2131
01:34:50.111 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2132
01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:54.230
<v Speaker 2>they had a wave pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2133
01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:55.113
<v Speaker 2>so a wave pool is big pool and then like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got these giant beaters in the </v>

2134
01:34:59.211 --> 01:35:00.044
<v Speaker 2>underwater at the end that are huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just constantly make fucking waves </v>

2135
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 2>and people would get crushed under them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get killed.</v>

2136
01:35:07.671 --> 01:35:11.810
<v Speaker 2>They had this like slalom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race a thing,</v>

2137
01:35:11.811 --> 01:35:15.020
<v Speaker 2>whereas you kind of sitting on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>cement track,</v>

2138
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:18.320
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey's action park offered fun and</v>

2139
01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 2>injury for the whole family.</v>

2140
01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a waterslide.</v>

2141
01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:23.503
<v Speaker 2>Look at that water slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were completely in a bluetube that </v>

2142
01:35:26.361 --> 01:35:27.194
<v Speaker 2>went down a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did a a loop in the dark where a lot </v>

2143
01:35:30.651 --> 01:35:33.110
<v Speaker 2>of people were getting hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they didn't make the full loop.</v>

2144
01:35:33.111 --> 01:35:35.750
<v Speaker 2>They just got jammed and then people </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clyde into you bang,</v>

2145
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back injuries.</v>

2146
01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Couple dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2147
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 2>A couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was.</v>

2148
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:42.530
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we were kids,</v>

2149
01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't want to get hurt,</v>

2150
01:35:43.731 --> 01:35:46.580
<v Speaker 2>but like nobody told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get hurt that badly.</v>

2151
01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Some things were sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was a child.</v>

2152
01:35:48.381 --> 01:35:50.240
<v Speaker 2>If I saw monkey bars that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

2153
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even go near the fucking monkey</v>

2154
01:35:52.731 --> 01:35:54.430
<v Speaker 2>bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I saw them that high,</v>

2155
01:35:54.431 --> 01:35:56.270
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is ridiculous.</v>

2156
01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Like this is clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly we're being filmed or something.</v>

2157
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2158
01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:01.673
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

2159
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:04.280
<v Speaker 2>This was built by somebody who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know the child,</v>

2160
01:36:04.281 --> 01:36:05.114
<v Speaker 2>looks like or hates them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricked him into going high so they can </v>

2161
01:36:08.691 --> 01:36:11.630
<v Speaker 2>fall and die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more blood I get,</v>

2162
01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:12.890
<v Speaker 2>young child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood to Bay,</v>

2163
01:36:12.891 --> 01:36:13.724
<v Speaker 2>then the younger one could look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They subscribed to the theory of what's </v>

2164
01:36:16.341 --> 01:36:17.174
<v Speaker 2>her fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was a real concern back then </v>

2165
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:19.754
<v Speaker 2>about mouths to feed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're talking about the </v>

2166
01:36:20.871 --> 01:36:21.704
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think they built the playgrounds </v>

2167
01:36:23.031 --> 01:36:25.180
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So out the week real.</v>

2168
01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:28.490
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then you have to agree that we live</v>

2169
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:32.540
<v Speaker 2>in a better time because nobody ran on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that platform and the election of like,</v>

2170
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:35.180
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only the strong survive.</v>

2171
01:36:35.181 --> 01:36:37.130
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your kid goes to the playground,</v>

2172
01:36:37.131 --> 01:36:39.530
<v Speaker 2>falls off the monkey bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's on you.</v>

2173
01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2174
01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 2>we certainly are more protective of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>children today and we'll just understand</v>

2175
01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:49.660
<v Speaker 2>child rearing and understand mortality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we understand like the,</v>

2176
01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.240
<v Speaker 2>the bad things that you can do to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid while you're developing them.</v>

2177
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.073
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird catch 22 and you'll </v>

2178
01:36:56.091 --> 01:36:57.860
<v Speaker 2>probably agree with me as a parent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>my kids,</v>

2179
01:36:57.861 --> 01:36:59.600
<v Speaker 2>you got three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know more than me.</v>

2180
01:36:59.601 --> 01:37:00.434
<v Speaker 2>I got one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but go ahead.</v>

2181
01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.313
<v Speaker 2>But I was just gonna say is like there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a weird catch 22 in that you want to </v>

2182
01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:06.374
<v Speaker 2>give them all the love in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to support them as much as you </v>

2183
01:37:09.441 --> 01:37:10.274
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be there 100 percent for </v>

2184
01:37:12.141 --> 01:37:14.810
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also realize that everyone,</v>

2185
01:37:14.811 --> 01:37:16.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting,</v>

2186
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:17.833
<v Speaker 2>had to overcome some bizarre childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome some crazy for all my favorite </v>

2187
01:37:22.941 --> 01:37:23.774
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all my favorite people tell me </v>

2188
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:30.850
<v Speaker 2>terror stories about like growing up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what their parents or what their dad did</v>

2189
01:37:31.341 --> 01:37:32.510
<v Speaker 2>or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2190
01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.050
<v Speaker 2>So many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the comedians that I know,</v>

2191
01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:38.450
<v Speaker 2>it was all just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

2192
01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:41.510
<v Speaker 2>And then what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck dude.</v>

2193
01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:42.553
<v Speaker 2>And they're the funniest fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the most interesting kids that </v>

2194
01:37:45.921 --> 01:37:47.660
<v Speaker 2>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2195
01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:48.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I look,</v>

2196
01:37:48.951 --> 01:37:49.784
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a helicopter parent and I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy that paves the way for his </v>

2197
01:37:52.341 --> 01:37:53.690
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants to act.</v>

2198
01:37:53.691 --> 01:37:54.021
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2199
01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:55.500
<v Speaker 2>let's make a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really,</v>

2200
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not</v>

2201
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 6>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know what,</v>

2202
01:37:57.301 --> 01:37:58.830
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the only thing that's wrong with that,</v>

2203
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.240
<v Speaker 6>this is the only thing that's wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2204
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.133
<v Speaker 6>and this is where we have a problem of </v>
<v Speaker 6>human beings is the only thing that's </v>

2205
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:05.214
<v Speaker 6>wrong with that is the idea that she's </v>
<v Speaker 6>not going to have to start making a </v>

2206
01:38:09.121 --> 01:38:09.954
<v Speaker 6>living on her own.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's going to be able to carry forth </v>

2207
01:38:12.721 --> 01:38:16.350
<v Speaker 6>under her dad's momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the only reason why that's a problem</v>

2208
01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:17.184
<v Speaker 6>even remotely has because we have this </v>
<v Speaker 6>absurd idea that it should be super </v>

2209
01:38:21.331 --> 01:38:23.490
<v Speaker 6>important for you to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>

2210
01:38:23.670 --> 01:38:27.930
<v Speaker 6>That it should be super important for </v>
<v Speaker 6>you to financially carry yourself.</v>

2211
01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:29.400
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I explain,</v>

2212
01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:30.243
<v Speaker 6>explain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been fucking with this idea more </v>

2213
01:38:32.131 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 6>and more lately.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I fuck with it.</v>

2214
01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:35.124
<v Speaker 6>Is this my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my buddy Eddie Wong who's a chef and a </v>

2215
01:38:38.461 --> 01:38:42.610
<v Speaker 6>really fucking interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cool guy was on a podcast and uh,</v>

2216
01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:46.530
<v Speaker 6>Eddie was talking about universal basic </v>
<v Speaker 6>income.</v>

2217
01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 6>And at first I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why you're going to,</v>

2218
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:52.590
<v Speaker 6>you're going to give people free money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2219
01:38:52.591 --> 01:38:54.180
<v Speaker 6>That's so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

2220
01:38:54.181 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then the more I thought about it,</v>

2221
01:38:57.151 --> 01:38:57.841
<v Speaker 6>the more I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2222
01:38:57.841 --> 01:39:00.390
<v Speaker 6>it seems like when you give people </v>
<v Speaker 6>money,</v>

2223
01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:02.940
<v Speaker 6>like it kills their motivation for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 6>of folks,</v>

2224
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.880
<v Speaker 6>but what if that's just like your needs </v>
<v Speaker 6>are covered?</v>

2225
01:39:05.890 --> 01:39:06.723
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that really true that if you give </v>

2226
01:39:08.431 --> 01:39:11.070
<v Speaker 6>people something and you give them </v>
<v Speaker 6>security,</v>

2227
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.280
<v Speaker 6>that it takes away their creativity?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or is this just.</v>

2228
01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:17.460
<v Speaker 6>I mean the only we don't know because </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody's always been in need.</v>

2229
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:20.220
<v Speaker 6>They overcame that need and then they </v>
<v Speaker 6>became successful.</v>

2230
01:39:20.221 --> 01:39:21.054
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's the story that we hear over </v>

2231
01:39:21.571 --> 01:39:22.770
<v Speaker 6>and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what if.</v>

2232
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:25.560
<v Speaker 6>What if all your needs were taken care </v>
<v Speaker 6>of?</v>

2233
01:39:25.561 --> 01:39:26.640
<v Speaker 6>Like food,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shelter,</v>

2234
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:29.940
<v Speaker 6>like you have basic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know you're not going to get rich,</v>

2235
01:39:30.090 --> 01:39:32.640
<v Speaker 6>but you have enough to eat and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>always have a roof over your head,</v>

2236
01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.970
<v Speaker 6>which is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't we all like each other more?</v>

2237
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 6>If that was the case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we didn't have to worry,</v>

2238
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:41.970
<v Speaker 6>if nobody had to worry about how much </v>
<v Speaker 6>money they had.</v>

2239
01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:43.830
<v Speaker 6>Nobody had to worry about not being able</v>
<v Speaker 6>to eat.</v>

2240
01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.440
<v Speaker 6>Nobody worried about not having a place </v>
<v Speaker 6>to sleep.</v>

2241
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:47.603
<v Speaker 6>That sounds Utopian right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's almost doable financially if </v>

2242
01:39:51.901 --> 01:39:52.734
<v Speaker 6>you look at the amount of money we have </v>
<v Speaker 6>versus the amount of people we have </v>

2243
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:57.840
<v Speaker 6>versus how much money people make.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2244
01:39:58.230 --> 01:39:59.910
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of close.</v>

2245
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:02.040
<v Speaker 6>Like we would have to restructure a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>of shit,</v>

2246
01:40:02.041 --> 01:40:06.090
<v Speaker 6>but it seems like they might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 6>give every person $12,000</v>

2247
01:40:06.091 --> 01:40:07.560
<v Speaker 6>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

2248
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:13.700
<v Speaker 6>And I think if we could figure out some </v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of a way to do things like that,</v>

2249
01:40:15.090 --> 01:40:15.923
<v Speaker 6>I think we would have a giant </v>
<v Speaker 6>alleviation of tension and struggle at </v>

2250
01:40:20.221 --> 01:40:24.400
<v Speaker 6>its base level survival shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like to elevate us as a,</v>

2251
01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:27.210
<v Speaker 6>as a people just above the survival </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2252
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:31.440
<v Speaker 6>So then we can relax more and get better</v>
<v Speaker 6>at all this other shit.</v>

2253
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.810
<v Speaker 6>But we got to get past the survival </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2254
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:37.320
<v Speaker 6>And the base of the survival is what bay</v>
<v Speaker 6>basic food,</v>

2255
01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.030
<v Speaker 6>basic shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2256
01:40:39.031 --> 01:40:39.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>having,</v>

2257
01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:41.820
<v Speaker 6>having a roof over your head and having </v>
<v Speaker 6>food.</v>

2258
01:40:42.010 --> 01:40:42.843
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you could just guarantee that if we </v>

2259
01:40:43.861 --> 01:40:46.290
<v Speaker 6>could all collectively say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's figure out,</v>

2260
01:40:46.410 --> 01:40:48.390
<v Speaker 6>let's pile all this fucking money </v>
<v Speaker 6>together,</v>

2261
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:51.330
<v Speaker 6>let's figure out how we can make this </v>
<v Speaker 6>better.</v>

2262
01:40:51.331 --> 01:40:52.164
<v Speaker 6>What's number one with God?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We gotta figure out a way to make it </v>

2263
01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:58.540
<v Speaker 6>easier to figure out what the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to do with your life.</v>

2264
01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:59.683
<v Speaker 6>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You shouldn't have to just dive into </v>

2265
01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.860
<v Speaker 6>some job and be desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2266
01:41:02.861 --> 01:41:04.180
<v Speaker 6>we were talking today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie,</v>

2267
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:05.103
<v Speaker 6>about people that we know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that may be wanting to do something </v>

2268
01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:09.394
<v Speaker 6>else,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they played it safe and now they're </v>

2269
01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:11.644
<v Speaker 6>kind of stuck in this weird place where </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can't get out of playing it safe </v>

2270
01:41:14.051 --> 01:41:16.210
<v Speaker 6>because they have bills and they get </v>
<v Speaker 6>trapped.</v>

2271
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:21.430
<v Speaker 6>I feel like if we had some sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 6>universal basic income,</v>

2272
01:41:21.431 --> 01:41:22.264
<v Speaker 6>it's totally possible that way less </v>
<v Speaker 6>people would do that and then more </v>

2273
01:41:25.931 --> 01:41:30.070
<v Speaker 6>people would try to make independent </v>
<v Speaker 6>films or more people would try to become</v>

2274
01:41:30.071 --> 01:41:30.904
<v Speaker 6>standup comics or more people would try </v>
<v Speaker 6>to write books or more people would try </v>

2275
01:41:33.521 --> 01:41:36.670
<v Speaker 6>to build cars or do whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're compelled to do.</v>

2276
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.900
<v Speaker 6>How did you do it without getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>$12,000?</v>

2277
01:41:39.901 --> 01:41:42.370
<v Speaker 6>$3 a year?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got lucky.</v>

2278
01:41:42.371 --> 01:41:47.371
<v Speaker 6>I worked while you wait for it to show </v>
<v Speaker 6>up at your door.</v>

2279
01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.870
<v Speaker 6>You actually went out into the world and</v>
<v Speaker 6>had to.</v>

2280
01:41:50.290 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 6>You had to move some elements around in </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality to make a new reality.</v>

2281
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:56.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess man,</v>

2282
01:41:57.030 --> 01:42:00.130
<v Speaker 6>but I mean I honestly didn't have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>of ourselves and exceptional.</v>

2283
01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.990
<v Speaker 6>I consider yourself an exceptional human</v>
<v Speaker 6>being.</v>

2284
01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:02.824
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what you consider yourself an </v>

2285
01:42:03.731 --> 01:42:04.630
<v Speaker 6>exceptional human being.</v>

2286
01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:08.750
<v Speaker 6>Then I knew I was good at taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was about until had a skill.</v>

2287
01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.250
<v Speaker 6>I was good at one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I knew I was good at one thing.</v>

2288
01:42:12.370 --> 01:42:13.200
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God dammit.</v>

2289
01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.460
<v Speaker 6>If I can get good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's totally possible.</v>

2290
01:42:15.610 --> 01:42:17.580
<v Speaker 6>I can get good at life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>SMART,</v>

2291
01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.513
<v Speaker 6>smart way to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at the very least you're a hired </v>

2292
01:42:20.141 --> 01:42:20.974
<v Speaker 6>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Definitely taking care of people's </v>

2293
01:42:23.111 --> 01:42:25.200
<v Speaker 6>problems with your bare fists and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2294
01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:26.053
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't really taking care of any </v>

2295
01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:30.670
<v Speaker 6>competing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you had to society clubs,</v>

2296
01:42:30.690 --> 01:42:33.100
<v Speaker 6>they'd have any competitions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd already realized that I could get my</v>

2297
01:42:33.101 --> 01:42:36.820
<v Speaker 6>ass kicked too easy by wrestler or by a </v>
<v Speaker 6>a good boxer.</v>

2298
01:42:36.821 --> 01:42:39.790
<v Speaker 6>I was having problems already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So inspiring problems.</v>

2299
01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.200
<v Speaker 6>But you have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you built,</v>

2300
01:42:41.530 --> 01:42:44.170
<v Speaker 6>you built a world and I'm not saying </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2301
01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:45.573
<v Speaker 6>I like your idea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time it's like not </v>

2302
01:42:48.911 --> 01:42:49.744
<v Speaker 6>anybody can do exactly what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but anybody can take the steps that you </v>

2303
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:52.450
<v Speaker 6>did.</v>

2304
01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:52.950
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just.</v>

2305
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:57.230
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying that the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>anybody can take opportunity.</v>

2306
01:42:57.450 --> 01:42:58.283
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This world we live in offers ample </v>

2307
01:42:59.890 --> 01:43:01.210
<v Speaker 6>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

2308
01:43:01.211 --> 01:43:03.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying 12 grand more a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

2309
01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:06.790
<v Speaker 6>I really feel like it's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're doing it wrong.</v>

2310
01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:10.060
<v Speaker 6>I just think it collectively,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I've said this before,</v>

2311
01:43:10.061 --> 01:43:12.250
<v Speaker 6>so if you heard me say it before anybody</v>
<v Speaker 6>listening,</v>

2312
01:43:12.251 --> 01:43:13.084
<v Speaker 6>I apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I always say that if we looked at </v>

2313
01:43:14.561 --> 01:43:18.280
<v Speaker 6>ourselves as an organism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we looked at society as an organism,</v>

2314
01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:19.293
<v Speaker 6>what would we.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What would we want to fix other </v>

2315
01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.273
<v Speaker 6>organism?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would we want to make the muscle </v>

2316
01:43:22.281 --> 01:43:24.940
<v Speaker 6>stronger or would we want to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 6>cancer?</v>

2317
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:27.490
<v Speaker 6>Would we want to figure out what's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 6>with it?</v>

2318
01:43:27.491 --> 01:43:30.310
<v Speaker 6>We want to cure the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2319
01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:34.570
<v Speaker 6>the disease has got to be poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's the number one problem that we</v>

2320
01:43:34.571 --> 01:43:36.010
<v Speaker 6>have as crime and poverty.</v>

2321
01:43:36.190 --> 01:43:40.540
<v Speaker 6>Like we've got to focus on that area of </v>
<v Speaker 6>our world and instead of thinking of is,</v>

2322
01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:41.413
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they should pull themselves up by their </v>

2323
01:43:41.981 --> 01:43:43.240
<v Speaker 6>bootstraps,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or oh,</v>

2324
01:43:43.241 --> 01:43:44.610
<v Speaker 6>they need the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2325
01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:47.140
<v Speaker 6>realize there's opportunity out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just got to go get it.</v>

2326
01:43:47.141 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's go their own path.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think collectively as a human species,</v>

2327
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:57.250
<v Speaker 6>we have to look at the world's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the world is like real deep poverty</v>

2328
01:43:57.681 --> 01:43:58.514
<v Speaker 6>and social problems and look at it </v>
<v Speaker 6>almost like as if we're a living </v>

2329
01:44:00.831 --> 01:44:01.664
<v Speaker 6>creature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we're living creature and there's </v>

2330
01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:06.380
<v Speaker 6>parts of us that are starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to get that part food.</v>

2331
01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.150
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's universal.</v>

2332
01:44:08.151 --> 01:44:10.310
<v Speaker 6>That's why those commercials with Sally </v>
<v Speaker 6>Fields,</v>

2333
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 6>Sally struthers selling brothers were so</v>
<v Speaker 6>compelling.</v>

2334
01:44:13.161 --> 01:44:13.994
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because you would see those babies and </v>

2335
01:44:15.681 --> 01:44:16.210
<v Speaker 6>they did</v>

2336
01:44:16.210 --> 01:44:18.090
<v Speaker 7>somebody who's hungry and I've got some.</v>

2337
01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>

2338
01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:21.463
<v Speaker 6>these are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like we only have a certain </v>

2339
01:44:24.441 --> 01:44:25.640
<v Speaker 6>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2340
01:44:25.641 --> 01:44:26.474
<v Speaker 6>just as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as an organism that has a finite </v>

2341
01:44:27.921 --> 01:44:31.370
<v Speaker 6>lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have like 100 years if you're lucky,</v>

2342
01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:32.653
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this thing that we're doing now </v>

2343
01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.920
<v Speaker 6>where we have a president,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2344
01:44:36.921 --> 01:44:40.910
<v Speaker 6>and you have to fucking go out there and</v>
<v Speaker 6>earn your keep boy and you know,</v>

2345
01:44:40.911 --> 01:44:41.744
<v Speaker 6>you get a job in oil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>looks like you're going to have to get </v>

2346
01:44:43.461 --> 01:44:46.340
<v Speaker 6>married now you're a dad and then you </v>
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

2347
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:48.350
<v Speaker 6>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of a sudden I'm dying.</v>

2348
01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.570
<v Speaker 6>Like I was living.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I worked in a factory,</v>

2349
01:44:50.571 --> 01:44:51.740
<v Speaker 6>now I'm dying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2350
01:44:52.130 --> 01:44:52.963
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if that's the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 6>make the most productive society or the </v>

2351
01:44:59.211 --> 01:45:01.410
<v Speaker 6>most enjoyable experience for the people</v>
<v Speaker 6>that are living in.</v>

2352
01:45:01.730 --> 01:45:03.460
<v Speaker 7>It's like a little more jewelry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mom.</v>

2353
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:04.780
<v Speaker 7>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A little bit.</v>

2354
01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:08.500
<v Speaker 7>A little,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a little more joy would,</v>

2355
01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:09.363
<v Speaker 7>would,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2356
01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.670
<v Speaker 7>the American experience would benefit </v>
<v Speaker 7>from a little more jewelry.</v>

2357
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.670
<v Speaker 7>There's so much toil.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And as you said,</v>

2358
01:45:15.671 --> 01:45:17.350
<v Speaker 7>there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can do anything here,</v>

2359
01:45:17.351 --> 01:45:18.184
<v Speaker 7>but you got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we spend so much time chasing </v>

2360
01:45:21.850 --> 01:45:22.683
<v Speaker 7>something that makes life easier.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to argue that money makes </v>

2361
01:45:25.571 --> 01:45:27.500
<v Speaker 7>things easier to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2362
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:30.080
<v Speaker 7>but chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2363
01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:33.880
<v Speaker 7>the idea of prosperity and one direction</v>
<v Speaker 7>as opposed to spiritual prosperity.</v>

2364
01:45:33.881 --> 01:45:34.714
<v Speaker 7>Not saying religion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>saying prosperity of one's soul growing </v>

2365
01:45:37.301 --> 01:45:40.510
<v Speaker 7>as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>something that doesn't have to stop just</v>

2366
01:45:40.511 --> 01:45:42.250
<v Speaker 7>because now you've entered the </v>
<v Speaker 7>workplace,</v>

2367
01:45:42.251 --> 01:45:43.084
<v Speaker 7>now you're married and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>falling into place with the model for </v>

2368
01:45:47.081 --> 01:45:48.190
<v Speaker 7>society.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2369
01:45:48.191 --> 01:45:49.024
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's still a space in there for </v>

2370
01:45:52.110 --> 01:45:52.943
<v Speaker 7>while.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think maybe this is where I'm </v>

2371
01:45:54.401 --> 01:45:56.320
<v Speaker 7>coming around to your free $12,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>a year.</v>

2372
01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:58.930
<v Speaker 7>It's not my idea by any stretch of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>idea of three,</v>

2373
01:45:58.931 --> 01:45:59.764
<v Speaker 7>$12,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>a year because maybe it does leave a </v>

2374
01:46:01.241 --> 01:46:05.290
<v Speaker 7>little breathing space where suddenly in</v>
<v Speaker 7>that space somebody like,</v>

2375
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:07.930
<v Speaker 7>oh I want to do this and this would make</v>
<v Speaker 7>me happy.</v>

2376
01:46:07.931 --> 01:46:10.570
<v Speaker 7>And when I'm happy at this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it'll trickle down at work.</v>

2377
01:46:10.571 --> 01:46:11.404
<v Speaker 7>Like so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I go from one job to this job and </v>

2378
01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:15.850
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then I get the weekends,</v>

2379
01:46:15.851 --> 01:46:18.940
<v Speaker 7>maybe in my weekends are Tuesday and </v>
<v Speaker 7>Thursday or something like that.</v>

2380
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.500
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're right,</v>

2381
01:46:20.501 --> 01:46:24.800
<v Speaker 7>I was thinking like I even,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got privileges and,</v>

2382
01:46:24.801 --> 01:46:27.300
<v Speaker 7>and fucking breaks that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't get.</v>

2383
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:30.580
<v Speaker 7>I came from a poor white people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it didn't matter.</v>

2384
01:46:30.581 --> 01:46:33.580
<v Speaker 7>It was white people and so there are </v>
<v Speaker 7>breaks for me out there somewhere in the</v>

2385
01:46:33.581 --> 01:46:35.500
<v Speaker 7>world and I always think through that </v>
<v Speaker 7>prism.</v>

2386
01:46:36.010 --> 01:46:36.843
<v Speaker 7>But you're right man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of people out there that </v>

2387
01:46:38.951 --> 01:46:41.050
<v Speaker 7>would benefit from like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's a cushion.</v>

2388
01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:43.690
<v Speaker 7>Here's something to start with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where do you go from there?</v>

2389
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.080
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and what does that $4,000</v>

2390
01:46:47.081 --> 01:46:49.030
<v Speaker 7>a month just for being an American?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2391
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 7>mean it sounds like thinking,</v>

2392
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:50.761
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2393
01:46:50.761 --> 01:46:52.830
<v Speaker 6>everybody's scamming to try to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>welfare money.</v>

2394
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:56.760
<v Speaker 6>How about just give it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how just give them enough to survive.</v>

2395
01:46:56.970 --> 01:46:59.400
<v Speaker 6>Just give everybody enough to survive </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then let's work this shit out.</v>

2396
01:46:59.490 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 6>And then when you make more than x </v>
<v Speaker 6>amount a year,</v>

2397
01:47:01.890 --> 01:47:02.910
<v Speaker 6>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2398
01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:05.550
<v Speaker 6>if you're like Kevin Smith or me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2399
01:47:05.551 --> 01:47:06.271
<v Speaker 6>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2400
01:47:06.271 --> 01:47:08.850
<v Speaker 6>I don't want my 12 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Put it back into the system.</v>

2401
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.380
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pay All your taxes,</v>

2402
01:47:10.381 --> 01:47:11.214
<v Speaker 6>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But this would make us feel like we're </v>

2403
01:47:14.281 --> 01:47:16.230
<v Speaker 6>looking out for each other a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2404
01:47:16.231 --> 01:47:17.340
<v Speaker 6>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not.</v>

2405
01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:18.513
<v Speaker 6>I'm not fully formed on this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just something on battering around </v>

2406
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:22.164
<v Speaker 6>in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm battering it around in my head </v>

2407
01:47:23.371 --> 01:47:24.204
<v Speaker 6>the same way I'm batting around this </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea that there shouldn't really be a </v>

2408
01:47:26.701 --> 01:47:27.534
<v Speaker 6>president like this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just it's only there because we've been </v>

2409
01:47:30.451 --> 01:47:34.140
<v Speaker 6>doing it this way for 300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if it didn't exist,</v>

2410
01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.120
<v Speaker 6>there's no way that's how you would run </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2411
01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:37.163
<v Speaker 6>There's no way we would all agree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what we should do because once you </v>

2412
01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.353
<v Speaker 6>get one person who knows the most people</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the most money who have been doing </v>

2413
01:47:42.781 --> 01:47:43.614
<v Speaker 6>this the longest and that person will </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a giant advantage over everybody </v>

2414
01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:46.584
<v Speaker 6>else and get that person backed up by </v>
<v Speaker 6>these huge corporations that would </v>

2415
01:47:49.651 --> 01:47:50.484
<v Speaker 6>benefit by this person being an office </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you'd make laws and make </v>

2416
01:47:52.591 --> 01:47:53.424
<v Speaker 6>environmental rules a little bit lax </v>
<v Speaker 6>because we can get away with some shit </v>

2417
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:57.870
<v Speaker 6>and we could make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way we would say,</v>

2418
01:47:57.871 --> 01:47:58.800
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's do it that way.</v>

2419
01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.630
<v Speaker 6>There's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We would say,</v>

2420
01:48:00.631 --> 01:48:02.490
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we want the geniuses of the world.</v>

2421
01:48:02.670 --> 01:48:04.860
<v Speaker 6>We want the the professors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2422
01:48:04.861 --> 01:48:05.241
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2423
01:48:05.241 --> 01:48:06.720
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Elon musks,</v>

2424
01:48:06.721 --> 01:48:08.340
<v Speaker 6>we want the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Bill Gates,</v>

2425
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:12.570
<v Speaker 6>the people that are very wise and very </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligent and very rational.</v>

2426
01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 6>You want to talk to giant groups of them</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we want to form our own opinions and</v>

2427
01:48:16.981 --> 01:48:19.590
<v Speaker 6>we should all be voting collectively as </v>
<v Speaker 6>a group.</v>

2428
01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:22.050
<v Speaker 6>There shouldn't be some representative </v>
<v Speaker 6>government,</v>

2429
01:48:22.051 --> 01:48:22.884
<v Speaker 6>some electoral college.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you going to fucking wear a </v>

2430
01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:26.640
<v Speaker 6>powdered wig to?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't.</v>

2431
01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:30.720
<v Speaker 6>You got to ride around on a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>horse with some homemade horseshoes with</v>

2432
01:48:30.721 --> 01:48:33.300
<v Speaker 6>your powdered wig and your electoral </v>
<v Speaker 6>college.</v>

2433
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:36.180
<v Speaker 6>We're going to read it on a scroll and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the talents square,</v>

2434
01:48:36.181 --> 01:48:38.730
<v Speaker 6>standing on an apple box.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck off.</v>

2435
01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:39.773
<v Speaker 6>That shit is old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you make me feel bad because I get </v>

2436
01:48:42.091 --> 01:48:44.550
<v Speaker 6>high and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let me write a movie about.</v>

2437
01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:45.384
<v Speaker 6>A guy turns to go to a Walrus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get high and you want to change the </v>

2438
01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:48.750
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're a dreamer.</v>

2439
01:48:48.751 --> 01:48:51.810
<v Speaker 6>Dreamer of a day sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes not at all.</v>

2440
01:48:51.811 --> 01:48:53.970
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes I just want to go watch that </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hawaiian movie.</v>

2441
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.480
<v Speaker 6>Rwanda.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a good movie.</v>

2442
01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:56.460
<v Speaker 6>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's good.</v>

2443
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:58.850
<v Speaker 6>Let me ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let me ask you about archery,</v>

2444
01:48:58.870 --> 01:49:00.330
<v Speaker 6>which you seem to have fallen in love </v>
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>

2445
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:01.950
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love our fucking hard.</v>

2446
01:49:01.951 --> 01:49:05.340
<v Speaker 6>Is it to pull back a bone arrow?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not easy,</v>

2447
01:49:05.341 --> 01:49:10.341
<v Speaker 6>but they make bows for people is like </v>
<v Speaker 6>little kids like field film.</v>

2448
01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:14.550
<v Speaker 6>It goes back with the and shit depends </v>
<v Speaker 6>entirely on what you're trying to do.</v>

2449
01:49:14.551 --> 01:49:18.360
<v Speaker 6>If you want to shoot a target,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they make bows that a little kid like my</v>

2450
01:49:18.361 --> 01:49:21.120
<v Speaker 6>little kids were shooting bows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when my daughter was three,</v>

2451
01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:23.250
<v Speaker 6>I got her a bow and Arrow that she could</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of pull back.</v>

2452
01:49:23.251 --> 01:49:24.084
<v Speaker 6>I kind of help her or I would have to </v>
<v Speaker 6>hold onto it and she could pull it back </v>

2453
01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 6>and then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're getting ready to go and one,</v>

2454
01:49:28.411 --> 01:49:29.790
<v Speaker 6>two,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three and she would let it go.</v>

2455
01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:33.020
<v Speaker 6>So you could have a redo that later </v>
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>

2456
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:36.120
<v Speaker 6>That's the way I would need to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>handled.</v>

2457
01:49:36.121 --> 01:49:36.954
<v Speaker 6>But then for a compound bow you have to </v>
<v Speaker 6>two possibilities that you're using it </v>

2458
01:49:40.561 --> 01:49:41.640
<v Speaker 6>for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One,</v>

2459
01:49:41.641 --> 01:49:44.490
<v Speaker 6>which is target archery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is what I do more than anything.</v>

2460
01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 6>I shoot targets just in my yard and with</v>
<v Speaker 6>friends</v>

2461
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.053
<v Speaker 3>and I'll go to some ranges and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>place in Vegas I go to that's really </v>

2462
01:49:51.611 --> 01:49:52.810
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2463
01:49:52.930 --> 01:49:53.763
<v Speaker 3>and doing that is like you don't need </v>
<v Speaker 3>that much power because it's just about </v>

2464
01:49:56.561 --> 01:49:59.320
<v Speaker 3>figuring out where the Arrow's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go and be an accurate about it.</v>

2465
01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.040
<v Speaker 3>But then when you get to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to hunt an animal with it,</v>

2466
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.053
<v Speaker 3>then you have a certain obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that your bow is at least a </v>

2467
01:50:07.751 --> 01:50:10.090
<v Speaker 3>certain amount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a certain amount of power to it.</v>

2468
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:15.080
<v Speaker 3>And most people agree that somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>around 45 or 50 pounds it's,</v>

2469
01:50:15.081 --> 01:50:16.420
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's debatable.</v>

2470
01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:17.403
<v Speaker 3>But in Texas I know they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they fought back a law because </v>

2471
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:23.710
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to keep kids from </v>
<v Speaker 3>bowhunting unless they could pull back,</v>

2472
01:50:23.711 --> 01:50:26.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 35 pounds or 45 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the weight.</v>

2473
01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.760
<v Speaker 7>So there's a measure of strength in </v>
<v Speaker 7>order to do something.</v>

2474
01:50:28.770 --> 01:50:30.330
<v Speaker 7>They don't have to do that for driving.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2475
01:50:30.331 --> 01:50:32.580
<v Speaker 7>the only reason why you gotta be strong </v>
<v Speaker 7>enough to drive</v>

2476
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:33.763
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because it's not ethical because </v>

2477
01:50:35.571 --> 01:50:36.404
<v Speaker 3>you really almost don't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinetic energy to actually penetrate an </v>

2478
01:50:38.811 --> 01:50:40.750
<v Speaker 3>animal and kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you wouldn't be,</v>

2479
01:50:41.490 --> 01:50:43.640
<v Speaker 3>they'll like harold would stick out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

2480
01:50:43.730 --> 01:50:45.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it does happen.</v>

2481
01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:46.873
<v Speaker 3>So you have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirement of the kinetic energy where </v>

2482
01:50:51.501 --> 01:50:54.300
<v Speaker 3>it's ethical to bowhunt I remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

2483
01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:55.163
<v Speaker 7>trying my father in law,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my wife's a step that buyer and a great </v>

2484
01:51:00.091 --> 01:51:01.810
<v Speaker 7>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2485
01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:06.330
<v Speaker 7>he was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a bone Arrow enthusiast.</v>

2486
01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:09.000
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't go into a bowhunter because </v>
<v Speaker 7>then go out and hunt anything.</v>

2487
01:51:09.001 --> 01:51:12.060
<v Speaker 7>But he was good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He won medals and shit like,</v>

2488
01:51:12.090 --> 01:51:13.470
<v Speaker 7>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So um,</v>

2489
01:51:13.530 --> 01:51:15.530
<v Speaker 7>I was writing Green Arrow at the time </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>

2490
01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:16.710
<v Speaker 7>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I should,</v>

2491
01:51:17.730 --> 01:51:20.010
<v Speaker 7>if I'm going to write,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he shoot.</v>

2492
01:51:20.011 --> 01:51:23.940
<v Speaker 7>He knocks and fires and are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you should try knocking an arrow.</v>

2493
01:51:23.941 --> 01:51:26.550
<v Speaker 7>Just maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe there's something there about like</v>

2494
01:51:26.551 --> 01:51:28.680
<v Speaker 7>you can describe it rather than make it </v>
<v Speaker 7>up.</v>

2495
01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:32.760
<v Speaker 7>And he took me into the backyard with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>bow and Arrow and a target,</v>

2496
01:51:32.761 --> 01:51:36.630
<v Speaker 7>big hate target with thing on it and no </v>
<v Speaker 7>compound or anything.</v>

2497
01:51:36.631 --> 01:51:38.970
<v Speaker 7>Just a longbow and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

2498
01:51:38.971 --> 01:51:40.770
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is gonna be easy.</v>

2499
01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 7>Green Arrow Knox,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like six of these at a time and shit and</v>

2500
01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:46.050
<v Speaker 7>knocked one Arrow and went to pull back.</v>

2501
01:51:46.050 --> 01:51:50.880
<v Speaker 7>And like the shake began in my arm </v>
<v Speaker 7>pretty fucking quickly.</v>

2502
01:51:50.881 --> 01:51:52.200
<v Speaker 7>I didn't get very far back for.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

2503
01:51:52.201 --> 01:51:54.780
<v Speaker 7>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>serious Boho.</v>

2504
01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.720
<v Speaker 7>Pretty serious fucking bow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

2505
01:51:56.721 --> 01:51:57.750
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Number one,</v>

2506
01:51:57.751 --> 01:51:58.584
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not the man I thought I was and I </v>

2507
01:52:00.301 --> 01:52:01.740
<v Speaker 7>didn't think I was much of a man to </v>
<v Speaker 7>begin with.</v>

2508
01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.930
<v Speaker 7>But number two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just like,</v>

2509
01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:04.793
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think anyone would ever choose </v>

2510
01:52:06.751 --> 01:52:10.950
<v Speaker 7>this to fight crime.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

2511
01:52:10.951 --> 01:52:11.784
<v Speaker 7>One of those things where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you confront as much as I love this </v>

2512
01:52:14.101 --> 01:52:15.050
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love comic books.</v>

2513
01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.010
<v Speaker 7>Went to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was the moment where I was like,</v>

2514
01:52:17.011 --> 01:52:17.844
<v Speaker 7>this shit falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you always find yourself defending </v>

2515
01:52:19.621 --> 01:52:21.030
<v Speaker 7>the notion of a Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Many people like,</v>

2516
01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:22.133
<v Speaker 7>come on dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you out all the money and you lost </v>

2517
01:52:23.971 --> 01:52:27.030
<v Speaker 7>your parents had all the time to commit </v>
<v Speaker 7>to your body,</v>

2518
01:52:27.031 --> 01:52:30.780
<v Speaker 7>turning it into a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could be Batman or superman.</v>

2519
01:52:30.781 --> 01:52:31.614
<v Speaker 7>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he comes from,</v>

2520
01:52:32.610 --> 01:52:36.480
<v Speaker 7>but there could be a bad thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>all you have to do is try pulling back a</v>

2521
01:52:36.481 --> 01:52:41.481
<v Speaker 7>bone Arrow once and you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well there couldn't be a green Arrow and</v>

2522
01:52:41.701 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 7>he's got it easier than a Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if he could give that can exist,</v>

2523
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 7>then</v>

2524
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.903
<v Speaker 2>this probably can't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although like we were talking about an </v>

2525
01:52:49.761 --> 01:52:52.370
<v Speaker 2>episode of podcast the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could,</v>

2526
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:54.133
<v Speaker 2>could you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I saw a video they did on Penn and </v>

2527
01:52:57.531 --> 01:53:01.700
<v Speaker 2>teller of Penn and teller were doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>were somebody shot a bullet at a Samurai</v>

2528
01:53:01.701 --> 01:53:02.534
<v Speaker 2>sword and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a calibrated so it was hitting </v>

2529
01:53:05.331 --> 01:53:09.460
<v Speaker 2>directly into the middle of the blade </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it split the bullet into.</v>

2530
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:12.260
<v Speaker 2>And then the idea was could a butter </v>
<v Speaker 2>knife to the same thing?</v>

2531
01:53:12.261 --> 01:53:14.060
<v Speaker 2>And of course the butter knife did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

2532
01:53:14.061 --> 01:53:16.580
<v Speaker 2>It's split the bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't matter if it was a hammered</v>

2533
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:20.030
<v Speaker 2>a thousand times razor's Edge Samurai </v>
<v Speaker 2>sword or a butter knife,</v>

2534
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:21.163
<v Speaker 2>that bullet hitting that target split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we were talking about on the </v>

2535
01:53:24.571 --> 01:53:25.340
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2536
01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:26.173
<v Speaker 2>well that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that to me is proof now that you </v>

2537
01:53:29.361 --> 01:53:32.390
<v Speaker 2>could fight crime with a Katana sword.</v>

2538
01:53:32.530 --> 01:53:33.363
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to be super fucking fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to Scott Leggett and Scott's </v>

2539
01:53:37.071 --> 01:53:37.904
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2540
01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:40.460
<v Speaker 2>making fun of me because he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I said,</v>

2541
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you have to be Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2542
01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.050
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm saying you do have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2543
01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:49.070
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying like if you were the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>held a sword and somebody fired a bullet</v>

2544
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:51.650
<v Speaker 2>and it's split with the kickback of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullet,</v>

2545
01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:54.650
<v Speaker 2>throw the sword into you or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2546
01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:55.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

2547
01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.460
<v Speaker 2>This was a concrete block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was holding the Samurai Sword.</v>

2548
01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:00.590
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the pockets and then God</v>

2549
01:54:00.591 --> 01:54:01.424
<v Speaker 2>bless the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody sends us a link of some other </v>

<v Speaker 2>swordsman and cuts of baseball and half.</v>

2552

<v Speaker 2>No fucking metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bb Pellets did.</v>

2553
01:54:17.091 --> 01:54:19.400

<v Speaker 2>and a laser scope so that it would hit </v>

2556

<v Speaker 3>I had a bit in my act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing well.</v>

2610
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:37.890
<v Speaker 3>You know what you don't find when you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for bigfoot.</v>

2611
01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Black people are more likely to find big</v>
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>

2612
01:56:41.371 --> 01:56:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Then you are black people out looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>for bigfoot.</v>

2613
01:56:43.890 --> 01:56:44.191
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2614
01:56:44.191 --> 01:56:46.540
<v Speaker 3>you find it's unfuckable white dudes </v>
<v Speaker 3>camping,</v>

2615
01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:52.750
<v Speaker 3>trying to work out whatever's in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>heads about big foot.</v>

2616
01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:56.490
<v Speaker 3>If you gave everybody $12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot more people go look for big.</v>

2617
01:56:56.550 --> 01:57:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they'd find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should at least find something new.</v>

2618
01:57:01.390 --> 01:57:02.161
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2619
01:57:02.161 --> 01:57:03.660
<v Speaker 3>dude?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't thought this through.</v>

2620
01:57:04.110 --> 01:57:07.740
<v Speaker 3>12 k a year could find big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2621
01:57:07.741 --> 01:57:12.741
<v Speaker 3>When I knew that I always had a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was probably horseshit,</v>

2622
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.430
<v Speaker 3>but what does that cover Yeti and about </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult abominable snowman.</v>

2623
01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:20.060
<v Speaker 3>They used to be an animal called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic pithy gets.</v>

2624
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:21.390
<v Speaker 3>That's what a lot of this is based on.</v>

2625
01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:23.970
<v Speaker 3>The gigantic pythius lived as recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>as 100,000</v>

2626
01:57:23.971 --> 01:57:28.280
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight or man or a bipedal hominid in the</v>

2627
01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Orangutang family that was potentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight feet tall.</v>

2628
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:33.583
<v Speaker 3>Sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ape giant fucking big standing freaky </v>

2629
01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:38.513
<v Speaker 3>ape thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why they figured out it </v>

2630
01:57:40.531 --> 01:57:43.320
<v Speaker 3>was by people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2631
01:57:43.321 --> 01:57:47.640
<v Speaker 3>well like bigfoot really would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be big foot.</v>

2632
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:52.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was short like us and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if that's true or not because</v>

2633
01:57:53.651 --> 01:57:54.484
<v Speaker 3>we only have some job bones and see what</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened was this guy found a tooth in </v>

2634
01:57:58.171 --> 01:57:59.004
<v Speaker 3>an apothecary shop in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say the 19 twenties and </v>

2635
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:06.750
<v Speaker 3>he was an anthropologist and a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he was there,</v>

2636
01:58:06.751 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 3>he looked good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

2637
01:58:07.650 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's this?</v>

2638
01:58:08.701 --> 01:58:09.534
<v Speaker 3>Where'd you get this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they took him to the place where </v>

2639
01:58:11.071 --> 01:58:13.310
<v Speaker 3>they got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw the tooth and he recognized that</v>

2640
01:58:13.311 --> 01:58:14.144
<v Speaker 3>as a primate tooth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but far larger than a gorilla is far </v>

2641
01:58:16.291 --> 01:58:17.340
<v Speaker 3>larger than a human being.</v>

2642
01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:18.360
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2643
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Like this is like a giant tubes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck's going on?</v>

2644
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:22.103
<v Speaker 3>They took them to this spot and he found</v>
<v Speaker 3>more bones and then it was eventually </v>

2645
01:58:25.051 --> 01:58:27.630
<v Speaker 3>recognized as an actual animal and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>call it Jack Canto,</v>

2646
01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Pythagoras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2647
01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:31.270
<v Speaker 3>they just don't know that there's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>big foot.</v>

2648
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:32.143
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me show him the picture of gigantic </v>

2649
01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.820
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] next to a Bush area of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world was,</v>

2650
01:58:35.821 --> 01:58:38.460
<v Speaker 3>which I found the baseball gets the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2651
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do it just right now before we get</v>

2652
01:58:40.231 --> 01:58:41.064
<v Speaker 3>to the baseball guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You show the picture of gigantic pithy </v>

2653
01:58:43.450 --> 01:58:45.050
<v Speaker 3>gets next to a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2654
01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:47.070
<v Speaker 3>this is what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2655
01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:50.830
<v Speaker 3>scientists believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is not like big foot researchers</v>

2656
01:58:50.831 --> 01:58:54.850
<v Speaker 3>that are claiming this is a real animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like actual scientists.</v>

2657
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:55.833
<v Speaker 3>There's a picture of one standing right </v>
<v Speaker 3>next to a dude is like a statue of </v>

2658
01:58:59.201 --> 01:59:01.270
<v Speaker 3>gigantic pythagoras covered in hair.</v>

2659
01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:02.560
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's huge.</v>

2660
01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:05.230
<v Speaker 3>So this was a real answer for that right</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2661
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Harry and the Hendersons.</v>

2662
01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:10.600
<v Speaker 3>That is big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if that is what I mean.</v>

2663
01:59:10.601 --> 01:59:12.910
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not big foot researchers.</v>

2664
01:59:12.911 --> 01:59:13.744
<v Speaker 3>They didn't create this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is created by actual </v>

2665
01:59:15.221 --> 01:59:16.054
<v Speaker 3>anthropologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And did this exist as recently as </v>

2666
01:59:18.791 --> 01:59:19.624
<v Speaker 3>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago with no chance that there's </v>

2667
01:59:22.181 --> 01:59:23.470
<v Speaker 3>one still hanging out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2668
01:59:23.471 --> 01:59:25.630
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just been.</v>

2669
01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:26.643
<v Speaker 3>Unless we comb every inch of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we give an audit on every single living </v>

2670
01:59:31.331 --> 01:59:34.300
<v Speaker 3>creature that is in the densest of dense</v>
<v Speaker 3>forests.</v>

2671
01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:35.253
<v Speaker 3>We can't really say that that's true </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they find that we find new shit </v>

2672
01:59:39.371 --> 01:59:42.340
<v Speaker 3>all the time and the Pacific northwest </v>
<v Speaker 3>where these things.</v>

2673
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:43.263
<v Speaker 3>The reason why it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it works geologically are </v>

2674
01:59:45.761 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 3>geographically because that animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>existed in Asia.</v>

2675
01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:53.440
<v Speaker 3>We know that humans came from Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally American Indians,</v>

2676
01:59:53.441 --> 01:59:55.510
<v Speaker 3>native Americans there from Siberia.</v>

2677
01:59:56.050 --> 01:59:59.680
<v Speaker 3>Like they have the same DNA as people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who came from Asia.</v>

2678
01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:02.370
<v Speaker 3>They came across thej or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2679
02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:03.513
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing has been connected at </v>
<v Speaker 3>separated for as long as humans have </v>

2680
02:00:06.491 --> 02:00:07.324
<v Speaker 3>been humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2681
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:08.343
<v Speaker 3>So if we came from that area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that a bunch of other animals </v>

2682
02:00:12.191 --> 02:00:13.024
<v Speaker 3>came from that area too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they think that it's entirely </v>

2683
02:00:14.621 --> 02:00:15.454
<v Speaker 3>possible that that big ass monkey thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>came from that area to somebody brought </v>

2684
02:00:18.371 --> 02:00:20.680
<v Speaker 3>it with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just came like all these other things</v>

2685
02:00:20.690 --> 02:00:24.640
<v Speaker 3>to make the walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be where the whole yeti thing</v>

2686
02:00:24.641 --> 02:00:27.070
<v Speaker 3>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The yeti thing is one of those living in</v>

2687
02:00:27.071 --> 02:00:29.170
<v Speaker 3>an extremely cold climate during the ice</v>
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>

2688
02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:30.323
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's entirely possible when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people either saw a remanence of it or </v>

2689
02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:35.620
<v Speaker 3>but never alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have never crossed paths.</v>

2690
02:00:35.730 --> 02:00:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Ip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they did back in the day for sure.</v>

2691
02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Are you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you serious?</v>

2692
02:00:39.251 --> 02:00:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A hundred percent.</v>

2693
02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:42.520
<v Speaker 3>We will cross paths with all the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>great apes.</v>

2694
02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:45.310
<v Speaker 3>We cross paths with Orangutans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would we think we'd cross paths with</v>

2695
02:00:45.311 --> 02:00:47.170
<v Speaker 3>a gigantic [inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get some.</v>

2696
02:00:47.290 --> 02:00:49.840
<v Speaker 3>You'd see a you'd fucking run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's really smart,</v>

2697
02:00:49.841 --> 02:00:50.674
<v Speaker 3>it would have a fucking house in a cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone or it's not smart enough to hide </v>

2698
02:00:53.171 --> 02:00:54.940
<v Speaker 3>from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like get the fuck out of here.</v>

2699
02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.010
<v Speaker 3>If we could find a gorilla like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2700
02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:58.690
<v Speaker 3>this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could find a gorilla,</v>

2701
02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:00.910
<v Speaker 3>we could find a champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We find the howler monkey should be able</v>

2702
02:01:00.911 --> 02:01:04.270
<v Speaker 3>to find it so slick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still a monkey.</v>

2703
02:01:04.271 --> 02:01:05.104
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even have pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This stupid fuck he doesn't have shoes </v>

2704
02:01:07.431 --> 02:01:10.110
<v Speaker 3>is that doesn't have a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>your barometer for intelligence.</v>

2705
02:01:10.111 --> 02:01:13.810
<v Speaker 3>You like pants and you got a man with no</v>
<v Speaker 3>pants.</v>

2706
02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.580
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna freeze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to figure out fire.</v>

2707
02:01:15.670 --> 02:01:17.980
<v Speaker 3>You're walking around on two legs like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the shit.</v>

2708
02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Come on Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figure it out.</v>

2709
02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:23.740
<v Speaker 3>So if he could figure out nothing except</v>
<v Speaker 3>escaping people,</v>

2710
02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:24.581
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2711
02:01:24.581 --> 02:01:27.970
<v Speaker 3>what an extraordinarily animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extraordinarily intelligent animal.</v>

2712
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:28.863
<v Speaker 3>It's figured out at least how to get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck away from people to have a house </v>

2713
02:01:32.050 --> 02:01:32.883
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

2714
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a real thing.</v>

2715
02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it was a real thing.</v>

2716
02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I think it was things based on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

2717
02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.390
<v Speaker 6>think it is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So do you think the.</v>

2718
02:01:42.590 --> 02:01:43.423
<v Speaker 6>Somebody sees one of those frozen in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>cave and then it's passed down or they </v>

2719
02:01:47.721 --> 02:01:51.110
<v Speaker 6>could have encountered it if people have</v>
<v Speaker 6>been around for I think,</v>

2720
02:01:51.111 --> 02:01:52.970
<v Speaker 6>what did we decide the other day in this</v>
<v Speaker 6>forum?</v>

2721
02:01:52.971 --> 02:01:56.000
<v Speaker 6>I think the consensus is like at least </v>
<v Speaker 6>250,000</v>

2722
02:01:56.001 --> 02:01:59.840
<v Speaker 6>years we've been in this form.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That means for 150,000</v>

2723
02:01:59.841 --> 02:02:00.674
<v Speaker 6>years we lived around those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>things and that has got to be in her </v>

2724
02:02:03.831 --> 02:02:06.860
<v Speaker 6>head because most likely they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably peaceful because they're so big</v>

2725
02:02:06.861 --> 02:02:07.694
<v Speaker 6>like a rang of tans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if that wanted to it would just </v>

2726
02:02:09.921 --> 02:02:10.754
<v Speaker 6>throw water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Balloons would splatter against the </v>

2727
02:02:14.301 --> 02:02:17.230
<v Speaker 6>coconut tree and that'd be the end of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that and you'd imagine the be similar in</v>

2728
02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.021
<v Speaker 6>our history.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were like,</v>

2729
02:02:18.021 --> 02:02:20.570
<v Speaker 6>and then there was the great April or we</v>
<v Speaker 6>probably killed them.</v>

2730
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:21.703
<v Speaker 6>We probably figured out bows and arrows </v>
<v Speaker 6>and we probably started fucking killing </v>

2731
02:02:23.811 --> 02:02:24.644
<v Speaker 6>him from a distance and we're alive and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not and nobody remembers nobody </v>

2732
02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:29.293
<v Speaker 6>too long ago.</v>

2733
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:30.433
<v Speaker 6>How can we know his chip passed down?</v>
<v Speaker 6>People don't know shit about my </v>

2734
02:02:33.441 --> 02:02:36.290
<v Speaker 6>grandmother and grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know we killed those hobbit people.</v>

2735
02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:37.213
<v Speaker 6>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a really a fairly new revelation </v>

2736
02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:44.000
<v Speaker 6>is my favorite part island of Flores.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a small being that they found on</v>

2737
02:02:44.001 --> 02:02:44.834
<v Speaker 6>the island of Flores that's in the human</v>
<v Speaker 6>species that they're literally calling </v>

2738
02:02:47.991 --> 02:02:51.860
<v Speaker 6>the hobbit people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's called like Homo floresiensis cysts</v>

2739
02:02:51.861 --> 02:02:54.140
<v Speaker 6>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is.</v>

2740
02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:55.333
<v Speaker 6>This is a hundred percent confirmed now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is 100 percent accepted by </v>

2741
02:02:59.331 --> 02:03:04.331
<v Speaker 6>mainstream science that this was an </v>
<v Speaker 6>actual type of human being are typos.</v>

2742
02:03:05.370 --> 02:03:06.670
<v Speaker 6>The third one is type of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2743
02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:08.600
<v Speaker 6>the third one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that was a real animal.</v>

2744
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:12.070
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't a human in necessarily like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>homo sapiens,</v>

2745
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:17.350
<v Speaker 6>but it was some human ed or Hominid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some human light based on funding school</v>

2746
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:20.570
<v Speaker 6>funding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A bunch of them they found,</v>

2747
02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.900
<v Speaker 6>they found quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there was a bunch of resistance.</v>

2748
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.823
<v Speaker 6>Now when I say that it definitely lived.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are people to this day that don't </v>

2749
02:03:28.461 --> 02:03:29.294
<v Speaker 6>think it lived,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the vast consensus amongst these </v>

2750
02:03:33.411 --> 02:03:35.330
<v Speaker 6>anthropologists that this is a real </v>
<v Speaker 6>animal,</v>

2751
02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:36.313
<v Speaker 6>but there's always gonna be people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>are willing to debate it and they found </v>

2752
02:03:40.911 --> 02:03:43.550
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of bones of these little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 6>people like things.</v>

2753
02:03:43.551 --> 02:03:44.384
<v Speaker 6>And what they think is that these are </v>
<v Speaker 6>like literally like hobbit people and </v>

2754
02:03:48.161 --> 02:03:51.130
<v Speaker 6>that there was always been a legend of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

2755
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:52.950
<v Speaker 6>I forget what part of the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

2756
02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:56.060
<v Speaker 6>there's a thing called the Orang pendek </v>
<v Speaker 6>think that's how you say it,</v>

2757
02:03:56.061 --> 02:03:56.894
<v Speaker 6>or in pen deck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was a little tiny apelike </v>

2758
02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:04.810
<v Speaker 6>person and they think that this legend </v>
<v Speaker 6>of these little tiny a black people,</v>

2759
02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.400
<v Speaker 6>it was the species that this was a real </v>
<v Speaker 6>species.</v>

2760
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:08.383
<v Speaker 6>And they think that this real species </v>
<v Speaker 6>might've even been preyed on human </v>

2761
02:04:10.851 --> 02:04:11.660
<v Speaker 6>children.</v>

2762
02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:13.910
<v Speaker 6>They might've been competing for </v>
<v Speaker 6>resources.</v>

2763
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:17.120
<v Speaker 6>We might've cannibalize them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2764
02:04:17.121 --> 02:04:21.350
<v Speaker 6>It's entirely possible that we can </v>
<v Speaker 6>belies the of story.</v>

2765
02:04:21.351 --> 02:04:22.184
<v Speaker 6>The grimm fairy tales come from like the</v>
<v Speaker 6>troll who comes to steal your baby and </v>

2766
02:04:26.031 --> 02:04:26.864
<v Speaker 6>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had this guy Dr Jordan Peterson from </v>

2767
02:04:29.181 --> 02:04:31.460
<v Speaker 6>the University of Toronto the other day </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the podcast.</v>

2768
02:04:31.461 --> 02:04:32.294
<v Speaker 6>And he was telling me a story about how </v>
<v Speaker 6>when the fall of the Soviet Union or in </v>

2769
02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 6>Russia in the 19 thirties and doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>during Marxism,</v>

2770
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:39.263
<v Speaker 6>that they had signs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had made signs telling people not </v>

2771
02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:44.010
<v Speaker 6>to eat their children.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

2772
02:04:44.370 --> 02:04:45.990
<v Speaker 6>Because people were so starving to </v>
<v Speaker 6>death,</v>

2773
02:04:45.991 --> 02:04:50.010
<v Speaker 6>they were eating their fucking children,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they had to make billboards saying,</v>

2774
02:04:50.011 --> 02:04:52.980
<v Speaker 6>don't eat your children.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

2775
02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.610
<v Speaker 6>we just want a different track.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought we were talking about the hub.</v>

2776
02:04:55.611 --> 02:04:57.000
<v Speaker 6>It's still what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2777
02:04:57.060 --> 02:05:00.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about cannibalism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Human beings have been known to you that</v>

2778
02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:03.930
<v Speaker 6>he was in the 19 hundreds through the </v>
<v Speaker 6>20th century in our ear in Russia.</v>

2779
02:05:04.110 --> 02:05:05.700
<v Speaker 6>They were telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't eat your children.</v>

2780
02:05:05.701 --> 02:05:06.534
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>however many had happened to three </v>

2781
02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:08.580
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ate their kids for.</v>

2782
02:05:08.670 --> 02:05:09.503
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the numbers were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if that was enough to the point </v>

2783
02:05:11.431 --> 02:05:13.200
<v Speaker 6>where the government wanted to have a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sign that said,</v>

2784
02:05:13.201 --> 02:05:14.280
<v Speaker 6>please don't eat your children.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2785
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:16.770
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty metal dude.</v>

2786
02:05:16.771 --> 02:05:18.240
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's as metal as it gets.</v>

2787
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:21.930
<v Speaker 6>People have been eating people for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>long ass time.</v>

2788
02:05:22.170 --> 02:05:23.340
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then we stopped.</v>

2789
02:05:23.490 --> 02:05:26.310
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because before you were mad.</v>

2790
02:05:26.311 --> 02:05:28.260
<v Speaker 6>Cow Disease comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you know that?</v>

2791
02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:29.423
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thank God I cleared out a bunch of my </v>

2792
02:05:32.101 --> 02:05:34.800
<v Speaker 6>head so I could walk out of here with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of more knowledge.</v>

2793
02:05:34.801 --> 02:05:39.801
<v Speaker 6>Go fire cow disease comes from something</v>
<v Speaker 6>called the brain.</v>

2794
02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:40.733
<v Speaker 6>It comes up the other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the brain tissue of your of other human </v>

2795
02:05:45.301 --> 02:05:46.980
<v Speaker 6>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the ways you get it.</v>

2796
02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:49.770
<v Speaker 6>Like at Papa New Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cannibals of New Guinea.</v>

2797
02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:52.050
<v Speaker 6>They develop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's called Jacob Corks,</v>

2798
02:05:52.051 --> 02:05:54.780
<v Speaker 6>Feld,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is technically mad cow disease.</v>

2799
02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:57.660
<v Speaker 6>It's the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're getting it because they're feeding</v>

2800
02:05:57.690 --> 02:06:00.240
<v Speaker 6>cows cows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're feeding cows,</v>

2801
02:06:00.241 --> 02:06:01.074
<v Speaker 6>ground up brain matter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which they're not supposed to fucking </v>

2802
02:06:03.001 --> 02:06:04.500
<v Speaker 6>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The cows eat that.</v>

2803
02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:08.700
<v Speaker 6>They developed these prions that people </v>
<v Speaker 6>eat that tainted beef in the prize given</v>

2804
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:09.643
<v Speaker 6>by our own brains and does damage and </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's fucking prions can exist in like a </v>

2805
02:06:12.661 --> 02:06:13.494
<v Speaker 6>thousand degree temperatures.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like these indestructible </v>

2806
02:06:15.421 --> 02:06:19.110
<v Speaker 6>organisms and they invade your central </v>
<v Speaker 6>nervous system thing.</v>

2807
02:06:19.111 --> 02:06:19.944
<v Speaker 6>You feed a cow and another cow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're saying would have existed </v>

2808
02:06:22.801 --> 02:06:26.010
<v Speaker 6>prior to mad cow disease called </v>
<v Speaker 6>something else in human beings.</v>

2809
02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:26.993
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's probably set up to discourage </v>

2810
02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:34.400
<v Speaker 6>predation amongst the same species that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you you are a part of because of council</v>

2811
02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:35.493
<v Speaker 6>meeting council essentially to not eat </v>
<v Speaker 6>ourselves each other and especially the </v>

2812
02:06:39.511 --> 02:06:40.344
<v Speaker 6>brain tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the brain tissues apparently where we </v>

2813
02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:43.290
<v Speaker 6>could really differentiate it.</v>

2814
02:06:43.530 --> 02:06:47.010
<v Speaker 6>Like if you eat someone else's brain </v>
<v Speaker 6>tissue that's like the new Guinea,</v>

2815
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:50.380
<v Speaker 6>a neurological Jacobs Crutchfield,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>

2816
02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:54.030
<v Speaker 6>which affects cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like literally a fucking disease affects</v>

2817
02:06:54.031 --> 02:06:56.670
<v Speaker 6>cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good neurological disease.</v>

2818
02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:59.490
<v Speaker 6>When you eat brain matter from your own </v>
<v Speaker 6>species,</v>

2819
02:06:59.491 --> 02:07:00.324
<v Speaker 6>that's how they get it and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that's maybe that's the reason </v>

2820
02:07:03.361 --> 02:07:05.570
<v Speaker 6>why people stopped eating people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

2821
02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:09.350
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's nature discouraging that,</v>

2822
02:07:09.351 --> 02:07:11.190
<v Speaker 6>that this is an aberrant behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not.</v>

2823
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:12.223
<v Speaker 6>It's not what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not conducive to the survival of </v>

2824
02:07:13.501 --> 02:07:14.370
<v Speaker 6>the species.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2825
02:07:14.371 --> 02:07:16.040
<v Speaker 6>well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I could I,</v>

2826
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:18.300
<v Speaker 6>other than a cow where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2827
02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:20.010
<v Speaker 6>champ,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cow brain.</v>

2828
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.990
<v Speaker 6>Like a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's say there was normal cal.</v>

2829
02:07:21.991 --> 02:07:24.410
<v Speaker 6>Brandon didn't have mad cow disease,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no prions.</v>

2830
02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:26.430
<v Speaker 6>Could I eat that brand?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that okay for me?</v>

2831
02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:29.160
<v Speaker 6>Can I eat the normal rate?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you most certainly can eat,</v>

2832
02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:31.470
<v Speaker 6>people eat lamb's brains,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2853
02:08:18.221 --> 02:08:20.920
<v Speaker 2>obviously it would have to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of your species.</v>

2854
02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:21.813
<v Speaker 2>Imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if there was like magic and </v>

2855
02:08:24.101 --> 02:08:27.340
<v Speaker 2>brains and the more brains you ate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more power your brain had.</v>

2856
02:08:28.650 --> 02:08:30.380
<v Speaker 2>People have believed that it was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing time.</v>

2857
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the zombies,</v>

2858
02:08:33.130 --> 02:08:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I used to want brain that's called for </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains in the.</v>

2859
02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Not In the Romero flick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah.</v>

2860
02:08:38.670 --> 02:08:42.070
<v Speaker 2>We'll think about Ramiro's the modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>father of zombies,</v>

2861
02:08:42.071 --> 02:08:42.904
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2862
02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:44.013
<v Speaker 2>I mean there have been a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The concept of undead human has been </v>

2863
02:08:46.991 --> 02:08:49.660
<v Speaker 2>around forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but calling it a Zombie,</v>

2864
02:08:49.661 --> 02:08:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it comes out of the graveyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wants to eat your brains.</v>

2865
02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they ever said brains and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then moving the zombies.</v>

2866
02:08:55.631 --> 02:08:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Never say brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who did say brains?</v>

2867
02:08:57.731 --> 02:08:58.564
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think said brains?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First one that might have happened and </v>

2868
02:09:00.191 --> 02:09:03.130
<v Speaker 2>you could look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a.</v>

2869
02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:04.753
<v Speaker 2>is it revenge of the living dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had nothing to do with the living </v>

2870
02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:10.870
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember the scene in the cemetery where</v>

2871
02:09:10.871 --> 02:09:13.300
<v Speaker 2>the girl has sex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She takes her gear off like.</v>

2872
02:09:13.301 --> 02:09:14.134
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching that in early days </v>

2873
02:09:14.981 --> 02:09:15.400
<v Speaker 2>of cable.</v>

2874
02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:16.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

2875
02:09:16.061 --> 02:09:17.380
<v Speaker 2>she's going to have sex right here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the graveyard.</v>

2876
02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:20.620
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a Zombie attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That movie was great.</v>

2877
02:09:20.621 --> 02:09:21.454
<v Speaker 2>Really wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a fun movie and he's like </v>

2878
02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.010
<v Speaker 2>tongue in cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>

2879
02:09:25.011 --> 02:09:27.340
<v Speaker 2>It had like a hipness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something Fun and Shit.</v>

2880
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:29.560
<v Speaker 2>But it was pretty committed to it's Gore</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

2881
02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I've got to write that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Revenge of the living dead.</v>

2882
02:09:32.050 --> 02:09:32.883
<v Speaker 2>My childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't hate on zombies because I'm </v>

2883
02:09:35.861 --> 02:09:36.694
<v Speaker 2>bailing on the walking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go like I got to fulfill my Zombie </v>

2884
02:09:39.641 --> 02:09:41.350
<v Speaker 2>logos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is that?</v>

2885
02:09:41.351 --> 02:09:42.940
<v Speaker 2>What it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Return of the living dead.</v>

2886
02:09:42.970 --> 02:09:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 85.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2887
02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And what did say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh Oh.</v>

2888
02:09:47.590 --> 02:09:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was made by John Russo.</v>

2889
02:09:49.311 --> 02:09:50.144
<v Speaker 2>Parted ways and reach the agreement that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia would retain the rights to the </v>

2890
02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:53.673
<v Speaker 2>living dead suffix while Ramiro use </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreed to use of the dead in any </v>

2891
02:09:57.431 --> 02:09:59.180
<v Speaker 2>subsequent out.</v>

2892
02:09:59.750 --> 02:10:00.583
<v Speaker 2>Funny Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two dudes came up with </v>

2893
02:10:01.661 --> 02:10:03.670
<v Speaker 2>night the living dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>

2894
02:10:03.671 --> 02:10:08.420
<v Speaker 2>you take a living dead and I'll take of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whatever.</v>

2895
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:09.800
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Split.</v>

2896
02:10:09.850 --> 02:10:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Negotiated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

2897
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:14.560
<v Speaker 2>That seems rational though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Bad.</v>

2898
02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I like to think they did that with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>smile and they shook hands.</v>

2899
02:10:16.890 --> 02:10:19.000
<v Speaker 2>And do you think George Romero is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2900
02:10:19.001 --> 02:10:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I wish I'd put my zombies on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

2901
02:10:22.370 --> 02:10:23.203
<v Speaker 2>So that was what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it's not about zombies </v>

2902
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:26.700
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The zombies like there,</v>

2903
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:27.663
<v Speaker 2>go back to the little people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little people could they need human </v>

2904
02:10:30.431 --> 02:10:30.971
<v Speaker 2>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2905
02:10:30.971 --> 02:10:33.030
<v Speaker 2>That was the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we're.</v>

2906
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:33.990
<v Speaker 2>We got</v>

2907
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:36.650
<v Speaker 3>to finish that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that were human brains</v>

2908
02:10:36.651 --> 02:10:40.340
<v Speaker 3>is that those things might have preyed </v>
<v Speaker 3>on people and that we might've prayed on</v>

2909
02:10:40.341 --> 02:10:44.090
<v Speaker 3>them and that that might be also what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>did to the neanderthals.</v>

2910
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:45.103
<v Speaker 3>They found the end of towels apparently </v>
<v Speaker 3>that had some scouring marks inside </v>

2911
02:10:48.501 --> 02:10:51.950
<v Speaker 3>their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we might have some one in the past,</v>

2912
02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:52.963
<v Speaker 3>might have killed a neanderthal and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>ate him and broke his brain open and a </v>

2913
02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:58.220
<v Speaker 3>scoop of Greens cooked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2914
02:10:58.760 --> 02:10:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2915
02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:01.910
<v Speaker 3>Super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>

2916
02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:05.690
<v Speaker 3>super hard to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five hundred thousand years ago,</v>

2917
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:10.380
<v Speaker 3>the person that I wanted to win the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisons who didn't win the presidency.</v>

2918
02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:11.733
<v Speaker 3>There was a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude where you'd be eating neanderthals </v>

2919
02:11:13.491 --> 02:11:16.460
<v Speaker 3>brains and you're sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought I'd be here,</v>

2920
02:11:16.461 --> 02:11:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but you'd be doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

2921
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:22.160
<v Speaker 3>you would be one of the lucky ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>because most people,</v>

2922
02:11:22.161 --> 02:11:23.280
<v Speaker 3>they beat in your brain.</v>

2923
02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:25.130
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were eating the animal brains,</v>

2924
02:11:25.131 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 3>you've survived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2925
02:11:26.121 --> 02:11:29.030
<v Speaker 3>you clubbed in with that mastodon bone </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the fucking head while I was trying</v>

2926
02:11:29.031 --> 02:11:32.130
<v Speaker 3>to rape your mom or whatever the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>went wrong with those dark.</v>

2927
02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Can it just be just be like a first </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanksgiving story where like me and the</v>

2928
02:11:35.571 --> 02:11:37.460
<v Speaker 3>neanderthals like come to a common </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

2929
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:38.323
<v Speaker 3>You're eating is bread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me his brain and I give them some </v>

2930
02:11:40.311 --> 02:11:43.390
<v Speaker 3>wavy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dude who just fell here.</v>

2931
02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:46.880
<v Speaker 3>We have no need for me to his brain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like once a year we'll only do this once</v>

2932
02:11:46.881 --> 02:11:47.430
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2933
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:48.860
<v Speaker 3>We imagine if that was the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2934
02:11:48.890 --> 02:11:50.060
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to kill you.</v>

2935
02:11:50.070 --> 02:11:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Please don't kill us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if one of your guys dies,</v>

2936
02:11:52.191 --> 02:11:53.560
<v Speaker 3>can we eat them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>

2937
02:11:53.690 --> 02:11:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean call me crude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a bad deal.</v>

2938
02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the worst deal.</v>

2939
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:58.340
<v Speaker 3>And think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2940
02:11:58.341 --> 02:11:59.660
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do with them?</v>

2941
02:11:59.661 --> 02:12:00.261
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2942
02:12:00.261 --> 02:12:02.170
<v Speaker 3>There's the sentimentality and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>histology of like,</v>

2943
02:12:02.210 --> 02:12:02.691
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the debt,</v>

2944
02:12:02.691 --> 02:12:04.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you're just going to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the ground is going to rock.</v>

2945
02:12:04.401 --> 02:12:05.690
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A waste of energy.</v>

2946
02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:06.853
<v Speaker 3>So you give us your dead will give you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are dead and that will keep peace </v>

2947

<v Speaker 3>amongst the living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2948
02:12:11.151 --> 02:12:11.984
<v Speaker 3>We're onto a movie writer or a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of government in a world where </v>

2949
02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:16.340
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who needs a president?</v>

2950
02:12:16.370 --> 02:12:17.203
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the civilization civilization </v>

2951
02:12:19.611 --> 02:12:20.444
<v Speaker 3>stabilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of a Tibet and sky </v>

2952
02:12:22.491 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 3>funeral?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2953
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Do tell them here to freak the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

2954
02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:29.150
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] the way they handle it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tibet,</v>

2955
02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:31.820
<v Speaker 3>the Himalayas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take the body out,</v>

2956
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:35.420
<v Speaker 3>a score it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they chop it up into chunks and then the</v>

2957
02:12:35.421 --> 02:12:36.254
<v Speaker 3>vultures come in and they get it down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bone and then they smash the bones </v>

2958
02:12:40.581 --> 02:12:44.870
<v Speaker 3>up and then the vultures come in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they consume the bones and they do it.</v>

2959
02:12:44.871 --> 02:12:47.100
<v Speaker 3>All the images of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could watch it here.</v>

2960
02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Pull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It blew my mind.</v>

2961
02:12:48.051 --> 02:12:50.910
<v Speaker 3>As much as I'm less kind of a let down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at the end of the day.</v>

2962
02:12:53.070 --> 02:12:53.903
<v Speaker 3>This is how they deal with their dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feed them to literally feed them </v>

2963
02:12:56.931 --> 02:12:59.480
<v Speaker 3>two vultures and they film it and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>take photos of this.</v>

2964
02:12:59.481 --> 02:13:01.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like this intense ceremonies.</v>

2965
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:04.190
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Will,</v>

2966
02:13:04.191 --> 02:13:06.770
<v Speaker 3>you could see it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm having Jamie pull it up.</v>

2967
02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:08.390
<v Speaker 3>I thought this was like the pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the little.</v>

2968
02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:09.253
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2969
02:13:09.710 --> 02:13:13.100
<v Speaker 3>This is happening right now too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not going to put it up.</v>

2970
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:16.790
<v Speaker 3>No cemetery with the images because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of websites.</v>

2971
02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Skytap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some Tibetan sky funeral.</v>

2972
02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:21.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean we don't want to watch it </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>

2973
02:13:21.591 --> 02:13:23.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just like look at some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>images.</v>

2974
02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:24.710
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they filmed them now.</v>

2975
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:25.603
<v Speaker 3>It's like people can see the watch one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I have to choose between the </v>

2976
02:13:28.881 --> 02:13:29.331
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2977
02:13:29.331 --> 02:13:31.370
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be a little weird.</v>

2978
02:13:31.650 --> 02:13:33.000
<v Speaker 3>I'd write it up on youtube either </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

2979
02:13:33.001 --> 02:13:34.890
<v Speaker 3>but just give me the images so that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could see them.</v>

2980
02:13:35.130 --> 02:13:36.780
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just a,</v>

2981
02:13:36.781 --> 02:13:40.650
<v Speaker 3>a spinal chord in the left corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show the motherfucker,</v>

2982
02:13:40.651 --> 02:13:43.500
<v Speaker 3>this is just one of their dead monks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a regular person.</v>

2983
02:13:43.501 --> 02:13:44.334
<v Speaker 3>So rather than bury them in the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guy just getting picked apart </v>

2984
02:13:47.670 --> 02:13:50.160
<v Speaker 3>and then after they pick them apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these,</v>

2985
02:13:50.161 --> 02:13:50.994
<v Speaker 3>almost down to nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have the bones and they'll </v>

2986
02:13:53.370 --> 02:13:54.203
<v Speaker 3>take the bones and smash them and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds would come in and eat the bones </v>

2987
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:58.590
<v Speaker 3>and the birds know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>

2988
02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:01.260
<v Speaker 3>what you just clicked on Jamie up above </v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

2989
02:14:01.590 --> 02:14:03.990
<v Speaker 3>Like where you see the body right next </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

2990
02:14:03.991 --> 02:14:04.824
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

2991
02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:07.740
<v Speaker 3>So they taken this guy and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they treat them.</v>

2992
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Is that a dead human being?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

2993
02:14:08.970 --> 02:14:10.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of debt to human beings.</v>

2994
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:14.100
<v Speaker 3>They take these human beings that die in</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever part of the world.</v>

2995
02:14:14.101 --> 02:14:15.510
<v Speaker 3>This is in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2996
02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:20.560
<v Speaker 3>in Tibet and they cut their bodies up </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the vultures and they wear gloves.</v>

2997
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:21.773
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are modern people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he's got Levi's on and a belt and </v>

2998
02:14:24.511 --> 02:14:27.690
<v Speaker 3>he's chopping up this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person's body.</v>

2999
02:14:27.930 --> 02:14:28.763
<v Speaker 3>And then they leave it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go through those series of </v>

3000
02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:30.691
<v Speaker 3>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

3001
02:14:30.691 --> 02:14:32.590
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole series of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

3002
02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:34.590
<v Speaker 3>And you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3003
02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:35.483
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't ready for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tendency that shit just throwing </v>

3004
02:14:38.551 --> 02:14:40.380
<v Speaker 3>dead bodies out of the ball just become </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean.</v>

3005
02:14:40.410 --> 02:14:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got harder to.</v>

3006
02:14:41.950 --> 02:14:42.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they help because they want it to be </v>

3007
02:14:43.591 --> 02:14:47.790
<v Speaker 3>done within a good amount of time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the more it's chopped up like that,</v>

3008
02:14:47.791 --> 02:14:50.760
<v Speaker 3>the more vultures that will attract and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the quicker the whole process will be.</v>

3009
02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:52.140
<v Speaker 3>What is the reaction?</v>

3010
02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's Ooh squeamish or do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's a ego?</v>

3011
02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's just like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3012
02:14:57.751 --> 02:14:59.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm far more complex.</v>

3013
02:14:59.401 --> 02:15:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Like I've got way more going on in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and body.</v>

3014
02:15:01.681 --> 02:15:04.170
<v Speaker 3>I can't wind up as bird food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of the day,</v>

3015
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:06.450
<v Speaker 3>your fruit for something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>

3016
02:15:06.451 --> 02:15:08.970
<v Speaker 3>it's not the worst way to go because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gone.</v>

3017
02:15:09.090 --> 02:15:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean as long as you don't fucking like</v>

3018
02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:14.640
<v Speaker 3>at the mouth of something while you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>still alive.</v>

3019
02:15:14.641 --> 02:15:16.050
<v Speaker 3>But if they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3020
02:15:16.051 --> 02:15:19.680
<v Speaker 3>when you dead however you pass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to feed you to something else.</v>

3021
02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:22.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to think I'm okay with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular life.</v>

3022
02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Eat a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker.</v>

3023
02:15:23.551 --> 02:15:24.660
<v Speaker 3>They'd remember me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>

3024
02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:26.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fed the village for like men months.</v>

3025
02:15:27.570 --> 02:15:29.430
<v Speaker 3>You'd be amazed how quick they put you </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

3026
02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:34.260
<v Speaker 3>They'd eat you so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take the elephant like due to go fast.</v>

3027
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:36.000
<v Speaker 3>You'd you'd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd disappear in a second.</v>

3028
02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:36.893
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a dude who was in Africa when </v>

3029
02:15:38.041 --> 02:15:38.874
<v Speaker 3>someone is shot an elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said they just trumped that elephant </v>

3030
02:15:40.531 --> 02:15:43.950
<v Speaker 3>up to like a million pieces and handed </v>
<v Speaker 3>them out to all these villages that came</v>

3031
02:15:43.951 --> 02:15:46.500
<v Speaker 3>from far and wide to get elephant meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3032
02:15:46.530 --> 02:15:47.850
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everyone could eat.</v>

3033
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:48.541
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3034
02:15:48.541 --> 02:15:50.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll go have a bunch of people eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuts.</v>

3035
02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Some asshole was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3036
02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:54.210
<v Speaker 3>just to kill something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3037
02:15:54.211 --> 02:15:55.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Guy,</v>

3038
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:56.143
<v Speaker 3>the guy who killed the actual elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might've been one of those guys that </v>

3039
02:15:59.401 --> 02:16:01.510
<v Speaker 3>will just went there to kill an elephant</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then.</v>

3040
02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:05.190
<v Speaker 3>But when they killed the elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's such a catch 22,</v>

3041
02:16:05.191 --> 02:16:06.024
<v Speaker 3>but when they kill the elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very beneficial to the environment </v>

3042
02:16:08.011 --> 02:16:08.844
<v Speaker 3>because they have more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can pay for more of the park </v>

3043
02:16:10.891 --> 02:16:11.724
<v Speaker 3>rangers to protect the elephants against</v>
<v Speaker 3>poachers and then the people all around </v>

3044
02:16:14.431 --> 02:16:15.650
<v Speaker 3>the village get the meat.</v>

3045
02:16:15.930 --> 02:16:19.380
<v Speaker 3>This is the real thing is someplaces </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants are endangered,</v>

3046
02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:22.800
<v Speaker 3>but some places they decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people decide there's a surplus.</v>

3047
02:16:22.801 --> 02:16:23.634
<v Speaker 3>Those elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're trampling on people's </v>

3048
02:16:24.871 --> 02:16:27.030
<v Speaker 3>crops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are eating people's stuff.</v>

3049
02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:29.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>automatically you say like,</v>

3050
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:30.303
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should never kill off offense for </v>

3051
02:16:31.151 --> 02:16:31.984
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem is with some of </v>

3052
02:16:34.091 --> 02:16:37.300
<v Speaker 3>these extremely poor people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants invade their crops.</v>

3053
02:16:37.301 --> 02:16:38.134
<v Speaker 3>You can't do a God damn thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those are the people that want help </v>

3054
02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.390
<v Speaker 3>and then they hire someone to come and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill an elephant.</v>

3055
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is very fucked up.</v>

3056
02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Way more complex than way more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complaint.</v>

3057
02:16:47.321 --> 02:16:49.470
<v Speaker 3>My teenage daughter may painted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3058
02:16:49.471 --> 02:16:50.304
<v Speaker 3>I mean we would all like to think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings and elephants live so far </v>

3059
02:16:53.561 --> 02:16:55.240
<v Speaker 3>away from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was a nonissue.</v>

3060
02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:59.260
<v Speaker 3>When we just let the elephant survive </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there in the wild and leave them the</v>

3061
02:16:59.261 --> 02:17:00.550
<v Speaker 3>fuck alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we'd all like,</v>

3062
02:17:00.551 --> 02:17:01.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3063
02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:02.073
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they do live with people and they </v>

3064
02:17:04.481 --> 02:17:05.314
<v Speaker 3>live with people that are super poor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live with people that have houses </v>

3065
02:17:07.721 --> 02:17:08.554
<v Speaker 3>that are made out of fucking hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are people too in this bill </v>

3066
02:17:11.531 --> 02:17:12.180
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3067
02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:14.000
<v Speaker 3>If it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

3068
02:17:14.850 --> 02:17:16.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not all.</v>

3069
02:17:16.481 --> 02:17:20.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not always that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of it is trophy hunting.</v>

3070
02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:23.620
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of it is poachers trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to steal ivory and there's a lot of real</v>

3071
02:17:23.621 --> 02:17:24.454
<v Speaker 3>darkness to killing elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it and ideally no one </v>

3072
02:17:27.881 --> 02:17:29.620
<v Speaker 3>should ever have to kill an elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>

3073
02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:30.473
<v Speaker 3>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want those people to kill </v>

3074
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.450
<v Speaker 3>elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3075
02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:33.513
<v Speaker 3>someone's got to figure out a way to at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least capture them and make it valuable </v>

3076
02:17:38.801 --> 02:17:39.634
<v Speaker 3>to transport them to some other part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa where they're not going to kill </v>

3077
02:17:41.921 --> 02:17:44.290
<v Speaker 3>this guy or tramples and eat all of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>crops.</v>

3078
02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:45.313
<v Speaker 3>Unless you don't give a fuck about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy you know and you don't care and you </v>

3079
02:17:49.210 --> 02:17:49.901
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3080
02:17:49.901 --> 02:17:50.734
<v Speaker 3>that guy's going to have to starve to </v>
<v Speaker 3>death because the elephant is just as </v>

3081
02:17:53.081 --> 02:17:55.510
<v Speaker 3>important as a living organism as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy is.</v>

3082
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:56.650
<v Speaker 3>Which is another argument,</v>

3083
02:17:56.930 --> 02:17:59.420
<v Speaker 7>something to fall in order for you to </v>
<v Speaker 7>rise.</v>

3084
02:18:00.270 --> 02:18:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I see how people think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

3085
02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I understand where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3086
02:18:04.430 --> 02:18:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3087
02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more into people.</v>

3088
02:18:07.410 --> 02:18:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I like people more than any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>

3089
02:18:09.570 --> 02:18:11.700
<v Speaker 3>but I love other animals too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get where they're coming from.</v>

3090
02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3091
02:18:13.470 --> 02:18:15.040
<v Speaker 3>it's complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3092
02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:16.093
<v Speaker 3>Eight in any animals complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my buddy Brian just kill a rat in </v>

3093
02:18:20.551 --> 02:18:23.280
<v Speaker 3>his house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a rat trap and kill a rat.</v>

3094
02:18:23.610 --> 02:18:24.690
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

3095
02:18:24.691 --> 02:18:26.130
<v Speaker 3>you got them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's good.</v>

3096
02:18:26.131 --> 02:18:27.690
<v Speaker 3>And I sent them a text message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got them.</v>

3097
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:29.063
<v Speaker 3>And then I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's one of the few animals so you </v>

3098
02:18:30.331 --> 02:18:31.950
<v Speaker 3>could cheer for it's murder</v>

3099
02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:35.160
<v Speaker 7>and people back up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody backs you up.</v>

3100
02:18:35.161 --> 02:18:38.250
<v Speaker 7>You showed a picture of a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you killed with a trap.</v>

3101
02:18:38.430 --> 02:18:39.580
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ah.</v>

3102
02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:41.130
<v Speaker 7>It must have been satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3103
02:18:41.131 --> 02:18:43.350
<v Speaker 7>Well done man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck Outta grosses me out.</v>

3104
02:18:43.410 --> 02:18:44.243
<v Speaker 3>If you're watching TV and you hear stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like motherfucker and you go </v>

3105
02:18:48.601 --> 02:18:51.870
<v Speaker 3>in the kitchen and you got a fat rat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are happy.</v>

3106
02:18:52.610 --> 02:18:53.241
<v Speaker 7>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3107
02:18:53.241 --> 02:18:54.074
<v Speaker 7>we live out in the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We live in the Hollywood hills and </v>

3108
02:18:55.491 --> 02:18:58.130
<v Speaker 7>sometimes it gets dry and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>rats fucking.</v>

3109
02:18:58.131 --> 02:19:00.050
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's one of those things that like,</v>

3110
02:19:00.051 --> 02:19:02.630
<v Speaker 7>I grew up in New Jersey and you would </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagine that,</v>

3111
02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:03.553
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>according to every joke you've ever </v>

3112
02:19:04.641 --> 02:19:05.474
<v Speaker 7>heard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's where I would have encountered a </v>

3113
02:19:06.111 --> 02:19:08.090
<v Speaker 7>rat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Never encountered a rat in my life until</v>

3114
02:19:08.630 --> 02:19:09.463
<v Speaker 7>I lived in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so you're living in the hills and </v>

3115
02:19:11.451 --> 02:19:12.201
<v Speaker 7>the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3116
02:19:12.201 --> 02:19:13.034
<v Speaker 7>I lived in the suburbs of Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There weren't a lot of rats and we by </v>

3117
02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:16.060
<v Speaker 7>the water too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Flow.</v>

3118
02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:17.910
<v Speaker 7>So the rats,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if there were rats,</v>

3119
02:19:17.930 --> 02:19:19.970
<v Speaker 7>they lived in the rocks by the water and</v>
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>

3120
02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:23.210
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there were a lot more efficient in those</v>

3121
02:19:23.210 --> 02:19:25.880
<v Speaker 7>days as opposed to lately.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>

3122
02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:26.953
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck.</v>

3123
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:30.500
<v Speaker 7>Was I going with the rats?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So until,</v>

3124
02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:31.453
<v Speaker 7>until I got to Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they come out of the hills because it's </v>

3125
02:19:32.751 --> 02:19:36.950
<v Speaker 7>dry and we got a pool and water tracks </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that cream.</v>

3126
02:19:36.970 --> 02:19:38.480
<v Speaker 7>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you think like,</v>

3127
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:40.640
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I ever had a rat in my house,</v>

3128
02:19:40.641 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 7>I'd fucking go ape shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then suddenly you know,</v>

3129
02:19:43.940 --> 02:19:44.773
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

3130
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:46.103
<v Speaker 7>we are a house that gets rats in it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's not like the stereotype that </v>

3131
02:19:49.431 --> 02:19:53.600
<v Speaker 7>you always think of where it's like we </v>
<v Speaker 7>live like pigs and the filth everywhere.</v>

3132
02:19:53.601 --> 02:19:57.140
<v Speaker 7>It's just like they're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking food and yeah,</v>

3133
02:19:57.141 --> 02:19:57.974
<v Speaker 7>that's the creepy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'd be sitting in your office and you </v>

3134
02:19:59.481 --> 02:20:02.010
<v Speaker 7>hear some things in a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:03.460
<v Speaker 7>And you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh my God.</v>

3136
02:20:03.461 --> 02:20:05.390
<v Speaker 7>And they got,</v>
<v Speaker 7>once they get in,</v>

3137
02:20:05.391 --> 02:20:08.180
<v Speaker 7>they get the inside of your house down </v>
<v Speaker 7>to a system in science,</v>

3138
02:20:08.181 --> 02:20:09.014
<v Speaker 7>unless you plug all the holes and we've </v>
<v Speaker 7>had to go through that thing where you </v>

3139
02:20:10.341 --> 02:20:12.620
<v Speaker 7>plug all the holes and then the </v>
<v Speaker 7>skittering stops.</v>

3140
02:20:12.621 --> 02:20:13.454
<v Speaker 7>You never hear it again.</v>

3141
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will camp out in your house if it's</v>

3142
02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:18.500
<v Speaker 3>a safe spot to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where we live now.</v>

3143
02:20:18.530 --> 02:20:19.363
<v Speaker 3>Didn't make it a little nest in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you have insulation in </v>

3144
02:20:21.171 --> 02:20:26.030
<v Speaker 3>your attic like the nest and that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

3145
02:20:26.031 --> 02:20:26.631
<v Speaker 3>But you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3146
02:20:26.631 --> 02:20:28.070
<v Speaker 3>People get like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3147
02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:29.660
<v Speaker 3>that's an animal that you're allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill.</v>

3148
02:20:29.661 --> 02:20:32.090
<v Speaker 3>So like elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no rat.</v>

3149
02:20:32.091 --> 02:20:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3150
02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:34.660
<v Speaker 3>like tiger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3151
02:20:35.370 --> 02:20:37.730
<v Speaker 3>You know like mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3152
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Comes back to we have rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3153
02:20:40.970 --> 02:20:41.803
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always gonna be a guideline </v>

3154
02:20:42.141 --> 02:20:42.974
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found a mouse the other day and I've </v>

3155
02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:50.420
<v Speaker 3>got one of those little pills with a mop</v>
<v Speaker 3>for barbecuing a little in the mop thing</v>

3156
02:20:51.951 --> 02:20:52.784
<v Speaker 3>was sitting there and I saw this little </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker run up the top and go into </v>

3157
02:20:55.311 --> 02:20:56.480
<v Speaker 3>the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3158
02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:58.610
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a mouse in that thing.</v>

3159
02:20:58.611 --> 02:20:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3160
02:20:59.721 --> 02:21:00.260
<v Speaker 3>that's gross.</v>

3161
02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:01.790
<v Speaker 3>He's going to shit all over that little </v>
<v Speaker 3>brush.</v>

3162
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:04.220
<v Speaker 3>So I took them over to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I picked up the bucket.</v>

3163
02:21:04.221 --> 02:21:05.054
<v Speaker 3>I took them over to the fence and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>emptied them out on the other side and </v>

3164
02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:10.370
<v Speaker 3>he fell and he just hit the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just stand there like,</v>

3165
02:21:10.371 --> 02:21:11.204
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he just slowly started walking off </v>

3166
02:21:16.191 --> 02:21:17.024
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he knew what the fuck </v>

3167
02:21:17.481 --> 02:21:18.314
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3168
02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:20.030
<v Speaker 3>But immediately I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

3169
02:21:20.031 --> 02:21:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I should have fed them to my chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean a chicken?</v>

3170
02:21:22.941 --> 02:21:25.820
<v Speaker 3>Would he have mouse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude,</v>

3171
02:21:25.821 --> 02:21:28.220
<v Speaker 3>would they eat a mouse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go after them,</v>

3172
02:21:28.430 --> 02:21:31.310
<v Speaker 3>like raptors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like raptors in Jurassic Park.</v>

3173
02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Like what you would imagine should get </v>
<v Speaker 3>us to eat.</v>

3174
02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:34.873
<v Speaker 3>Mice are straight up dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you remember that scene in Jurassic </v>

3175

<v Speaker 3>And they fight over them.</v>

3179
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:51.110
<v Speaker 3>They all know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they run after each other,</v>

3180
02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:54.170
<v Speaker 3>like they stole it from the fucking cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that cat.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what part of the world I live in?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>where is it?</v>

3246
02:24:19.470 --> 02:24:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Because you hear kids talking and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely got.</v>

3247
02:24:21.781 --> 02:24:22.614
<v Speaker 2>They got an accent.</v>

3248
02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:28.253
<v Speaker 2>You hear kids talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an accent or they could hear </v>

3249
02:24:29.850 --> 02:24:33.230
<v Speaker 2>the kids going do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bonnie and stuff like that.</v>

3250
02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Like England or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Quite England,</v>

3251
02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:38.940
<v Speaker 2>but like definitely Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look to even on the rocks.</v>

3252
02:24:38.941 --> 02:24:42.240
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker's not done from hell's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

3253
02:24:42.241 --> 02:24:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I stab at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't say it says save babies.</v>

3254
02:24:45.601 --> 02:24:48.020
<v Speaker 2>She didn't save him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fucking thing.</v>

3255
02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Killed a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might've saved one.</v>

3256
02:24:50.370 --> 02:24:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe click on and see if like somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an explanation or something like</v>

3257
02:24:53.821 --> 02:24:55.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe that's what they told the kids.</v>

3258
02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:58.860
<v Speaker 2>She saved the babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't see any movement there.</v>

3259
02:24:59.310 --> 02:25:01.200
<v Speaker 2>To me that was the story of a mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming home.</v>

3260
02:25:01.201 --> 02:25:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Seeing your kids dead and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna fucking kill you.</v>

3261
02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:06.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very human story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really think about that in the</v>

3262
02:25:06.481 --> 02:25:09.000
<v Speaker 2>animal kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like that's very human.</v>

3263
02:25:09.250 --> 02:25:10.083
<v Speaker 2>I mean there it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is revenge or whether she just </v>

3264
02:25:12.271 --> 02:25:13.104
<v Speaker 2>knew that if that thing was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it presented a threat to the other baby </v>

3265
02:25:16.201 --> 02:25:18.150
<v Speaker 2>and she had to kill it because if she </v>
<v Speaker 2>let it go,</v>

3266
02:25:18.151 --> 02:25:18.984
<v Speaker 2>eventually she would have to leave to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back to get food and maybe it'd be </v>

3267
02:25:21.601 --> 02:25:23.290
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would find out where it was.</v>

3268
02:25:23.291 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she knew that</v>

3269
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.970
<v Speaker 3>it was in the middle of like the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment of your fucking life.</v>

3270
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:29.050
<v Speaker 3>We've just lost two kids and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3271
02:25:29.051 --> 02:25:31.180
<v Speaker 3>I still have to fucking kill this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to death.</v>

3272
02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise it'll come back and take my </v>
<v Speaker 3>other baby may be me in the night.</v>

3273
02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:35.993
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like so poorly equipped for battle </v>

3274
02:25:38.201 --> 02:25:39.034
<v Speaker 3>to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All fluffy and shit with nothing but </v>

3275
02:25:41.351 --> 02:25:43.520
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look what happens.</v>

3276
02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Like almost unleashed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like grabbing and kicking,</v>

3277
02:25:47.861 --> 02:25:52.050
<v Speaker 3>scratching like apparently until you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just going that fucking room.</v>

3278
02:25:52.270 --> 02:25:54.280
<v Speaker 3>And that snake was a pretty nasty </v>
<v Speaker 3>customer,</v>

3279
02:25:54.281 --> 02:25:55.330
<v Speaker 3>but he was still like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

3280
02:25:55.331 --> 02:25:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking done.</v>

3281
02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:03.480
<v Speaker 3>Serpents and snakes and lizards and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>those unfeeling cold things.</v>

3282
02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:08.920
<v Speaker 3>You know that that existed before time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chickens are in that group,</v>

3283
02:26:08.921 --> 02:26:09.754
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in that group.</v>

3285
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.771
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't.</v>

3286
02:26:11.771 --> 02:26:13.960
<v Speaker 3>You don't realize it until you see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tear of mouse,</v>

3287
02:26:13.961 --> 02:26:14.980
<v Speaker 3>part primordial.</v>

3288
02:26:15.130 --> 02:26:17.590
<v Speaker 3>They're like raptors there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jurassic Park.</v>

3289
02:26:17.591 --> 02:26:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Raptors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just little.</v>

3290
02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:21.610
<v Speaker 3>You see them in the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opened doors and shit with lucky.</v>

3291
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.070
<v Speaker 3>They're not that smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're smart enough to like if I,</v>

3292
02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:26.740
<v Speaker 3>if I have rocks around my house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pick up a rock,</v>

3293
02:26:26.741 --> 02:26:29.140
<v Speaker 3>the chickens will go towards it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the bugs under it.</v>

3294
02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figured that out.</v>

3295
02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not about being smart.</v>

3296
02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:37.250
<v Speaker 3>It's about that lizard brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they mostly are there.</v>

3297
02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:38.213
<v Speaker 3>They're omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mostly eat grain because most of </v>

3298
02:26:40.181 --> 02:26:41.014
<v Speaker 3>them are being kept by people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best way for you to feed </v>

3299
02:26:43.091 --> 02:26:43.924
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you let them lose feed every </v>

3300
02:26:45.161 --> 02:26:48.460
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing that moves everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every bug,</v>

3301
02:26:48.490 --> 02:26:50.000
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every state,</v>

3302
02:26:50.001 --> 02:26:51.250
<v Speaker 3>snails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>

3303
02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:52.640
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3304
02:26:52.641 --> 02:26:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Whatever's on the ground dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And apparently they caught a mouse.</v>

3305
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:57.790
<v Speaker 3>The fight to the death over that mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It chase each other,</v>

3306
02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:58.943
<v Speaker 3>clawed out of each other's mouths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're little eating machine with a </v>

3307
02:27:00.881 --> 02:27:02.650
<v Speaker 3>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3308
02:27:02.651 --> 02:27:05.350
<v Speaker 3>They need each other for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pick holes in each other.</v>

3309
02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:06.790
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that just picking holes?</v>

3310
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:09.220
<v Speaker 3>A few chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd eat the shit out of it.</v>

3311
02:27:09.221 --> 02:27:10.054
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He cooked some chicken and let it or </v>

3312
02:27:11.310 --> 02:27:14.110
<v Speaker 3>made raw chicken and put it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get the fuck out of it.</v>

3313
02:27:14.350 --> 02:27:16.950
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't even think it would.</v>

3314
02:27:20.650 --> 02:27:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Then they go open a kitchen door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not smart.</v>

3315
02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:25.573
<v Speaker 3>I'm 22.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it irritate you to watch Jurassic </v>

3316
02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Park where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where to fucking feathers,</v>

3317
02:27:30.731 --> 02:27:33.490
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know these things now.</v>

3318
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.870
<v Speaker 3>Now drastic world just recently did have</v>
<v Speaker 3>feathers.</v>

3319
02:27:37.930 --> 02:27:38.763
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no feathers.</v>

3320
02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:39.161
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3321
02:27:39.161 --> 02:27:39.994
<v Speaker 3>it's probably too hard like CGI wise </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't use just one big </v>

3322
02:27:42.941 --> 02:27:45.550
<v Speaker 3>texture that's going to definitely </v>
<v Speaker 3>flowing cash grab.</v>

3323
02:27:45.610 --> 02:27:48.660
<v Speaker 3>Like when they reboot the franchise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be the best source.</v>

3324
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:50.260
<v Speaker 3>We finally got feathers on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

3325
02:27:50.261 --> 02:27:52.510
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking historically accurate </v>
<v Speaker 3>memory.</v>

3326
02:27:52.511 --> 02:27:53.344
<v Speaker 3>When we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbus discovered America and </v>

3327
02:27:55.151 --> 02:27:56.820
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs were green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3328
02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:01.620
<v Speaker 3>The good old days were the days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the days and now they're off.</v>

3329
02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:05.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a museum of Montana dinosaur </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3330
02:28:05.501 --> 02:28:06.334
<v Speaker 3>I'll be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understood it and was that in as much </v>

3331
02:28:08.290 --> 02:28:12.010
<v Speaker 3>as you find a bunch of bones and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you extrapolate what it looked like?</v>

3332
02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:12.993
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean it depends on the extent of </v>

3333
02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:15.933
<v Speaker 3>what you're finding on the lake there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be like some sort of </v>

3334
02:28:19.031 --> 02:28:22.190
<v Speaker 3>consensus on what actually is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaur.</v>

3335
02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Like how much of this belongs to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same animal,</v>

3336
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:25.543
<v Speaker 3>especially because you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fossilized remains and the problem with </v>

3337
02:28:27.981 --> 02:28:30.560
<v Speaker 3>fossilized remains or it's not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bone anymore.</v>

3338
02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:31.823
<v Speaker 3>Like the bone disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's replaced by minerals and it makes </v>

3339
02:28:33.771 --> 02:28:34.820
<v Speaker 3>us rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3340
02:28:34.821 --> 02:28:38.090
<v Speaker 3>So you can't really do DNA tests on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the most part.</v>

3341
02:28:38.091 --> 02:28:41.990
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to find enough of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>laid out in the same way where you agree</v>

3342
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:44.030
<v Speaker 3>this was this animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3343
02:28:44.031 --> 02:28:44.864
<v Speaker 3>and they've changed that over the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning of the first </v>

3344
02:28:47.961 --> 02:28:48.794
<v Speaker 3>discoveries of dinosaurs to today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now they've been doing it for so </v>

3345
02:28:50.631 --> 02:28:52.130
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were pretty good idea.</v>

3346
02:28:52.131 --> 02:28:54.170
<v Speaker 3>And then every now and then they find a </v>
<v Speaker 3>new one and they go,</v>

3347
02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:55.370
<v Speaker 3>we'll check out this motherfucker.</v>

3348
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:57.140
<v Speaker 3>What does he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again I got get,</v>

3349
02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:58.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll grant you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Liz,</v>

3350
02:28:58.821 --> 02:29:00.830
<v Speaker 3>would his bones would look like if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>put it together?</v>

3351
02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:03.260
<v Speaker 3>But how do they get to like it's skin </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like this.</v>

3352
02:29:03.261 --> 02:29:04.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

3353
02:29:04.521 --> 02:29:09.320
<v Speaker 3>So it was all bullshit speculation for </v>
<v Speaker 3>us and now at least they're gone.</v>

3354
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:11.900
<v Speaker 3>We think it's got feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's got feathers.</v>

3355
02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:15.390
<v Speaker 3>One guy had a really cool idea about t </v>
<v Speaker 3>rex.</v>

3356
02:29:15.391 --> 02:29:18.870
<v Speaker 3>The t rex would have like vulture colors</v>
<v Speaker 3>the t rex did it because it was.</v>

3357
02:29:19.010 --> 02:29:19.843
<v Speaker 3>They think that T-rex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some people think that he was a </v>

3358
02:29:22.821 --> 02:29:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Predator and other people think that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a scavenger.</v>

3359
02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:28.580
<v Speaker 3>And if one of the reasons why they think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's a scavengers,</v>

3360
02:29:28.581 --> 02:29:30.410
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at it the way his body's built</v>

3361
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:32.840
<v Speaker 3>that like you couldn't possibly run very</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast.</v>

3362
02:29:32.841 --> 02:29:34.700
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't really possibly chase things</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

3363
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:37.970
<v Speaker 3>He's really super awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's other people that point</v>

3364
02:29:37.971 --> 02:29:38.804
<v Speaker 3>to the idea that the atmosphere itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>was very different back then and it </v>

3365
02:29:42.291 --> 02:29:43.124
<v Speaker 3>might have been much richer and thicker </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it actually might have been able to </v>

3366
02:29:46.161 --> 02:29:51.161
<v Speaker 3>support an animal like that easier in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of its size in terms of its size,</v>

3367
02:29:51.561 --> 02:29:54.170
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the amount of life on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet itself,</v>

3368
02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:57.680
<v Speaker 3>that that animal was so large and </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumed so much,</v>

3369
02:29:57.920 --> 02:29:58.753
<v Speaker 3>but everything was so large back then </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything consumed so much back </v>

3370
02:30:00.981 --> 02:30:01.814
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were so many examples of these </v>

3371
02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:04.610
<v Speaker 3>mega animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3372
02:30:04.611 --> 02:30:05.444
<v Speaker 3>Like brontosaurus fucking Allosaurus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>t rex and these crazy gigantic fucking </v>

3373
02:30:10.941 --> 02:30:14.450
<v Speaker 3>things roaming the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This speculation is that life was.</v>

3374
02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:15.313
<v Speaker 3>There was more richness of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was more life and so the animals </v>

3375
02:30:18.591 --> 02:30:21.440
<v Speaker 3>that consumed life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's in the form of plants,</v>

3376
02:30:21.441 --> 02:30:23.940
<v Speaker 3>like a brontosaurus or in meet like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3377
02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:24.783
<v Speaker 3>a t rex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just got bigger and bigger and </v>

3378
02:30:26.031 --> 02:30:27.890
<v Speaker 3>bigger because there was so much to </v>
<v Speaker 3>consume.</v>

3379
02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:30.950
<v Speaker 3>There was no need to like hold back </v>
<v Speaker 3>their size.</v>

3380
02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like if you're a champ or if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a human,</v>

3381
02:30:33.451 --> 02:30:35.600
<v Speaker 3>like there's only so much you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more you eat,</v>

3382
02:30:35.601 --> 02:30:38.990
<v Speaker 3>we've shown the more people eat and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more prosperous nation,</v>

3383
02:30:38.991 --> 02:30:40.730
<v Speaker 3>the larger the people start to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3384
02:30:41.060 --> 02:30:41.893
<v Speaker 3>and so I think that it's entirely </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible that that's the case with the </v>

3385
02:30:45.291 --> 02:30:47.450
<v Speaker 3>world back then that the whole world was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

3386
02:30:47.451 --> 02:30:50.360
<v Speaker 3>It just supported bigger things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just more life,</v>

3387
02:30:50.390 --> 02:30:53.480
<v Speaker 3>more green life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more animals for t rex to eat and it was</v>

3388
02:30:53.481 --> 02:30:54.314
<v Speaker 3>just this big fucking thick oxygenated </v>
<v Speaker 3>soup of life that nobody was lizard </v>

3389
02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:02.893
<v Speaker 3>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll more probably bird in lizard </v>

3390
02:31:05.811 --> 02:31:06.644
<v Speaker 3>because today we have crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have Komodo dragons and we have </v>

3391
02:31:10.491 --> 02:31:15.491
<v Speaker 3>chickens and we have eagles and Eagle is</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking clearly a lot like a dinosaur,</v>

3392
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:16.603
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy ass thing with swords on its </v>

3393
02:31:18.681 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 3>fingers and death</v>

3394
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.980
<v Speaker 6>in its eyes and it swoops down and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>got the strength to catch a fucking fish</v>

3395
02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:28.530
<v Speaker 6>in the water and pull it out and fly </v>
<v Speaker 6>with it.</v>

3396
02:31:28.740 --> 02:31:29.573
<v Speaker 6>They can catch goats and pulled them off</v>
<v Speaker 6>the side of cliffs and watch them fall </v>

3397
02:31:32.611 --> 02:31:36.230
<v Speaker 6>and smash on the rocks below.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do it as a strategy in order to get</v>

3398
02:31:36.570 --> 02:31:38.130
<v Speaker 6>to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It will knock it down.</v>

3399
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:39.750
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've heard,</v>

3400
02:31:39.770 --> 02:31:43.110
<v Speaker 6>I've never seen videos,</v>

<v Speaker 6>on the rocks down below.</v>

3403
02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:53.940

<v Speaker 6>As a filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm fine.</v>

3414
02:32:25.950 --> 02:32:28.170
<v Speaker 6>A swooped down.</v>

3420
02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:48.913
<v Speaker 6>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He literally follows it to the rocks to </v>

3421
02:32:51.651 --> 02:32:55.520
<v Speaker 6>make sure it lands on its head and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>boom all the way to the ground.</v>

3422
02:32:55.521 --> 02:32:56.354
<v Speaker 6>So this is a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a strategy for eating these </v>

3423
02:32:58.731 --> 02:33:01.220
<v Speaker 6>goats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he'll go down there and now,</v>

<v Speaker 6>With a goat.</v>

3431
02:33:24.980 --> 02:33:27.740
<v Speaker 6>Maybe if he got a good hold of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't have to throw it.</v>

3432
02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:29.970
<v Speaker 6>If you couldn't carry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't carry it.</v>

02:33:56.211 --> 02:34:00.950
<v Speaker 6>Venezuelan eagles called Harpy Eagles </v>

3462
02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:10.090
<v Speaker 6>I would have never thought that eagles </v>
<v Speaker 6>were so fearsome to wolves.</v>

3463
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:13.670
<v Speaker 6>They thought wolves would fucking eagle </v>
<v Speaker 6>up if you would turn around and bite it,</v>

3464
02:35:13.671 --> 02:35:14.504
<v Speaker 6>set up at the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe a wolf dude wolfs are for </v>

<v Speaker 6>neck and pierces him with his claws.</v>

3471
02:35:32.470 --> 02:35:35.820

<v Speaker 6>those knives and just sticks those </v>

3475
02:35:44.021 --> 02:35:46.020
<v Speaker 6>knives in his neck.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Why don't they try to eat the man?</v>

3485
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:11.070
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>

3486
02:36:11.130 --> 02:36:13.110
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how long before they're like,</v>

3487
02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:15.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we could keep attacking these walls that</v>

3488
02:36:15.451 --> 02:36:16.830
<v Speaker 6>we could turn it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hit the dude in the hat.</v>

3489
02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:18.900
<v Speaker 6>Well maybe if the dude keeps bringing </v>
<v Speaker 6>them wolves,</v>

3490
02:36:18.901 --> 02:36:19.880
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look guys,</v>

<v Speaker 6>didn't bring me a fucking wolf.</v>

3493
02:36:23.791 --> 02:36:26.060
<v Speaker 6>There are wolves out there for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>taking just like they're humans.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I could be picking the spool off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can turn around and you just fucking </v>

3495
02:36:28.411 --> 02:36:29.820
<v Speaker 6>eyes out to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good point.</v>

3496
02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:31.650
<v Speaker 6>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're making a lot of sense today.</v>

3497
02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:38.180
<v Speaker 6>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm well.</v>

3498
02:36:38.181 --> 02:36:40.350
<v Speaker 6>What are we going to look up before?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to look up that.</v>

3499
02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:43.233
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Harpy Eagle that swoops down and </v>

3500
02:36:44.310 --> 02:36:47.940
<v Speaker 6>kills monkeys as one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 6>we look up all the time.</v>

3501
02:36:47.941 --> 02:36:48.774
<v Speaker 6>Apparently people look up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have a consistent like instinct to </v>

3502
02:36:52.231 --> 02:36:54.090
<v Speaker 6>look up like you're in the forest or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

3503
02:36:54.091 --> 02:36:54.924
<v Speaker 6>You look up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the main reasons is they think </v>

3504
02:36:56.971 --> 02:36:57.804
<v Speaker 6>that there's an ancient instinct that we</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to protect ourselves from flying </v>

3505
02:37:01.231 --> 02:37:04.200
<v Speaker 6>raptors because they found,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3506
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:07.200
<v Speaker 6>old hominids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like not necessarily humans,</v>

3507
02:37:07.201 --> 02:37:08.034
<v Speaker 6>but in the human tree that had predation</v>
<v Speaker 6>marks from eagles and the inside of </v>

3508
02:37:11.461 --> 02:37:15.240
<v Speaker 6>their skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it came from that.</v>

3509
02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:16.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>From Eagles,</v>

3510
02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:20.510
<v Speaker 3>from Eagle swooping down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in larger equals.</v>

3511
02:37:20.511 --> 02:37:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look up a shit.</v>

3512
02:37:21.770 --> 02:37:22.131
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3513
02:37:22.131 --> 02:37:24.560
<v Speaker 3>not look up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you look for danger?</v>

3514
02:37:25.340 --> 02:37:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll use google to like,</v>

3515
02:37:27.111 --> 02:37:28.510
<v Speaker 3>come on mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Google everything.</v>

3516
02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I need references.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No I don't,</v>

3517
02:37:31.551 --> 02:37:34.280
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it's an instant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mostly in the woods,</v>

3518
02:37:34.281 --> 02:37:35.114
<v Speaker 3>like looking around in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently when you go to the </v>

3519
02:37:36.591 --> 02:37:37.280
<v Speaker 3>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3520
02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.430
<v Speaker 3>there's an instinct to look up that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to cats to potentially,</v>

3521
02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:44.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time big cats are not hiding</v>

3522
02:37:44.091 --> 02:37:47.340
<v Speaker 3>in the trees and they come down and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking cats.</v>

3523
02:37:47.350 --> 02:37:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about the ticks up because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3524
02:37:50.130 --> 02:37:51.440
<v Speaker 3>ticks ticks in my hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3525
02:37:51.441 --> 02:37:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Somebody you have to use a big later </v>
<v Speaker 3>burned lyme disease.</v>

3526
02:37:53.841 --> 02:37:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a dark and silent killer.</v>

3527
02:37:56.810 --> 02:38:00.070
<v Speaker 3>And it was something we shit develop in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our lifetime.</v>

3528
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I right about that didn't exist when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a kid.</v>

3529
02:38:02.421 --> 02:38:04.790
<v Speaker 3>And then one day somebody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get bit by a deer tick,</v>

3530
02:38:04.791 --> 02:38:06.590
<v Speaker 3>it'd be fucked up for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3531
02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:08.650
<v Speaker 3>mono times a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:11.540
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy who got lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>misdiagnosed.</v>

3533
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:12.403
<v Speaker 3>Steven Kotler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guest on the podcast really </v>

3534
02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:14.684
<v Speaker 3>recently misdiagnosed for about a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wound up spending three years in the </v>

3535
02:38:19.281 --> 02:38:20.114
<v Speaker 3>hospital because of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years in the hospital because of </v>

3536
02:38:23.331 --> 02:38:26.120
<v Speaker 3>lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrecked his immune system because of the</v>

3537
02:38:26.121 --> 02:38:29.390
<v Speaker 3>misdiagnosis of over a year and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different doctors had told them it</v>

3538
02:38:29.391 --> 02:38:31.580
<v Speaker 3>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that that's what it is.</v>

3539
02:38:31.581 --> 02:38:33.020
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be going crazy.</v>

3540
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:37.280
<v Speaker 3>One doctor told him he had aids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you fucking Dr you have aids?</v>

3541
02:38:37.290 --> 02:38:38.123
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3542
02:38:38.290 --> 02:38:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3543
02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:40.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the time where a lot of people </v>

3544
02:38:41.211 --> 02:38:43.220
<v Speaker 3>had aids and he was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what it was like.</v>

3545
02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:44.053
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3546
02:38:44.210 --> 02:38:45.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it's lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like was like,</v>

3547
02:38:45.741 --> 02:38:46.490
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a.</v>

3548
02:38:46.490 --> 02:38:48.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

3549
02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:50.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because your immune system is devastated</v>

3550
02:38:50.211 --> 02:38:55.100
<v Speaker 3>when you have lyme disease and you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasting away like to get the fuck out of</v>

3551
02:38:55.101 --> 02:38:56.090
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

3552
02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:56.953
<v Speaker 3>he didn't tell us the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I believe he got so as Damon Wayans </v>

3553
02:39:03.141 --> 02:39:03.974
<v Speaker 3>would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to go through a lot to get there </v>

3554
02:39:05.121 --> 02:39:06.650
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was easier ways.</v>

3555
02:39:07.010 --> 02:39:08.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he wouldn't have chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want it,</v>

3556
02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:10.340
<v Speaker 3>but I think he learned a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself,</v>

3557
02:39:10.341 --> 02:39:12.500
<v Speaker 3>like overcoming this incredible health </v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis.</v>

3558
02:39:12.501 --> 02:39:15.770
<v Speaker 3>But I've had many people that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with get lyme disease.</v>

3559
02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:16.933
<v Speaker 3>I know at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you go out in the woods alone for </v>

3560
02:39:19.530 --> 02:39:20.340
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3561
02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:22.370
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where they're all contracting</v>

3562
02:39:22.371 --> 02:39:23.990
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know several people who have gotten it</v>

3563
02:39:23.991 --> 02:39:25.180
<v Speaker 3>from that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3564
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:28.650
<v Speaker 3>But I know other people that have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just from a don't say just from state</v>

3565
02:39:28.690 --> 02:39:29.420
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3566
02:39:29.420 --> 02:39:30.253
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I don't go fishing or something </v>

3567
02:39:31.251 --> 02:39:32.100
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3568
02:39:32.101 --> 02:39:34.160
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have to be upstate New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be North Carolina.</v>

3569
02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:35.110
<v Speaker 3>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3570
02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:36.170
<v Speaker 3>a lot of doors though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3571
02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:37.243
<v Speaker 3>Almost all outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost all ticks ever happened here in </v>

3572
02:39:39.081 --> 02:39:41.240
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3573
02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:43.070
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not as prevalent,</v>

3574
02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:46.340
<v Speaker 3>but it has happened here in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tick so fucking bad news,</v>

3575
02:39:46.341 --> 02:39:47.174
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their carriers and that disease is </v>

3576
02:39:49.641 --> 02:39:50.474
<v Speaker 3>insidious and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tricky one too because it's </v>

3577
02:39:52.041 --> 02:39:52.874
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes misdiagnosed or especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was talking about Caitlyn was </v>

3578
02:39:57.051 --> 02:39:57.884
<v Speaker 3>saying that the doctors in California </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't really hip to it because it's </v>

3579
02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:03.350
<v Speaker 3>not common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but aids was more common,</v>

3580
02:40:03.351 --> 02:40:08.310
<v Speaker 3>so that's one of the reasons why this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy was also insurance and you know,</v>

3581
02:40:08.311 --> 02:40:09.144
<v Speaker 3>like it was a shitty deal with a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't get paid very much for each </v>

3582
02:40:12.171 --> 02:40:14.190
<v Speaker 3>person that came to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't very motivated.</v>

3583
02:40:14.290 --> 02:40:18.570
<v Speaker 2>We kind of went through the full gamut </v>
<v Speaker 2>of explaining how it came to be,</v>

3584
02:40:18.571 --> 02:40:20.580
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>misdiagnosed for a year.</v>

3585
02:40:20.581 --> 02:40:23.890
<v Speaker 2>One US bank three years in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3586
02:40:23.891 --> 02:40:24.724
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a losing that much time to </v>

3587
02:40:26.971 --> 02:40:29.760
<v Speaker 2>something where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Pitney of fucking.</v>

3588
02:40:30.030 --> 02:40:30.863
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where human arrogance or ego </v>

3589
02:40:31.831 --> 02:40:34.740
<v Speaker 2>would come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be like a fucking bug put</v>

3590
02:40:34.741 --> 02:40:36.120
<v Speaker 2>it's dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spit on me,</v>

3591
02:40:36.121 --> 02:40:38.100
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm going to be in a hospital </v>
<v Speaker 2>three fucking years.</v>

3592
02:40:38.101 --> 02:40:42.240
<v Speaker 2>This isn't fucking fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you remember their guys out and</v>

3593
02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:47.820
<v Speaker 2>fucking Tibet voltage drops to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vultures can eat and while you're making</v>

3594
02:40:47.821 --> 02:40:49.580
<v Speaker 2>movies and smoking weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you relax.</v>

3595
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relax file I think seems pretty awesome.</v>

3596
02:40:53.341 --> 02:40:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sweat the ticks anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when Shit tastic.</v>

3597
02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:00.810
<v Speaker 2>I came back from recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Vancouver.</v>

3598
02:41:00.811 --> 02:41:01.644
<v Speaker 2>I've been at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been in the woods lately </v>

3599
02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:06.930
<v Speaker 2>through a directed two episodes of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flash one last season,</v>

3600
02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:09.000
<v Speaker 2>which was fucking fun.</v>

3601
02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.640
<v Speaker 2>And that one episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second episode.</v>

3602
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:11.780
<v Speaker 2>He's now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3603
02:41:11.790 --> 02:41:12.451
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

3604
02:41:12.451 --> 02:41:14.160
<v Speaker 2>The old episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a CW show.</v>

3605
02:41:14.220 --> 02:41:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I need to watch that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3606
02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:18.330
<v Speaker 2>it's dope if you like DC comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3607
02:41:18.331 --> 02:41:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I love movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3608
02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more into them now as I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>older than I was when I was younger.</v>

3609
02:41:24.030 --> 02:41:27.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the center is about a boy runs very</v>

3610
02:41:27.481 --> 02:41:28.314
<v Speaker 2>fast to solve all those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the really it's just soap operas </v>

3611
02:41:31.861 --> 02:41:34.750
<v Speaker 2>for boys and girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even gonna limit it to.</v>

3612
02:41:34.810 --> 02:41:36.810
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very soap operatic.</v>

3613
02:41:36.811 --> 02:41:37.351
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3614
02:41:37.351 --> 02:41:40.500
<v Speaker 2>it's like very episodic and they thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>an adventure each week,</v>

3615
02:41:40.501 --> 02:41:43.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's more about the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the characters and stuff.</v>

3616
02:41:43.171 --> 02:41:44.730
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what you keep coming back</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

3617
02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:47.790
<v Speaker 2>It's good balance of heart humor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroics.</v>

3618
02:41:47.791 --> 02:41:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3619
02:41:48.450 --> 02:41:50.900
<v Speaker 2>the got the family stuff or friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

3620
02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:51.733
<v Speaker 2>It's important to be friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it got some laughs and then the </v>

3621
02:41:53.611 --> 02:41:54.960
<v Speaker 2>heroics is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run fast.</v>

3623

<v Speaker 2>Look at her fly.</v>

3624
02:41:57.180 --> 02:41:58.013
<v Speaker 2>I did an episode of supergirl as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was in Vancouver like three times </v>

3625
02:42:01.711 --> 02:42:04.460
<v Speaker 2>in the span of the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3626
02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:08.610
<v Speaker 2>and we were at one point out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woods and I remember being kind of like,</v>

3627
02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:12.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I get some protection and like,</v>

3628
02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:13.620
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to get laid out here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods.</v>

3629
02:42:13.621 --> 02:42:15.960
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no for like ticks and stuff like that.</v>

3630
02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Like last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real big problem here.</v>

3631
02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:19.073
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from the Pacific north woods you </v>

3632
02:42:20.131 --> 02:42:20.964
<v Speaker 2>would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's a real big </v>

3633
02:42:21.901 --> 02:42:24.900
<v Speaker 2>problem in the Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more,</v>

3634
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:26.280
<v Speaker 2>it's more of an east coast problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3635
02:42:26.281 --> 02:42:28.530
<v Speaker 2>they named it after lyme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut.</v>

3636
02:42:29.130 --> 02:42:31.050
<v Speaker 2>That's where all the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it originated.</v>

3637
02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:34.170
<v Speaker 2>That's where the original diagnosis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

3638
02:42:34.171 --> 02:42:36.440
<v Speaker 2>How long had existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is anybody's guess.</v>

3639
02:42:36.690 --> 02:42:37.523
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do know it's also connected to </v>

3640
02:42:38.791 --> 02:42:41.710
<v Speaker 2>other neurological disorders like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>more jealous.</v>

3641
02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:43.213
<v Speaker 2>Magellan's is a weird one where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they have strands of fibers </v>

3642
02:42:46.411 --> 02:42:51.411
<v Speaker 2>growing out of their body and oftentimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these crazy delusions and what</v>

3643
02:42:51.601 --> 02:42:52.434
<v Speaker 2>Kotler was saying was that it has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurological effect and he didn't have </v>

3644
02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:56.753
<v Speaker 2>more gallons disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm one of the doctors that I </v>

3645
02:42:59.131 --> 02:42:59.964
<v Speaker 2>interviewed about more jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was telling me that he believes it's </v>

3646
02:43:03.241 --> 02:43:04.074
<v Speaker 2>connected to lyme disease because lyme </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease has some sort of neuro toxicity </v>

3647
02:43:07.051 --> 02:43:07.884
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has some sort of an effect where it </v>

3648
02:43:09.331 --> 02:43:12.250
<v Speaker 2>distorts reality and Kotler had a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem</v>

3649
02:43:12.250 --> 02:43:13.083
<v Speaker 6>member he was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He couldn't figure out whether a </v>

3650
02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:15.633
<v Speaker 6>greenlight meant go or he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>understand how to drive anymore like </v>

3651
02:43:19.151 --> 02:43:20.620
<v Speaker 6>his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his body out of nowhere,</v>

3652
02:43:20.621 --> 02:43:22.420
<v Speaker 6>nowhere out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's realizing,</v>

3653
02:43:22.421 --> 02:43:23.254
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something's really wrong and this neuro </v>

3654
02:43:25.271 --> 02:43:26.104
<v Speaker 6>toxicity effect this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this whatever it was doing to pollute </v>

3655
02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:31.510
<v Speaker 6>his brain's ability to function </v>
<v Speaker 6>correctly,</v>

3656
02:43:32.060 --> 02:43:32.893
<v Speaker 6>the more jealous people think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's also what makes you claw at your </v>

3657
02:43:34.751 --> 02:43:38.840
<v Speaker 6>skin and think there's fibers in there </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you start seeing shit that it's.</v>

3658
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:40.063
<v Speaker 6>And then they get like fibers from their</v>
<v Speaker 6>clothes stuck to their scabs and they </v>

3659
02:43:42.881 --> 02:43:47.680
<v Speaker 6>think that's growing out of their body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's more likely just an offshoot of</v>

3660
02:43:47.681 --> 02:43:49.900
<v Speaker 6>lyme because apparently when you get </v>
<v Speaker 6>lyme,</v>

3661
02:43:50.050 --> 02:43:50.883
<v Speaker 6>you're not getting one bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the reasons why the results </v>

3662
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:57.550
<v Speaker 6>that people have when they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they get bitten,</v>

3663
02:43:57.610 --> 02:43:58.443
<v Speaker 6>vary so widely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's a gang of different </v>

3664
02:44:01.001 --> 02:44:01.834
<v Speaker 6>ones and there's a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 6>also like a neighboring poisons and </v>

3665
02:44:07.121 --> 02:44:10.300
<v Speaker 6>toxins that this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this tick could have in its body.</v>

3666
02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:13.660
<v Speaker 6>It might just not be the simple lyme </v>
<v Speaker 6>disease,</v>

3667
02:44:13.690 --> 02:44:14.530
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's that one.</v>

3668
02:44:14.531 --> 02:44:15.364
<v Speaker 6>Bacteria that tick hasn't number tick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The tick might have a host of different </v>

3669
02:44:18.371 --> 02:44:21.400
<v Speaker 6>pathogens that affect you as a lyme </v>
<v Speaker 6>disease.</v>

3670
02:44:21.550 --> 02:44:22.383
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is this guy who has it explaining </v>

3671
02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:27.720
<v Speaker 6>it to me and I'm shitting my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>pants because I know so many people</v>

3672
02:44:27.830 --> 02:44:30.250
<v Speaker 4>gotten this and there's no one like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3673
02:44:30.251 --> 02:44:31.870
<v Speaker 4>take this antibiotic and knocks it out.</v>

3674
02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:32.621
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3675
02:44:32.621 --> 02:44:32.921
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3676
02:44:32.921 --> 02:44:36.640
<v Speaker 6>And it varies widely how your body </v>
<v Speaker 6>reacts to it when you get it.</v>

3677
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:37.790
<v Speaker 6>My friend's son,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my friend,</v>

3678
02:44:37.791 --> 02:44:39.020
<v Speaker 6>Steven Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his son got it.</v>

3679
02:44:39.250 --> 02:44:42.760
<v Speaker 6>The doctor misdiagnosed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The kid wound up getting bell's palsy.</v>

3680
02:44:42.761 --> 02:44:45.290
<v Speaker 6>Where face started going numb in child.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3681
02:44:45.350 --> 02:44:46.490
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

3682
02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:49.060
<v Speaker 6>He was in his fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3683
02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.600
<v Speaker 6>most likely the young body could </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably bounce back from it better than</v>

3684
02:44:52.601 --> 02:44:54.520
<v Speaker 6>the old body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but for a lot of people,</v>

3685
02:44:54.521 --> 02:44:58.240
<v Speaker 6>like my friend cody has it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like 26 I think,</v>

3686
02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:02.110
<v Speaker 6>and he says his fucking joints hurt all </v>
<v Speaker 6>the time and that it's from,</v>

3687
02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:04.450
<v Speaker 6>from having lyme,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like from that point on,</v>

3688
02:45:04.451 --> 02:45:05.180
<v Speaker 6>like his joints,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3689
02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:06.013
<v Speaker 4>Always achy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've no have not been bit by a tick and </v>

3690
02:45:08.871 --> 02:45:09.704
<v Speaker 4>I don't have lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but lately I've noticed I'm 46 now so I </v>

3691
02:45:13.551 --> 02:45:14.384
<v Speaker 4>have noticed aging in a way that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't before my knee lately doing </v>

3692
02:45:17.901 --> 02:45:19.640
<v Speaker 4>nothing and I'm not an active guy at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

3693
02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:20.833
<v Speaker 4>Has been being fucking weird and </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody said it's from descending a </v>

3694
02:45:23.511 --> 02:45:24.800
<v Speaker 4>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I walk every day,</v>

3695
02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:27.530
<v Speaker 4>walk the dogs like a mile and a half a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pill and back down.</v>

3696
02:45:27.531 --> 02:45:30.380
<v Speaker 4>That's like my exercise routine and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the hill.</v>

3697
02:45:30.381 --> 02:45:32.690
<v Speaker 4>They said that's what's doing it to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like how do you walk?</v>

3698
02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:33.553
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know like this and like you </v>

3699
02:45:34.161 --> 02:45:37.010
<v Speaker 4>don't do heel toe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like I don't,</v>

3700
02:45:37.100 --> 02:45:38.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know.</v>

3701
02:45:38.540 --> 02:45:40.880
<v Speaker 4>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I apparently I walk ball,</v>

3702
02:45:40.970 --> 02:45:44.240
<v Speaker 4>he'll ball heel up is the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3703
02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:45.373
<v Speaker 4>Well apparently is what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know anybody like unless </v>

3704
02:45:49.221 --> 02:45:50.054
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're thinking about walking </v>

3705
02:45:51.561 --> 02:45:52.394
<v Speaker 4>heel toe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you necessarily fall </v>

3706
02:45:54.231 --> 02:45:55.700
<v Speaker 4>into a heel toe type pattern.</v>

3707
02:45:56.170 --> 02:45:57.003
<v Speaker 6>The real issue is there's a big issue </v>
<v Speaker 6>with shoes like the way we have </v>

3708
02:46:00.431 --> 02:46:04.040
<v Speaker 6>constructed shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've created a gate that's an unnatural</v>

3709
02:46:04.041 --> 02:46:04.874
<v Speaker 6>like heel toe forward gate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like people always used to walk on the </v>

3710
02:46:07.451 --> 02:46:08.284
<v Speaker 6>ball of their foot because the ball of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the foot acts as like a shock absorber </v>

3711
02:46:10.750 --> 02:46:13.730
<v Speaker 6>and it allows you to slowly lower your </v>
<v Speaker 6>heels down to the ground,</v>

3712
02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:17.120
<v Speaker 6>which is why a lot of like those </v>
<v Speaker 6>barefoot runners,</v>

3713
02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:18.163
<v Speaker 6>they do so well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you're running barefoot all the </v>

3714
02:46:20.091 --> 02:46:20.924
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're developing these incredibly </v>

3715
02:46:21.951 --> 02:46:23.870
<v Speaker 6>strong feet and they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3716
02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:26.810
<v Speaker 6>they're springing and they don't need </v>
<v Speaker 6>like these big thick cushions.</v>

3717
02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:29.450
<v Speaker 6>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I guess it was like the 19 seventies</v>

3718
02:46:29.451 --> 02:46:32.600
<v Speaker 6>when Nike came out with a running shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they developed that big fat ass.</v>

3719
02:46:32.601 --> 02:46:35.210
<v Speaker 6>He'll and then people started running on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the heel.</v>

3720
02:46:35.350 --> 02:46:36.183
<v Speaker 6>They started bouncing on the hill </v>
<v Speaker 6>instead of using the natural shock </v>

3721
02:46:38.481 --> 02:46:43.220
<v Speaker 6>absorbing motion of lending shoe change </v>
<v Speaker 6>the way we walk as human beings.</v>

3722
02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:44.720
<v Speaker 6>It changed our running gait.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3723
02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:45.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which were also,</v>

3724
02:46:45.801 --> 02:46:47.660
<v Speaker 6>would it effect your walking gait?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

3725
02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:48.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

3726
02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:52.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because prior to the the sneaker who,</v>

3727
02:46:52.161 --> 02:46:54.170
<v Speaker 6>what was that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Phil Knight or something like that,</v>

3728
02:46:54.171 --> 02:46:56.280
<v Speaker 6>or if I don't know who invented Nike Gym</v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

3729
02:46:56.470 --> 02:46:57.780
<v Speaker 6>Phil Knight Champion Gym.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3730
02:46:57.880 --> 02:46:58.713
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's.</v>

3731
02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:01.610
<v Speaker 6>He's a sneakerhead film.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That literally changed.</v>

3732
02:47:01.611 --> 02:47:03.460
<v Speaker 6>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He buys yeezys with A.</v>

3733
02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:04.880
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

3734
02:47:05.390 --> 02:47:09.200
<v Speaker 6>God bless his soul in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

3735
02:47:09.201 --> 02:47:10.440
<v Speaker 6>maybe that's kind of your west.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3736
02:47:10.441 --> 02:47:12.260
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing and you don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

3737
02:47:13.260 --> 02:47:16.250
<v Speaker 6>I try to keep my head firmly lodged up </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ass of the nineties.</v>

3738
02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:18.080
<v Speaker 6>That's where shit was good for me.</v>

3758
02:47:57.771 --> 02:47:58.604
<v Speaker 6>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You tend to do a lot more active shit </v>

3759
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:03.200
<v Speaker 6>than the average bear though to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But like these,</v>

3760
02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:04.413
<v Speaker 6>these are the shit converse ones.</v>

3762
02:48:10.881 --> 02:48:12.770
<v Speaker 6>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like the rubber soul,</v>

3763
02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:13.850
<v Speaker 6>but there's no cushioning.</v>

3764

<v Speaker 6>It was like very little like sponge fans</v>
<v Speaker 6>were like that as well.</v>

3765
02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:20.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>supposed to walk.</v>

3769
02:48:25.430 --> 02:48:28.130
<v Speaker 6>You're not supposed to walk with this </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy cushion on the bottom.</v>

3770
02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:29.293
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like whenever I do the UFC I wear dress </v>

3771
02:48:30.501 --> 02:48:31.334
<v Speaker 6>shoes and dress shoes have like a heel </v>
<v Speaker 6>and if you stand in them with that heel </v>

3772
02:48:35.121 --> 02:48:38.030
<v Speaker 6>for like a while,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it kind of makes your feet feel weird.</v>

3773
02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:40.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to get out of them.</v>

<v Speaker 6>a year and you can all have a pair of </v>

<v Speaker 6>bucks balm with running shoes looked </v>

3796
02:49:36.711 --> 02:49:38.260
<v Speaker 6>like 1920.</v>

02:49:42.691 --> 02:49:43.524
<v Speaker 6>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did they have tracks or were they just </v>

3800
02:49:44.761 --> 02:49:48.240
<v Speaker 6>running in the dark circle?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably had heels.</v>

3801
02:49:48.270 --> 02:49:49.103
<v Speaker 6>The Spencer Shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Possibly the first pair of specialized </v>

3802
02:49:52.201 --> 02:49:56.640
<v Speaker 6>running shoes ever made all my God old </v>

<v Speaker 7>This is off the topic,</v>

3806
02:50:02.561 --> 02:50:03.394
<v Speaker 7>but old timey picked your trigger to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you ever heard of the cuttings </v>

3807
02:50:05.830 --> 02:50:06.663
<v Speaker 7>fairies now?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I guess maybe turn of the century or </v>

3808
02:50:10.241 --> 02:50:12.640
<v Speaker 7>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like 1900 or something like that.</v>

3809
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:13.703
<v Speaker 7>There are these little girls in England </v>
<v Speaker 7>that photographed themselves playing </v>

3810
02:50:17.951 --> 02:50:19.640
<v Speaker 7>with fairies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

3811
02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:24.780
<v Speaker 7>And the world was exposed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3812
02:50:26.290 --> 02:50:30.670
<v Speaker 7>not this wasn't the only person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but uh,</v>

3813
02:50:30.671 --> 02:50:32.860
<v Speaker 7>what's his name sir?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Arthur Conan doyle.</v>

3814
02:50:33.010 --> 02:50:35.350
<v Speaker 7>There's a picture Sir Arthur Conan </v>
<v Speaker 7>doyle.</v>

3815
02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:39.880
<v Speaker 7>The writer of Sherlock Holmes was a </v>
<v Speaker 7>spiritualist.</v>

3816
02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:44.680
<v Speaker 7>And so he actually wrote an article </v>
<v Speaker 7>defending that picture.</v>

3817
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:46.240
<v Speaker 7>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'd go through all the pictures.</v>

3818
02:50:46.241 --> 02:50:48.970
<v Speaker 7>Those are the [inaudible] ferry picture.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't want to take a leak.</v>

3819
02:50:49.290 --> 02:50:50.100
<v Speaker 7>Go ahead.</v>

3820
02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:52.920
<v Speaker 6>Paid for quite a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it needs to be debunked.</v>

3821
02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:54.390
<v Speaker 6>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tell him about your sneakers.</v>

3822
02:50:57.490 --> 02:51:00.330
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say keep talking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there was a will that says museum of</v>

3823
02:51:00.331 --> 02:51:01.630
<v Speaker 6>hoaxes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what they talk about.</v>

3824
02:51:01.631 --> 02:51:03.590
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a fucking hoax bedtime</v>

3825
02:51:03.650 --> 02:51:04.490
<v Speaker 7>hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

3826
02:51:04.491 --> 02:51:05.324
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the kids years later admitted that they </v>

3827
02:51:10.101 --> 02:51:13.160
<v Speaker 7>had kind of cut the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They admitted something that if you look</v>

3828
02:51:13.161 --> 02:51:14.600
<v Speaker 7>at these photos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll be like,</v>

3829
02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:17.540
<v Speaker 7>that had to be admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like to us.</v>

3830
02:51:17.541 --> 02:51:22.010
<v Speaker 7>It's very clearly she cut pictures out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those are pictures.</v>

3831
02:51:22.011 --> 02:51:22.844
<v Speaker 7>There's a two dimensional images of </v>
<v Speaker 7>fairies and pretty traditional fairy </v>

3832
02:51:26.511 --> 02:51:27.650
<v Speaker 7>imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3833
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:29.383
<v Speaker 7>years later they revealed that they </v>
<v Speaker 7>traced the images that have a popular </v>

3834
02:51:33.261 --> 02:51:37.670
<v Speaker 7>book and put their own spins on them and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then cut them out and took pictures with</v>

3835
02:51:37.671 --> 02:51:40.370
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But Arthur Conan doyle,</v>

3836
02:51:40.371 --> 02:51:44.930
<v Speaker 7>the guy that wrote Sherlock Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like really defended this shit.</v>

3837
02:51:44.931 --> 02:51:45.351
<v Speaker 7>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3838
02:51:45.351 --> 02:51:46.184
<v Speaker 7>there are ferries,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there is another world and it's trying </v>

3839
02:51:48.111 --> 02:51:51.860
<v Speaker 7>to break through and these little girls </v>
<v Speaker 7>have been in contact with it.</v>

3840
02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:54.080
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3841
02:51:54.081 --> 02:51:54.914
<v Speaker 7>and he was ridiculed by over half the </v>
<v Speaker 7>population because a lot of people </v>

3842
02:51:58.791 --> 02:52:00.980
<v Speaker 7>looked at that picture and saw what we </v>
<v Speaker 7>see,</v>

3843
02:52:00.981 --> 02:52:04.820
<v Speaker 7>which is kids with little cutouts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pictures of fairies.</v>

3844
02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:10.140
<v Speaker 7>But there was a time where almost half </v>
<v Speaker 7>the world was like,</v>

3845
02:52:10.691 --> 02:52:11.650
<v Speaker 7>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's real.</v>

3846
02:52:11.890 --> 02:52:13.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that could be real.</v>

3847
02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:14.653
<v Speaker 7>The cunningly fairs or pictures of these</v>
<v Speaker 7>kids fucking took Joe and the clearly </v>

02:52:18.491 --> 02:52:20.380
<v Speaker 7>just blow one up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Clearly fake as fuck.</v>

3849
02:52:20.450 --> 02:52:21.283
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But there was a time because you had </v>

3850
02:52:23.111 --> 02:52:25.270
<v Speaker 7>somebody like Arthur Conan doyle going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3851
02:52:25.271 --> 02:52:26.104
<v Speaker 7>this is real and spiritualism is a real </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing and there are other races and </v>

3852
02:52:28.781 --> 02:52:29.614
<v Speaker 7>other beings and fairies are real out </v>
<v Speaker 7>there in the world defending it and </v>

3853
02:52:32.441 --> 02:52:33.274
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then finally late in their lives </v>

3854
02:52:34.721 --> 02:52:36.310
<v Speaker 7>when they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nearly passed,</v>

3855
02:52:36.980 --> 02:52:37.870
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they said,</v>

3856
02:52:38.260 --> 02:52:39.093
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we cut them out of a book and they </v>

3857
02:52:40.601 --> 02:52:45.190
<v Speaker 7>admitted to something that you knew </v>
<v Speaker 7>right away just by looking at the photo,</v>

3858
02:52:45.270 --> 02:52:45.611
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

3859
02:52:45.611 --> 02:52:48.950
<v Speaker 7>that's fake as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But in the twenties or whatever,</v>

3860
02:52:48.951 --> 02:52:50.710
<v Speaker 7>or back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh yeah man,</v>

3861
02:52:50.740 --> 02:52:52.690
<v Speaker 7>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could show somebody a picture.</v>

3862
02:52:52.691 --> 02:52:54.820
<v Speaker 7>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's fucking real,</v>

3863
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.863
<v Speaker 7>but you can only imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean how gullible people were before </v>

3864
02:52:59.201 --> 02:53:01.820
<v Speaker 7>photos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when you look at it,</v>

3865
02:53:01.890 --> 02:53:02.920
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's bullshit,</v>

3866
02:53:02.921 --> 02:53:04.840
<v Speaker 7>but I still think of the big foot video </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'm like,</v>

3867
02:53:04.841 --> 02:53:05.674
<v Speaker 7>that Shit's real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like when he walks past the camera and </v>

3868
02:53:07.361 --> 02:53:08.770
<v Speaker 7>then he suddenly looks at the camera,</v>

3869
02:53:10.450 --> 02:53:12.800
<v Speaker 3>a thought on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this topic recently,</v>

3870
02:53:12.801 --> 02:53:13.720
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3871
02:53:14.050 --> 02:53:14.883
<v Speaker 3>at like five years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if like photoshop was erased from the </v>

3872
02:53:17.151 --> 02:53:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Internet's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember memories,</v>

3873
02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:22.220
<v Speaker 3>how could you explain photoshop pictures</v>
<v Speaker 3>to somebody?</v>

3874
02:53:22.221 --> 02:53:23.054
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we live to be a few thousand </v>

3875
02:53:24.711 --> 02:53:25.544
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if society goes down and then they </v>

3876
02:53:27.321 --> 02:53:28.154
<v Speaker 3>re build computers a thousand years from</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and they look at these old images </v>

3877
02:53:31.581 --> 02:53:33.770
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have the capability then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3878
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:34.670
<v Speaker 3>totally possible.</v>

3879
02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:36.033
<v Speaker 7>There'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was somebody standing on top of </v>

3880
02:53:37.901 --> 02:53:38.734
<v Speaker 7>one of the twin towers when a plane kid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember seeing that picture and be </v>

3881
02:53:42.581 --> 02:53:43.780
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>holy fucking shit.</v>

3882
02:53:43.781 --> 02:53:46.540
<v Speaker 7>How'd they find that camera?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

02:55:46.401 --> 02:55:48.950
<v Speaker 6>like if it came from the factory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe 400 horsepower,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Barely.</v>

3934
02:56:06.150 --> 02:56:07.410
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a moment like that,</v>

3935
02:56:07.411 --> 02:56:07.831
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3936
02:56:07.831 --> 02:56:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't do any of those things by being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3937
02:56:12.090 --> 02:56:12.923
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably can't make a real good Dick </v>

3938
02:56:14.701 --> 02:56:17.880
<v Speaker 2>joke and then that's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd much rather be him than me.</v>

3939
02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Better off to not balance yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How not to go.</v>

3940
02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:21.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't do it.</v>

3941
02:56:21.691 --> 02:56:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I better off to just go look at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy motherfucker.</v>

3942
02:56:25.470 --> 02:56:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate someone else's ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3943
02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:30.990
<v Speaker 2>The less time you compare yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>

3944
02:56:31.270 --> 02:56:34.800
<v Speaker 2>the better off you'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just enjoy how amazing people are.</v>

3945
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3946
02:56:35.881 --> 02:56:38.330
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was at a managing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3947
02:56:38.340 --> 02:56:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what I was going back to the</v>

3948
02:56:40.351 --> 02:56:43.830
<v Speaker 2>$12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year for $12,000</v>

3949
02:56:43.831 --> 02:56:44.664
<v Speaker 2>a year for everybody.</v>

3950
02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:45.833
<v Speaker 2>I think what gets in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's human nature because you have some </v>

3951
02:56:47.791 --> 02:56:50.780
<v Speaker 2>people who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is he he don't deserve that 12,000</v>

3952
02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:51.633
<v Speaker 2>or he gets a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a nicer house and he's also </v>

3953
02:56:53.521 --> 02:56:55.440
<v Speaker 2>getting the $12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting.</v>

3954
02:56:55.700 --> 02:56:56.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3955
02:56:56.311 --> 02:56:58.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that would start seeping in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3956
02:56:58.381 --> 02:57:02.350
<v Speaker 2>but he gets a lot because he makes money</v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of the 12,000,</v>

3957
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:04.670
<v Speaker 2>so like his needs are taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bucharest,</v>

3958
02:57:04.740 --> 02:57:07.980
<v Speaker 2>logical human animal doesn't always see </v>
<v Speaker 2>things logically.</v>

3959
02:57:07.981 --> 02:57:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'd just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

3960
02:57:09.241 --> 02:57:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Then when we get selfish that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>12,000</v>

3961
02:57:14.090 --> 02:57:16.010
<v Speaker 2>years comes into problem when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

3962
02:57:16.060 --> 02:57:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know because I don't think it's</v>

3963
02:57:18.091 --> 02:57:20.730
<v Speaker 2>ever been really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least on a wide scale.</v>

3964
02:57:20.731 --> 02:57:22.350
<v Speaker 2>It's ever been practiced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

3965
02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think our system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people did you say we had an in</v>

3966
02:57:25.460 --> 02:57:28.470
<v Speaker 2>this country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 something million plus Mexicans.</v>

3967
02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:31.230
<v Speaker 2>So do quick math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

3968
02:57:31.231 --> 02:57:32.930
<v Speaker 2>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they've done it out.</v>

3969
02:57:33.570 --> 02:57:34.403
<v Speaker 2>There was an argument by an economist </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really well respected economist </v>

3970
02:57:37.170 --> 02:57:37.900
<v Speaker 2>for</v>

3971
02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:42.190
<v Speaker 6>universal basic income and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 6>number they were going by was $12,000</v>

3972
02:57:42.191 --> 02:57:43.060
<v Speaker 6>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

3973
02:57:43.090 --> 02:57:47.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm surprisingly supports universal </v>
<v Speaker 6>basic income.</v>

3974
02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:49.960
<v Speaker 6>Just Google that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And because there was some,</v>

3975
02:57:49.990 --> 02:57:50.823
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty prominent economist who actually </v>

3976
02:57:54.191 --> 02:57:55.550
<v Speaker 6>understands the system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3977
02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:56.930
<v Speaker 6>except for you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>

3978
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:58.600
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got enough money I can do my thing.</v>

3979
02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Is this like Noam Chomsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Noam Chomsky,</v>

3980
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:02.850
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3981
02:58:02.940 --> 02:58:04.420
<v Speaker 2>he's a linguist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3982
02:58:04.650 --> 02:58:05.800
<v Speaker 2>So He's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3983
02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:06.793
<v Speaker 2>not going to be talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you ever trying to follow Noam </v>

3984
02:58:09.750 --> 02:58:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Chomsky stuff on language to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

3985
02:58:12.050 --> 02:58:13.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you,</v>

3986
02:58:13.950 --> 02:58:16.650
<v Speaker 2>it feels like doing exercise with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

3987
02:58:17.230 --> 02:58:19.310
<v Speaker 2>It feels like you're doing a workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3988
02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:23.820
<v Speaker 2>the easiest way to I think take in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chomsky is,</v>

3989
02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:26.100
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was that movie they did.</v>

3990
02:58:26.101 --> 02:58:30.660
<v Speaker 2>It was a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the tall man happy,</v>

3991
02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:33.510
<v Speaker 2>I think is the name of it is the man who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is tall,</v>

3992
02:58:33.511 --> 02:58:35.020
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3993
02:58:35.050 --> 02:58:37.380
<v Speaker 2>and it was directed by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3994
02:58:37.470 --> 02:58:39.590
<v Speaker 2>the guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3995
02:58:39.740 --> 02:58:41.940
<v Speaker 2>this isn't my Michel Gondry the </v>
<v Speaker 2>director.</v>

3996
02:58:41.970 --> 02:58:42.803
<v Speaker 2>He made a very interesting documentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was partly animated in a </v>

3997
02:58:46.021 --> 02:58:48.340
<v Speaker 2>conversation with about Chomsky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3998
02:58:48.350 --> 02:58:51.060
<v Speaker 2>What was it called again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the man who is tall,</v>

3999
02:58:51.061 --> 02:58:52.860
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe is the title.</v>

4000
02:58:54.270 --> 02:58:55.140
<v Speaker 2>And it's wonderful.</v>

4001
02:58:55.140 --> 02:58:55.973
<v Speaker 2>It's like beginners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Chomsky for beginners because it's </v>

4002
02:58:58.681 --> 02:59:01.950
<v Speaker 2>very colorful and breaks it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've watched the other morning I got</v>

4003
02:59:01.951 --> 02:59:02.784
<v Speaker 2>up and blazed and watch three interviews</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him talking about postelection and </v>

4004
02:59:07.111 --> 02:59:11.760
<v Speaker 2>stuff and his take on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Oh my God,</v>

4005
02:59:11.940 --> 02:59:12.970
<v Speaker 2>like even at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

4006
02:59:13.010 --> 02:59:16.500
<v Speaker 2>he's advanced in age at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that mind is,</v>

4007
02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:17.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharp as a tack and it's one of those </v>

4008
02:59:19.021 --> 02:59:19.890
<v Speaker 2>magic and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ugh,</v>

4009
02:59:20.210 --> 02:59:22.230
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a loss to lose that </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

4010
02:59:22.231 --> 02:59:23.064
<v Speaker 2>He's thinking about things that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>others aren't in his thing that spooked </v>

4011
02:59:26.311 --> 02:59:27.660
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Deal was a,</v>

4012
02:59:28.710 --> 02:59:31.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said right now the whole world should</v>

4013
02:59:31.141 --> 02:59:31.974
<v Speaker 2>be focused on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Russian front on Russia and the </v>

4014
02:59:35.611 --> 02:59:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Russian front because that's where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotspot of activities like United States</v>

4015
02:59:40.171 --> 02:59:42.030
<v Speaker 2>and Russia have come in conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

4016
02:59:42.090 --> 02:59:44.820
<v Speaker 2>recently in a way that they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the Cold War.</v>

4017
02:59:45.120 --> 02:59:47.460
<v Speaker 2>And he's going in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about Su two super powers</v>

4018
02:59:47.461 --> 02:59:48.294
<v Speaker 2>with the ability to destroy the planet </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that we haven't really thought </v>

4019
02:59:50.311 --> 02:59:53.400
<v Speaker 2>about since the fucking eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden you're like,</v>

4020
02:59:53.430 --> 02:59:54.263
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what they meant by make America </v>

4021
02:59:54.961 --> 02:59:55.651
<v Speaker 2>great again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4022
02:59:55.651 --> 02:59:59.430
<v Speaker 2>let's be scared of the popular possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear annihilation.</v>

4023
02:59:59.580 --> 03:00:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Because I thought about that in years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest with you.</v>

4024
03:00:01.880 --> 03:00:04.050
<v Speaker 2>That was another thing that bummed me </v>
<v Speaker 2>out about the Clinton campaign.</v>

4025
03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:05.153
<v Speaker 2>They were Russian fearmongering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the big things that she kept </v>

4026
03:00:07.501 --> 03:00:08.334
<v Speaker 2>saying during the election was they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about being hacked and she's </v>

4027
03:00:10.960 --> 03:00:11.793
<v Speaker 2>saying it was the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she was implying to Donald Trump </v>

4028
03:00:13.801 --> 03:00:14.634
<v Speaker 2>supports the Russians because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>supports the hacks and there's no </v>

4029
03:00:17.371 --> 03:00:18.810
<v Speaker 2>evidence to the Russians did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

4030
03:00:19.210 --> 03:00:20.043
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People got mad at me and so that I've </v>

4031
03:00:22.111 --> 03:00:23.040
<v Speaker 2>looked into a deeply.</v>

4032
03:00:23.180 --> 03:00:24.013
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one has proven that the </v>

4033
03:00:24.961 --> 03:00:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Russians have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're saying it is.</v>

4034
03:00:27.091 --> 03:00:28.680
<v Speaker 2>If they proven the Russians have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4035
03:00:28.860 --> 03:00:31.160
<v Speaker 2>So one of two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either progressions.</v>

4036
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:32.850
<v Speaker 2>They're not that they actually tinkered </v>
<v Speaker 2>with short.</v>

4037
03:00:32.851 --> 03:00:33.684
<v Speaker 2>I would admit it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no evidence that they did </v>

4038
03:00:35.151 --> 03:00:35.640
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4039
03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:36.473
<v Speaker 2>I mean who knows if they did fair point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is if you say they did </v>

4040
03:00:39.541 --> 03:00:41.250
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to know for sure they did it.</v>

4041
03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:42.113
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I'm going to listen to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you say you know something </v>

4042
03:00:44.611 --> 03:00:45.840
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

4043
03:00:45.841 --> 03:00:47.550
<v Speaker 2>this bitch definitely doesn't know for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

4044
03:00:47.610 --> 03:00:50.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't know for sure because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the information.</v>

4045
03:00:50.551 --> 03:00:53.880
<v Speaker 2>If you did he tell us what it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

4046
03:00:54.030 --> 03:00:54.863
<v Speaker 2>And the FBI and the CIA doesn't say they</v>
<v Speaker 2>know there's a likelihood there's a </v>

4047
03:00:58.381 --> 03:01:00.340
<v Speaker 2>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a high probability,</v>

4048
03:01:00.610 --> 03:01:01.443
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know.</v>

4049
03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:03.850
<v Speaker 2>So until you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you know you can't say,</v>

4050
03:01:03.851 --> 03:01:05.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because as soon as you do,</v>

4051
03:01:05.201 --> 03:01:07.270
<v Speaker 2>because you might be full of shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>

4052
03:01:07.390 --> 03:01:08.650
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4053
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:11.650
<v Speaker 2>you might fill in the blank on a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of other important stuff and pretend you</v>

4054
03:01:11.651 --> 03:01:12.820
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't know,</v>

4055
03:01:12.821 --> 03:01:13.810
<v Speaker 2>because that's what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

4056
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:15.480
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's another thing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4057
03:01:15.490 --> 03:01:17.800
<v Speaker 2>as a civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't allow that.</v>

4058
03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:20.380
<v Speaker 2>We can't allow that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in Donald Trump,</v>

4059
03:01:20.381 --> 03:01:22.720
<v Speaker 2>when he keeps talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of voters that,</v>

4060
03:01:22.721 --> 03:01:23.554
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the illegally voted and kept him </v>

4061
03:01:24.821 --> 03:01:25.654
<v Speaker 2>from winning the popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that you can't do that </v>

4062
03:01:28.781 --> 03:01:29.614
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

4063
03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Because you can't lie when number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>lie.</v>

4064
03:01:31.870 --> 03:01:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't do that before.</v>

4065
03:01:35.430 --> 03:01:38.920
<v Speaker 2>He kinda seems to have brought it back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it hasn't killed him.</v>

4066
03:01:38.980 --> 03:01:42.160
<v Speaker 2>He is in fact the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you do this thing when you put your</v>

4067
03:01:42.161 --> 03:01:44.590
<v Speaker 2>hand on the ancient book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4068
03:01:44.590 --> 03:01:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're.</v>

4069
03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:46.193
<v Speaker 2>We're in the episode daisy him now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't matter what used to be </v>

4070
03:01:49.181 --> 03:01:50.014
<v Speaker 2>and there is no more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't because of things like that </v>

4071
03:01:51.971 --> 03:01:53.530
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you couldn't,</v>

4072
03:01:53.531 --> 03:01:55.510
<v Speaker 2>but he did and everything worked out </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

4073
03:01:57.610 --> 03:01:58.443
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally with you in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't write fucking say that </v>

4074
03:02:01.901 --> 03:02:03.790
<v Speaker 2>because that starts breaking the system </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

4075
03:02:03.791 --> 03:02:05.410
<v Speaker 2>But then again we were just talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like,</v>

4076
03:02:05.411 --> 03:02:08.380
<v Speaker 2>is this a system that you even want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in a world where you're like,</v>

4077
03:02:08.381 --> 03:02:10.630
<v Speaker 2>do we need a president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

4078
03:02:10.690 --> 03:02:11.910
<v Speaker 2>What's being said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then like,</v>

4079
03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:12.753
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does it matter if somebody being </v>

4080
03:02:13.751 --> 03:02:14.584
<v Speaker 2>like the really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a people that voted that </v>

4081
03:02:16.061 --> 03:02:17.130
<v Speaker 2>didn't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4082
03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:20.680
<v Speaker 2>because he's the guy now see like if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want that position,</v>

4083
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:23.170
<v Speaker 2>you have to be under oath all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's got to be like.</v>

4084
03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:24.033
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you really want to say that you </v>

4085
03:02:24.851 --> 03:02:28.330
<v Speaker 2>are so noble or you're so powerful or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wise or whatever you are,</v>

4086
03:02:28.331 --> 03:02:30.100
<v Speaker 2>that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever your attributes are,</v>

4087
03:02:30.250 --> 03:02:32.200
<v Speaker 2>you're so awesome that you should be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

4088
03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I know you can't be lying about illegal </v>
<v Speaker 2>voters unless you have some data.</v>

4089
03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:38.590
<v Speaker 2>You can't say it until you have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>data.</v>

4090
03:02:38.591 --> 03:02:39.424
<v Speaker 2>You can't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you say you got to have some </v>

4091
03:02:40.901 --> 03:02:41.734
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got a lot of things with no data </v>

4092
03:02:43.121 --> 03:02:44.000
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

4093
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:46.480
<v Speaker 2>but we understand anything to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>elected.</v>

4094
03:02:46.481 --> 03:02:47.314
<v Speaker 2>But now we're beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know still playing the same kind of </v>

4095
03:02:49.180 --> 03:02:50.013
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

4096
03:02:50.290 --> 03:02:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I've just not grown comfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

4097
03:02:52.571 --> 03:02:55.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to learn to accept the fact that,</v>

4098
03:02:56.790 --> 03:02:57.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I used to consider a fact is no </v>

4099
03:02:59.201 --> 03:03:00.034
<v Speaker 2>longer fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People talk about facts in this real </v>

4100
03:03:01.631 --> 03:03:03.580
<v Speaker 2>loose way now where they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4101
03:03:03.581 --> 03:03:04.414
<v Speaker 2>what is the fact?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you may not be effect to </v>

4102
03:03:05.561 --> 03:03:06.011
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

4103
03:03:06.011 --> 03:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>well that's not the definition of fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

4104
03:03:07.751 --> 03:03:09.790
<v Speaker 2>The fact is a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people go,</v>

4105
03:03:09.791 --> 03:03:12.190
<v Speaker 2>what's factual for you may not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>factual for me.</v>

4106
03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:15.430
<v Speaker 2>We're on such a fucking slippery slope </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that a matrix,</v>

4107
03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:20.170
<v Speaker 2>that's the least egregious thing at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>point of him being like 2 million people</v>

4108
03:03:20.171 --> 03:03:21.004
<v Speaker 2>voted illegally because the dude was </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally saying he won the popular </v>

4109
03:03:22.721 --> 03:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right.</v>

4110
03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:26.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the first big kind of untruth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4111
03:03:26.251 --> 03:03:27.084
<v Speaker 2>as he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things that like sometimes he </v>

4112
03:03:28.361 --> 03:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>chucks up to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kidding.</v>

4113
03:03:30.490 --> 03:03:32.230
<v Speaker 2>It's the same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4114
03:03:32.231 --> 03:03:33.064
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone saying that the Russians hacked </v>

4115
03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:37.900
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic National Conference or </v>
<v Speaker 2>committee or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

4116
03:03:37.901 --> 03:03:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Dnc W are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4117
03:03:40.870 --> 03:03:43.720
<v Speaker 2>that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like saying that like these are all like</v>

4118
03:03:44.020 --> 03:03:44.853
<v Speaker 2>whether the little tiny lies or whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a leaps of faith or leaps of </v>

4119
03:03:47.681 --> 03:03:49.990
<v Speaker 2>judgment or whether they're just full </v>
<v Speaker 2>fabrications,</v>

4120
03:03:50.260 --> 03:03:51.820
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do any of them.</v>

4121
03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be able to do any of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

4122
03:03:53.980 --> 03:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Like if anybody catches you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in big government and you</v>

4123
03:03:57.281 --> 03:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a video</v>

4124
03:03:57.980 --> 03:03:58.813
<v Speaker 3>of the FBI saying one thing and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>say another thing when the Fbi told me </v>

4125
03:04:01.161 --> 03:04:01.994
<v Speaker 3>this and the FBI saying explicitly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they told you and those things don't </v>

4126
03:04:04.041 --> 03:04:04.874
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be a trial and she'd be </v>

4127
03:04:06.621 --> 03:04:07.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you a liar?</v>

4128
03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

4129
03:04:08.660 --> 03:04:11.750
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you get interviews extended to people</v>

4130
03:04:11.751 --> 03:04:12.441
<v Speaker 3>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4131
03:04:12.441 --> 03:04:15.920
<v Speaker 3>the president was born and should only </v>
<v Speaker 3>be when you have power Muslim countries.</v>

4132
03:04:15.980 --> 03:04:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're have like,</v>

4133
03:04:17.391 --> 03:04:18.224
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a perfect example when he was </v>

4134
03:04:19.131 --> 03:04:21.590
<v Speaker 3>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was born in Kenya,</v>

4135
03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:23.930
<v Speaker 3>like trump was like a major league </v>
<v Speaker 3>birther.</v>

4136
03:04:24.140 --> 03:04:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4137
03:04:26.170 --> 03:04:31.170
<v Speaker 4>he was some theorize I've read that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of jumped onto the birther movement</v>

4138
03:04:32.140 --> 03:04:33.670
<v Speaker 4>because he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4139
03:04:33.970 --> 03:04:36.580
<v Speaker 4>if I ingratiate myself with this crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will be helpful.</v>

4140
03:04:36.970 --> 03:04:38.500
<v Speaker 4>If I want to run for president.</v>

4141
03:04:38.970 --> 03:04:41.540
<v Speaker 3>He might've like watched a youtube video</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it.</v>

4142
03:04:42.470 --> 03:04:45.510
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4143
03:04:45.511 --> 03:04:46.344
<v Speaker 4>I don't like to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I choose to think that he's smarter </v>

4144
03:04:49.411 --> 03:04:51.210
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

4145
03:04:51.211 --> 03:04:53.910
<v Speaker 4>he could have just been him like </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently he tweeted,</v>

4146
03:04:54.390 --> 03:04:57.270
<v Speaker 4>anyone who burns the flag should go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>jail and be rested.</v>

4147
03:04:57.271 --> 03:04:58.104
<v Speaker 4>And then they found out I read an </v>
<v Speaker 4>article online that they had just run a </v>

4148
03:05:01.591 --> 03:05:02.424
<v Speaker 4>piece on Fox News about flag burning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was kind of informed by something </v>

4149
03:05:07.291 --> 03:05:10.930
<v Speaker 4>he just watched on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you know tell most people tweet,</v>

4150
03:05:10.931 --> 03:05:12.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They see something go like that,</v>

4151
03:05:12.181 --> 03:05:15.720
<v Speaker 4>but that's not what you want out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chief executive of a country.</v>

4152
03:05:15.721 --> 03:05:17.730
<v Speaker 4>At least that's traditionally not what </v>
<v Speaker 4>people want it.</v>

4153
03:05:17.731 --> 03:05:20.040
<v Speaker 4>But this time that seems to be what </v>
<v Speaker 4>people want.</v>

4154
03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:20.933
<v Speaker 3>Digital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton had proposed that very </v>

4155
03:05:21.961 --> 03:05:22.794
<v Speaker 3>same thing in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She proposed that flag burning should </v>

4156
03:05:26.401 --> 03:05:27.234
<v Speaker 3>have a stiff fine in a year in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she said that and she's not the </v>

4157
03:05:31.111 --> 03:05:33.780
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know now that he is.</v>

4158
03:05:33.781 --> 03:05:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

4159
03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Well the whole thing is uber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uber Bizarre.</v>

4160
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:40.400
<v Speaker 4>Where do you feel like and an and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't want to,</v>

4161
03:05:42.140 --> 03:05:43.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying it cynically,</v>

4162
03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:44.833
<v Speaker 4>like this country has been here for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile and probably be here for a lot </v>

4163
03:05:47.421 --> 03:05:50.330
<v Speaker 4>longer than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than our petty issues within,</v>

4164
03:05:50.340 --> 03:05:54.350
<v Speaker 4>in the moment if we have issues with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>

4165
03:05:54.380 --> 03:05:57.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just it,</v>

4166
03:05:57.160 --> 03:06:00.620
<v Speaker 4>it became a different world in the span </v>
<v Speaker 4>of six months.</v>

4167
03:06:01.290 --> 03:06:02.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it did to like,</v>

4168
03:06:02.820 --> 03:06:04.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way where,</v>

4169
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:05.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I had this down.</v>

4170
03:06:05.630 --> 03:06:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Like I think about this whenever I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>in school.</v>

4171
03:06:07.970 --> 03:06:10.310
<v Speaker 4>You'd read your history books and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

4172
03:06:10.760 --> 03:06:14.270
<v Speaker 4>how come they didn't stop this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did they know this was going on?</v>

4173
03:06:14.300 --> 03:06:15.133
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the,</v>

4174
03:06:15.320 --> 03:06:17.720
<v Speaker 4>are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm sitting here as a child reading</v>

4175
03:06:17.721 --> 03:06:20.930
<v Speaker 4>this and I know that this is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why didn't someone step in?</v>

4176
03:06:20.931 --> 03:06:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Why didn't Blah Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

4177
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.903
<v Speaker 4>I remember going to Germany the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>time with clerks and went to the Berlin </v>

4178
03:06:26.031 --> 03:06:29.240
<v Speaker 4>film festival and before screening me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and my friend Brian Johnson,</v>

4179
03:06:29.241 --> 03:06:29.691
<v Speaker 4>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4194
03:07:01.861 --> 03:07:02.694
<v Speaker 7>you can't help but turn to the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 7>was our cab driver who drove us for </v>

4195
03:07:05.761 --> 03:07:07.980
<v Speaker 7>Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which was like 40 minutes out of Berlin,</v>

4196
03:07:07.981 --> 03:07:11.520
<v Speaker 7>maybe an hour out of Berlin and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>drove us back and you know,</v>

4197
03:07:11.521 --> 03:07:12.960
<v Speaker 7>he was waiting with us while we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

4198
03:07:12.961 --> 03:07:13.794
<v Speaker 7>So he went through the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 7>camp and he was born and raised in </v>

4199
03:07:15.661 --> 03:07:18.210
<v Speaker 7>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I'm sure he's had to do this a number</v>

4200
03:07:18.211 --> 03:07:19.800
<v Speaker 7>of times with school or something like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

4201
03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:22.230
<v Speaker 7>But you couldn't help but on the ride </v>
<v Speaker 7>back,</v>

4202
03:07:22.231 --> 03:07:24.150
<v Speaker 7>he didn't want to be that American Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it's like,</v>

4203
03:07:24.810 --> 03:07:28.140
<v Speaker 7>did anyone in your family?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

4204
03:07:28.141 --> 03:07:28.974
<v Speaker 7>Did you guys talk about this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how do they handle this sort of </v>

4205
03:07:32.220 --> 03:07:33.053
<v Speaker 7>thing over here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how did you guys wake up after it </v>

4206
03:07:35.791 --> 03:07:36.624
<v Speaker 7>was all over and go back to what was the</v>
<v Speaker 7>new normal like you realize this is </v>

4207
03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:42.240
<v Speaker 7>fucking heinous,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4208
03:07:42.241 --> 03:07:43.074
<v Speaker 7>and the guy was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's taught to us in school and there </v>

4209
03:07:45.211 --> 03:07:46.270
<v Speaker 7>was a moment when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4210
03:07:46.310 --> 03:07:47.143
<v Speaker 7>every young kid in school learns about </v>
<v Speaker 7>Hitler and the Third Reich and the </v>

4211
03:07:50.071 --> 03:07:52.790
<v Speaker 7>Holocaust that they go back to their </v>
<v Speaker 7>parents and start saying like,</v>

4212
03:07:52.800 --> 03:07:54.660
<v Speaker 7>how much did you knew how much to </v>
<v Speaker 7>grandma and Grandpa?</v>

4213
03:07:54.660 --> 03:07:55.493
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>blah blah blah.</v>

4214
03:07:55.800 --> 03:07:58.890
<v Speaker 7>So I think of moments like that where </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying I'm not,</v>

4215
03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:02.700
<v Speaker 7>I'm certainly not comparing this country</v>
<v Speaker 7>to the fucking Germany by any stretch of</v>

4216
03:08:02.701 --> 03:08:03.534
<v Speaker 7>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying.</v>

4217
03:08:04.230 --> 03:08:06.330
<v Speaker 7>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not at all.</v>

4218
03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:10.980
<v Speaker 7>All I'm saying is like there are moments</v>
<v Speaker 7>in history where,</v>

4219
03:08:10.981 --> 03:08:13.110
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought we were kind of passed it.</v>

4220
03:08:13.111 --> 03:08:14.490
<v Speaker 7>History happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4221
03:08:14.491 --> 03:08:17.880
<v Speaker 7>obviously September 11th is a very big </v>
<v Speaker 7>historical moment in our lifetime.</v>

4222
03:08:18.810 --> 03:08:20.130
<v Speaker 7>But I really felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

4223
03:08:20.310 --> 03:08:22.800
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>until like world war three,</v>

4224
03:08:22.890 --> 03:08:25.050
<v Speaker 7>we're probably done with history for a </v>
<v Speaker 7>little bit,</v>

4225
03:08:25.530 --> 03:08:26.363
<v Speaker 7>which is ridiculous fucking statement,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but now I feel like we're living in a </v>

4226
03:08:29.881 --> 03:08:30.714
<v Speaker 7>chapter in a history book.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some kid in the future is going to be </v>

4227
03:08:32.311 --> 03:08:34.560
<v Speaker 7>looking at this chapter and being like </v>
<v Speaker 7>really?</v>

4228
03:08:34.610 --> 03:08:35.443
<v Speaker 7>Like they didn't know that's what they </v>
<v Speaker 7>did and I'm not saying again like I </v>

4229
03:08:37.711 --> 03:08:39.720
<v Speaker 7>expect horrible things from this guy or </v>
<v Speaker 7>anything.</v>

4230
03:08:39.720 --> 03:08:40.553
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying the world is vastly </v>
<v Speaker 7>changed in a way that it's going to be </v>

4231
03:08:43.891 --> 03:08:47.100
<v Speaker 7>recognized,</v>
<v Speaker 7>recognized now and it will be recognized</v>

4232
03:08:47.190 --> 03:08:48.023
<v Speaker 7>when they write the book on this year </v>
<v Speaker 7>and when they write the book on this </v>

4233
03:08:50.490 --> 03:08:53.880
<v Speaker 7>year for years to come.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Suddenly we're kind of in that moment as</v>

4234
03:08:53.881 --> 03:08:54.714
<v Speaker 7>well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then again we probably were always </v>

4235
03:08:57.271 --> 03:09:00.010
<v Speaker 7>in a moment of history and I don't even </v>
<v Speaker 7>mean in a stoner way.</v>

4236
03:09:00.011 --> 03:09:02.220
<v Speaker 7>Like this is a moment of history and </v>
<v Speaker 7>this is a moment in history,</v>

4237
03:09:02.221 --> 03:09:05.460
<v Speaker 7>but history is not always that loud and </v>
<v Speaker 7>noticeable.</v>

4238
03:09:05.461 --> 03:09:07.890
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes it's quiet and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>notice it until later on.</v>

4239
03:09:07.900 --> 03:09:09.420
<v Speaker 7>But we've gone through it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

4240
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:12.660
<v Speaker 7>I'm a couple of years older than you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we remember Reagan.</v>

4241
03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:15.630
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we remember the Iran Contra affair.</v>

4242
03:09:15.890 --> 03:09:18.390
<v Speaker 7>Is that what it feels like culturally?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It felt like.</v>

4243
03:09:18.391 --> 03:09:20.190
<v Speaker 7>So I was just having this discussion </v>
<v Speaker 7>with somebody else,</v>

4244
03:09:20.191 --> 03:09:22.860
<v Speaker 7>but in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sixties,</v>

4245
03:09:23.610 --> 03:09:28.170
<v Speaker 7>sixties into the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you had this kind of progressive growing</v>

4246
03:09:28.171 --> 03:09:30.080
<v Speaker 7>America where suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4247
03:09:30.090 --> 03:09:31.980
<v Speaker 7>maybe there wasn't as much segregation </v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

4248
03:09:32.430 --> 03:09:33.490
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people were.</v>

4249
03:09:34.230 --> 03:09:35.063
<v Speaker 7>People were kind of developing and </v>
<v Speaker 7>evolving and becoming more like the </v>

4250
03:09:39.631 --> 03:09:43.230
<v Speaker 7>world we recognized now and it felt </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

4251
03:09:43.231 --> 03:09:44.064
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like by showing you stuff like all in </v>

4252
03:09:45.331 --> 03:09:47.580
<v Speaker 7>the family and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4253
03:09:47.581 --> 03:09:48.414
<v Speaker 7>arts and um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tries to push the edge of the envelope </v>

4254
03:09:50.641 --> 03:09:53.770
<v Speaker 7>at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Try to put normalcy into something that,</v>

4255
03:09:53.900 --> 03:09:54.090
<v Speaker 7>you</v>

4256
03:09:54.090 --> 03:09:54.923
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a situation that you maybe don't find </v>

4257
03:09:56.230 --> 03:09:58.180
<v Speaker 4>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you see it on TV enough,</v>

4258
03:09:58.181 --> 03:09:58.780
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4259
03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:00.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm over it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And suddenly it's for real.</v>

4260
03:10:00.701 --> 03:10:02.770
<v Speaker 4>And stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Felt like,</v>

4261
03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:05.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eighties and Reagan.</v>

4262
03:10:05.411 --> 03:10:06.244
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a political creature by any </v>

4263
03:10:07.061 --> 03:10:08.440
<v Speaker 4>stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lived through it,</v>

4264
03:10:08.441 --> 03:10:11.380
<v Speaker 4>but I was not active during it by any </v>
<v Speaker 4>stretch of the imagination,</v>

4265
03:10:11.381 --> 03:10:16.360
<v Speaker 4>but it feels like that time was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>reaction to the culture,</v>

4266
03:10:16.390 --> 03:10:17.170
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4267
03:10:17.170 --> 03:10:19.780
<v Speaker 4>things have gotten too loosey goosey </v>
<v Speaker 4>around here,</v>

4268
03:10:20.140 --> 03:10:23.450
<v Speaker 4>and then things got conservative for </v>
<v Speaker 4>eight years or.</v>

4269
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:24.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it feels like things loosened </v>

4270
03:10:26.381 --> 03:10:26.891
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4271
03:10:26.891 --> 03:10:28.210
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm no political analysts,</v>

4272
03:10:28.211 --> 03:10:30.100
<v Speaker 4>but it just seems like if you look over </v>
<v Speaker 4>your history,</v>

4273
03:10:30.940 --> 03:10:35.940
<v Speaker 4>it contracts and it expands the </v>
<v Speaker 4>contracts and it expands,</v>

4274
03:10:35.981 --> 03:10:40.981
<v Speaker 4>but the contractions don't seem to bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>it back to square one.</v>

4275
03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:42.393
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may be a matter of of two steps </v>

4276
03:10:43.961 --> 03:10:45.280
<v Speaker 4>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one step back,</v>

4277
03:10:45.281 --> 03:10:46.990
<v Speaker 4>two steps forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one step back.</v>

4278
03:10:46.990 --> 03:10:49.030
<v Speaker 4>And if you do that enough of the course </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a nation,</v>

4279
03:10:49.540 --> 03:10:51.820
<v Speaker 4>there's growth and you'll see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance.</v>

4280
03:10:51.821 --> 03:10:55.930
<v Speaker 4>But you've got a bunch of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't believe in the same things,</v>

4281
03:10:56.170 --> 03:10:58.810
<v Speaker 4>don't even see the world through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same prism.</v>

4282
03:10:58.811 --> 03:11:00.040
<v Speaker 4>So it just feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4283
03:11:00.041 --> 03:11:02.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

4284
03:11:02.490 --> 03:11:06.130
<v Speaker 4>a couple stoners talking about how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to do the presidency better.</v>

4285
03:11:06.520 --> 03:11:09.400
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you just have an agreement where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like eight years of this,</v>

4286
03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:10.353
<v Speaker 4>eight years of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's only if it's a two party </v>

4287
03:11:11.381 --> 03:11:12.214
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what if you come up with a four </v>

4288
03:11:14.111 --> 03:11:15.580
<v Speaker 4>party system and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4289
03:11:15.581 --> 03:11:17.710
<v Speaker 4>you only get four years and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next.</v>

4290
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:20.110
<v Speaker 4>Then it goes to this party right after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then this part of this is a</v>

4291
03:11:20.110 --> 03:11:20.943
<v Speaker 6>multiple party system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can have a multiple independent </v>

4292
03:11:23.291 --> 03:11:24.910
<v Speaker 6>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you look at the ballot,</v>

4293
03:11:24.911 --> 03:11:27.340
<v Speaker 6>a lot of other people wanting to run for</v>
<v Speaker 6>president,</v>

4294
03:11:27.341 --> 03:11:30.010
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Gary Johnson and Jill Stein and I'm</v>

4295
03:11:30.011 --> 03:11:31.800
<v Speaker 6>sure there were a bunch of other ones </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we don't know.</v>

4296
03:11:32.110 --> 03:11:34.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was Zoltan Istvan who's the.</v>

4297
03:11:34.350 --> 03:11:39.040
<v Speaker 6>He's the trends in dent or transhumanist</v>
<v Speaker 6>party like a lot of people ran,</v>

4298
03:11:39.041 --> 03:11:44.041
<v Speaker 6>but that that's the system is just so </v>
<v Speaker 6>old.</v>

4299
03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:48.610
<v Speaker 6>It's just so goddamn ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're trying to patch up this thing that</v>

4300
03:11:48.611 --> 03:11:51.460
<v Speaker 6>we would never create today if it </v>
<v Speaker 6>existed today.</v>

4301
03:11:51.461 --> 03:11:54.340
<v Speaker 6>There's no way we would ever let one </v>
<v Speaker 6>person have all the fucking power.</v>

4302
03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:56.193
<v Speaker 6>I just think that human beings are in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>process of waking up and realizing how </v>

4303
03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:06.100
<v Speaker 6>bizarre our position is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4304
03:12:06.210 --> 03:12:07.043
<v Speaker 6>and not just our position in America,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but our position on the planet earth as </v>

4305
03:12:10.481 --> 03:12:11.920
<v Speaker 6>it hurdles through infinity.</v>

4306
03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:13.053
<v Speaker 6>We were on a spinning ball that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>floating in the sky and hurling towards </v>

4307
03:12:16.301 --> 03:12:20.020
<v Speaker 6>the cosmos or through the cosmos and we </v>
<v Speaker 6>tend not to focus.</v>

4308
03:12:20.021 --> 03:12:20.854
<v Speaker 6>That alone is insane and we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>concentrating on whether or not gay </v>

4309
03:12:25.211 --> 03:12:26.044
<v Speaker 6>people should be able to marry or girls </v>
<v Speaker 6>should be able to get abortions or </v>

4310
03:12:29.350 --> 03:12:30.183
<v Speaker 6>whether or not black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're fucking hurling through infinity </v>

4311
03:12:34.060 --> 03:12:34.893
<v Speaker 6>and I think this slow process of </v>
<v Speaker 6>realization coincides with the </v>

4312
03:12:39.190 --> 03:12:40.023
<v Speaker 6>innovation that you're seeing from like </v>
<v Speaker 6>all these different new technology </v>

4313
03:12:44.500 --> 03:12:47.890
<v Speaker 6>companies that are coming up with better</v>
<v Speaker 6>and better ways to communicate,</v>

4314
03:12:47.891 --> 03:12:50.840
<v Speaker 6>whether it's cellular or a video or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whether they're.</v>

4315
03:12:50.950 --> 03:12:54.710
<v Speaker 6>They're using snapchat or virtual </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality rooms where they can all meet in</v>

4316
03:12:54.860 --> 03:12:57.920
<v Speaker 6>and it's going to keep going and going </v>
<v Speaker 6>and going and going and going and going.</v>

4317
03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:01.550
<v Speaker 6>Until we're in some sort of a matrix </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

4318
03:13:01.551 --> 03:13:04.070
<v Speaker 6>It's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to fucking happen.</v>

4319
03:13:04.070 --> 03:13:06.440
<v Speaker 6>You think we go digital ventures hundred</v>
<v Speaker 6>percent,</v>

4320
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:07.543
<v Speaker 6>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think we might not even have a </v>

4321
03:13:10.161 --> 03:13:12.620
<v Speaker 6>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's entirely possible.</v>

4322
03:13:12.740 --> 03:13:14.510
<v Speaker 6>We're going to create a new form of </v>
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>

4323
03:13:14.660 --> 03:13:15.493
<v Speaker 6>some new artificial form of life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that thing is going to be what goes </v>

4324
03:13:19.431 --> 03:13:21.770
<v Speaker 6>on from now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to merge with that somehow.</v>

4325
03:13:22.400 --> 03:13:23.233
<v Speaker 6>We're going to find out that they can </v>
<v Speaker 6>give you new eyes when your eyes go bad </v>

4326
03:13:27.350 --> 03:13:31.940
<v Speaker 6>and these eyes allow you to look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>navigation screens and Google things and</v>

4327
03:13:31.941 --> 03:13:35.540
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be able to get to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>able to stare straight at the sun.</v>

4328
03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:36.623
<v Speaker 6>There's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's inevitable that we're going to </v>

4329
03:13:38.511 --> 03:13:39.344
<v Speaker 6>improve upon the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're already replacing people's hips </v>

4330
03:13:41.481 --> 03:13:42.314
<v Speaker 6>and shoulders and knees.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're growing fucking hearts in a </v>

4331
03:13:45.021 --> 03:13:47.420
<v Speaker 6>laboratory with stem cells that actually</v>
<v Speaker 6>beat.</v>

4332
03:13:47.660 --> 03:13:50.120
<v Speaker 6>They create a woman's bladder at a stem </v>
<v Speaker 6>cells.</v>

4333
03:13:50.121 --> 03:13:52.370
<v Speaker 6>She had bladder cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They made her a bladder here.</v>

4334
03:13:52.371 --> 03:13:54.020
<v Speaker 6>We've got one for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stitched it back in.</v>

4335
03:13:54.021 --> 03:13:54.854
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

4336
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:59.660
<v Speaker 6>Like we're doing some crazy shit and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to keep going.</v>

4337
03:13:59.930 --> 03:14:00.711
<v Speaker 6>Fifty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>60,</v>

4338
03:14:00.711 --> 03:14:01.730
<v Speaker 6>70,</v>
<v Speaker 6>8,100</v>

4339
03:14:01.731 --> 03:14:02.990
<v Speaker 6>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever it takes,</v>

4340
03:14:03.140 --> 03:14:05.940
<v Speaker 6>we're going to merge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to merge with technology.</v>

4341
03:14:08.060 --> 03:14:11.870
<v Speaker 7>I heaven sitting here talking for a </v>
<v Speaker 7>little while and normally when you're in</v>

4342
03:14:11.871 --> 03:14:12.704
<v Speaker 7>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've got that fucking device in your </v>

4343
03:14:14.361 --> 03:14:15.194
<v Speaker 7>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's when I've noticed that my wife </v>

4344
03:14:16.161 --> 03:14:18.290
<v Speaker 7>says that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's like,</v>

4345
03:14:18.291 --> 03:14:21.950
<v Speaker 7>you never separated from that phone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I get up from side of the bed,</v>

4346
03:14:21.951 --> 03:14:23.960
<v Speaker 7>I pick it up and go to the bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I'm like,</v>

4347
03:14:24.170 --> 03:14:25.003
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I might want to play a game or I might </v>

4348
03:14:25.551 --> 03:14:26.384
<v Speaker 7>want to look up some information.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like there seems to be a human need for </v>

4349
03:14:29.751 --> 03:14:33.410
<v Speaker 7>data at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now we've trained ourselves to have debt</v>

4350
03:14:33.411 --> 03:14:35.240
<v Speaker 7>or to fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We no longer sit there and go,</v>

4351
03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:38.180
<v Speaker 7>what does that person's name now you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>just like,</v>

4352
03:14:38.210 --> 03:14:39.320
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll look it up.</v>

4353
03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:41.750
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So a lot of our thinking has been pushed</v>

4354
03:14:41.751 --> 03:14:46.160
<v Speaker 7>off to to technology that we've created,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we feel comfortable with a gun like,</v>

4355
03:14:46.161 --> 03:14:46.641
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4356
03:14:46.641 --> 03:14:50.180
<v Speaker 7>we're smarter than that and it keeps </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting better and faster.</v>

4357
03:14:50.181 --> 03:14:51.014
<v Speaker 7>Do you think about it like all those </v>
<v Speaker 7>body parts you're talking about them </v>

4358
03:14:52.431 --> 03:14:53.570
<v Speaker 7>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the last,</v>

4359
03:14:53.571 --> 03:14:54.404
<v Speaker 7>what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Twenty years,</v>

4360
03:14:54.770 --> 03:14:55.603
<v Speaker 7>like prior to that there was no like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey will grow you a new bladder or hey </v>

4361
03:14:57.741 --> 03:15:00.040
<v Speaker 7>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can put skin on you again.</v>

4362
03:15:00.070 --> 03:15:01.880
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it wouldn't look like that and shit like</v>

4363
03:15:01.881 --> 03:15:02.714
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah.</v>

4364
03:15:03.140 --> 03:15:04.190
<v Speaker 7>What's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4365
03:15:04.191 --> 03:15:05.990
<v Speaker 7>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the next 50 years</v>

4366
03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:07.233
<v Speaker 6>merge we're going to somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this new Google assistant that </v>

4367
03:15:10.611 --> 03:15:11.510
<v Speaker 6>comes with the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4368
03:15:11.511 --> 03:15:12.344
<v Speaker 6>the Google Pixel phone and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 6>their version of Siri but it's superior </v>

4369
03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:18.680
<v Speaker 6>because it's contextual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I could say like,</v>

4370
03:15:18.681 --> 03:15:20.120
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he prefers not to calm self bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus because he doesn't like how the </v>

4396
03:16:15.621 --> 03:16:17.420
<v Speaker 3>story ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He likes bitcoin.</v>

4397
03:16:17.430 --> 03:16:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Buddha feels like it's better leads to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment problem.</v>

4398
03:16:20.810 --> 03:16:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody fucking hack their account</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

4399
03:16:22.991 --> 03:16:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

4400
03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:24.353
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a long conversation if you </v>

4401
03:16:25.831 --> 03:16:26.820
<v Speaker 3>want to go with no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no need,</v>

4402
03:16:26.830 --> 03:16:31.830
<v Speaker 3>but that is actually an exchange that </v>
<v Speaker 3>got tapped into is the magic,</v>

4403
03:16:31.981 --> 03:16:34.770
<v Speaker 3>the gathering exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4404
03:16:34.771 --> 03:16:36.120
<v Speaker 3>That's what it started out as.</v>

4405
03:16:36.230 --> 03:16:37.063
<v Speaker 3>You know that game magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gathering started off as that and </v>

4406
03:16:39.091 --> 03:16:39.924
<v Speaker 3>then during that time people started </v>
<v Speaker 3>trading bitcoin on that when it was </v>

4407
03:16:43.441 --> 03:16:44.274
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that bitcoin became worth </v>

4408
03:16:45.721 --> 03:16:46.554
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of dollars and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got robbed so all the bitcoin got </v>

4409
03:16:48.901 --> 03:16:49.734
<v Speaker 3>stolen out and this guy got in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he ran the site that he was </v>

4410
03:16:52.141 --> 03:16:52.974
<v Speaker 3>never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one had any idea that I was going to </v>

4411
03:16:54.151 --> 03:16:57.270
<v Speaker 3>be worth hundreds of millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that this guy would lose it all.</v>

4412
03:16:57.660 --> 03:17:00.960
<v Speaker 3>So it was the whole thing was like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really crazy and sort of fair,</v>

4413
03:17:00.961 --> 03:17:05.961
<v Speaker 3>but the spirit of Bitcoin is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can exchange money for services.</v>

4414
03:17:06.421 --> 03:17:09.810
<v Speaker 3>But with no third party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just you and I know bank of like,</v>

4415
03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:11.160
<v Speaker 3>you want to buy this computer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

4416
03:17:11.161 --> 03:17:12.770
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me x amount of bitcoin.</v>

4417
03:17:12.780 --> 03:17:14.010
<v Speaker 3>And you sent it to my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

4418
03:17:14.011 --> 03:17:14.160
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

4419
03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:16.740
<v Speaker 3>We got a deal and then you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

4420
03:17:16.741 --> 03:17:17.574
<v Speaker 3>this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean if you could get to the point </v>

4421
03:17:19.860 --> 03:17:20.693
<v Speaker 3>where are you're talking to your phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you tell your phone to order you a </v>

4422
03:17:24.901 --> 03:17:28.680
<v Speaker 3>pizza and pay for it in bit corn and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's doing everything digitally and it's</v>

4423
03:17:29.010 --> 03:17:32.790
<v Speaker 3>winter big corn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The corn already buying shits,</v>

4424
03:17:32.791 --> 03:17:36.030
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it when it's a hooker bit Quan?</v>

4425
03:17:36.180 --> 03:17:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4426
03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:40.040
<v Speaker 3>that sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll have the corn,</v>

4427
03:17:40.041 --> 03:17:44.430
<v Speaker 3>but not everyone will have the quad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it was the climate meant like love,</v>

4428
03:17:44.431 --> 03:17:46.000
<v Speaker 3>respect everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

4429
03:17:46.080 --> 03:17:47.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that package?</v>

4430
03:17:47.670 --> 03:17:49.680
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember Jerry Maguire,</v>

4431
03:17:49.681 --> 03:17:50.680
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was always talking about that.</v>

4432
03:17:50.681 --> 03:17:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

4433
03:17:52.291 --> 03:17:53.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the full package.</v>

4434
03:17:53.671 --> 03:17:55.500
<v Speaker 3>It was love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

4435
03:17:55.501 --> 03:17:57.560
<v Speaker 3>respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endorsement.</v>

4436
03:17:58.530 --> 03:18:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a bigger deal than just like,</v>

4437
03:18:00.450 --> 03:18:01.290
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4438
03:18:01.291 --> 03:18:02.790
<v Speaker 3>But go back to bit coin.</v>

4439
03:18:02.790 --> 03:18:04.080
<v Speaker 3>So it's still going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4440
03:18:04.081 --> 03:18:04.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4441
03:18:04.621 --> 03:18:05.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some people who love it.</v>

4442
03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the very,</v>

4443
03:18:09.280 --> 03:18:13.890
<v Speaker 3>very democratic way to like my money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I have to go through this,</v>

4444
03:18:13.891 --> 03:18:14.461
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4445
03:18:14.461 --> 03:18:15.294
<v Speaker 3>and I understand those institutions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>FDC is all built to protect your money </v>

4446
03:18:19.741 --> 03:18:20.574
<v Speaker 3>but also seems engineered to keep your </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and get your money and take a </v>

4447
03:18:23.940 --> 03:18:24.773
<v Speaker 3>percentage of it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the weirdest abstract take on </v>

4448
03:18:27.181 --> 03:18:28.420
<v Speaker 3>crypto currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4449
03:18:28.590 --> 03:18:32.370
<v Speaker 3>I think that ultimately all money will </v>
<v Speaker 3>be digital and since digital,</v>

4450
03:18:32.890 --> 03:18:34.080
<v Speaker 3>since money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it,</v>

4451
03:18:34.220 --> 03:18:37.860
<v Speaker 3>if it all becomes digital like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>money is basically information.</v>

4452
03:18:38.070 --> 03:18:42.000
<v Speaker 3>And the one thing that's keeping people </v>
<v Speaker 3>from each other,</v>

4453
03:18:42.210 --> 03:18:43.043
<v Speaker 3>like the re,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that separates us is the </v>

4454
03:18:44.491 --> 03:18:47.220
<v Speaker 3>barrier of information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't read your emails,</v>

4455
03:18:47.350 --> 03:18:48.370
<v Speaker 3>can't read my mind,</v>

4456
03:18:48.700 --> 03:18:51.730
<v Speaker 6>you can't see my pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't,</v>

4457
03:18:52.080 --> 03:18:56.380
<v Speaker 6>you can't know everything that you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>possibly know instantaneously.</v>

4458
03:18:56.381 --> 03:18:59.560
<v Speaker 6>There's like this barrier and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>barrier is all information,</v>

4459
03:18:59.561 --> 03:19:00.700
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all trying to get,</v>

4460
03:19:01.180 --> 03:19:04.060
<v Speaker 6>trying to get like writing what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what has someone written,</v>

4461
03:19:04.240 --> 03:19:05.073
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is,</v>

4462
03:19:05.140 --> 03:19:08.470
<v Speaker 6>what is all the scholarly work on </v>
<v Speaker 6>astrophysics,</v>

4463
03:19:08.471 --> 03:19:12.610
<v Speaker 6>what does all that stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the barriers between us and those things</v>

4464
03:19:12.790 --> 03:19:13.623
<v Speaker 6>are slowly being removed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's more and more like if you </v>

4465
03:19:16.031 --> 03:19:19.960
<v Speaker 6>went on the Internet in 1996 and tried </v>
<v Speaker 6>to get an education,</v>

4466
03:19:19.961 --> 03:19:22.640
<v Speaker 6>you'd be retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you're not have that education,</v>

4467
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:23.503
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to learn shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But now like you can legitimately get </v>

4468
03:19:26.471 --> 03:19:27.304
<v Speaker 6>like a full college education online.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Plus you can read a million different </v>

4469
03:19:31.391 --> 03:19:32.224
<v Speaker 6>papers on all sorts of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially if you want to pay for them </v>

4470
03:19:34.510 --> 03:19:35.343
<v Speaker 6>on all sorts of different studies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And actually in a classroom you could </v>

4471
03:19:39.940 --> 03:19:42.430
<v Speaker 6>almost never run out of things to </v>
<v Speaker 6>absorb.</v>

4472
03:19:42.730 --> 03:19:43.563
<v Speaker 6>Almost never run out of information and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that that's the one thing that </v>

4473
03:19:46.391 --> 03:19:51.391
<v Speaker 6>technology seems to be embracing is </v>
<v Speaker 6>closing the gap between people and data.</v>

4474
03:19:52.450 --> 03:19:53.283
<v Speaker 6>Closing the gap between people and </v>
<v Speaker 6>information will eventually that money </v>

4475
03:19:56.441 --> 03:19:59.860
<v Speaker 6>is going to be the only bottleneck to </v>
<v Speaker 6>reading each other's minds.</v>

4476
03:20:00.010 --> 03:20:02.110
<v Speaker 6>There's going to be like w,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's what,</v>

4477
03:20:02.140 --> 03:20:04.750
<v Speaker 6>what money is if it's bitcoin or if it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>digital,</v>

4478
03:20:04.751 --> 03:20:06.540
<v Speaker 6>it's a one and a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just a code.</v>

4479
03:20:06.970 --> 03:20:08.950
<v Speaker 6>So what's to stop me from getting into </v>
<v Speaker 6>that code?</v>

4480
03:20:08.951 --> 03:20:10.450
<v Speaker 6>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How come I can't get that code?</v>

4481
03:20:10.570 --> 03:20:11.650
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's somebody else's.</v>

4482
03:20:11.980 --> 03:20:12.970
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

4483
03:20:12.971 --> 03:20:14.470
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does that mean?</v>

4484
03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:16.330
<v Speaker 6>Like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it information?</v>

4485
03:20:16.390 --> 03:20:17.500
<v Speaker 6>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can I get it?</v>

4486
03:20:17.501 --> 03:20:19.240
<v Speaker 6>Can I copy it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now if you copy this.</v>

4487
03:20:19.270 --> 03:20:20.080
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good.</v>

4488
03:20:20.080 --> 03:20:21.040
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

4489
03:20:21.041 --> 03:20:21.874
<v Speaker 6>So it's a finite resource,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's fucking ridiculous because </v>

4490
03:20:23.921 --> 03:20:24.754
<v Speaker 6>it's not.</v>

4491
03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:29.950
<v Speaker 6>We're not talking about oil or water or </v>
<v Speaker 6>rocks or minerals or metals.</v>

4492
03:20:30.070 --> 03:20:32.290
<v Speaker 6>We're talking about some goofy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>numbers.</v>

4493
03:20:32.420 --> 03:20:35.350
<v Speaker 6>They've got an a goddamn commuter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's information.</v>

4494
03:20:35.650 --> 03:20:36.483
<v Speaker 6>It allows us access to resources.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we should all have access to all </v>

4495
03:20:39.161 --> 03:20:44.050
<v Speaker 6>the information and then it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be some weird merging of digital minds,</v>

4496
03:20:44.320 --> 03:20:49.320
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a hive mind system created </v>
<v Speaker 6>by something like Google or some company</v>

4497
03:20:50.410 --> 03:20:51.243
<v Speaker 6>that figures out a way to allow people </v>
<v Speaker 6>to communicate thought that thought and </v>

4498
03:20:53.441 --> 03:20:55.960
<v Speaker 6>it's going to have money attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of it.</v>

4499
03:20:55.961 --> 03:20:58.900
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be a big fucking soup of </v>
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>

4500
03:20:59.320 --> 03:21:01.390
<v Speaker 6>That's going to be the breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The breakdown is money.</v>

4501
03:21:01.930 --> 03:21:03.130
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

4502
03:21:03.131 --> 03:21:05.870
<v Speaker 6>Because it's information because if </v>
<v Speaker 6>money becomes informed,</v>

4503
03:21:05.871 --> 03:21:08.540
<v Speaker 6>this is obviously super stoner talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>

4504
03:21:08.590 --> 03:21:11.080
<v Speaker 6>But if money just becomes one's and </v>
<v Speaker 6>zero's,</v>

4505
03:21:11.320 --> 03:21:14.020
<v Speaker 6>what's coming?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's happening with Wiki leaks?</v>

4506
03:21:14.170 --> 03:21:14.591
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4507
03:21:14.591 --> 03:21:15.251
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4508
03:21:15.251 --> 03:21:18.760
<v Speaker 6>these emails getting hacked data,</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting out,</v>

4509
03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:19.400
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4510
03:21:19.400 --> 03:21:21.640
<v Speaker 6>so many getting hacked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all their data,</v>

4511
03:21:21.641 --> 03:21:26.170
<v Speaker 6>getting out all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's the barriers are falling between</v>

4512
03:21:26.171 --> 03:21:27.490
<v Speaker 6>people and information.</v>

4513
03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:30.620
<v Speaker 7>They said in the government right now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>our government,</v>

4514
03:21:30.770 --> 03:21:31.603
<v Speaker 7>the love of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I say something retarded in someone </v>

4515
03:21:32.481 --> 03:21:33.020
<v Speaker 7>nods,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

4516
03:21:33.020 --> 03:21:34.100
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's fucking,</v>

4517
03:21:34.220 --> 03:21:36.920
<v Speaker 7>that's dumb to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They said that there are,</v>

4518
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:39.830
<v Speaker 7>there's a deep need for hackers in this </v>
<v Speaker 7>country.</v>

4519
03:21:40.250 --> 03:21:41.083
<v Speaker 7>There's not enough because everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 7>else like hacking as exponentially over </v>

4520
03:21:45.741 --> 03:21:49.670
<v Speaker 7>the course of the last few years by </v>
<v Speaker 7>double the amount that it was and that's</v>

4521
03:21:49.700 --> 03:21:52.340
<v Speaker 7>why you're seeing things like they took </v>
<v Speaker 7>down Sony.</v>

4522
03:21:52.400 --> 03:21:54.260
<v Speaker 7>They took,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they took down this one,</v>

4523
03:21:54.650 --> 03:21:57.230
<v Speaker 7>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I lately I've just been like,</v>

4524
03:21:57.260 --> 03:22:00.140
<v Speaker 7>do I really want to have all my world </v>
<v Speaker 7>online?</v>

4525
03:22:00.630 --> 03:22:02.510
<v Speaker 7>I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go the other way where I'm just like,</v>

4526
03:22:02.511 --> 03:22:03.344
<v Speaker 7>well how do you protect that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do you protect what you think you </v>

4527
03:22:05.461 --> 03:22:08.620
<v Speaker 7>will be able to for a while?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I honestly,</v>

4528
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:09.590
<v Speaker 7>the fact that you can't.</v>

4529
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:11.650
<v Speaker 6>Well the trend is clearly going to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>cloud.</v>

4530
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:15.400
<v Speaker 6>If you look at these goddamn new macs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't even have a slot for a USB,</v>

4531
03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:19.300
<v Speaker 6>like a hug or a thumb drive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have a DVD player.</v>

4532
03:22:19.480 --> 03:22:21.880
<v Speaker 6>There's no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to do everything wirelessly.</v>

4533
03:22:21.881 --> 03:22:24.280
<v Speaker 6>Like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is weird.</v>

4534
03:22:24.460 --> 03:22:26.680
<v Speaker 6>So you have a very minimal high hard </v>
<v Speaker 6>drives.</v>

4535
03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:27.633
<v Speaker 6>The hard drives of the new Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Books are smaller than the old hard </v>

4536
03:22:30.731 --> 03:22:31.564
<v Speaker 6>drives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've made them smaller so it can be </v>

4537
03:22:34.031 --> 03:22:36.550
<v Speaker 6>lighter and lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more compact,</v>

4538
03:22:36.551 --> 03:22:40.060
<v Speaker 6>but also you're not storing cheat on you</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they want to throw everything up</v>

4539
03:22:40.061 --> 03:22:42.250
<v Speaker 6>on the cloud and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh man,</v>

4540
03:22:42.340 --> 03:22:43.173
<v Speaker 6>where do you stand in it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating because on one hand I </v>

4541
03:22:46.721 --> 03:22:48.490
<v Speaker 6>think it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>On the other hand,</v>

4542
03:22:48.940 --> 03:22:51.640
<v Speaker 6>digging my heels in the dirt and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting dragged along.</v>

4543
03:22:52.190 --> 03:22:53.770
<v Speaker 6>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got off the apple tip.</v>

4544
03:22:54.040 --> 03:22:58.420
<v Speaker 6>I've got a windows 10 laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two terabytes of storage,</v>

4545
03:22:58.810 --> 03:22:59.550
<v Speaker 6>two terabytes.</v>

4546
03:22:59.550 --> 03:23:02.010
<v Speaker 7>You can't get the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Any Mac whatsoever.</v>

4547
03:23:02.440 --> 03:23:05.230
<v Speaker 6>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It cost you a fucking shit ton.</v>

4548
03:23:05.950 --> 03:23:06.783
<v Speaker 6>Way More.</v>

4549
03:23:07.530 --> 03:23:09.570
<v Speaker 7>Did they choose this upgrade?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Smooth.</v>

4550
03:23:09.870 --> 03:23:11.370
<v Speaker 7>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Windows 10.</v>

4551
03:23:11.380 --> 03:23:12.800
<v Speaker 7>So cat</v>

4552
03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:16.070
<v Speaker 6>people need them for business there if </v>
<v Speaker 6>they broke down all the time,</v>

4553
03:23:16.071 --> 03:23:16.904
<v Speaker 6>but just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just assumed they had to be better </v>

4554
03:23:18.221 --> 03:23:19.240
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I said I'm gonna.</v>

4555
03:23:19.241 --> 03:23:20.074
<v Speaker 6>Give it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've only been using it for a few </v>

4556
03:23:21.280 --> 03:23:22.510
<v Speaker 6>months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Zero problems.</v>

4557
03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:23.980
<v Speaker 6>Super adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Prior to this,</v>

4558
03:23:23.981 --> 03:23:28.981
<v Speaker 6>the whole time for like years since I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>like the nineties,</v>

4559
03:23:29.730 --> 03:23:33.270
<v Speaker 7>you were one of those cats that you know</v>
<v Speaker 7>when it all collapses,</v>

4560
03:23:33.271 --> 03:23:36.170
<v Speaker 7>you're going to be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm fucked your fucking.</v>

4561
03:23:36.180 --> 03:23:38.430
<v Speaker 7>You've unlocked and gone off the grid </v>
<v Speaker 7>before anybody else.</v>

4562
03:23:38.431 --> 03:23:41.460
<v Speaker 7>You've thought about things that most </v>
<v Speaker 7>people don't think you have big things.</v>

4563
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:44.460
<v Speaker 7>You don't just smoke and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dammit,</v>

4564
03:23:44.490 --> 03:23:45.323
<v Speaker 7>life's good you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You smoke and go deep on the big thing </v>

4565
03:23:47.580 --> 03:23:49.650
<v Speaker 7>on stuff that like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you,</v>

4566
03:23:49.680 --> 03:23:51.390
<v Speaker 7>like you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very few people do.</v>

4567
03:23:51.391 --> 03:23:55.860
<v Speaker 7>It's usually stoners that the big issues</v>
<v Speaker 7>are that we all think of.</v>

4568
03:23:55.861 --> 03:23:59.070
<v Speaker 7>The big issues are nothing compared to </v>
<v Speaker 7>like you do recall.</v>

4569
03:23:59.071 --> 03:24:01.320
<v Speaker 7>We're hurdling through space on a </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking rock.</v>

4570
03:24:01.380 --> 03:24:02.213
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anything can happen and you're worried </v>

4571
03:24:05.341 --> 03:24:10.341
<v Speaker 7>about this or this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fucking gender identity,</v>

4572
03:24:10.711 --> 03:24:12.720
<v Speaker 7>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Netflix or something like that.</v>

4573
03:24:13.190 --> 03:24:14.023
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's even the big things that people </v>

4574
03:24:15.091 --> 03:24:16.500
<v Speaker 7>like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is everything in life.</v>

4575
03:24:16.520 --> 03:24:17.353
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you do the Kentucky take on </v>

4576
03:24:18.511 --> 03:24:21.450
<v Speaker 7>everything beyond the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Beyond the obvious,</v>

4577
03:24:21.690 --> 03:24:25.920
<v Speaker 7>beyond the temporal or the daily,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're gone like what's next?</v>

4578
03:24:25.921 --> 03:24:30.921
<v Speaker 7>What happens 10 years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What happens to us?</v>

4579
03:24:30.931 --> 03:24:31.770
<v Speaker 7>Not just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

4580
03:24:31.771 --> 03:24:32.604
<v Speaker 7>what happens to me?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because that's very human nature to be </v>

4581
03:24:34.501 --> 03:24:35.400
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what happens to me,</v>

4582
03:24:35.401 --> 03:24:37.590
<v Speaker 7>but your thing is what happens to us as </v>
<v Speaker 7>a species.</v>

4583
03:24:37.810 --> 03:24:39.730
<v Speaker 7>You're a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're a thinker and a seeker as well as</v>

4584
03:24:39.731 --> 03:24:40.531
<v Speaker 7>like about you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

4585
03:24:40.531 --> 03:24:43.380
<v Speaker 7>You're not content to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think I know everything.</v>

4586
03:24:43.381 --> 03:24:43.980
<v Speaker 7>There is pretty</v>

4587
03:24:43.980 --> 03:24:44.813
<v Speaker 4>much to know that I'm interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rest of them are really not </v>

4588
03:24:45.961 --> 03:24:48.900
<v Speaker 4>interested in you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You refill all the time.</v>

4589
03:24:48.901 --> 03:24:51.840
<v Speaker 4>I met a priest once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were sweet kid and uh,</v>

4590
03:24:51.900 --> 03:24:54.840
<v Speaker 4>he said not when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was like a grown ass man.</v>

4591
03:24:54.841 --> 03:24:56.610
<v Speaker 4>I was 20 somethings before I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 4>dogma.</v>

4592
03:24:56.810 --> 03:24:57.643
<v Speaker 4>So when I went out to film school and 92</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Vancouver and I was in Washington </v>

4593
03:25:02.671 --> 03:25:03.504
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my uncle lived in federal way and so I </v>

4594
03:25:04.871 --> 03:25:05.521
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

4595
03:25:05.521 --> 03:25:07.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go to my uncles and then go</v>
<v Speaker 4>up from there.</v>

4596
03:25:07.861 --> 03:25:10.020
<v Speaker 4>You can drive me up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drop my shit off and stuff.</v>

4597
03:25:10.380 --> 03:25:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'd never really left my side of the</v>

4598
03:25:13.020 --> 03:25:15.480
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let alone fucking New Jersey and,</v>

4599
03:25:15.570 --> 03:25:17.490
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4600
03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:20.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at one point I was still struggling.</v>

4601
03:25:20.101 --> 03:25:20.934
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the end of my Catholicism as I knew </v>

4602
03:25:23.191 --> 03:25:26.100
<v Speaker 4>it in childhood that I just believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything they tell me and stuff.</v>

4603
03:25:26.610 --> 03:25:28.920
<v Speaker 4>So I was having some troubles with it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I went into,</v>

4604
03:25:29.140 --> 03:25:32.040
<v Speaker 4>was walking around and I wouldn't call </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself an emo kid,</v>

4605
03:25:32.041 --> 03:25:32.874
<v Speaker 4>but like I still was raised in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you believe something from the </v>

4606
03:25:36.151 --> 03:25:37.590
<v Speaker 4>moment you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4607
03:25:37.591 --> 03:25:40.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the tenants of the Catholic faith,</v>

4608
03:25:40.930 --> 03:25:41.763
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was an altar boy even for heaven's </v>

4609
03:25:42.591 --> 03:25:43.890
<v Speaker 4>sakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4610
03:25:44.190 --> 03:25:45.023
<v Speaker 4>when that moment comes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like the adult version of </v>

4611
03:25:48.450 --> 03:25:49.920
<v Speaker 4>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your parents are like,</v>

4612
03:25:49.921 --> 03:25:51.530
<v Speaker 4>there is no Santa Claus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4613
03:25:51.570 --> 03:25:53.460
<v Speaker 4>surprise where suddenly you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

4614
03:25:53.920 --> 03:25:56.100
<v Speaker 4>you fuck it up ended my entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>

4615
03:25:56.250 --> 03:25:59.190
<v Speaker 4>So I was going through that and I'm age </v>
<v Speaker 4>22 at this point,</v>

4616
03:25:59.280 --> 03:26:00.390
<v Speaker 4>should have gone through it in high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

4617
03:26:00.391 --> 03:26:05.390
<v Speaker 4>But I held onto my own lot longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I walked into this church and uh,</v>

4618
03:26:05.460 --> 03:26:08.970
<v Speaker 4>I sat down and a priest came by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eventually,</v>

4619
03:26:08.971 --> 03:26:10.230
<v Speaker 4>younger priests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can help you.</v>

4620
03:26:10.230 --> 03:26:11.340
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4621
03:26:11.341 --> 03:26:12.174
<v Speaker 4>I'm just having a crisis of faith and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just sitting here and praying and </v>

4622
03:26:15.421 --> 03:26:17.190
<v Speaker 4>meditating on it and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

4623
03:26:17.191 --> 03:26:18.240
<v Speaker 4>come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come to the office,</v>

4624
03:26:18.241 --> 03:26:19.770
<v Speaker 4>we'll talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went into his office and he was like,</v>

4625
03:26:19.771 --> 03:26:20.604
<v Speaker 4>what's the issue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was like I believed in this shit </v>

4626
03:26:22.440 --> 03:26:27.440
<v Speaker 4>so much when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't even a matter of belief.</v>

4627
03:26:27.451 --> 03:26:29.790
<v Speaker 4>This was the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

4628
03:26:29.791 --> 03:26:32.850
<v Speaker 4>but now I'm of this mind that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

4629
03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:35.640
<v Speaker 4>We follow this Bible and supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the word of God,</v>

4630
03:26:35.641 --> 03:26:36.474
<v Speaker 4>but like thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bunch of people that followed a </v>

4631
03:26:40.291 --> 03:26:43.710
<v Speaker 4>bunch of other books that said there </v>
<v Speaker 4>were multiple gods and now we read those</v>

4632
03:26:43.711 --> 03:26:45.300
<v Speaker 4>books and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that fucking quaint?</v>

4633
03:26:45.570 --> 03:26:47.340
<v Speaker 4>These fuckers thought there were 12 </v>
<v Speaker 4>gods,</v>

4634
03:26:47.341 --> 03:26:49.380
<v Speaker 4>one for each thing that ever happened in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>

4635
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.823
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm afraid one day that like they're </v>

4636
03:26:52.171 --> 03:26:54.300
<v Speaker 4>going to turn around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing about our book is this.</v>

4637
03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:56.220
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't believe.</v>

4638
03:26:56.221 --> 03:27:00.080
<v Speaker 4>Like I believed when I was a kid and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>priest said something really smart.</v>

4639
03:27:00.130 --> 03:27:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I stuck it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The movie was so smart.</v>

4640
03:27:01.680 --> 03:27:02.513
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4641
03:27:03.540 --> 03:27:04.950
<v Speaker 4>he's going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're a little kid,</v>

4642
03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.980
<v Speaker 4>I think of yourself as a small glass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're very easy to fill up.</v>

4643
03:27:08.300 --> 03:27:10.980
<v Speaker 4>It's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put liquid in and you're done.</v>

4644
03:27:11.040 --> 03:27:13.140
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to top off a small glass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gone.</v>

4645
03:27:13.141 --> 03:27:15.120
<v Speaker 4>The older you get the glass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets bigger.</v>

4646
03:27:15.780 --> 03:27:16.613
<v Speaker 4>You can't expect the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>liquid that filled that small glass to </v>

4647
03:27:19.501 --> 03:27:20.334
<v Speaker 4>fill the big glass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like do means like </v>

4648
03:27:21.420 --> 03:27:25.200
<v Speaker 4>periodically you gotta refill the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he was talking about faith and shit,</v>

4649
03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:26.273
<v Speaker 4>but that goes for anything even goes for</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual intellectual pursuits or </v>

4650
03:27:32.221 --> 03:27:36.120
<v Speaker 4>just the person who's the seeker who is </v>
<v Speaker 4>not content to just be like,</v>

4651
03:27:36.300 --> 03:27:38.880
<v Speaker 4>I see it all as it is and I think I </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand it now.</v>

4652
03:27:39.120 --> 03:27:41.280
<v Speaker 4>You always understand there's more to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

4653
03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:43.960
<v Speaker 4>You go looking for the not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4654
03:27:43.961 --> 03:27:44.794
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of fucked up an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's really ultimately important </v>

4655
03:27:48.250 --> 03:27:49.083
<v Speaker 4>if you scrape away all the stuff that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of concern ourselves with the shit </v>

4656
03:27:52.121 --> 03:27:53.500
<v Speaker 4>you think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

4657
03:27:53.501 --> 03:27:54.334
<v Speaker 4>and again this is just from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to some podcasts and mostly </v>

4658
03:27:56.471 --> 03:28:00.100
<v Speaker 4>looking at your instagram feed is shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like useful.</v>

4659
03:28:00.370 --> 03:28:04.240
<v Speaker 4>If it all went away and it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4660
03:28:04.241 --> 03:28:05.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know how to live off the land is so if</v>

4661
03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:09.400
<v Speaker 4>you're thinking big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about where the mind goes.</v>

4662
03:28:09.420 --> 03:28:10.253
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like most people look like you strong </v>

4663
03:28:12.671 --> 03:28:13.504
<v Speaker 4>and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't fucking think nearly as much as </v>

4664
03:28:15.791 --> 03:28:17.320
<v Speaker 4>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that's a stereotype,</v>

4665
03:28:17.321 --> 03:28:20.230
<v Speaker 4>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't develop one set of muscles and</v>

4666
03:28:20.231 --> 03:28:22.150
<v Speaker 4>concentrated on another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Generally speaking,</v>

4667
03:28:22.480 --> 03:28:24.130
<v Speaker 4>you were there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Concentrate on building your brand,</v>

4668
03:28:24.131 --> 03:28:24.964
<v Speaker 4>building your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've found a perfect way to build </v>

4669
03:28:26.261 --> 03:28:26.790
<v Speaker 4>both.</v>

4670
03:28:26.790 --> 03:28:28.290
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

4671
03:28:28.291 --> 03:28:29.580
<v Speaker 3>No?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you're smart,</v>

4672
03:28:29.581 --> 03:28:31.680
<v Speaker 3>you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but especially Jujitsu guys.</v>

4673
03:28:31.920 --> 03:28:33.960
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really smart Jujitsu guys.</v>

4674
03:28:33.961 --> 03:28:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just this week</v>

4675
03:28:35.950 --> 03:28:38.710
<v Speaker 4>stereotype to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all muscle heads must be done.</v>

4676
03:28:38.711 --> 03:28:39.544
<v Speaker 4>That's the only thing I got it.</v>

4677
03:28:39.550 --> 03:28:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Josh Waitzkin do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy from.</v>

4678
03:28:42.040 --> 03:28:45.050
<v Speaker 3>He was the inspiration for the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Searching for Bobby Fischer,</v>

4679
03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:49.520
<v Speaker 3>American chess champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He became obsessed with Jujitsu now,</v>

4680
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black belt under Marcello Garcia.</v>

4681
03:28:52.330 --> 03:28:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the most respected Brazilian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu practitioners have two things.</v>

4682
03:28:57.581 --> 03:28:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Chess and Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's unfair,</v>

4683
03:28:59.350 --> 03:29:00.183
<v Speaker 3>bad motherfucker Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a chess master and he's just a </v>

4684
03:29:02.980 --> 03:29:05.560
<v Speaker 3>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant guy and I mean,</v>

4685
03:29:05.970 --> 03:29:08.230
<v Speaker 3>but a killer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you've got a hold of you,</v>

4686
03:29:08.231 --> 03:29:11.400
<v Speaker 3>he will choke you to death for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only if I did something to.</v>

4687
03:29:11.450 --> 03:29:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying if you had to,</v>

4688
03:29:12.911 --> 03:29:14.170
<v Speaker 3>if you want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's.</v>

4689
03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:15.033
<v Speaker 3>He's not just as genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a genius and a smart and he's </v>

4690
03:29:19.270 --> 03:29:20.680
<v Speaker 3>probably never described himself that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

4691
03:29:20.681 --> 03:29:23.170
<v Speaker 3>He's a martial artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his ability,</v>

4692
03:29:23.171 --> 03:29:26.110
<v Speaker 3>what he can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his specialty is strangling people.</v>

4693
03:29:26.440 --> 03:29:27.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you mean.</v>

4694
03:29:27.860 --> 03:29:30.760
<v Speaker 3>This comes from Marcella Garcia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marcella Garcia,</v>

4695
03:29:30.820 --> 03:29:35.820
<v Speaker 3>as you would know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Marcello is famous for his chokes.</v>

4696
03:29:36.100 --> 03:29:38.980
<v Speaker 3>He's like a famous strangulation artists</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he said,</v>

4697
03:29:38.981 --> 03:29:39.814
<v Speaker 3>some of the most spectacular highlights </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the history of competitive Brazilian </v>

4698
03:29:42.971 --> 03:29:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just choking guys unconscious.</v>

4699
03:29:45.340 --> 03:29:46.810
<v Speaker 3>It's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never killing them.</v>

4700
03:29:46.811 --> 03:29:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Just taking them to the matches to black</v>
<v Speaker 3>belts.</v>

4701
03:29:49.241 --> 03:29:50.410
<v Speaker 3>Go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never.</v>

4702
03:29:50.470 --> 03:29:51.303
<v Speaker 3>You've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember we had this little Garcia vs </v>

4703
03:29:54.221 --> 03:29:55.054
<v Speaker 3>Shaolin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He barely ever seen and so quickly at </v>

4704
03:29:58.261 --> 03:29:59.094
<v Speaker 3>UFC match and you don't have to see a </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC match because this is probably </v>

4705
03:30:01.300 --> 03:30:02.133
<v Speaker 3>something more interesting for you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch because no one got hurt even </v>

4706
03:30:04.181 --> 03:30:05.014
<v Speaker 3>though it looks like the guy was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually just check the blood stops </v>

4707
03:30:08.951 --> 03:30:12.970
<v Speaker 3>the brain and then he lets it go and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's instantaneously back like it's not</v>

4708
03:30:12.971 --> 03:30:15.280
<v Speaker 3>like a knockout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering brain damage.</v>

4709
03:30:15.620 --> 03:30:16.453
<v Speaker 3>The scramble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marcella takes his back and he holds </v>

4710
03:30:18.701 --> 03:30:21.490
<v Speaker 3>onto the choke and Shalon tries to </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirm out of it,</v>

4711
03:30:21.610 --> 03:30:22.443
<v Speaker 3>but he lacks in the choke and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge trying to fight gallantly </v>

4712
03:30:25.751 --> 03:30:28.990
<v Speaker 3>buddy goes asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's out cold here and the referee stops</v>

4713
03:30:28.991 --> 03:30:29.380
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

4714
03:30:29.380 --> 03:30:31.450
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they realize now he's out </v>
<v Speaker 3>cold,</v>

4715
03:30:31.720 --> 03:30:32.553
<v Speaker 3>so marcel gets off of him and walks away</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Shaolin wakes up like just a second </v>

4716
03:30:36.821 --> 03:30:40.190
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's 100 percent fine.</v>

4717
03:30:40.340 --> 03:30:41.061
<v Speaker 3>He just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4718
03:30:41.061 --> 03:30:42.230
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He starts talking.</v>

4719
03:30:42.320 --> 03:30:45.140
<v Speaker 3>He's not like he got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you got brain damage.</v>

4720
03:30:45.170 --> 03:30:48.890
<v Speaker 3>He just got choked unconscious like </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll be instantaneously fine,</v>

4721
03:30:49.310 --> 03:30:52.970
<v Speaker 3>but Marcello was just choked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never totally out,</v>

4722
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:55.520
<v Speaker 3>but have gotten super close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten to like,</v>

4723
03:30:55.521 --> 03:30:56.354
<v Speaker 3>the elevator door is like closing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that literally way it feels entirely </v>

4724
03:31:00.981 --> 03:31:01.814
<v Speaker 3>like the walls are closing in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the darkness is coming and you're </v>

4725
03:31:04.390 --> 03:31:07.250
<v Speaker 3>like barely can get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten to the door.</v>

4726
03:31:07.430 --> 03:31:11.870
<v Speaker 3>I never went totally asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you go into the door,</v>

4727
03:31:11.890 --> 03:31:13.910
<v Speaker 3>you're also smart enough to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not dying.</v>

4728
03:31:13.911 --> 03:31:14.870
<v Speaker 3>I tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4729
03:31:14.900 --> 03:31:16.970
<v Speaker 3>you tap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta know when to tap pants.</v>

4730
03:31:17.000 --> 03:31:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Like is there a moment of panic where </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

4731
03:31:19.040 --> 03:31:19.791
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

4732
03:31:19.791 --> 03:31:20.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4733
03:31:20.211 --> 03:31:22.430
<v Speaker 3>you definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw like that dude was like,</v>

4734
03:31:23.020 --> 03:31:25.190
<v Speaker 3>he was like fucking go picked up by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Eagle.</v>

4735
03:31:25.191 --> 03:31:29.180
<v Speaker 3>He was like before it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then he gets out Jujitsu.</v>

4736
03:31:29.181 --> 03:31:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those moments happen a lot.</v>

4737
03:31:32.090 --> 03:31:32.923
<v Speaker 3>So like if you go to a Jujitsu class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very likely you might get choked </v>

4738
03:31:35.241 --> 03:31:37.520
<v Speaker 3>out three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four times by one person.</v>

4739
03:31:37.970 --> 03:31:38.803
<v Speaker 3>Like if you roll with some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Brazilian jujitsu black belt and </v>

4740
03:31:41.031 --> 03:31:41.864
<v Speaker 3>you're like a blue belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty likely he's going to get you at </v>

4741
03:31:44.870 --> 03:31:45.890
<v Speaker 3>least a couple of times while you roll </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

4742
03:31:45.891 --> 03:31:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're like really agile and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at defending yourself.</v>

4743
03:31:48.790 --> 03:31:52.110
<v Speaker 3>What are the chances of losing off your </v>
<v Speaker 3>windpipe carotid artery,</v>

4744
03:31:52.111 --> 03:31:52.944
<v Speaker 3>your carotids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They literally like closing the blood </v>

4745
03:31:55.791 --> 03:31:56.624
<v Speaker 3>supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dangerous that not not only if you </v>

4746
03:31:59.271 --> 03:32:04.271
<v Speaker 3>keep it on but clamped on like how long </v>
<v Speaker 3>a minute probably kill somebody.</v>

4747
03:32:05.410 --> 03:32:07.310
<v Speaker 3>That's I'm saying so like they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

4748
03:32:07.340 --> 03:32:09.980
<v Speaker 3>You have to be a surgeon to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got them for 30.</v>

4749
03:32:09.981 --> 03:32:10.814
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4750
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:14.860
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to find out like how long would</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to hold someone would.</v>

4751
03:32:14.930 --> 03:32:17.990
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how a healthy they were,</v>

4752
03:32:18.020 --> 03:32:20.660
<v Speaker 3>how young they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure would have a factor as well,</v>

4753
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:25.280
<v Speaker 3>but find out how long would it take if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you choke someone out before they died,</v>

4754
03:32:25.430 --> 03:32:26.263
<v Speaker 3>someone must've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone wants to Google request that's </v>

4755
03:32:29.751 --> 03:32:31.370
<v Speaker 3>going to bring the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come,</v>

4756
03:32:31.880 --> 03:32:36.880
<v Speaker 3>but what if you could do that with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>body part [inaudible] I mean,</v>

4757
03:32:36.901 --> 03:32:41.050
<v Speaker 3>and you got to get a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>leverage on somebody's carotid artists.</v>

4758
03:32:41.051 --> 03:32:41.884
<v Speaker 3>Science reflex death is sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered a mechanism of death and </v>

4759
03:32:44.031 --> 03:32:46.040
<v Speaker 3>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Granulation remains highly disputed.</v>

4760
03:32:46.400 --> 03:32:47.233
<v Speaker 3>The port of time from application to </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconsciousness varies from seven to 14 </v>

4761
03:32:50.031 --> 03:32:50.510
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>

4762
03:32:50.510 --> 03:32:51.343
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If effectively applied to one minute in </v>

4763
03:32:54.141 --> 03:32:57.740
<v Speaker 3>other cases with death occurring minutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>after unconsciousness.</v>

4764
03:32:57.890 --> 03:33:01.380
<v Speaker 3>So if you held on for a couple minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the next show on,</v>

4765
03:33:01.420 --> 03:33:04.760
<v Speaker 3>would you have to choke ticket?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4766
03:33:04.761 --> 03:33:07.090
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that from a forum MMA forum?</v>

4767
03:33:07.430 --> 03:33:11.600
<v Speaker 3>They might not necessarily know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's on the Internet.</v>

4768
03:33:11.601 --> 03:33:13.160
<v Speaker 3>It must be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's read it and believe it.</v>

4769
03:33:13.460 --> 03:33:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forums,</v>

4770
03:33:14.390 --> 03:33:15.770
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ars,</v>

4771
03:33:15.771 --> 03:33:17.700
<v Speaker 3>Technica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one is um,</v>

4772
03:33:17.790 --> 03:33:18.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they'll believe.</v>

4773
03:33:19.020 --> 03:33:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Think about it is super wrong right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

4774
03:33:22.280 --> 03:33:24.530
<v Speaker 3>When it says varies from seven to 14 </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds,</v>

4775
03:33:24.890 --> 03:33:25.723
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even take a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean you could put someone </v>

4776
03:33:28.731 --> 03:33:31.010
<v Speaker 3>to sleep in a second if you hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

4777
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:33.440
<v Speaker 3>if you have just hit it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just hold onto it right.</v>

4778
03:33:33.560 --> 03:33:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Especially if they're not resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they're hurt already and they're</v>

4779
03:33:37.921 --> 03:33:38.550
<v Speaker 3>relaxed,</v>

4780
03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:40.760
<v Speaker 2>you could just put them to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you,</v>

4781
03:33:40.761 --> 03:33:43.770
<v Speaker 2>if someone gets hit first and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get choked and they don't,</v>

4782
03:33:43.920 --> 03:33:44.753
<v Speaker 2>they don't defend it quickly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they're out of it and then they </v>

4783
03:33:46.951 --> 03:33:48.180
<v Speaker 2>get choked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just go to sleep.</v>

4784
03:33:48.570 --> 03:33:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Like real quick says anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever been choked to death.</v>

4785
03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:53.743
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure people have been choked to </v>

4786
03:33:55.650 --> 03:33:57.450
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just not in the UFC.</v>

4787
03:33:57.570 --> 03:34:00.480
<v Speaker 2>What I mean in the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that was the Eric Garner thing.</v>

4788
03:34:00.510 --> 03:34:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a breathing issue.</v>

4789
03:34:02.640 --> 03:34:05.310
<v Speaker 2>That was the guy who the police killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York.</v>

4790
03:34:05.311 --> 03:34:07.140
<v Speaker 2>They took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was selling loose cigarettes in front</v>

4791
03:34:07.141 --> 03:34:09.990
<v Speaker 2>of them and they get mad at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were still talking.</v>

4792
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:11.023
<v Speaker 2>You were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed them with the choke </v>

4793
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're taking real life.</v>

4794
03:34:13.591 --> 03:34:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4795
03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:15.720
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying you can choke someone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

4796
03:34:15.721 --> 03:34:16.440
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think.</v>

4797
03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he died Maura's,</v>

4798
03:34:18.520 --> 03:34:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Ellie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

4799
03:34:19.220 --> 03:34:22.410
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't physically very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About three minutes is about the most.</v>

4800
03:34:22.420 --> 03:34:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Your brain can last without air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three minutes without air.</v>

4801
03:34:24.740 --> 03:34:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

4802
03:34:28.140 --> 03:34:28.973
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would never it how like </v>

4803
03:34:32.461 --> 03:34:34.320
<v Speaker 2>basically he get out of you for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>

4804
03:34:34.321 --> 03:34:36.040
<v Speaker 2>you'd be passed out and then they let </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go.</v>

4805
03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4806
03:34:38.130 --> 03:34:39.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would just let you go.</v>

4807
03:34:39.091 --> 03:34:39.924
<v Speaker 2>And in class sometimes people forget to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tap in class so they don't tap quick </v>

4808
03:34:42.931 --> 03:34:44.490
<v Speaker 2>enough when they go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

4809
03:34:44.491 --> 03:34:45.324
<v Speaker 2>I like the things you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have zero interest in doing the </v>

4810
03:34:47.201 --> 03:34:49.570
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't understand me.</v>

4811
03:34:49.650 --> 03:34:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Like every time I look at those </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures,</v>

4812
03:34:51.061 --> 03:34:51.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

4813
03:34:51.721 --> 03:34:52.980
<v Speaker 2>he's living a cool life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4814
03:34:53.310 --> 03:34:55.930
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any one of these things.</v>

4815
03:34:55.970 --> 03:35:00.420
<v Speaker 2>We could certainly be an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to admire an envy.</v>

4816
03:35:00.420 --> 03:35:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Someone's like freedom in life and still</v>
<v Speaker 2>not want to do it yourself.</v>

4817
03:35:04.681 --> 03:35:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at somebody and be like,</v>

4818
03:35:06.191 --> 03:35:07.024
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to do the things they do or be </v>

4819
03:35:09.481 --> 03:35:10.314
<v Speaker 2>the person they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead I can look at you and </v>

4820
03:35:11.461 --> 03:35:14.280
<v Speaker 2>appreciate what you do and who you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and never wants to be like,</v>

4821
03:35:14.340 --> 03:35:15.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

4822
03:35:15.840 --> 03:35:18.030
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't like.</v>

4823
03:35:18.031 --> 03:35:21.300
<v Speaker 2>You're into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're far too much of a man.</v>

4824
03:35:21.930 --> 03:35:24.960
<v Speaker 2>You're such a dude and not a dude like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bro,</v>

4825
03:35:25.350 --> 03:35:27.030
<v Speaker 2>but you are like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

4826
03:35:27.031 --> 03:35:28.860
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're somebody's dad.</v>

4827
03:35:28.920 --> 03:35:30.600
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you are.</v>

4828
03:35:30.990 --> 03:35:32.970
<v Speaker 2>When I think of a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think of,</v>

4829
03:35:32.971 --> 03:35:34.760
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean this to sound like </v>
<v Speaker 2>compliments.</v>

4830
03:35:35.020 --> 03:35:38.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a big head when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave your problems in life now,</v>

4831
03:35:38.610 --> 03:35:39.443
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you would be a cool dead </v>

4832
03:35:40.791 --> 03:35:41.550
<v Speaker 2>like your kids.</v>

4833
03:35:41.550 --> 03:35:43.040
<v Speaker 2>That's very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your kids have a.</v>

4834
03:35:43.260 --> 03:35:44.093
<v Speaker 2>have a wonderful lifetime ahead of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have had great experience thus far it </v>

4835
03:35:47.701 --> 03:35:48.534
<v Speaker 2>seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the rest of their lives they're </v>

4836
03:35:49.621 --> 03:35:52.530
<v Speaker 2>being raised by a thinking masculine </v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4837
03:35:52.531 --> 03:35:53.364
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my kid will never have that in her </v>

4838
03:35:56.461 --> 03:35:57.470
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>

4839
03:35:57.480 --> 03:35:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Would you want to be different than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are though?</v>

4840
03:35:59.251 --> 03:36:01.240
<v Speaker 2>You seem super content with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>

4841
03:36:01.860 --> 03:36:02.693
<v Speaker 2>The way I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like everyone's dealt the </v>

4842
03:36:04.651 --> 03:36:05.484
<v Speaker 2>cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4843
03:36:05.520 --> 03:36:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4844
03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:07.770
<v Speaker 2>and you could improve some things in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

4845
03:36:07.771 --> 03:36:08.604
<v Speaker 2>but like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when we were young and they'd be </v>

4846
03:36:10.771 --> 03:36:12.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your cross to bear.</v>

4847
03:36:12.151 --> 03:36:13.600
<v Speaker 2>When I was kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4848
03:36:13.650 --> 03:36:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I was always having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom would be like,</v>

4849
03:36:15.121 --> 03:36:16.680
<v Speaker 2>well that's your cross to bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4850
03:36:16.681 --> 03:36:17.514
<v Speaker 2>as if like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just something you're as if it </v>

4851
03:36:18.271 --> 03:36:19.104
<v Speaker 2>was genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if she wasn't like she could </v>

4852
03:36:20.181 --> 03:36:21.180
<v Speaker 2>have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4853
03:36:21.181 --> 03:36:23.760
<v Speaker 2>let's get you working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe feed you less or whatever.</v>

4854
03:36:23.761 --> 03:36:25.440
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just your cross to bear,</v>

4855
03:36:25.441 --> 03:36:26.274
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of your life is blessed and </v>

4856
03:36:27.751 --> 03:36:29.190
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably just didn't.</v>

4857
03:36:29.280 --> 03:36:30.113
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people say things like that </v>

4858
03:36:31.021 --> 03:36:31.854
<v Speaker 2>because that's what someone told them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they never stopped to think about </v>

4859
03:36:33.781 --> 03:36:33.960
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4860
03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:36.100
<v Speaker 2>her mother definitely told her that</v>

4861
03:36:36.100 --> 03:36:39.090
<v Speaker 4>your cross to bear is something that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kind of passed sanction.</v>

4862
03:36:39.310 --> 03:36:40.990
<v Speaker 4>My mom was a wonderful woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just spent.</v>

4863
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.921
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4864
03:36:41.921 --> 03:36:43.900
<v Speaker 4>she's getting old and stuff and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4865
03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:49.090
<v Speaker 4>I took her to see Dolly Parton and Tampa</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a Dolly Parton have seen three times</v>

4866
03:36:49.091 --> 03:36:49.901
<v Speaker 4>in two months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

4867
03:36:49.901 --> 03:36:54.901
<v Speaker 4>she smells like she smells like cotton </v>
<v Speaker 4>candy and baby powder and dude,</v>

4868
03:36:55.730 --> 03:36:57.720
<v Speaker 4>she's high note here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me try to hit you.</v>

4869
03:36:57.730 --> 03:37:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Always hit me to cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dolly Parton is seven years old.</v>

4870
03:37:01.810 --> 03:37:04.570
<v Speaker 4>She just three hour fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't sit in one place.</v>

4874
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:13.530
<v Speaker 4>which now she didn't just blow </v>
<v Speaker 4>saxophone.</v>

4875
03:37:13.540 --> 03:37:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a few notes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She played yackety sac,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I took my 70 year old mother to see her </v>

4881
03:37:25.631 --> 03:37:30.000
<v Speaker 4>and like mom's got a cane and we had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a people mover and stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite people in the world,</v>

4886
03:37:39.371 --> 03:37:40.870
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like tiger.</v>

4887
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:43.660
<v Speaker 4>You finally made it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

4888
03:37:43.870 --> 03:37:44.703
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because like we got to meet Dolly </v>

4889
03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:46.350
<v Speaker 4>Parton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4890
03:37:46.350 --> 03:37:47.183
<v Speaker 4>mom met Dolly Parton and any old title </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not a sign of prosperity or </v>

4891
03:37:52.361 --> 03:37:53.194
<v Speaker 4>success or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that happened back on clerks or </v>

4892
03:37:55.571 --> 03:37:56.404
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those days when Dolly Parton was on </v>

4893
03:37:57.911 --> 03:37:59.770
<v Speaker 4>TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was only like three channels.</v>

4894
03:37:59.810 --> 03:38:01.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She pulled,</v>

4895
03:38:01.160 --> 03:38:03.850
<v Speaker 4>she fills arenas like it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's massive.</v>

4896
03:38:03.851 --> 03:38:07.510
<v Speaker 4>And just watching somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4897
03:38:07.511 --> 03:38:09.970
<v Speaker 4>I saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw her when I went up to Vancouver to</v>

4898
03:38:09.971 --> 03:38:10.960
<v Speaker 4>shoot an episode of the flash.</v>

4899
03:38:11.020 --> 03:38:12.400
<v Speaker 4>I went and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

4900
03:38:12.401 --> 03:38:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Then there's a part of me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

4901
03:38:14.051 --> 03:38:18.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a big country guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my old man loved country and Western</v>

4902
03:38:18.041 --> 03:38:18.874
<v Speaker 4>even though we came from New Jersey and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we weren't even from like Southern </v>

4903
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Central Jersey.</v>

4904
03:38:22.030 --> 03:38:24.150
<v Speaker 4>He loved country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>west country mustard.</v>

4905
03:38:24.160 --> 03:38:27.010
<v Speaker 4>I hated it growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's now dead for like 12,</v>

4906
03:38:27.011 --> 03:38:28.960
<v Speaker 4>13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And naturally the older one gets,</v>

4907
03:38:29.200 --> 03:38:30.033
<v Speaker 4>you hear that music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes you not to the president but </v>

4908
03:38:31.841 --> 03:38:34.180
<v Speaker 4>right back to your childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So lately,</v>

4909
03:38:34.181 --> 03:38:35.560
<v Speaker 4>even though I've never been a country </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

4910
03:38:35.561 --> 03:38:36.394
<v Speaker 4>I find more country leaking into my life</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it has everything to do with my </v>

4911
03:38:39.221 --> 03:38:40.054
<v Speaker 4>father or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went to see the show and it was </v>

4912
03:38:42.281 --> 03:38:44.410
<v Speaker 4>like I might as well taking my dad with </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

4913
03:38:44.411 --> 03:38:48.430
<v Speaker 4>He's been dead so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like that was his dream show.</v>

4914
03:38:48.460 --> 03:38:49.870
<v Speaker 4>Like he loved Ali parties.</v>

4915
03:38:49.870 --> 03:38:51.880
<v Speaker 4>Big Country Music Fan generally love </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dolly Parton.</v>

4916
03:38:52.330 --> 03:38:54.190
<v Speaker 4>So I went to see the show the first time</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was like,</v>

4917
03:38:54.191 --> 03:38:55.180
<v Speaker 4>I got nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go.</v>

4918
03:38:55.181 --> 03:38:58.240
<v Speaker 4>And then I was blown away by her </v>
<v Speaker 4>showmanship as storyteller as well.</v>

4919
03:38:58.420 --> 03:39:00.480
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't just sit there and play the </v>
<v Speaker 4>music between songs.</v>

4920
03:39:00.481 --> 03:39:03.330
<v Speaker 4>She'll sit there and tell you a story </v>
<v Speaker 4>about growing up in the rocky mountains.</v>

4921
03:39:03.331 --> 03:39:04.164
<v Speaker 4>She's fucking funny dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know she's got like pattern she's </v>

4922
03:39:05.951 --> 03:39:07.660
<v Speaker 4>probably been doing for years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she talks about,</v>

4923
03:39:08.170 --> 03:39:09.003
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was a little girl we went into </v>

4924
03:39:10.481 --> 03:39:14.290
<v Speaker 4>town and they grew up poor and she's one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of 13 children or something like that.</v>

4925
03:39:14.830 --> 03:39:16.720
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw this woman,</v>

4926
03:39:16.900 --> 03:39:17.733
<v Speaker 4>beautiful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's painted like an angel and she </v>

4927
03:39:20.651 --> 03:39:25.651
<v Speaker 4>had pretty clothes and real big pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>heritage burn heels and makeup.</v>

4928
03:39:26.050 --> 03:39:26.771
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mama,</v>

4929
03:39:26.771 --> 03:39:28.900
<v Speaker 4>who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And her mom is like,</v>

4930
03:39:28.901 --> 03:39:30.030
<v Speaker 4>that's the town trial.</v>

4931
03:39:30.030 --> 03:39:32.500
<v Speaker 4>That girl is nothing but trash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

4932
03:39:32.501 --> 03:39:34.610
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I want to be when I grow up.</v>

4933
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:37.270
<v Speaker 4>So that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why she's got the look.</v>

4934
03:39:37.280 --> 03:39:38.113
<v Speaker 4>She's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

4935
03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:39.980
<v Speaker 4>it cost a lot of money to look this </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheap.</v>

4936
03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:43.350
<v Speaker 4>So she's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

4937
03:39:43.470 --> 03:39:47.510
<v Speaker 4>it's a true like even if you're not like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Dolly Parton Fan,</v>

4938
03:39:47.540 --> 03:39:51.300
<v Speaker 4>like what a true night of entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 4>like and you just won't get appreciate.</v>

4939
03:39:51.650 --> 03:39:52.483
<v Speaker 4>I saw her like last weekend I took my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mom to see her in Tampa and time I saw </v>

4940
03:39:56.291 --> 03:39:59.120
<v Speaker 4>her at the Hollywood bowl and then like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a month ago,</v>

4941
03:39:59.121 --> 03:40:02.210
<v Speaker 4>and then I took mom to see her in Tampa </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was more like,</v>

4942
03:40:02.450 --> 03:40:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Hey dad would love this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4943
03:40:04.891 --> 03:40:08.130
<v Speaker 4>but she had this weird moment where she </v>
<v Speaker 4>met Dolly in like,</v>

4944
03:40:08.480 --> 03:40:09.860
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven year old woman.</v>

4945
03:40:10.370 --> 03:40:13.640
<v Speaker 4>And my mom went in for a fucking kiss.</v>

4946
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:14.503
<v Speaker 4>Not like I want a friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just like the way you would kiss a </v>

4947
03:40:16.131 --> 03:40:16.930
<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4948
03:40:16.930 --> 03:40:21.470
<v Speaker 4>and then you could see Dolly who's had </v>
<v Speaker 4>to politically maneuver strangers for 50</v>

4949
03:40:21.471 --> 03:40:23.360
<v Speaker 4>years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Figure out,</v>

4950
03:40:23.540 --> 03:40:25.190
<v Speaker 4>do I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4951
03:40:25.191 --> 03:40:28.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't kiss strangers or do I just have</v>
<v Speaker 4>her lips were going for the lip on the,</v>

4952
03:40:28.640 --> 03:40:30.140
<v Speaker 4>what she was going for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was awkward too.</v>

4953
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:34.670
<v Speaker 4>There was a moment where they were the </v>
<v Speaker 4>exparel and then finally they hugged and</v>

4954
03:40:34.671 --> 03:40:35.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4955
03:40:35.180 --> 03:40:36.920
<v Speaker 4>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my husband loved your music and shit.</v>

4956
03:40:37.220 --> 03:40:40.250
<v Speaker 4>It's really fucking beautiful the see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But mom,</v>

4957
03:40:40.310 --> 03:40:44.180
<v Speaker 4>I love mom to death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mom is like such A.</v>

4958
03:40:44.180 --> 03:40:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's mother is very singular </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

4959
03:40:45.621 --> 03:40:47.600
<v Speaker 4>But mom like had this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to figure out.</v>

4960
03:40:47.601 --> 03:40:49.100
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did this person die?</v>

4961
03:40:49.380 --> 03:40:50.710
<v Speaker 4>I think we were talking about Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4962
03:40:50.711 --> 03:40:52.610
<v Speaker 4>when did aunt Barbara di?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my mom's like,</v>

4963
03:40:52.640 --> 03:40:53.473
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

4964
03:40:53.810 --> 03:40:55.820
<v Speaker 4>And she had this thing when we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

4965
03:40:55.821 --> 03:40:56.654
<v Speaker 4>like she'd get a calendar from church </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she wouldn't write on it your </v>

4966
03:40:59.091 --> 03:41:03.050
<v Speaker 4>birthday or a relative's birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'd write the day that they died.</v>

4967
03:41:03.051 --> 03:41:06.350
<v Speaker 4>So like this day was the day uncle Andy </v>
<v Speaker 4>die this day and Connie died.</v>

4968
03:41:06.590 --> 03:41:09.830
<v Speaker 4>So my mom keeps all that information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she goes,</v>

4969
03:41:09.831 --> 03:41:13.010
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She comes out with a box of like funeral</v>

4970
03:41:13.011 --> 03:41:14.780
<v Speaker 4>mass cards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when somebody dies,</v>

4971
03:41:14.781 --> 03:41:16.920
<v Speaker 4>you go to a funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a little trading card that has a</v>

4972
03:41:16.921 --> 03:41:19.040
<v Speaker 4>picture of a saint and on the back has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>person's name.</v>

4973
03:41:19.041 --> 03:41:20.600
<v Speaker 4>And when they were born,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were dead,</v>

4974
03:41:21.330 --> 03:41:22.163
<v Speaker 4>my mom has like a collection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way you collect baseball cards and </v>

4975
03:41:24.051 --> 03:41:24.884
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we spread them all out on the table </v>

4976
03:41:26.571 --> 03:41:29.930
<v Speaker 4>is 12 significant deaths in our family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had lots more,</v>

4977
03:41:29.931 --> 03:41:30.764
<v Speaker 4>but the ones that would matter to both </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and her in our immediate family and </v>

4978
03:41:35.540 --> 03:41:40.490
<v Speaker 4>between 12 deaths I was able to quiz my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother who died in 1980.</v>

4979
03:41:40.910 --> 03:41:41.481
<v Speaker 4>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4980
03:41:41.481 --> 03:41:45.020
<v Speaker 4>that was grandpa Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she is my mom's obsessed with death</v>

4981
03:41:45.021 --> 03:41:48.650
<v Speaker 4>but not in a like death metal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When she was a child in Catholic school,</v>

4982
03:41:48.980 --> 03:41:51.670
<v Speaker 4>they tried to explain hell tour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4983
03:41:51.980 --> 03:41:55.250
<v Speaker 4>as you do in Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was fucking far too young to get</v>

4984
03:41:55.251 --> 03:41:56.084
<v Speaker 4>the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So death has been her obsession her </v>

4985
03:41:57.921 --> 03:41:59.330
<v Speaker 4>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Staving it off,</v>

4986
03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:03.020
<v Speaker 4>stopping it from like taking not just </v>
<v Speaker 4>her but her family,</v>

4987
03:42:03.021 --> 03:42:04.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she lost her husband to it.</v>

4988
03:42:04.161 --> 03:42:04.994
<v Speaker 4>We all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Death is just a natural part of the </v>

4989
03:42:06.171 --> 03:42:10.700
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mom finds it like she's terrified,</v>

4990
03:42:10.701 --> 03:42:13.130
<v Speaker 4>but now I as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a creative person.</v>

4991
03:42:13.190 --> 03:42:16.160
<v Speaker 4>And I wonder if you feel the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I fancy myself a creative person.</v>

4992
03:42:16.161 --> 03:42:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Some people like you're not very </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative,</v>

4993
03:42:17.661 --> 03:42:20.510
<v Speaker 4>but I fancy myself a creative person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No caveats.</v>

4994
03:42:20.600 --> 03:42:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Death to me is not scary as much as like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a repugnant idea where you're like,</v>

4995
03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:27.793
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

4996
03:42:27.920 --> 03:42:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Stop all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm just getting the of it.</v>

4997
03:42:31.441 --> 03:42:34.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm just learning like I got so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>more jokes to tell and Shit like that.</v>

4998
03:42:35.550 --> 03:42:36.383
<v Speaker 4>Like death to people who make stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 4>us and that's why you might be the </v>

4999
03:42:39.510 --> 03:42:42.840
<v Speaker 4>exception because you deal with death on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a regular basis.</v>

5000
03:42:42.870 --> 03:42:43.703
<v Speaker 4>Like with hunting and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just something that probably </v>

5001
03:42:46.500 --> 03:42:50.910
<v Speaker 4>enters your purview farm with the month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is like one of those things,</v>

5002
03:42:50.911 --> 03:42:52.500
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were you like wow,</v>

5003
03:42:52.501 --> 03:42:54.780
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't really thought about that too </v>
<v Speaker 4>often.</v>

5004
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:55.703
<v Speaker 4>But she's thinks about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Often when I think of death I'm </v>

5005
03:42:58.291 --> 03:43:00.150
<v Speaker 4>irritated by it because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's unfair.</v>

5006
03:43:00.210 --> 03:43:01.043
<v Speaker 4>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I imagine if I was like my </v>

5007
03:43:03.541 --> 03:43:06.300
<v Speaker 4>grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my grandmother lost her sight 12,</v>

5008
03:43:06.301 --> 03:43:09.000
<v Speaker 4>14 years before she died and I loved </v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging out with her.</v>

5009
03:43:09.001 --> 03:43:10.440
<v Speaker 4>I used to play cards with her and shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

5010
03:43:10.440 --> 03:43:12.270
<v Speaker 4>And then when she lost her site,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she did,</v>

5011
03:43:12.300 --> 03:43:15.690
<v Speaker 4>she was no longer just didn't living,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she would sit around and be like,</v>

5012
03:43:15.691 --> 03:43:17.040
<v Speaker 4>how are you Graham?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go visit her.</v>

5013
03:43:17.041 --> 03:43:19.050
<v Speaker 4>She'd be sitting in the dark and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to the radio,</v>

5014
03:43:19.051 --> 03:43:21.690
<v Speaker 4>maybe no longer Christian like she used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

5015
03:43:21.691 --> 03:43:23.310
<v Speaker 4>We used to play cards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can do any of that shit.</v>

5016
03:43:23.311 --> 03:43:25.680
<v Speaker 4>So she just sat there and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you?</v>

5017
03:43:25.681 --> 03:43:28.620
<v Speaker 4>And she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I asked him to take me.</v>

5018
03:43:28.621 --> 03:43:30.990
<v Speaker 4>And he said he didn't answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still not today.</v>

5019
03:43:30.991 --> 03:43:31.561
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

5020
03:43:31.561 --> 03:43:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like Jesus everyday I pray that he</v>

5021
03:43:34.411 --> 03:43:38.250
<v Speaker 4>finally take me and I'm still here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she grew slowly,</v>

5022
03:43:38.251 --> 03:43:40.590
<v Speaker 4>grew to be bitter about life and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

5023
03:43:40.591 --> 03:43:42.930
<v Speaker 4>from where I sit right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the guy that's like,</v>

5024
03:43:43.080 --> 03:43:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I never want this party to an oh shit.</v>

5025
03:43:45.780 --> 03:43:48.240
<v Speaker 4>But I guess there could be a time in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life where,</v>

5026
03:43:48.510 --> 03:43:49.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>

5027
03:43:49.381 --> 03:43:53.010
<v Speaker 4>you know and love is past and you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>get to a place where you're like,</v>

5028
03:43:53.400 --> 03:43:54.233
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay.</v>

5029
03:43:54.270 --> 03:43:55.103
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

5030
03:43:55.140 --> 03:43:56.000
<v Speaker 4>who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5031
03:43:56.720 --> 03:44:01.720
<v Speaker 4>the singer that that just passed a law </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the guy that sang Hallelujah.</v>

5032
03:44:04.260 --> 03:44:05.093
<v Speaker 4>Leonard Cohen has been to have Louis and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leonard Cohen didn't interview like </v>

5033
03:44:07.500 --> 03:44:09.750
<v Speaker 4>before he passed like five months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five weeks,</v>

5034
03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:12.270
<v Speaker 4>maybe 40 past where he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5035
03:44:12.271 --> 03:44:14.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready for death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gone up pretty much done everything</v>

5036
03:44:14.821 --> 03:44:17.160
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to do and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready for it.</v>

5037
03:44:17.340 --> 03:44:19.770
<v Speaker 4>And he went fairly short there shortly </v>
<v Speaker 4>thereafter.</v>

5038
03:44:19.980 --> 03:44:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Grandma didn't Ms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Young on for awhile but wanted to die.</v>

5039
03:44:23.880 --> 03:44:26.250
<v Speaker 4>I hope I'm never that person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

5040
03:44:26.390 --> 03:44:27.223
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if something happens to me and I can't </v>

5041
03:44:29.341 --> 03:44:31.980
<v Speaker 4>move or something like that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny got his gun and Shit.</v>

5042
03:44:32.100 --> 03:44:32.933
<v Speaker 4>You hit that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd been really taking care of your </v>

5043
03:44:34.471 --> 03:44:35.840
<v Speaker 4>health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5044
03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:38.010
<v Speaker 4>You a little bit late in life just </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was like,</v>

5045
03:44:38.011 --> 03:44:39.120
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should.</v>

5046
03:44:39.330 --> 03:44:41.760
<v Speaker 4>I come from diabetic people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dad,</v>

5047
03:44:41.761 --> 03:44:42.594
<v Speaker 4>all his brothers and sisters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very diabetic and I've played for my </v>

5048
03:44:45.871 --> 03:44:49.230
<v Speaker 4>whole life as if that wasn't a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never eat vegetables and shit.</v>

5049
03:44:49.430 --> 03:44:50.263
<v Speaker 4>Say packaged food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I saw that movie fed up and that </v>

5050
03:44:53.430 --> 03:44:54.263
<v Speaker 4>turned it around for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost like a bunch of weight because I </v>

5051
03:44:56.191 --> 03:44:59.400
<v Speaker 4>stopped eating sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This documentary was fascinating.</v>

5052
03:44:59.401 --> 03:45:02.340
<v Speaker 4>It was abused cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's why it worked on me,</v>

5053
03:45:02.910 --> 03:45:04.200
<v Speaker 4>but it broke down like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5054
03:45:04.201 --> 03:45:07.020
<v Speaker 4>this is what you do every time he put </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar into your body.</v>

5055
03:45:07.021 --> 03:45:09.390
<v Speaker 4>And I was one of those documentary fed </v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

5056
03:45:09.391 --> 03:45:11.410
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5057
03:45:12.060 --> 03:45:13.170
<v Speaker 4>I was one of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5058
03:45:13.171 --> 03:45:14.010
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar's natural.</v>

5059
03:45:14.011 --> 03:45:15.060
<v Speaker 4>Comes out of the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5060
03:45:15.150 --> 03:45:15.983
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like wheat and fucking flower and </v>

5061
03:45:17.761 --> 03:45:20.090
<v Speaker 4>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's okay for us,</v>

5062
03:45:20.091 --> 03:45:20.924
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things where it's </v>

5063
03:45:21.781 --> 03:45:25.020
<v Speaker 4>taken me a long time to accept the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sugars much as I love it,</v>

5064
03:45:25.080 --> 03:45:25.950
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5065
03:45:26.040 --> 03:45:27.750
<v Speaker 4>it's a poison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5066
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:30.070
<v Speaker 4>or it's like booze for an alcoholic,</v>

5067
03:45:30.100 --> 03:45:32.770
<v Speaker 2>like I can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped sugar on my life,</v>

5068
03:45:32.771 --> 03:45:37.771
<v Speaker 2>lost 70 fucking pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I let sugar creep back in slowly 20</v>

5069
03:45:38.530 --> 03:45:40.780
<v Speaker 2>came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I've gotten rid of 10 of it.</v>

5070
03:45:40.781 --> 03:45:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I've got another 10 to get back to where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking was.</v>

5071
03:45:43.330 --> 03:45:46.000
<v Speaker 2>And I remember being free of sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>

5072
03:45:46.390 --> 03:45:48.880
<v Speaker 2>what a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get back into it?</v>

5073
03:45:49.570 --> 03:45:51.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a slippery slope.</v>

5074
03:45:51.230 --> 03:45:52.063
<v Speaker 2>Candy Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 piece of chocolate starts with a </v>

5075
03:45:53.441 --> 03:45:55.450
<v Speaker 2>piece of chocolate where you like milk </v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate,</v>

5076
03:45:55.451 --> 03:45:56.680
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love milk chocolate.</v>

5077
03:45:56.681 --> 03:45:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I can handle this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I was working on the shows</v>

5078
03:45:59.651 --> 03:46:00.484
<v Speaker 2>in Canada donuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they got Tim Horton's </v>

5079
03:46:03.071 --> 03:46:05.020
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throw a rock and there's a Tim Horton's.</v>

5080
03:46:05.021 --> 03:46:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I got those Tim bits which are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin donuts.</v>

5081
03:46:07.271 --> 03:46:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Munchkins a little donut holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked those.</v>

5082
03:46:09.251 --> 03:46:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Boston cream jammies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

5083
03:46:11.441 --> 03:46:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I love when they checked on the top and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cream and jelly in that shit.</v>

5084
03:46:15.910 --> 03:46:19.570
<v Speaker 2>That's my religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a jelly donut to powdered sugar.</v>

5085
03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do this.</v>

5086
03:46:22.080 --> 03:46:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Just so soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that I had.</v>

5087
03:46:24.490 --> 03:46:25.323
<v Speaker 2>I had to cut it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to put sugar way entirely so I </v>

5088
03:46:27.581 --> 03:46:30.520
<v Speaker 2>stopped eating processed or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Processed or added sugar?</v>

5089
03:46:30.880 --> 03:46:32.440
<v Speaker 2>No sugar whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Natural Sheer.</v>

5090
03:46:32.441 --> 03:46:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Like the closest sugar I'd get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking were beats.</v>

5091
03:46:36.041 --> 03:46:38.520
<v Speaker 2>I know I started drinking vegetable </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink though something.</v>

5092
03:46:38.521 --> 03:46:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I never did vegetable juice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a big fan of cold press juices.</v>

5093
03:46:42.281 --> 03:46:45.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stores too.</v>

5094
03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:47.810
<v Speaker 2>You can go and stop in and get them </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

5095
03:46:47.980 --> 03:46:48.813
<v Speaker 2>You could find out online like if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a store near you and then once </v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking powers you didn't like before I.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean it's no secret or anything,</v>

5100
03:47:01.091 --> 03:47:03.610
<v Speaker 2>but here's a tip before I got to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

5101
03:47:03.611 --> 03:47:06.070
<v Speaker 2>requires a lot of energy or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I was going to go on the talking</v>

5102
03:47:06.071 --> 03:47:06.904
<v Speaker 2>dead or I'm going to fucking go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie set or make some do show I get me </v>

5103
03:47:11.561 --> 03:47:12.394
<v Speaker 2>a fucking a big vegetable drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically I get one whole beat eight </v>

5104
03:47:16.301 --> 03:47:19.300
<v Speaker 2>fistfuls of spinach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a carat,</v>

5105
03:47:19.301 --> 03:47:20.420
<v Speaker 2>half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>

5106
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I stopped doing so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abbott was a lot of sugar in it.</v>

5107
03:47:23.980 --> 03:47:24.813
<v Speaker 2>So about quarter apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big knob of Ginger Shit just burned to </v>

5108
03:47:28.041 --> 03:47:28.874
<v Speaker 2>my insides out kids in 1920.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're playing on scaffolding and we're </v>

5109
03:47:31.871 --> 03:47:36.871
<v Speaker 2>scared of sugar from an apple were such </v>
<v Speaker 2>pussies who become such until now.</v>

5110
03:47:37.651 --> 03:47:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

5111
03:47:38.621 --> 03:47:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't have the extra sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I make that dude,</v>

5112
03:47:40.871 --> 03:47:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I drink that and that gives me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5113
03:47:44.300 --> 03:47:46.000
<v Speaker 2>like beats fucking natural.</v>

5114
03:47:47.830 --> 03:47:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I've never done coke,</v>

5115
03:47:49.871 --> 03:47:51.710
<v Speaker 2>but I imagine it's like we're doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>line of coke.</v>

5116
03:47:51.720 --> 03:47:52.553
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think it's anything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is like doing dope beats make me </v>

5117
03:47:57.761 --> 03:48:00.070

<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5121

<v Speaker 2>that was one of the things I like about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your instagram feed you,</v>

5122
03:48:07.960 --> 03:48:11.050

<v Speaker 2>talk about like what it does for you and</v>

5123
03:48:11.051 --> 03:48:12.190
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at his shit.</v>

5124
03:48:12.850 --> 03:48:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Fucking natural and I'm getting all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

5125
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:18.430
<v Speaker 2>It's food porn because it gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>repetitive.</v>

5126
03:48:18.460 --> 03:48:20.890
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean it gets repetitive?</v>

5127
03:48:20.891 --> 03:48:21.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you cook it?</v>

5128
03:48:21.701 --> 03:48:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Oka Gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking fuck it.</v>

5129
03:48:23.570 --> 03:48:25.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you get.</v>

5130
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you then stop and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you realize your hurdling</v>

5131
03:48:27.980 --> 03:48:30.090
<v Speaker 3>through space on a fucking rock?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything could happen.</v>

5132
03:48:30.100 --> 03:48:32.270
<v Speaker 3>I just think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it don't bother saying it,</v>

5133
03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:33.920
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

5134
03:48:34.530 --> 03:48:37.670
<v Speaker 3>But people always looking for things but</v>
<v Speaker 3>also criticizing.</v>

5135
03:48:37.690 --> 03:48:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fun if you're eating out again,</v>

5136
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.863
<v Speaker 3>it's not like it's not a one time </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience where like I've eaten out </v>

5137
03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:47.870
<v Speaker 3>when I was 14 and of course when a man </v>
<v Speaker 3>eats can never again,</v>

5138
03:48:48.280 --> 03:48:51.080
<v Speaker 3>so got to expect you might redo a meal </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I give you some.</v>

5139
03:48:51.081 --> 03:48:53.410
<v Speaker 3>When you cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of meat is it?</v>

5140
03:48:53.530 --> 03:48:54.680
<v Speaker 3>Elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5141
03:48:54.681 --> 03:48:56.060
<v Speaker 3>How do you cook it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll teach you.</v>

5142
03:48:56.270 --> 03:48:58.700
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you how to put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you some real simple.</v>

5143
03:48:58.701 --> 03:48:59.960
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kill this thing.</v>

5144
03:49:00.020 --> 03:49:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you an elk burger.</v>

5145
03:49:01.581 --> 03:49:04.040
<v Speaker 3>That's the simplest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Him out of it.</v>

5146
03:49:04.220 --> 03:49:06.830
<v Speaker 3>You just got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tastes like it tastes really good.</v>

5147
03:49:07.010 --> 03:49:10.250
<v Speaker 3>It's super healthy for you because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean no hormones,</v>

5148
03:49:10.251 --> 03:49:11.390
<v Speaker 3>no antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>

5149
03:49:11.391 --> 03:49:12.224
<v Speaker 3>It's just wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elk Meat was very lean and if you cook </v>

5150
03:49:16.041 --> 03:49:19.010
<v Speaker 3>it like as a cheeseburger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to kind of cook it pretty quick</v>

5151
03:49:19.250 --> 03:49:21.610
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't have much fat in it </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all really.</v>

5152
03:49:21.680 --> 03:49:23.200
<v Speaker 3>It's really lean protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5153
03:49:23.300 --> 03:49:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Very high protein content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So meaning like it's going to burn fat,</v>

5154
03:49:28.660 --> 03:49:29.690
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't cook it.</v>

5155
03:49:29.691 --> 03:49:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe as long as you would like a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>fatty beef burger,</v>

5156
03:49:33.090 --> 03:49:35.260
<v Speaker 3>just cook it a little less time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's A.</v>

5157
03:49:35.260 --> 03:49:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I think the last time we talked we </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about that.</v>

5158
03:49:36.981 --> 03:49:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea of you'll go out hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>but you eat what you,</v>

5159
03:49:40.670 --> 03:49:42.920
<v Speaker 3>what you bring back or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat everything.</v>

5160
03:49:43.520 --> 03:49:46.420
<v Speaker 3>It's Mark Zuckerberg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one year was like,</v>

5161
03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:49.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm only going to that kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5162
03:49:49.180 --> 03:49:51.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean from the minute we were all like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that savage,</v>

5163
03:49:51.171 --> 03:49:52.610
<v Speaker 3>and then afterwards we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5164
03:49:53.090 --> 03:49:53.923
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

5165
03:49:53.960 --> 03:49:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all doing.</v>

5166
03:49:55.461 --> 03:49:57.050
<v Speaker 3>If we we eat beet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my point.</v>

5167
03:49:57.130 --> 03:49:57.963
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're buying food from a store or </v>

5168
03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:03.560
<v Speaker 3>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

5169
03:50:03.660 --> 03:50:05.600
<v Speaker 3>you're killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just killing it with a card,</v>

5170
03:50:05.601 --> 03:50:08.360
<v Speaker 3>a credit card or a check book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if you're eating meat,</v>

5171
03:50:08.361 --> 03:50:09.194
<v Speaker 3>you're killing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5172
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:10.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might not be doing it yourself,</v>

5173
03:50:10.970 --> 03:50:15.720
<v Speaker 3>but my whole take is that if an animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>is wild that's in the,</v>

5174
03:50:15.721 --> 03:50:17.660
<v Speaker 3>in that wild animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kill it.</v>

5175
03:50:17.661 --> 03:50:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Like that thing was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

5176
03:50:20.271 --> 03:50:22.910
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's whether you ever existed or not.</v>

5177
03:50:22.911 --> 03:50:23.744
<v Speaker 3>That thing did exactly what it did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the pure life for one of those </v>

5178
03:50:26.541 --> 03:50:27.710
<v Speaker 3>animals and you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5179
03:50:27.711 --> 03:50:29.410
<v Speaker 3>why would you want a hunter doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>killer?</v>

5180
03:50:29.700 --> 03:50:31.730
<v Speaker 3>Something's going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what you don't understand.</v>

5181
03:50:31.731 --> 03:50:33.350
<v Speaker 3>These things are not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to live forever.</v>

5182
03:50:33.560 --> 03:50:35.240
<v Speaker 3>They have a very short and brutal life.</v>

5183
03:50:35.270 --> 03:50:38.150
<v Speaker 3>They usually get taken down by coyotes </v>
<v Speaker 3>or mountain lions or.</v>

5184
03:50:38.420 --> 03:50:39.253
<v Speaker 3>I mean when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a person comes in and shoots a </v>

5185
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:42.583
<v Speaker 3>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the best death it's ever going </v>

5186
03:50:44.051 --> 03:50:45.980
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a person doesn't do it,</v>

5187
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.823
<v Speaker 3>that just died in my bed at age 80.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they free surrounded by my loved </v>

5188
03:50:50.721 --> 03:50:52.400
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They freeze to death.</v>

5189
03:50:52.401 --> 03:50:54.890
<v Speaker 3>They get hit by cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>

5190
03:50:54.920 --> 03:50:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Can I make this board clear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucking freeze to death.</v>

5191
03:50:57.570 --> 03:50:59.810
<v Speaker 3>They don't live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't live very long.</v>

5192
03:50:59.811 --> 03:51:03.680
<v Speaker 3>If a deer lifts to be like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is an old fucking deer.</v>

5193
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5194
03:51:05.810 --> 03:51:09.470
<v Speaker 3>So if people are upset with you eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>any kind of animals at all,</v>

5195
03:51:09.471 --> 03:51:11.390
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to understand why you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be upset at hunting.</v>

5196
03:51:11.391 --> 03:51:14.600
<v Speaker 3>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my kid is total vegan.</v>

5197
03:51:14.930 --> 03:51:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Great kid about though she's not judging</v>
<v Speaker 3>me as I sit there and eat meat and shit,</v>

5198
03:51:18.561 --> 03:51:19.580
<v Speaker 3>but she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5199
03:51:19.581 --> 03:51:20.414
<v Speaker 3>her thing is like she fucking loves </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals and what does she do to </v>

5200
03:51:23.691 --> 03:51:26.180
<v Speaker 3>supplement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like our essential fatty invited me a</v>

5201
03:51:26.760 --> 03:51:29.670
<v Speaker 2>question because the Diet I've seen for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Vegan now,</v>

5202
03:51:29.671 --> 03:51:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I've been around it quite a bit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanely limited.</v>

5203
03:51:32.690 --> 03:51:33.523
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I pull sugar out of my diet </v>

5204
03:51:36.600 --> 03:51:37.433
<v Speaker 2>suddenly you're down to fucking 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>things because everything's gotten milk </v>

5205
03:51:41.121 --> 03:51:41.954
<v Speaker 2>and sugar added to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go vegan and not just </v>

5206
03:51:43.861 --> 03:51:45.460
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fucking leg,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

5208
03:51:48.060 --> 03:51:48.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything green and maybe three other </v>

5209
03:51:51.361 --> 03:51:52.194
<v Speaker 2>things in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't even eat a Bagel without </v>

5210
03:51:54.031 --> 03:51:54.864
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you use this or this or this or </v>

5211
03:51:57.480 --> 03:51:59.040
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenneth eggs,</v>

5212
03:51:59.470 --> 03:52:00.303
<v Speaker 2>which is a really unfortunate because </v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs are never going to be a living </v>

5213
03:52:02.341 --> 03:52:03.220
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5214
03:52:03.370 --> 03:52:04.203
<v Speaker 2>that's what people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could understand if you're against </v>

5215
03:52:05.671 --> 03:52:08.220
<v Speaker 2>factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's a different story.</v>

5216
03:52:08.490 --> 03:52:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>my chickens are pretty free range there.</v>

5217
03:52:11.491 --> 03:52:12.324
<v Speaker 2>They live in a big cute coop and I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't have room for </v>

5218
03:52:14.251 --> 03:52:14.550
<v Speaker 2>coop.</v>

5219
03:52:14.550 --> 03:52:15.383
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you need to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all I'm saying is you can have </v>

5220
03:52:17.941 --> 03:52:21.150
<v Speaker 2>chickens that exists in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural environment.</v>

5221
03:52:21.151 --> 03:52:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not entirely difficult and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you eggs.</v>

5222
03:52:24.120 --> 03:52:27.870
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to worry at all about </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything bad happening.</v>

5223
03:52:27.871 --> 03:52:29.790
<v Speaker 2>This is just a natural product of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>a chicken.</v>

5224
03:52:29.791 --> 03:52:30.624
<v Speaker 2>They lay one on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fertilized and no one's going </v>

5225
03:52:32.851 --> 03:52:34.710
<v Speaker 2>to eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not every egg becomes a chicken.</v>

5226
03:52:34.711 --> 03:52:35.321
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5227
03:52:35.321 --> 03:52:35.701
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5228
03:52:35.701 --> 03:52:36.900
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to get fucked.</v>

5229
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:39.480
<v Speaker 2>The rooster has to come along and sling </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Dick.</v>

5230
03:52:39.481 --> 03:52:42.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's no rooster then.</v>

5231
03:52:42.320 --> 03:52:43.670
<v Speaker 2>So essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

5232
03:52:43.680 --> 03:52:46.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that until I was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking 39 years old,</v>

5233
03:52:46.200 --> 03:52:47.010
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

5234
03:52:47.010 --> 03:52:47.843
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you told me last time it might </v>

5235
03:52:49.591 --> 03:52:50.420
<v Speaker 2>have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>

5236
03:52:50.420 --> 03:52:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm a repetitive motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will to do it.</v>

5237
03:52:52.800 --> 03:52:55.200
<v Speaker 2>I liked reading that you eat elk more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than once.</v>

5238
03:52:55.290 --> 03:52:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's Kinda like a chicken's period.</v>

5239
03:53:00.150 --> 03:53:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And matter of fact,</v>

5240
03:53:01.700 --> 03:53:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Peta developed a whole campaign to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get people to stop eating chicken,</v>

5241
03:53:06.931 --> 03:53:07.764
<v Speaker 2>egg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling it the menstrual cycle and also </v>

5242
03:53:10.081 --> 03:53:10.914
<v Speaker 2>showing a fucking frying pan with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody maxi pad sitting in the frying </v>

5243
03:53:15.601 --> 03:53:18.930
<v Speaker 2>pan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's very effective,</v>

5244
03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:19.970
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5245
03:53:19.980 --> 03:53:21.240
<v Speaker 2>that would gross me out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn me off.</v>

5246
03:53:21.241 --> 03:53:22.200
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll like pull it up.</v>

5247
03:53:22.201 --> 03:53:23.330

<v Speaker 2>I'm kidding.</v>

5248
03:53:23.340 --> 03:53:25.470
<v Speaker 2>I never want to eat a tampon again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Foul,</v>

5249
03:53:25.920 --> 03:53:26.753
<v Speaker 2>foul that they chose to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My kid doesn't get like shitty or </v>

5250
03:53:29.760 --> 03:53:31.410
<v Speaker 2>political about it or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

5252
03:53:33.481 --> 03:53:36.120
<v Speaker 2>But every once in awhile it slips out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big milk drinker.</v>

5253
03:53:36.810 --> 03:53:37.860
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

5257
03:53:43.650 --> 03:53:44.251
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You if you want milk,</v>

5259
03:53:46.021 --> 03:53:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you should get it from your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5260
03:53:48.090 --> 03:53:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you took some of the baby cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

5261
03:53:50.010 --> 03:53:50.580
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

5262
03:53:50.580 --> 03:53:52.050
<v Speaker 2>don't do this to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5263
03:53:52.051 --> 03:53:54.720
<v Speaker 2>they raised us to believe in milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a lot of commercials.</v>

5264
03:53:54.721 --> 03:53:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Milk does a body good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They taught me that on television.</v>

5265
03:53:57.870 --> 03:54:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell me that I'm taking milk from </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby cow.</v>

5266
03:54:00.660 --> 03:54:02.310
<v Speaker 2>She's kind of right though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5267

<v Speaker 2>Were you down on milk [inaudible]?</v>

5268
03:54:04.050 --> 03:54:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I saw your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I talk about milk,</v>

5269
03:54:06.360 --> 03:54:07.193
<v Speaker 2>people put up the little picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talk on stage and they put a bit of </v>

5270
03:54:10.081 --> 03:54:11.790
<v Speaker 2>your routine we talked about right </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the show.</v>

5271
03:54:11.970 --> 03:54:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Vegan?</v>

5272
03:54:12.871 --> 03:54:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were they say Vegan?</v>

5273
03:54:14.530 --> 03:54:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Say No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the only species.</v>

5274
03:54:16.511 --> 03:54:17.344
<v Speaker 2>Gut do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the only species that drinks the </v>

5275
03:54:19.561 --> 03:54:22.020
<v Speaker 2>milk of other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5276
03:54:22.021 --> 03:54:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you know what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only humans do</v>

5277
03:54:24.130 --> 03:54:26.800
<v Speaker 3>fly planes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make movies.</v>

5278
03:54:27.010 --> 03:54:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Call each other and tell each other how </v>
<v Speaker 3>eggs come from chicken ministration.</v>

5279
03:54:33.731 --> 03:54:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5280
03:54:34.360 --> 03:54:36.400
<v Speaker 3>it was a bloody underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

5281
03:54:36.401 --> 03:54:39.130
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a maxi pad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a real p to add.</v>

5282
03:54:39.280 --> 03:54:41.710
<v Speaker 3>They put a bloody pair of women's </v>
<v Speaker 3>underwear.</v>

5283
03:54:41.880 --> 03:54:42.713
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tagline is donated eggs period and </v>

5284
03:54:45.191 --> 03:54:47.290
<v Speaker 3>period is in red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5285
03:54:47.350 --> 03:54:48.790
<v Speaker 3>This psych.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

5286
03:54:49.260 --> 03:54:53.110
<v Speaker 3>What's gross is factory farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's gross,</v>

5287
03:54:53.320 --> 03:54:54.153
<v Speaker 3>but it's gross is having all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens packed and stacked into these </v>

5288
03:54:57.910 --> 03:55:01.660
<v Speaker 3>horrific cages and warehouses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's gross.</v>

5289
03:55:02.070 --> 03:55:02.903
<v Speaker 3>What's not gross?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it chicken living in a chicken house </v>

5290
03:55:05.770 --> 03:55:06.603
<v Speaker 3>that occasionally lays an egg and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they lay an egg then they just wander </v>

5291
03:55:09.551 --> 03:55:10.384
<v Speaker 3>off and they just wander around the yard</v>
<v Speaker 3>and packet grass and do chicken stuff </v>

5292
03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:14.793
<v Speaker 3>because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a chicken is living in a healthy </v>

5293
03:55:16.241 --> 03:55:18.340
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not even scared of you.</v>

5294
03:55:18.340 --> 03:55:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Like I go near my chickens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can pick some of them up.</v>

5295
03:55:21.040 --> 03:55:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Some of them don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fuck with it.</v>

5296
03:55:22.721 --> 03:55:24.550
<v Speaker 3>They won't let you pick them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do,</v>

5297
03:55:24.551 --> 03:55:26.470
<v Speaker 3>if you try to pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to chase them.</v>

5298
03:55:26.710 --> 03:55:28.960
<v Speaker 3>They don't try to go after you but they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to be picked up,</v>

5299
03:55:28.961 --> 03:55:31.340
<v Speaker 3>but some of them will just stay there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you pick them up and pet them in.</v>

5300
03:55:31.341 --> 03:55:34.840
<v Speaker 3>My girls will hold onto them that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>all have their own little personalities.</v>

5301
03:55:34.990 --> 03:55:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Are they dirty now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surprisingly,</v>

5302
03:55:37.271 --> 03:55:38.860
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

5303
03:55:38.861 --> 03:55:43.861
<v Speaker 3>They take dust baths though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their feathers I think can brush off</v>

5304
03:55:44.081 --> 03:55:44.914
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they keep themselves fairly </v>

5305
03:55:47.021 --> 03:55:50.120
<v Speaker 3>clean just by whatever the composition </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their feathers are there.</v>

5306
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Interesting little animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You eat the eggs.</v>

5307
03:55:51.911 --> 03:55:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you eat the chickens as well?</v>

5308
03:55:53.080 --> 03:55:54.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat the chickens now.</v>

5309
03:55:55.240 --> 03:55:57.280
<v Speaker 3>It just feels fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>

5310
03:55:57.340 --> 03:55:58.173
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so do you chicken engine to those </v>

5311
03:56:02.051 --> 03:56:04.090
<v Speaker 3>chickens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like animal farm.</v>

5312
03:56:04.091 --> 03:56:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Some chairs are more equal than others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5313
03:56:05.980 --> 03:56:10.790
<v Speaker 3>These chickens get a pass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there within my control to every</v>

5314
03:56:11.020 --> 03:56:12.670
<v Speaker 3>chicken in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not in a shitty way,</v>

5315
03:56:12.671 --> 03:56:13.940
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's chicken tonight.</v>

5316
03:56:14.070 --> 03:56:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Did we kill the chickens in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

5317
03:56:15.701 --> 03:56:16.534
<v Speaker 3>We put them on a fire in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We set the fire up in front of the </v>

5318
03:56:18.731 --> 03:56:20.520
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which be fucking kidding.</v>

5319
03:56:20.580 --> 03:56:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

5320
03:56:21.551 --> 03:56:22.810
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

5321
03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if I like the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was with Vlad.</v>

5322
03:56:26.141 --> 03:56:30.190
<v Speaker 3>The impaler used to do vlad the impaler </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Mary Shelley based.</v>

5323
03:56:30.220 --> 03:56:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Not Shelley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marisa was bram stoker.</v>

5324
03:56:32.260 --> 03:56:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Bram Stoker's Dracula on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vlad,</v>

5325
03:56:34.931 --> 03:56:38.350
<v Speaker 3>the impaler guy would eat people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of other people.</v>

5326
03:56:39.100 --> 03:56:40.420
<v Speaker 3>He would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

5327
03:56:40.421 --> 03:56:42.550
<v Speaker 3>Just a crazy killer late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe look up earlier.</v>

5328
03:56:42.551 --> 03:56:45.010
<v Speaker 3>That's what once she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She made one of her victims eat,</v>

5329
03:56:45.100 --> 03:56:46.150
<v Speaker 3>cook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eat themselves.</v>

5330
03:56:46.930 --> 03:56:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Elizabeth herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little girl said,</v>

5331
03:56:50.980 --> 03:56:52.510
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a monster.</v>

5332
03:56:53.370 --> 03:56:55.600
<v Speaker 3>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you cook and eat yourself to make</v>

5333
03:56:55.630 --> 03:56:57.480
<v Speaker 3>someone cut a piece off of their body?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5334
03:56:57.760 --> 03:57:00.430
<v Speaker 3>that was what Vlad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vlad did that as well.</v>

5335
03:57:00.730 --> 03:57:01.563
<v Speaker 3>He also put people on stakes in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his house and he would eat lunch while </v>

5336
03:57:05.261 --> 03:57:06.094
<v Speaker 3>he's watching them slowly rather than w </v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone has a stake through their </v>

5337
03:57:09.581 --> 03:57:13.570
<v Speaker 3>body doesn't kill them like right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can puncture with the stake and the</v>

5338
03:57:13.571 --> 03:57:15.700
<v Speaker 3>stake as long as they put it through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right spot.</v>

5339
03:57:15.880 --> 03:57:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Although you have like massive internal </v>
<v Speaker 3>bleeding,</v>

5340
03:57:18.580 --> 03:57:20.970
<v Speaker 3>the state kind of keeps it all in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>launches.</v>

5341
03:57:21.200 --> 03:57:22.033
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all stretched out and in your body </v>

5342
03:57:24.201 --> 03:57:27.020
<v Speaker 3>is kind of like if they stick it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right way,</v>

5343
03:57:27.021 --> 03:57:28.340
<v Speaker 3>it takes a while to die.</v>

5344
03:57:28.340 --> 03:57:29.173
<v Speaker 3>Like you could take hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're sticking this literally </v>

5345
03:57:31.791 --> 03:57:34.340
<v Speaker 3>through your asshole and out through </v>
<v Speaker 3>your back.</v>

5346
03:57:35.210 --> 03:57:36.043
<v Speaker 3>That's it in through your center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they could do it a bunch of </v>

5347
03:57:39.411 --> 03:57:41.990
<v Speaker 3>different way and they never show you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in any of those dracula movies.</v>

5348
03:57:41.991 --> 03:57:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Like put that asshole put the stake </v>
<v Speaker 3>right through his asshole.</v>

5349
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Now Standard up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe they go through a long,</v>

5350
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:51.170
<v Speaker 3>maybe they go through one side and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through a lung,</v>

5351
03:57:51.200 --> 03:57:52.033
<v Speaker 3>but either way there's ways they can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it where they would put you through </v>

5352
03:57:54.351 --> 03:57:56.360
<v Speaker 3>stakes where it take a long time for you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>

5353
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:57.463
<v Speaker 3>So these people would all be moaning on </v>
<v Speaker 3>steak steaks are probably going in dry </v>

5354
03:58:00.411 --> 03:58:00.950
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5355
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't lose that shit up at all.</v>

5356
03:58:04.340 --> 03:58:05.173
<v Speaker 3>These people were moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to die to stake going </v>

5357
03:58:07.131 --> 03:58:08.840
<v Speaker 3>through your asshole first then up </v>
<v Speaker 3>through your body.</v>

5358
03:58:08.840 --> 03:58:09.673
<v Speaker 3>But the good news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have some light cane is pretty </v>

5359
03:58:12.021 --> 03:58:12.854
<v Speaker 3>slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to spray the outside for a </v>

5360
03:58:14.170 --> 03:58:16.550
<v Speaker 3>stabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fucking gigantic steak.</v>

5361
03:58:16.700 --> 03:58:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's tough to.</v>

5362
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Well this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real human.</v>

5363
03:58:20.900 --> 03:58:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was a real human that really</v>
<v Speaker 3>did live.</v>

5364
03:58:22.880 --> 03:58:23.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

5365
03:58:23.421 --> 03:58:28.421
<v Speaker 3>This is the ancient pictures that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are from a long fucking time ago.</v>

5366
03:58:28.491 --> 03:58:31.040
<v Speaker 3>These images,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some woodcuts yeah.</v>

5367
03:58:31.220 --> 03:58:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just like right on.</v>

5368
03:58:32.200 --> 03:58:33.033
<v Speaker 3>And he's sitting there eating while </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people were on stakes in front of </v>

5369
03:58:35.451 --> 03:58:36.284
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

5370
03:58:36.580 --> 03:58:37.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to sort of process like how </v>

5371
03:58:39.171 --> 03:58:41.900
<v Speaker 3>much of that was myth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of that was folklore,</v>

5372
03:58:41.930 --> 03:58:45.050
<v Speaker 3>how much of it was real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the point at him there too?</v>

5373
03:58:46.190 --> 03:58:47.300
<v Speaker 3>What was the choices?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5374
03:58:47.301 --> 03:58:48.134
<v Speaker 3>he was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just wanted to make sure that </v>

5375
03:58:49.431 --> 03:58:52.220
<v Speaker 3>everybody knew was a bad motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you uh,</v>

5376
03:58:52.310 --> 03:58:57.310
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like trying to live forever </v>
<v Speaker 3>while he became so hard.</v>

5377
03:58:57.380 --> 03:58:58.213
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you're talking about people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like definitively describe like who </v>

5378
03:59:01.221 --> 03:59:02.420
<v Speaker 3>they were and what they were and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

5379
03:59:02.421 --> 03:59:05.420
<v Speaker 3>how it's history just gets so twisted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and distorted.</v>

5380
03:59:05.421 --> 03:59:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Especially back when there was no video </v>
<v Speaker 3>tapes and no,</v>

5381
03:59:08.030 --> 03:59:10.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing a drawings going like,</v>

5382
03:59:10.611 --> 03:59:11.450
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5383
03:59:11.480 --> 03:59:12.313
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of those people were even </v>

5384
03:59:12.591 --> 03:59:15.020
<v Speaker 3>writing things down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of those people could even read</v>

5385
03:59:15.021 --> 03:59:15.854
<v Speaker 3>back then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of those people actually saw </v>

5386
03:59:16.701 --> 03:59:18.410
<v Speaker 3>that was probably passed down like I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this village.</v>

5387
03:59:18.790 --> 03:59:20.540
<v Speaker 3>People on sticks and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to draw that.</v>

5388
03:59:20.740 --> 03:59:22.880
<v Speaker 3>Like what year was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vlad?</v>

5389
03:59:22.881 --> 03:59:26.860
<v Speaker 3>The impaler 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty eight to 14.</v>

5390
03:59:26.910 --> 03:59:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Seventy six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere in there.</v>

5391
03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:30.820
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>1,400.</v>

5392
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:31.663
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck saying exactly what that guy </v>

5393
03:59:33.411 --> 03:59:35.450
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what that guy did.</v>

5394
03:59:35.480 --> 03:59:36.313
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't even decide how many illegal </v>

5395
03:59:37.731 --> 03:59:41.850
<v Speaker 3>voters are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darling Donald Trump to calculate.</v>

5396
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5397
03:59:43.240 --> 03:59:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I think my biggest takeaway from the day</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the little people.</v>

5398
03:59:46.040 --> 03:59:46.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was weird,</v>

5399
03:59:46.731 --> 03:59:47.451
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

5400
03:59:47.451 --> 03:59:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5401
03:59:48.411 --> 03:59:50.450
<v Speaker 3>I know there've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5402
03:59:50.451 --> 03:59:51.284
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I thought there were pygmies and </v>

5403
03:59:52.341 --> 03:59:53.570
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's like,</v>

5404
03:59:53.960 --> 03:59:56.690
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a totally different species of.</v>

5405
03:59:56.720 --> 03:59:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smaller brands,</v>

5406
03:59:58.580 --> 04:00:02.260
<v Speaker 3>smaller chimps size brands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a homeless.</v>

5407
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Florian Florian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called the some better.</v>

5408
04:00:05.850 --> 04:00:06.683
<v Speaker 3>A few better images of them where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreated what they think it looked </v>

5409
04:00:09.310 --> 04:00:10.143
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of these pictures literally looks </v>

5410
04:00:11.781 --> 04:00:16.220
<v Speaker 3>like an innocent version of what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would show you as a troll in storybooks.</v>

5411
04:00:16.221 --> 04:00:18.980
<v Speaker 3>And look at that one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that you just passed,</v>

5412
04:00:18.990 --> 04:00:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the top</v>

5413
04:00:20.250 --> 04:00:22.350
<v Speaker 2>row with a spear and the animal and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder.</v>

5414
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you?</v>

5415
04:00:23.520 --> 04:00:26.010
<v Speaker 2>I think if you go full image as a full </v>
<v Speaker 2>image to see over there,</v>

5416
04:00:26.310 --> 04:00:27.750
<v Speaker 2>you can see what it looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5417
04:00:27.900 --> 04:00:29.750
<v Speaker 2>See that's what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things look like.</v>

5418
04:00:30.000 --> 04:00:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Like sort of semi chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like humans that were three feet tall,</v>

5419
04:00:34.620 --> 04:00:37.180
<v Speaker 2>but they had tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the discussion was and</v>

5420
04:00:37.181 --> 04:00:38.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we give him a dick?</v>

5421
04:00:38.520 --> 04:00:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's got.</v>

5422
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Not Everything but some things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't put a dick on it.</v>

5423
04:00:42.391 --> 04:00:43.224
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

5424
04:00:43.330 --> 04:00:44.940
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was dragged from everything else.</v>

5425
04:00:44.970 --> 04:00:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Is Dixon the shadow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like sort of Dick on,</v>

5426
04:00:48.390 --> 04:00:51.240
<v Speaker 2>but don't make it look too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Dick is wrapped up in a riddle.</v>

5427
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Is a mystery wrapped up in an riddle </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside into the Nigga.</v>

5428
04:00:57.420 --> 04:00:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to end this.</v>

5429
04:00:59.280 --> 04:01:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got here.</v>

5430
04:01:00.270 --> 04:01:03.700

5431
04:01:03.701 --> 04:01:06.330
<v Speaker 2>a like a springsteen concert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see who drops.</v>

5432
04:01:06.331 --> 04:01:09.710

<v Speaker 2>many things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

5434
04:01:11.491 --> 04:01:13.260
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing with resets at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store?</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is awesome.</v>

5441
04:01:24.980 --> 04:01:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sooner rather than waiting.</v>

5442
04:01:26.680 --> 04:01:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Fucking short brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always a pleasure,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mind?</v>

5444
04:01:31.680 --> 04:01:32.513
<v Speaker 2>We have these fun conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we spend so much time </v>

5445
04:01:34.861 --> 04:01:38.220
<v Speaker 2>complimenting each other because we like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because we just need to wait.</v>

5446
04:01:39.870 --> 04:01:41.580
<v Speaker 2>We can go deep on other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not each other.</v>

5447
04:01:41.610 --> 04:01:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if we compliment each other like</v>

5448
04:01:43.290 --> 04:01:46.410
<v Speaker 2>every time people would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are super gay for each other.</v>

5449
04:01:46.470 --> 04:01:47.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like every four years it's not </v>

5450
04:01:49.891 --> 04:01:52.530
<v Speaker 2>close enough for people to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumption that is our third.</v>

5451
04:01:52.710 --> 04:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I did one with you.</v>

5452
04:01:54.241 --> 04:01:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I did one with at our house and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them our house first.</v>

5453
04:01:57.691 --> 04:01:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Then with you and then this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>third.</v>

5454
04:02:00.360 --> 04:02:01.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the fourth.</v>

5455
04:02:01.320 --> 04:02:02.153
<v Speaker 2>Then was the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've done your house twice </v>

5456
04:02:04.530 --> 04:02:05.071
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5457
04:02:05.071 --> 04:02:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Then you did the first time you did with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and the wife.</v>

5458
04:02:06.990 --> 04:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe you can did one solo with me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we did one solo.</v>

5459
04:02:10.380 --> 04:02:11.213
<v Speaker 2>The last time we did one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you showed me that cool treadmill type </v>

5460
04:02:13.741 --> 04:02:16.920
<v Speaker 2>desk thing you had to standing standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk and I was like,</v>

5461
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:18.120
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's genius.</v>

5462
04:02:18.120 --> 04:02:20.940
<v Speaker 2>You have to walk and type at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>class and they're working.</v>

5463
04:02:21.120 --> 04:02:22.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a sweet movie.</v>

5464
04:02:23.230 --> 04:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Like a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I used that.</v>

5465
04:02:25.640 --> 04:02:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Eventually the treads started slipping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd be walking and uh,</v>

5466
04:02:31.280 --> 04:02:32.113
<v Speaker 2>one time I hit my chin up desk and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk was down here so I had to go like </v>

5467
04:02:35.970 --> 04:02:37.140
<v Speaker 2>this far and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

5468
04:02:37.250 --> 04:02:38.083
<v Speaker 2>sue those pitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we were meant to stand at a desk </v>

5469
04:02:40.230 --> 04:02:42.480
<v Speaker 2>or walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never at the same time.</v>

5470
04:02:42.720 --> 04:02:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Don't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

5471
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Back on that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say wrap it up,</v>

5472
04:02:46.800 --> 04:02:49.320
<v Speaker 2>put it on an angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to hike,</v>

5473
04:02:49.330 --> 04:02:52.950
<v Speaker 2>like you're hiking through the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky to walk up school.</v>

5474
04:02:52.960 --> 04:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>The English running shoes on shoes </v>
<v Speaker 2>running and heels and shit,</v>

5475
04:02:57.780 --> 04:02:59.550
