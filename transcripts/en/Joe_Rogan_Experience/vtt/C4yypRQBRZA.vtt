1
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.403
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Sam bitches.</v>

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.573
<v Speaker 1>I don't hear shit.</v>

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have my,</v>

6
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>that's how high was what happened.</v>

7
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have the headphones on my ears.</v>

8
00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:11.431
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

9
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>why am I not hearing anything?</v>

10
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

11
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>they're pressed up against the top of my head.</v>

12
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck dude?</v>

13
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Really after all these years,</v>

14
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>that's how you roll in it.</v>

15
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>And when Eddie Bravo is here,</v>

16
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>that's embarrassing.</v>

17
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>When you do like some serious stoner shit and everybody knows you're a stoner,</v>

18
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>you're like God dammit.</v>

19
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up one for the cause.</v>

21
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>The show Rogan experience is brought to you by,</v>

23
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>this episode is brought to you by audible.com and a audible.com has this thing</v>

24
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:46.491
<v Speaker 1>that I've been raving about because it's one of the coolest ideas that I've ever</v>

25
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>

26
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.001
<v Speaker 1>in technology when it comes to a audio books and audio podcast,</v>

28
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>what they've done is they've created something that's an app for the kindle fire</v>

29
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>and it really is worth getting it just for this.</v>

30
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

32
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing application.</v>

33
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it allows you,</v>

34
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're a book reader,</v>

35
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

36
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I have a kindle and I also have a nook and they're both great.</v>

38
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>But the difference between this kindle fire thing is you can be reading the book</v>

39
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>and you when you like you're going to bed at night,</v>

40
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>you could shut it off and it will sync with your smart phone.</v>

41
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get in your car,</v>

42
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>you hear the audio version of the book.</v>

43
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking incredible.</v>

44
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.641
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

45
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>it's done by professional actors.</v>

46
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a really good audio companion book to the original book that you</v>

47
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

48
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>so you can either read it or listen to it,</v>

49
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>which is a fucking brilliant.</v>

50
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that's like one of the coolest inventions I've ever heard of.</v>

51
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I got a question now.</v>

52
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

53
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:45.130
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

54
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to a lot of books,</v>

55
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:49.224
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

56
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Can you still say you read a lot?</v>

57
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.883
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

58
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good question.</v>

59
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

60
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can.</v>

62
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.363
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

63
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>It's close.</v>

64
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>It's close,</v>

65
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably not the same.</v>

66
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>There's probably something involved.</v>

67
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:08.050
<v Speaker 1>And actually reading the words yourself.</v>

68
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

69
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 2>It seems more prestigious,</v>

70
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

71
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 2>That you actually read it yourself.</v>

72
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

73
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Is that more prestigious?</v>

74
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Says it's a little boring.</v>

75
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.783
<v Speaker 2>Boring.</v>

76
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

77
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

78
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.903
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely think</v>

79
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 1>there's something too for a reading as opposed to watching TV.</v>

80
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I find that people who read more than they watch TV generally,</v>

81
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 1>they have more interesting shit to talk about.</v>

82
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

83
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 2>they trust.</v>

84
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 2>They trust a type letters and sentences on paper.</v>

85
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 2>More than like visual evidence.</v>

86
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird.</v>

87
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.663
<v Speaker 2>Like I read it,</v>

88
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.441
<v Speaker 2>I read it.</v>

89
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 2>It means more because someone typed it out like that.</v>

90
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.920
<v Speaker 2>People don't lie and fuck up reports and fuck up all these different studies.</v>

91
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I thought we're talking about books.</v>

92
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.721
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

93
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:51.554
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

94
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.980

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.800

97
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:55.790
<v Speaker 2>get into listening books.</v>

98
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time to read.</v>

99
00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:57.794
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

100

<v Speaker 1>It's no doubt about it.</v>

148
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>There's garlic in it and ginger in it.</v>

149
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>So we just started selling these blenders.</v>

150
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Sally's BLENDTEC blenders,</v>

151
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:27.951
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

152
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking bad ass.</v>

153
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.831
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

154
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I had a Vitamix before that.</v>

155
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Pretty fucking good too.</v>

156
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>The difference is the BLENDTEC really like,</v>

157
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>makes it like almost everything turns it really liquidity.</v>

158
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Vitamix,</v>

159
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

160
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a little more chewy to it,</v>

161
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.011
<v Speaker 1>but either way,</v>

162
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:42.844
<v Speaker 1>both of them are great.</v>

163
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 1>We sell the blend tax.</v>

164
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 1>We also sell kettlebells now and battle ropes,</v>

165
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.800
<v Speaker 1>kettle bells and battle ropes.</v>

166
00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:51.100

171
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times you see them whipping these big heavy marine ropes.</v>

172
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>They look like,</v>

173
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>the ropes that you would use to tie up boats.</v>

175
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually exactly what they are.</v>

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually exactly where we get them there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anything that we find that we find personally beneficial.</v>

190
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these things are very controversial,</v>

191
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>especially the idea of a nootropics,</v>

192
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>which are vitamins and nutrients that you take to enhance brain function.</v>

193
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of debate on that man.</v>

194
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that don't believe in it.</v>

195
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that try and say they don't,</v>

196
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.060
<v Speaker 1>they don't experience anything but every single aspect of Alpha brain,</v>

197
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>all the different ingredients have been closely studied by people for years.</v>

198
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

199
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a whole page of the science behind it.</v>

200
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

201
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

202
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>altered and improved.</v>

204
00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>The formula now was,</v>

205
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>there was people that were having like issues with Coleen.</v>

206
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strong tropic and it really does,</v>

207
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

208
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>dramatically affect cognitive function.</v>

209
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that you're,</v>

210
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>you just need a certain amount of nutrients to get shit done.</v>

211
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>And they have isolated the best nutrients for,</v>

212
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>for optimum use of the mind.</v>

214
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

215
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>it's very controversial.</v>

216
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:25.551
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

217
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>we offer 30 pills.</v>

223
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.990
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

224
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.700
<v Speaker 1>the reason behind that is twofold.</v>

225
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.931
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

226
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>because nobody is trying to rip you off.</v>

227
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.630

235
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.061

243
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.721

248
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've done more research into those ingredients.</v>

249
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 1>And I have,</v>

254
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>a dumb person to a brilliant person,</v>

255
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

256

<v Speaker 1>what it's going to do is it's going to give your brain the resources it needs to</v>

00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:47.674
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

504
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Most of it was on the boogie tip.</v>

505
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.740
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't on the boogie tip.</v>

506
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like Boogie rock with a,</v>

507
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of blues and shit really.</v>

508
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.570
<v Speaker 2>And hours into a kiss and kisses,</v>

509
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.380
<v Speaker 2>more like anthems and,</v>

510
00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:00.214
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

511
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.011
<v Speaker 2>and more.</v>

512
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:01.844
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 2>it just was the kissing.</v>

514
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.121
<v Speaker 2>I was on that side.</v>

515
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:05.391
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

516
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I was on the kiss side.</v>

517
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't on the led Zeppelin side.</v>

518
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:08.360
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

519
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 2>but I respected the shit out of him.</v>

520
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.881
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

521
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

522
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I just was a kiss fucking freak dude.</v>

523
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I was so poor.</v>

524
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:14.781
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

525
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have enough money to be into more than one band at a time.</v>

526
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 2>So I chose kiss and I dove in and by the time I got into kiss,</v>

534
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.820

535
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.063
<v Speaker 2>That was the only way.</v>

536
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

543
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I didn't allow myself to get into other bands.</v>

544
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:47.271
<v Speaker 2>To tell you the truth.</v>

545
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:47.661

<v Speaker 2>The fucking power was out while kiss meets.</v>

584
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.090
<v Speaker 2>The Phantom was on TV and I was so depressed and I couldn't believe it.</v>

585
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:50.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

586
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck could this happen?</v>

587
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Now that movie is what got me into kiss.</v>

588
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Cause before that movie,</v>

589
00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

590
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.610
<v Speaker 2>the general consensus among kids at school was that kiss like,</v>

591
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:05.840
<v Speaker 2>cause they're older brothers will telling him his kisses for homos.</v>

592
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.240
<v Speaker 2>So I remember being at school the night it was supposed to be on being at</v>

593
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:13.330
<v Speaker 2>schools and talking to my friend saying,</v>

594
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.540
<v Speaker 2>are you going to watch that kiss movie?</v>

595
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:14.781
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

596
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:15.614
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

597
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Kisses for fags at eight year olds were saying that,</v>

598
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

599

<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

601
00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

602
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.940
<v Speaker 2>and I was pretending like I didn't like kiss either,</v>

603
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:23.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

604
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.310
<v Speaker 2>cause my Stepdad was into classic rock and I would,</v>

605
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.500
<v Speaker 2>I would say like Ted Nugent or something.</v>

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

611
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in the kiss,</v>

612
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.870
<v Speaker 2>but we were all excited to see that kiss movie.</v>

613
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.440

615
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.330
<v Speaker 2>That's how they were going down.</v>

616
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:39.300
<v Speaker 2>They were just too commercialized.</v>

617
00:17:39.301 --> 00:17:43.490
<v Speaker 2>That was kiss ice cream cause bubblegum kiss pencils that were going down.</v>

618
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had any respect for him at that point.</v>

619
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>There were falling off when I was in high school.</v>

752
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.500
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

753
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.500
<v Speaker 4>And then ace got electrocuted by the stair railing was to God Jesus Christ.</v>

754
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy ass show,</v>

755
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

756
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

757
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.813
<v Speaker 4>So that movie,</v>

758
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

759
00:21:19.191 --> 00:21:19.901
<v Speaker 4>from that movie on,</v>

760
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:21.590
<v Speaker 4>I was a kiss fanatic and,</v>

761
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.200
<v Speaker 4>but I was getting into them.</v>

762
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:23.551
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

763
00:21:23.551 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 4>We're never going down and had no respect.</v>

764
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 4>But that's when I got into them is when they lost all respect,</v>

765
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

766
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.370
<v Speaker 4>from the mainstream media when it came to Iraq,</v>

767
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

768
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 4>And so I had a fight with my friends.</v>

769
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's made,</v>

770
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.810
<v Speaker 4>made fun of me that I liked kiss.</v>

771
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 4>I had a fucking,</v>

772
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.850
<v Speaker 4>there was a bunch of music that I had to go back and sort of review cause I</v>

773
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.520
<v Speaker 4>dismissed it because it was all like serious stoners that we're into it.</v>

774
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Like the doors is one of them.</v>

775
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 4>I never was really adores person when I was in high school because all the</v>

776
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 4>people that were in the doors were all fucking serious burnouts man.</v>

777
00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 4>Because you've got to think like that.</v>

778
00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 4>This was after like,</v>

779
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.371
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

780
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 4>I was in high school in 1981 all right,</v>

781
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 4>when did he die?</v>

782
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't do die like in the 70s I never was adores fan girls who are still into</v>

783
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:12.730
<v Speaker 4>like Morrison like that late.</v>

784
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 4>It's like they were like fucking,</v>

785
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.800
<v Speaker 4>they always had jean jackets on.</v>

786
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 4>So he's cigarettes in their pockets.</v>

787
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Those had dirty hair and they would just burnouts and that's,</v>

788
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:25.600
<v Speaker 4>so that's what I associated with the doors.</v>

789
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Those are the people that always have the door shirts and I had to like become a</v>

790
00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 4>man one day and become my own man and listen and go God damn the towards had</v>

791
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:35.560
<v Speaker 4>some good fucking songs and then I got into them afterwards.</v>

792
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.240
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the people that were so into him sort of negatively affected my</v>

793
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:42.340
<v Speaker 4>opinion of him unfortunately.</v>

794
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

795
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.020
<v Speaker 4>you can never admit that you would like certain bands though.</v>

796
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:49.510
<v Speaker 4>There are certain bands and if you brought up that you were into a map,</v>

797
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:50.261
<v Speaker 4>people get angry.</v>

798
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:53.320
<v Speaker 4>I had to pretend it got so bad I had to pretend for a while that I didn't like</v>

799
00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:53.681
<v Speaker 4>kiss.</v>

800
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:53.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

801
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't like this anymore.</v>

802
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Goddammit.</v>

803
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 4>I hate them.</v>

804
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.791
<v Speaker 4>I was in high school,</v>

805
00:22:57.791 --> 00:23:01.990
<v Speaker 4>I was on a bus and I told this dude that I was going to go see a cheap trick</v>

806
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.921
<v Speaker 4>were I was like,</v>

807
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:03.820
<v Speaker 4>cheap tricks come in town,</v>

808
00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:04.654
<v Speaker 4>we'll go see cheap trick.</v>

809
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.990
<v Speaker 4>And this guy turned around and looked at me.</v>

810
00:23:05.991 --> 00:23:06.521
<v Speaker 4>It was meant cheap.</v>

811
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:08.050
<v Speaker 4>Chip fucking sucks.</v>

812
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.671
<v Speaker 4>And I remember like,</v>

813
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

814
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.380
<v Speaker 4>this guy totally just not respect my taste in music.</v>

815
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.730
<v Speaker 4>He just shot it down.</v>

816
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.910
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't even say anything about it.</v>

817
00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

818
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:16.631
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

819
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:21.250
<v Speaker 4>you know to you like the what you say when someone just shits on you and then</v>

820
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:22.001
<v Speaker 4>even while you're there,</v>

821
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 4>that can influence your enjoyment of going to see it.</v>

822
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.051
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

823
00:23:26.051 --> 00:23:27.370
<v Speaker 4>Because even though you're enjoying it,</v>

824
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:27.581
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

825
00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:28.240
<v Speaker 4>God damn it.</v>

826
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 4>Like why does this band made me feel like a loser for liking them?</v>

827
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

828
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 4>The thing about the kiss though that they've,</v>

829
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.320
<v Speaker 4>no one has ever done,</v>

830
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.470
<v Speaker 4>no one has ever done kids.</v>

831
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 4>They went to superstardom.</v>

832
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.510
<v Speaker 4>Then they went to Mc Hammer status and vanilla ice status and then they came</v>

833
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 4>back and did it all over again with the same members.</v>

834
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:51.800
<v Speaker 4>They got ace and Peter Back who ended up getting kicked out for being drunks and</v>

835
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 4>coke heads in the late seventies in the height of it,</v>

836
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 4>they kicked out their drummer,</v>

837
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:56.550
<v Speaker 4>they kicked out the guitar player,</v>

838
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.413
<v Speaker 4>got them replaced,</v>

839
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.340
<v Speaker 4>but when they did the reunion tour 15 years later,</v>

840
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:02.001
<v Speaker 4>20 years later,</v>

841
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 4>whenever the fuck it was,</v>

842
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.370
<v Speaker 4>they got ace and Peter Back and then they blew up again and they took their</v>

843
00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:10.640
<v Speaker 4>makeup off and then they put it back on the most interesting.</v>

844
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.030
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

845
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.260
<v Speaker 4>I left that part out.</v>

846
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 4>You got during the reunion and when they died they decided to take off their</v>

847
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:20.420
<v Speaker 4>makeup for about 10 years and they went on and they were lost.</v>

848
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:21.760
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know how to dress dude.</v>

849
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.420
<v Speaker 4>They just looked at the other bands and said,</v>

850
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:24.850
<v Speaker 4>you know what poison is there?</v>

851
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.950
<v Speaker 4>I guess the Tremie look is in let's look like trannies.</v>

852
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what's in.</v>

853
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.380
<v Speaker 4>When we were in high school,</v>

854
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:31.250
<v Speaker 4>they would like,</v>

855
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.650
<v Speaker 4>they always had like Bandanas on and shit.</v>

856
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 4>When they were going to clubs and stuff,</v>

857
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.020
<v Speaker 4>like they had to like hide their identity and they'd get these photos of them</v>

858
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:41.460
<v Speaker 4>like trying to put a palm up to the Presley,</v>

859
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:45.650
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get photographed like that was the weirdest sort of celebrity ever</v>

860
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.780
<v Speaker 4>because these guys were superstars,</v>

861
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 4>but nobody knew what they looked like.</v>

862
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if everybody today can wrap their head around how fucking crazy</v>

863
00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 4>that shit was.</v>

864
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.161
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is that?</v>

865
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 4>Come on there like late seventies these dudes done that.</v>

866
00:24:58.251 --> 00:24:59.810
<v Speaker 4>No one has that in music.</v>

867
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 4>No one else has done the which no one knows what you look like.</v>

868
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.581
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

869
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:06.050

<v Speaker 4>You could never get away with that shit today.</v>

876
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.670
<v Speaker 4>There's too many people with cameras.</v>

877
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 4>Too many people who put that shit on Youtube,</v>

878
00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:25.701
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

879
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:27.290
<v Speaker 4>They just know where Paul Stanley lives.</v>

880
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:28.124

<v Speaker 4>There he is.</v>

887
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.300
<v Speaker 4>And then when they did it again,</v>

888
00:25:35.301 --> 00:25:36.290

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.913

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.820
<v Speaker 4>They just got started going off rocks.</v>

893
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.160
<v Speaker 4>They're drunks and I think Peter was just too old and he couldn't even play</v>

894
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:49.671

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.100
<v Speaker 4>Paul Stanley isn't like marathon shape.</v>

900
00:25:55.101 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 4>He's always been a workout health free like his,</v>

901
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.273

903
00:26:01.431 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

904

<v Speaker 4>65 and gene Simmons is not the in the best shape but live.</v>

905
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 4>He gives his his,</v>

906
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.520
<v Speaker 4>he loves being on stage so much that every night Jean Simmons gives it 110%</v>

907
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:13.611
<v Speaker 4>every night.</v>

908
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 4>He's on fire,</v>

909
00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:14.810
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

910
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.643
<v Speaker 4>He can't,</v>

911
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.740
<v Speaker 4>they won't stop touring men or 68 years old.</v>

912
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Speaker 4>How much do they love being on stage?</v>

913
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons,</v>

914
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:22.880
<v Speaker 4>they stayed together.</v>

915
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.810
<v Speaker 4>They never broke up.</v>

916
00:26:23.811 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 4>They never quit.</v>

917
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 4>They went through a lot of guitar players and drummers,</v>

918
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them,</v>

919
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 4>but it was always Peter or Paul and gene sticking together with without makeup.</v>

920
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.361
<v Speaker 4>They never stop.</v>

921
00:26:33.361 --> 00:26:34.640
<v Speaker 4>They never take took a break.</v>

922
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.670
<v Speaker 4>I still don't think they feel like they get,</v>

923
00:26:37.671 --> 00:26:40.700
<v Speaker 4>they're like just rewards or no,</v>

924
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:42.530
<v Speaker 4>cause every interview you hear the bitterness,</v>

925
00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:45.120
<v Speaker 4>every dogging on the media,</v>

926
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.380
<v Speaker 4>they're dogging on journalists and they're,</v>

927
00:26:47.381 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 4>they're reminding people,</v>

928
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:49.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

929
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 4>you can't ignore the millions of fans.</v>

930
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:51.031
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

931
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 4>just listen to the fans.</v>

932
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:52.321
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

933
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:54.600
<v Speaker 4>forget about they hate journalists because you know,</v>

934
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.410
<v Speaker 4>they got,</v>

935
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 4>they blew up without any radio airplay.</v>

936
00:26:57.301 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't even play them on the fucking radio.</v>

937
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:00.720
<v Speaker 4>That's how taboo they were.</v>

938
00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 4>They did it without radio airplay,</v>

939
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 4>but why wouldn't the radio recognize how many people were coming to see their</v>

940
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:09.990
<v Speaker 4>concerts and buying their albums and just play their shit?</v>

941
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

942
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Like they're like,</v>

943
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:17.370
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to allow these goofy clowns to just,</v>

944
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.670
<v Speaker 4>you can't look like a clown and make rock and roll music.</v>

945
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 4>They were just not allowing them.</v>

946
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:23.843
<v Speaker 4>They weren't allowing it.</v>

947
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.510
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

948
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.390
<v Speaker 4>That must have been an incredibly tough time to be an artist,</v>

949
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

950
00:27:28.321 --> 00:27:28.431
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

951
00:27:28.431 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 4>to have to deal like only with record companies and only with radio stations.</v>

952
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.310
<v Speaker 4>That's just a couple of decades ago.</v>

953
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:40.110
<v Speaker 4>Like what a weird world we live in today where people get fame through</v>

954
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.640
<v Speaker 4>electronic means.</v>

955
00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:44.890
<v Speaker 4>Like how many people like that Dj ts,</v>

956
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:45.530
<v Speaker 4>was that his name?</v>

957
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:45.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

958
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:49.610
<v Speaker 4>How many people have heard his shit because it's been online or dead mouse or</v>

959
00:27:49.611 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 4>enhance people?</v>

960
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.120
<v Speaker 4>All you could,</v>

961
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:51.601
<v Speaker 4>they could.</v>

962
00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Those guys could become famous just by virtue of their product and it's</v>

963
00:27:56.191 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 4>spreading virally.</v>

964
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

965
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

966
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 4>that's what a shit time.</v>

967
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:02.400
<v Speaker 4>It must've been when that couldn't happen.</v>

968
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.320
<v Speaker 4>When you had to deal with all these assholes,</v>

969
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:05.790
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't play you on the radio.</v>

970
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:06.271
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

971
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:06.871
<v Speaker 4>what do you have to do?</v>

972
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 4>How do you get played on the radio?</v>

973
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:08.783
<v Speaker 4>What do you have to do,</v>

974
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:09.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

975
00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 4>does connect with anybody,</v>

976
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:11.214
<v Speaker 4>play them?</v>

977
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:11.581
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

978
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:11.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

979
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:12.410
<v Speaker 4>that that was,</v>

980
00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:12.900
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

981
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 4>it was very rare that you heard a kiss song on the radio.</v>

982
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.621
<v Speaker 4>He would not.</v>

983
00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:17.454
<v Speaker 4>They would not.</v>

984
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.120
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

985
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:18.830
<v Speaker 4>well they,</v>

986
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.150
<v Speaker 4>they played hours made for loving you a little bit.</v>

987
00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:22.400
<v Speaker 4>They did play Bethlehem.</v>

988
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.180
<v Speaker 4>That was the disco era.</v>

989
00:28:24.181 --> 00:28:25.070
<v Speaker 4>They went a little disco.</v>

990
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:25.830
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

991
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.663
<v Speaker 4>look it,</v>

992
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.240
<v Speaker 4>they thought they thought discos the new thing and it's going to be the future.</v>

993
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:30.961
<v Speaker 4>So kiss,</v>

994
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:31.920
<v Speaker 4>they made a decision.</v>

995
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Paul and gene are businessmen.</v>

996
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.500
<v Speaker 4>They go with the trends and sometimes it's,</v>

997
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:36.850
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

998
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.120
<v Speaker 4>it's obvious that we owe now,</v>

999
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:39.271
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1000
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:41.070
<v Speaker 4>you're going to go really heavy on this album.</v>

1001
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.401
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1002
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:43.680
<v Speaker 4>Cause everyone dogged you that you went to commercial and disco.</v>

1003
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.221
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1004
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:44.920
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>

1005
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Like the careers in the toilet,</v>

1006
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.850
<v Speaker 4>they got to come back at me.</v>

1007
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 4>That's what they did and creatures of the night,</v>

1008
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:49.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1009
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1010
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.233
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1011
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.400
<v Speaker 4>their career is just fucking insane.</v>

1012
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.120
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy life to be a musician man,</v>

1013
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.740
<v Speaker 4>to make noises that people like to listen to.</v>

1014
00:28:59.100 --> 00:28:59.933
<v Speaker 4>That's what you do.</v>

1015
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.420
<v Speaker 4>You put together words and he'd make noise with your mouth and with some musical</v>

1016
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:08.421
<v Speaker 4>instruments are professional noisemaker what a crazy thing that is.</v>

1017
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:08.750
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1018
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.960
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1019
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 4>the beauty of music is so misunderstood.</v>

1020
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:14.790
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard for us to wrap our heads around what the fuck is really happening</v>

1021
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:17.130
<v Speaker 4>when you're listening to a song because it's,</v>

1022
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.340
<v Speaker 4>there's something,</v>

1023
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 4>something happens to you,</v>

1024
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:20.520
<v Speaker 4>like a real,</v>

1025
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:25.550
<v Speaker 4>a good song like does fire you up and make you feel good.</v>

1026
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:27.360
<v Speaker 4>It gives you a charge.</v>

1027
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.081
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1028
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:32.610
<v Speaker 4>there's certain times when you're in your car and it's just the right song for</v>

1029
00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:34.080
<v Speaker 4>the right moment and you know,</v>

1030
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:35.340
<v Speaker 4>like God damn,</v>

1031
00:29:35.341 --> 00:29:36.270
<v Speaker 4>this feels good.</v>

1032
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

1033
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.660
<v Speaker 4>that's generally the way I feel that way.</v>

1034
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 4>What you're describing as when I'm driving to go teach class,</v>

1035
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 4>when</v>

1036
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving to teach class my,</v>

1037
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I just took my glaucoma medication and then I find just the best song that I</v>

1038
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 2>liked that song that I could put it on repeat and I crank it really loud and I'm</v>

1039
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 2>thinking about training Jujitsu.</v>

1040
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1041
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving and I'm going to go transcend Jujitsu and all my boys that I love</v>

1042
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:05.080
<v Speaker 2>are going to be right there and we're all going to work together.</v>

1043
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 2>And when I get in that zone and I'm listening to an an amazing song,</v>

1044
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 2>it's the craze.</v>

1045
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 2>It's man,</v>

1046
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1047
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.610
<v Speaker 2>it really is like a meditative state,</v>

1048
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:17.750
<v Speaker 2>like a waking meditative state where you're,</v>

1049
00:30:17.751 --> 00:30:18.101
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1050
00:30:18.101 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 2>you feel connected to the universe.</v>

1051
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:19.711
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1052
00:30:19.711 --> 00:30:19.781
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1053
00:30:19.781 --> 00:30:20.600
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to explain,</v>

1054
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.690
<v Speaker 4>especially while under the influence of Glaucoma medication.</v>

1055
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1056
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.220
<v Speaker 4>Especially that.</v>

1057
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.580
<v Speaker 4>And the best song if you've got crazy and ate some,</v>

1058
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.761
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1059
00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:30.290
<v Speaker 4>and you've got some love that you're going to,</v>

1060
00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:33.410
<v Speaker 4>you're driving to and you got to just people just driving from San Diego,</v>

1061
00:30:33.411 --> 00:30:35.930
<v Speaker 4>people drawn from Costa Mesa just to train.</v>

1062
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.160
<v Speaker 4>That's when I,</v>

1063
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.440
<v Speaker 4>when I think about that and how amazing that is,</v>

1064
00:30:39.441 --> 00:30:39.741
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1065
00:30:39.741 --> 00:30:42.320
<v Speaker 4>and how much love I'm going to have at my gym,</v>

1066
00:30:42.321 --> 00:30:42.501
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1067
00:30:42.501 --> 00:30:43.281
<v Speaker 4>when I'm there.</v>

1068
00:30:43.281 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1069
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.240
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1070
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:44.811
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing,</v>

1071
00:30:44.811 --> 00:30:45.644
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1072
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.401
<v Speaker 4>I love being there.</v>

1073
00:30:46.401 --> 00:30:46.940
<v Speaker 4>Every night.</v>

1074
00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Songs have this weird effect on people,</v>

1075
00:30:49.371 --> 00:30:50.060
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1076
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:50.421
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1077
00:30:50.421 --> 00:30:51.860
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it can be measured,</v>

1078
00:30:51.861 --> 00:30:55.580
<v Speaker 4>like the good feeling that you get when you hear a bad ass fucking song.</v>

1079
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Like for me it's like,</v>

1080
00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I know this song gets worn out for a lot of people,</v>

1081
00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:00.883
<v Speaker 4>but for me,</v>

1082
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.650
<v Speaker 4>the first few chords of Sweet Home Alabama,</v>

1083
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.700
<v Speaker 4>I always go,</v>

1084
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.900
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah.</v>

1085
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Like I haven't loved that God damn song.</v>

1086
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:08.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1087
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck of day overplay that stupid song.</v>

1088
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.520
<v Speaker 4>You can overplay that shit forever.</v>

1089
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.010
<v Speaker 4>That's still is like one of my all time favorites on the side.</v>

1090
00:31:16.011 --> 00:31:18.800
<v Speaker 4>If I'm in a car and it's a nice day and that song comes on,</v>

1091
00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1092
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit and I'll turn that shit up.</v>

1093
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.760
<v Speaker 4>Right when he says to turn it it,</v>

1094
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.473
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

1095
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:27.463
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

1096
00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.630
<v Speaker 4>It's just that feeling though.</v>

1097
00:31:29.631 --> 00:31:30.920
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it can be measured.</v>

1098
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if you could put like a electrodes on your head and find out what,</v>

1099
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:35.661
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

1100
00:31:35.661 --> 00:31:36.050
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

1101
00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:39.140
<v Speaker 4>what's firing up when you really love to hear a good song,</v>

1102
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.930
<v Speaker 4>they should do that and then she'd get people high and make them listen to</v>

1103
00:31:41.931 --> 00:31:45.830
<v Speaker 4>awesome music and just find out what happened and then in between that awesome</v>

1104
00:31:45.831 --> 00:31:46.430
<v Speaker 4>music,</v>

1105
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.690
<v Speaker 4>throwing some bullshit.</v>

1106
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.160
<v Speaker 4>So really whack ass,</v>

1107
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.660
<v Speaker 4>terrible fucking music.</v>

1108
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.220
<v Speaker 4>Some like really bad Christian rock or something,</v>

1109
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:55.080
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1110
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.390
<v Speaker 4>something just terrible.</v>

1111
00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Did you read that there was something on Twitter about some research done on</v>

1112
00:32:01.611 --> 00:32:03.840
<v Speaker 4>freestyle rappers and [inaudible]?</v>

1113
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.311
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>

1114
00:32:04.311 --> 00:32:04.941
<v Speaker 4>but I saw it,</v>

1115
00:32:04.941 --> 00:32:06.380
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't want you to read it,</v>

1116
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.330
<v Speaker 4>so I saw it like as a headline.</v>

1117
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:13.760
<v Speaker 4>There's this study and they studied freestyle rappers and they put some</v>

1118
00:32:13.761 --> 00:32:14.990
<v Speaker 4>electrodes on their brain.</v>

1119
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:16.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure how it really worked,</v>

1120
00:32:16.671 --> 00:32:18.650
<v Speaker 4>but as they were,</v>

1121
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:20.660
<v Speaker 4>they had him freestyle,</v>

1122
00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.141
<v Speaker 4>freestyle,</v>

1123
00:32:21.141 --> 00:32:21.950
<v Speaker 4>some stuff,</v>

1124
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Speaker 4>and then the,</v>

1125
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.310
<v Speaker 4>I think they had him say some letters that they knew before and,</v>

1126
00:32:25.311 --> 00:32:25.560
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1127
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.330
<v Speaker 4>and see the difference in how the brain works when you're freestyling and how</v>

1128
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.390
<v Speaker 4>the brain works when you're just repeating stuff.</v>

1129
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.130
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

1130
00:32:34.131 --> 00:32:34.964
<v Speaker 4>I could be wrong,</v>

1131
00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:36.360
<v Speaker 4>but the old school,</v>

1132
00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.700
<v Speaker 4>the overall,</v>

1133
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.360
<v Speaker 4>the overall of that was that freestyle rappers are quicker thinkers.</v>

1134
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:49.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously like the obvious stuff did look at their brain is working</v>

1135
00:32:49.191 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 4>faster than normal people.</v>

1136
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1137
00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:53.294
<v Speaker 4>They there.</v>

1138
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:53.661
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1139
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 4>the idea that you have to be creative,</v>

1140
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.890
<v Speaker 4>you have to put yourself into that,</v>

1141
00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.591
<v Speaker 4>that mode.</v>

1142
00:32:58.591 --> 00:33:00.980
<v Speaker 4>What percentage of freestyle rappers you think smoke weed?</v>

1143
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.660
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 190</v>

1144
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:05.563
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1145
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.000
<v Speaker 4>Hasn't,</v>

1146
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm dying.</v>

1147
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.480
<v Speaker 4>They didn't talk about the weed connection.</v>

1148
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:08.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:09.261
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1150
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:11.210
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about freestyle rappers.</v>

1151
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.310
<v Speaker 4>They're probably smoking weed all day,</v>

1152
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 4>stuffing their brain with it.</v>

1153
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:14.841
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1154
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:16.970

1304
00:37:16.031 --> 00:37:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Like how like kind of like the acting style was like different back then.</v>

1305
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:22.190
<v Speaker 4>Like the movies where they just like they were,</v>

1306
00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.240
<v Speaker 4>they weren't as like evolved.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Which ones to the second one was the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>The one where the dude has that?</v>

1310
00:37:29.841 --> 00:37:30.880

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:33.000
<v Speaker 4>which was the guns and roses one to</v>

1313
00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:38.320

1314
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.150
<v Speaker 4>she was like in a mental institution and shit.</v>

1315
00:37:40.151 --> 00:37:40.984
<v Speaker 4>Doing Chin ups.</v>

1316
00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:41.391
<v Speaker 4>Go on.</v>

1317
00:37:41.391 --> 00:37:43.900
<v Speaker 4>This mother fuckers coming back Arnold when he was mean.</v>

1318
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.070
<v Speaker 4>I liked it in the first one.</v>

1319
00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:45.610
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1320
00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:46.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh you mean like when he came back?</v>

1321
00:37:46.811 --> 00:37:47.644
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>

1322
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:49.143
<v Speaker 4>I'm not into that.</v>

1323
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.811
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't as good.</v>

1324
00:37:49.811 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 4>I liked the main one.</v>

1325
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.720
<v Speaker 4>The main one was way scarier.</v>

1326
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:51.971
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1327
00:37:51.971 --> 00:37:54.190
<v Speaker 4>why would they have the same model come back nice with the,</v>

1328
00:37:54.191 --> 00:37:56.560
<v Speaker 4>can't make a different model and it's just so stupid.</v>

1329
00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.060
<v Speaker 4>It's the same model.</v>

1330
00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.390
<v Speaker 4>The first model was a motherfucker finally seen a good movie.</v>

1331
00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Argo Dude.</v>

1332
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.361
<v Speaker 4>I heard Argos.</v>

1333
00:38:04.361 --> 00:38:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Very good Argos.</v>

1334
00:38:05.261 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Fucking good.</v>

1335
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.670
<v Speaker 4>It was a really,</v>

1336
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:10.810
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was reluctant to see it cause I thought it was going to be like</v>

1337
00:38:10.811 --> 00:38:14.500
<v Speaker 4>contagion where it shows like that our government is so good and with the</v>

1338
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:15.700
<v Speaker 4>viruses and the vaccine,</v>

1339
00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.190
<v Speaker 4>it's like contagion was a joke.</v>

1340
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.090
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like produced by the CIA almost or FEMA or something.</v>

1341
00:38:22.091 --> 00:38:23.140
<v Speaker 4>It was weird but,</v>

1342
00:38:23.141 --> 00:38:25.060
<v Speaker 4>and I thought they were going to do the same thing with article make the</v>

1343
00:38:25.061 --> 00:38:27.940
<v Speaker 4>Iranians look like just fucking these evil Daryl is,</v>

1344
00:38:27.941 --> 00:38:29.410
<v Speaker 4>they want to make bombs and shit like that.</v>

1345
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.000
<v Speaker 4>But they told the truth.</v>

1346
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.080
<v Speaker 4>They did in the beginning.</v>

1347
00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.180
<v Speaker 4>They set up,</v>

1348
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean it in the beginning.</v>

1349
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:37.120
<v Speaker 4>It makes the,</v>

1350
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 4>the United States look at fault for a lot of the shit that's going on and it's</v>

1351
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:43.830
<v Speaker 4>the truth and the movie itself is damaged.</v>

1352
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.920
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty amazing man.</v>

1353
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:45.770
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1354
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 4>Doing it.</v>

1355
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a strong endorsement by Young Eddie Bravo.</v>

1356
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.600
<v Speaker 4>I usually hate movies but that one I stayed for the movies and I love language</v>

1357
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 4>ones cabin in the woods.</v>

1358
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1359
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1360
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:05.380
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to try to be funny or you're not going to be serious at better</v>

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 4>not like you liked it.</v>

1365
00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.150
<v Speaker 4>It was beautiful.</v>

1366
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:11.043
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1367
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.191
<v Speaker 4>50 50 thing.</v>

1368
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:14.110
<v Speaker 4>Like I get in my tweets,</v>

1369
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.610
<v Speaker 4>people say I'm fucking crazy.</v>

1370
00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:17.770
<v Speaker 4>And then some people agree to me.</v>

1371
00:39:17.771 --> 00:39:19.270
<v Speaker 4>It was just exciting fun.</v>

1372
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 4>It was just ridiculous,</v>

1373
00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:21.130
<v Speaker 4>silly fun,</v>

1374
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:21.890
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1375
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 4>But I believe these fucking people have a remote control and it can change the</v>

1376
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Speaker 4>house and make monsters and Sigourney weaver at the end,</v>

1377
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.250
<v Speaker 4>it was almost hilarious.</v>

1378
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:30.010
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno,</v>

1379
00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.120
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed the shit out of it.</v>

1380
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:32.290
<v Speaker 4>It was campy to me.</v>

1381
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:32.720
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1382
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.750
<v Speaker 4>it was like intentionally campy.</v>

1383
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.740
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was really good.</v>

1384
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.603
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed it.</v>

1385
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:37.811
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1386
00:39:37.811 --> 00:39:38.111
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1387
00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:38.530
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>

1388
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.570
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to fucking make a good movie dude.</v>

1389
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1390
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 4>I think got too many people involved.</v>

1391
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I think when you got some bad motherfucker like James Cameron,</v>

1392
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:47.620
<v Speaker 4>that can just totally take the reigns.</v>

1393
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 4>That's how you get like an Avatar.</v>

1394
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.360
<v Speaker 4>You got to have some like real strong personality behind it.</v>

1395
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.750
<v Speaker 4>That's why like it's always important,</v>

1396
00:39:53.751 --> 00:39:57.580
<v Speaker 4>like Francis Ford Coppola is this or that because I think there's so many people</v>

1397
00:39:57.581 --> 00:40:02.050
<v Speaker 4>involved and poking and prodding and wanting this and putting in that.</v>

1398
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 4>I think making a movie must be,</v>

1399
00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 4>it's just a fucking tremendous nightmare.</v>

1400
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.680
<v Speaker 4>It working with all those people and hoping they work together.</v>

1401
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.630
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who's a,</v>

1402

1420
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.730
<v Speaker 4>They just hold up production and go crazy and claim fake illnesses and faint and</v>

1421
00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:44.260
<v Speaker 4>should do weird shit to get attention.</v>

1422
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Like people are nuts.</v>

1423
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.300
<v Speaker 4>So you got to bring all these motherfuckers together and try to put some movie</v>

1424
00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:50.134
<v Speaker 4>out of it.</v>

1425

<v Speaker 4>they feel,</v>

1456

1463
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to tell who's really at fault.</v>

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Ricky rocket.</v>

1586
00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.430
<v Speaker 1>There's certain dudes that you meet there.</v>

1587
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:58.930
<v Speaker 1>The funniest defiance conversations I ever have with clueless folks are the</v>

1588
00:44:58.931 --> 00:45:02.260
<v Speaker 1>people that tell me that if they fought MMA,</v>

1589
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:06.640
<v Speaker 1>they would never lose because it's just a mentality because of that mentality.</v>

1590
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:08.560
<v Speaker 1>But how many times have you talked to that guy,</v>

1591
00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:09.550
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

1592
00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:10.383
<v Speaker 1>there's been,</v>

1593
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:11.830
<v Speaker 1>there's this many,</v>

1594
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.280
<v Speaker 1>many of those guys out there and you drift into them like icebergs.</v>

1595
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Like it'd be backstage at the UFC and you don't even realize you're talking to a</v>

1596
00:45:18.521 --> 00:45:20.650
<v Speaker 1>crazy person until they say something like that.</v>

1597
00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:20.801
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1598
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1599
00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean these guys are all tough and everything,</v>

1600
00:45:22.931 --> 00:45:24.160
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you my mentality.</v>

1601
00:45:24.161 --> 00:45:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't lose the fucking,</v>

1602
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1603
00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:28.400
<v Speaker 1>You know what man,</v>

1604
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.081
<v Speaker 1>that guys like me,</v>

1605
00:45:29.081 --> 00:45:29.914
<v Speaker 1>you don't get in there.</v>

1606
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference guys like me with my mentality that you know the gun</v>

1607
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:33.441
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1608
00:45:33.441 --> 00:45:34.211
<v Speaker 1>they never stopped.</v>

1609
00:45:34.211 --> 00:45:35.500
<v Speaker 1>The referee couldn't pull me off.</v>

1610
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1611
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I usually get the guys that say,</v>

1612
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:38.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1613
00:45:38.641 --> 00:45:39.190
<v Speaker 2>they don't do that.</v>

1614
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm then maybe they don't train,</v>

1615
00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:44.990
<v Speaker 2>but if anything went down they would kick them in the knee and I'm like,</v>

1616
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.241
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1617
00:45:45.241 --> 00:45:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Are you how?</v>

1618
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.170
<v Speaker 2>How often are you practicing this kick?</v>

1619
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 2>How many days a week?</v>

1620
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.393
<v Speaker 2>How long?</v>

1621
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean if he was highly,</v>

1622
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 2>three days a week was sitting,</v>

1623
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1624
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.570
<v Speaker 2>sit in front of the bag and just kick into the knee,</v>

1625
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.250
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes a day,</v>

1626
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.120
<v Speaker 2>three days a week,</v>

1627
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:02.280
<v Speaker 2>I might believe he's onto something like,</v>

1628
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:02.521
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1629
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:04.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's got this crazy because you didn't know how to</v>

1630
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.010
<v Speaker 1>fight and you ran into some Moitai guy.</v>

1631
00:46:07.011 --> 00:46:07.880
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>

1632
00:46:07.881 --> 00:46:11.600
<v Speaker 1>he just decided to only kick your legs out from under you and just kick your</v>

1633
00:46:11.601 --> 00:46:13.010
<v Speaker 1>legs until you're done.</v>

1634
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Like that could be possible.</v>

1635
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1636
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:16.783
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

1637
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:18.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a guy who's really good at that.</v>

1638
00:46:18.371 --> 00:46:19.204
<v Speaker 1>I could do that,</v>

1639
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.151
<v Speaker 1>but the knee kick,</v>

1640
00:46:20.151 --> 00:46:20.510
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1641
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:21.343
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

1642
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.790
<v Speaker 1>come on son.</v>

1643
00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1644
00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.401
<v Speaker 2>and they believe it.</v>

1645
00:46:24.401 --> 00:46:26.020
<v Speaker 2>They believe it and I end up with that.</v>

1646
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see that week,</v>

1647
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:29.790

1648
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.420
<v Speaker 2>it takes 10 pounds of pressure statistics and it just snaps Bra.</v>

1649
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:35.710
<v Speaker 2>There's certain statistics.</v>

1650
00:46:35.711 --> 00:46:36.371
<v Speaker 2>That's one of them.</v>

1651
00:46:36.371 --> 00:46:38.410
<v Speaker 2>The other one is you only use 10% of your brain,</v>

1652
00:46:38.411 --> 00:46:39.244

<v Speaker 4>Brian Callen when we went hunting together,</v>

1708
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:21.521
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1709
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I had a comedy show for five days.</v>

1710
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:24.243
<v Speaker 4>That's what I had.</v>

1711
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.610
<v Speaker 4>You know I did the prions,</v>

1712
00:48:26.611 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 4>lucky cow and it was like the perfect move.</v>

1713
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I turned like this boring ass camping trip where it's 10 degrees out into a</v>

1714
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:37.510
<v Speaker 4>constant comedy show where Kallan was talking about how he likes to fuck guys.</v>

1715
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 4>Well this is what I'm doing.</v>

1716
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1717
00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm holding you.</v>

1718
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:40.601
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1719
00:48:40.601 --> 00:48:40.871
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

1720
00:48:40.871 --> 00:48:41.481
<v Speaker 4>I'm holding you.</v>

1721
00:48:41.481 --> 00:48:42.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at your ear and him,</v>

1722
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:47.040
<v Speaker 4>he would just come up with all these crazy things and we just feel it.</v>

1723
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:50.860
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those jokes where it's the same joke over and over again.</v>

1724
00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 4>It's all about fucking guys holding guys down a fucking guys.</v>

1725
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 4>But it starts off really funny and ridiculous and then you like,</v>

1726
00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.030
<v Speaker 4>you wonder how long can this fucking guy keep this up?</v>

1727
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.840
<v Speaker 4>And then five days in you're still laughing at the same data.</v>

1728
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.780
<v Speaker 4>It's just him talking about holding guys down,</v>

1729
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.670
<v Speaker 4>fucking them.</v>

1730
00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 4>And it's like he has no,</v>

1731
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:14.410
<v Speaker 4>he has no shame and no limit.</v>

1732
00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.170
<v Speaker 4>You can just keep going,</v>

1733
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:17.230
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>

1734
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.990
<v Speaker 4>So it was literally like a five day comedy show.</v>

1735
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.570
<v Speaker 4>It was the most I've ever laughed while freezing my dick off,</v>

1736
00:49:22.571 --> 00:49:23.650
<v Speaker 4>sleeping outdoors.</v>

1737
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.780
<v Speaker 4>It was a perfect experience.</v>

1738
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 4>Plus he's just a fucking awesome guy and counts one of those guys that doesn't</v>

1739
00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:30.461
<v Speaker 4>complain.</v>

1740
00:49:30.461 --> 00:49:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Like he'll just go do what needs to be done.</v>

1741
00:49:32.561 --> 00:49:33.970
<v Speaker 4>Like we had to go hiking and shit.</v>

1742
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 4>He just goes hiking.</v>

1743
00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:37.540
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't give Joey Diaz went on the trip with you.</v>

1744
00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:38.290
<v Speaker 4>What would you say,</v>

1745
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.100
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan.</v>

1746
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.040
<v Speaker 4>There's a fucking blondes two miles away from my house.</v>

1747
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:45.850
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me antelope.</v>

1748
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.710
<v Speaker 4>You want to take me out to the fucking bad lands of Montana?</v>

1749
00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.270
<v Speaker 4>Suck my Dick.</v>

1750
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:53.163
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1751
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.381
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1752
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:54.790
<v Speaker 4>Dan never did nothing to me.</v>

1753
00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.770
<v Speaker 4>God wanted us to beat and D and and in a fucking store</v>

1754
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:04.980
<v Speaker 4>and buy a fucking beer.</v>

1755
00:50:04.981 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Cheese balls or whatever.</v>

1756
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.750
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking guys with your grey poupon on your fucking deer burger.</v>

1757
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.213
<v Speaker 4>Fuck Outta here.</v>

1758
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.290
<v Speaker 4>Stuff.</v>

1759
00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:14.140
<v Speaker 4>A nice slice.</v>

1760
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:15.310
<v Speaker 4>It's two points</v>

1761
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:18.370
<v Speaker 4>and a regular coke.</v>

1762
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Don't even fuck with that diet.</v>

1763
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:20.260
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

1764
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.610
<v Speaker 4>You don't want that type of cancer.</v>

1765
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:22.270
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1766
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Is a type of finger.</v>

1767
00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it crazy that we've gotten fucking stupid</v>

1768
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.180
<v Speaker 10>as a society that you get your product can advertise that you have real sugar</v>

1769
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 10>and it's a good thing.</v>

1770
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.710
<v Speaker 10>How retarded Roe,</v>

1771
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.940
<v Speaker 10>we're putting that on billboards.</v>

1772
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.670
<v Speaker 10>Well that's because of corn made with real sugar corn syrup.</v>

1773
00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.550
<v Speaker 10>People are finding out how hard it is for your body to process corn syrup.</v>

1774
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.001
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

1775
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 10>but sugar is,</v>

1776
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.420
<v Speaker 10>corn is the motherfucker man corner.</v>

1777
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:48.290
<v Speaker 10>It's brought up.</v>

1778
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 10>Do you ever watch that King Corn Documentary?</v>

1779
00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:50.971
<v Speaker 10>I think I have.</v>

1780
00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:52.370
<v Speaker 10>I've watched one crazy.</v>

1781
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:54.470
<v Speaker 10>How much money there isn't growing corn,</v>

1782
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 10>man Mike and using corn and all sorts of different food items and there's a lot</v>

1783
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 10>of like good uses for corn.</v>

1784
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:00.531
<v Speaker 10>First of all,</v>

1785
00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:01.101
<v Speaker 10>it tastes good.</v>

1786
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:02.270
<v Speaker 10>Carla cobb's delicious.</v>

1787
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.210
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1788
00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:04.710
<v Speaker 10>corn tortillas make,</v>

1789
00:51:04.711 --> 00:51:05.090
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1790
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.830
<v Speaker 10>makes for some Nice Tacos,</v>

1791
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.080
<v Speaker 10>but the reality is that's just not good for your body.</v>

1792
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.570
<v Speaker 10>Especially like in corn syrup form.</v>

1793
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:15.500
<v Speaker 10>And that shit's everywhere so bad that they're advertising.</v>

1794
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.880
<v Speaker 10>Look where we're using sugar after.</v>

1795
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:20.810
<v Speaker 10>I wasn't sugar like wasn't it sugar free as good before?</v>

1796
00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:21.321
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

1797
00:51:21.321 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1798
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.530
<v Speaker 10>you're only supposed to get sugar when it's attached to food.</v>

1799
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:25.390
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1800
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 10>the really the idea of extracting sugar and then taking pure sugar,</v>

1801
00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:31.970
<v Speaker 10>like that's not ever supposed to happen.</v>

1802
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.290
<v Speaker 10>It doesn't exist in nature,</v>

1803
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.820
<v Speaker 10>which just so fucked up man.</v>

1804
00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.630
<v Speaker 10>We have to dabble with everything and extract things and give you concentrated</v>

1805
00:51:38.631 --> 00:51:39.290
<v Speaker 10>doses.</v>

1806
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:40.550
<v Speaker 10>That's where cocaine came from.</v>

1807
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:41.000
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1808
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.440
<v Speaker 10>I mean if you eat the coca leaves,</v>

1809
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 10>it's apparently very healthy.</v>

1810
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 10>Like if the people that chew those leaves,</v>

1811
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:46.220
<v Speaker 10>like those,</v>

1812
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:46.550
<v Speaker 10>those,</v>

1813
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:47.420
<v Speaker 10>those herders,</v>

1814
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.020
<v Speaker 10>those high altitude hurt and high,</v>

1815
00:51:49.021 --> 00:51:50.780
<v Speaker 10>is it only grown in Colombia?</v>

1816
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.740
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>

1817
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.750
<v Speaker 10>Why is it there?</v>

1818
00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:53.950
<v Speaker 10>Other countries growing coke,</v>

1819
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.120
<v Speaker 10>it seems like it's only good.</v>

1820
00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:55.550
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

1821
00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:55.851
<v Speaker 10>believe,</v>

1822
00:51:55.851 --> 00:51:56.180
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>

1823
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:56.590
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1824
00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

1825
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:57.381
<v Speaker 10>I think,</v>

1826
00:51:57.381 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

1827
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.420
<v Speaker 10>there's quite a few places that can grow it,</v>

1828
00:51:59.421 --> 00:52:00.860
<v Speaker 10>but I think it's a climate thing.</v>

1829
00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 10>But that doesn't make sense to me because then why can't people grow in</v>

1830
00:52:04.101 --> 00:52:04.940
<v Speaker 10>greenhouses?</v>

1831
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.110
<v Speaker 10>And you never hear about cocaine busts where they've,</v>

1832
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:07.380
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>

1833
00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.200
<v Speaker 10>they busted them with cocoa plants,</v>

1834
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:09.951
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1835
00:52:09.951 --> 00:52:10.701
<v Speaker 10>so I don't know.</v>

1836
00:52:10.701 --> 00:52:11.570
<v Speaker 10>I'm not a botanist.</v>

1837
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:12.920
<v Speaker 10>I don't understand what the fuck's wrong,</v>

1838
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.640
<v Speaker 10>but it seems like it would doesn't make any sense that you'd have to get it all</v>

1839
00:52:16.641 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 10>from South America and less.</v>

1840
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.550
<v Speaker 10>It's the only place where it grows.</v>

1841
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.560
<v Speaker 10>That's the only thing that makes sense to me.</v>

1842
00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:26.270
<v Speaker 10>And I remember there was some controversy about the Egyptian mummies.</v>

1843
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:31.010
<v Speaker 10>So one of the coolest things they found was evidence of cocaine and a one of the</v>

1844
00:52:31.011 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 10>mummies when they did this,</v>

1845
00:52:32.151 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 10>like real thorough analysis of it.</v>

1846
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.390
<v Speaker 10>And that could be one of two things.</v>

1847
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:40.040
<v Speaker 10>It means either someone had made it all the way to South America and brought</v>

1848
00:52:40.041 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 10>back cocaine.</v>

1849
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.480
<v Speaker 10>That is one possibility or it's someone from South America got in a boat and</v>

1850
00:52:44.481 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 10>came all the way to Egypt and sold them cocaine,</v>

1851
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:52.480
<v Speaker 10>or it was some kind of a false positive because there was some other substance</v>

1852
00:52:52.701 --> 00:52:54.080
<v Speaker 10>that could mirror that.</v>

1853
00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:54.921
<v Speaker 10>When you're dealing with,</v>

1854
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:55.101
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1855
00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:57.350
<v Speaker 10>someone who's been dead for 5,000 fucking years,</v>

1856
00:52:57.351 --> 00:52:59.140
<v Speaker 10>I'm sure there's a lot of guesswork involved in the,</v>

1857
00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:00.500
<v Speaker 10>in the analysis of it,</v>

1858
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.740
<v Speaker 10>but they were thinking that maybe the Egyptian that got ahold of some eight</v>

1859
00:53:03.741 --> 00:53:04.170
<v Speaker 10>balls,</v>

1860
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:05.460
<v Speaker 10>maybe the archaeologist</v>

1861
00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:09.340
<v Speaker 2>coke head and then like accidentally spilled some coke on his shirt.</v>

1862
00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:11.591
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1863
00:53:11.591 --> 00:53:11.741
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1864
00:53:11.741 --> 00:53:12.471
<v Speaker 2>it's the Egyptian.</v>

1865
00:53:12.471 --> 00:53:12.761
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1866
00:53:12.761 --> 00:53:13.594
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1867
00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a ton and ton of fucking gets the mummy.</v>

1868
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.553
<v Speaker 2>He did it.</v>

1869
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.460
<v Speaker 10>That would,</v>

1870
00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 10>that's you gotta roll with it.</v>

1871
00:53:19.641 --> 00:53:21.350
<v Speaker 10>That's not outside the realm of possibility.</v>

1872
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:22.830
<v Speaker 10>If you were a,</v>

1873
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 10>it had to roll with chip tologist.</v>

1874
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.333
<v Speaker 10>He didn't have a choice.</v>

1875
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.550
<v Speaker 10>You get tired.</v>

1876
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.860
<v Speaker 10>You using that brush all day.</v>

1877
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 10>You need a little pick me up.</v>

1878
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:29.401
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1879
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:29.611
<v Speaker 10>you see,</v>

1880
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:29.761
<v Speaker 10>look,</v>

1881
00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:31.590
<v Speaker 10>I'm just going to do this coke this one time.</v>

1882
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:33.310
<v Speaker 10>I'm just going to get really juiced up.</v>

1883
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 10>You gotta be a coke.</v>

1884
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.960
<v Speaker 10>Coke had to be an archeologist.</v>

1885
00:53:35.961 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 10>I fucking combing rocks with a tooth brush.</v>

1886
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.070
<v Speaker 10>I'd be doing bath salts so kids would forget what they were doing.</v>

1887
00:53:44.071 --> 00:53:45.030
<v Speaker 10>What the fuck was I dealing with?</v>

1888
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:45.864
<v Speaker 10>The fuck was I doing?</v>

1889
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.680
<v Speaker 10>They would forget what they were doing and they would try to start different new</v>

1890
00:53:49.681 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 10>businesses while they were cleaning it up.</v>

1891
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:51.931
<v Speaker 10>They'd be like,</v>

1892
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:52.141
<v Speaker 10>dude,</v>

1893
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:53.310
<v Speaker 10>I got this amazing idea.</v>

1894
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.890
<v Speaker 10>And they would try to try to bring you in.</v>

1895
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.340
<v Speaker 10>You're like my brother and mean.</v>

1896
00:53:57.341 --> 00:53:59.040
<v Speaker 10>Even though we just met you like my brother,</v>

1897
00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:00.630
<v Speaker 10>I want you to come in and this idea with me,</v>

1898
00:54:00.631 --> 00:54:01.464
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>

1899
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.453
<v Speaker 10>let's do it.</v>

1900
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:02.971
<v Speaker 10>Let's do it.</v>

1901
00:54:02.971 --> 00:54:03.870
<v Speaker 10>Fuck archaeology,</v>

1902
00:54:03.871 --> 00:54:04.110
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

1903
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:04.943
<v Speaker 10>Let's make a boat.</v>

1904
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.140
<v Speaker 10>Let's make our own boat.</v>

1905
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:07.800
<v Speaker 10>Archeologists can kit that.</v>

1906
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 10>They,</v>

1907
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 10>they use our archaeology sometimes to get checks.</v>

1908
00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:11.441
<v Speaker 10>Like the sound.</v>

1909
00:54:11.441 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to go to each if you want to come with me and help me out.</v>

1910
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.670
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1911
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:17.380
<v Speaker 10>I bet they would if they were a lot of fucking toothbrushes of here.</v>

1912
00:54:17.381 --> 00:54:18.960
<v Speaker 10>We like academic chicks,</v>

1913
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.411
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1914
00:54:19.411 --> 00:54:20.244
<v Speaker 10>like totally.</v>

1915
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.200
<v Speaker 10>That's like a romantic thing.</v>

1916
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.580
<v Speaker 10>A guy was like a published author and Egyptologists and invites you to a dig.</v>

1917
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.120
<v Speaker 10>I go,</v>

1918
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:27.841
<v Speaker 10>oh my God,</v>

1919
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:32.210
<v Speaker 10>how much pussy you think Georgiou Georgiou was a handsome faster.</v>

1920
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 10>It's probably crushing it.</v>

1921
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:36.570
<v Speaker 10>I would not want to speculate because I don't know the man's personal situation,</v>

1922
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.770
<v Speaker 10>but I would say that if he wanted to Giorgio so close,</v>

1923
00:54:40.771 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 10>so smooth talking about the fucker.</v>

1924
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.320
<v Speaker 10>Everyone makes fun of his hair.</v>

1925
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:44.130
<v Speaker 10>He knows that he's done.</v>

1926
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:47.250
<v Speaker 10>He doesn't know is that the pitches are going to remember this hair.</v>

1927
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:48.781
<v Speaker 10>It was funny,</v>

1928
00:54:48.781 --> 00:54:48.961
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

1929
00:54:48.961 --> 00:54:53.961
<v Speaker 10>He got upset at me when I retweeted the thing about ancient aliens debunked,</v>

1930
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1931
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:55.741
<v Speaker 10>he was upset.</v>

1932
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:56.070
<v Speaker 10>I'm like,</v>

1933
00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:56.903
<v Speaker 10>look,</v>

1934
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:58.710
<v Speaker 10>this is how I looked at it.</v>

1935
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.790
<v Speaker 10>You cannot be upset when someone points out mistakes.</v>

1936
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.680
<v Speaker 10>You can't shoot the Messenger.</v>

1937
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:05.221
<v Speaker 10>And he was like,</v>

1938
00:55:05.221 --> 00:55:06.930
<v Speaker 10>I didn't know you supported Christians.</v>

1939
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:08.250
<v Speaker 10>You know the kinds of fundamental,</v>

1940
00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:08.701
<v Speaker 10>it's Christian.</v>

1941
00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:09.534
<v Speaker 10>And I was like,</v>

1942
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:10.171
<v Speaker 10>okay,</v>

1943
00:55:10.171 --> 00:55:11.004
<v Speaker 10>look you man,</v>

1944
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 10>I like you a lot.</v>

1945
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.310
<v Speaker 10>And I liked that whole subject of aliens a lot.</v>

1946
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:18.900
<v Speaker 10>But that guy who made that video pointed out a lot of shit that was an accurate</v>

1947
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 10>and that's important.</v>

1948
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 10>It's important to get shit accurate.</v>

1949
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:27.300
<v Speaker 10>It's important to not make speculations based on faulty evidence.</v>

1950
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 10>And when you got a television show,</v>

1951
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.840
<v Speaker 10>you have a certain amount of responsibility.</v>

1952
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:32.310
<v Speaker 10>So in my opinion,</v>

1953
00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 10>instead of being upset at that guy,</v>

1954
00:55:33.811 --> 00:55:36.540
<v Speaker 10>he shouldn't upset that they put something out that was accurate.</v>

1955
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:41.070
<v Speaker 10>But that doesn't discount the possibility that we could have been visited by</v>

1956
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.000
<v Speaker 10>ancient aliens.</v>

1957
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.290
<v Speaker 10>That's where everybody wants to take one camp or another and this debunker guy,</v>

1958
00:55:46.291 --> 00:55:47.210
<v Speaker 10>he's like convinced.</v>

1959
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 10>I used to believe that too.</v>

1960
00:55:48.421 --> 00:55:50.550
<v Speaker 10>But now I think it's been thoroughly debunked.</v>

1961
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.560
<v Speaker 10>Nothing's been debunked.</v>

1962
00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.420
<v Speaker 10>Yes,</v>

1963
00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:53.790
<v Speaker 10>there's,</v>

1964
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:54.960
<v Speaker 10>there's one monkey.</v>

1965
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:55.710
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1966
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:59.070
<v Speaker 10>That looks way different from all the other monkeys.</v>

1967
00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:04.370
<v Speaker 10>And the only thing that we resemble his dogs in that we are completely different</v>

1968
00:56:04.771 --> 00:56:05.161
<v Speaker 10>looking,</v>

1969
00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:06.270
<v Speaker 10>but we can breed with each other.</v>

1970
00:56:06.271 --> 00:56:10.380
<v Speaker 10>Like Shaquille O'Neal could mate with Miley Cyrus.</v>

1971
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:10.741
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

1972
00:56:10.741 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 10>they don't even look like they're remotely the same species.</v>

1973
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:14.131
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1974
00:56:14.131 --> 00:56:15.870
<v Speaker 10>Shaquille O'Neal is seven foot,</v>

1975
00:56:15.871 --> 00:56:16.740
<v Speaker 10>whatever the fuck he is.</v>

1976
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:18.160
<v Speaker 10>Miley Cyrus not a good example.</v>

1977
00:56:18.161 --> 00:56:20.820
<v Speaker 10>Like give me a really pale white girls.</v>

1978
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.653
<v Speaker 10>Tiny.</v>

1979
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 10>Anyone,</v>

1980
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.813
<v Speaker 10>Bjork,</v>

1981
00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:24.470
<v Speaker 10>Bjork,</v>

1982
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.740
<v Speaker 10>Sia.</v>

1983
00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.080
<v Speaker 10>Donald.</v>

1984
00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:25.450
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

1985
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:27.420
<v Speaker 10>it's Shaquille O'Neal could fuck Bjork.</v>

1986
00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.760
<v Speaker 10>And they could have a baby.</v>

1987
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:29.593
<v Speaker 10>That's ridiculous.</v>

1988
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.550
<v Speaker 10>The only place that exists in nature is with,</v>

1989
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:33.600
<v Speaker 10>with dogs.</v>

1990
00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:34.560
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1991
00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.400
<v Speaker 10>like a baboon's can't fuck Orangutang and get it pregnant.</v>

1992
00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.450
<v Speaker 10>It doesn't work that way.</v>

1993
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:44.280
<v Speaker 10>But a dog or any dog can fuck any other dog and they just make another dog.</v>

1994
00:56:44.281 --> 00:56:48.110
<v Speaker 10>Like you take crazy dogs like a beagle and that'd be ego can fuck a uh,</v>

1995
00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:50.760
<v Speaker 10>one of those giant Russian Wolf dogs.</v>

1996
00:56:50.761 --> 00:56:51.720
<v Speaker 10>You ever seen those things?</v>

1997
00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:54.210
<v Speaker 10>The octa vox or whatever the fuck it's called.</v>

1998
00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:54.841
<v Speaker 10>It's crazy thing.</v>

1999
00:56:54.841 --> 00:56:56.460
<v Speaker 10>It looks like an American Werewolf in London.</v>

2000
00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:56.791
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

2001
00:56:56.791 --> 00:56:58.380
<v Speaker 10>it's the most ridiculous looking dog ever.</v>

2002
00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:58.621
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2003
00:56:58.621 --> 00:56:59.221
<v Speaker 10>they could fuck them.</v>

2004
00:56:59.221 --> 00:57:02.070
<v Speaker 10>They can make a little crazy little hybrid baby that's a,</v>

2005
00:57:02.071 --> 00:57:03.990
<v Speaker 10>that only exists in people and dogs.</v>

2006
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:05.580
<v Speaker 10>And we know that human beings,</v>

2007
00:57:05.581 --> 00:57:06.870
<v Speaker 10>genetically engineered dogs,</v>

2008
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:07.651
<v Speaker 10>we know that,</v>

2009
00:57:07.651 --> 00:57:07.831
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2010
00:57:07.831 --> 00:57:09.810
<v Speaker 10>by selective breeding and you know,</v>

2011
00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:11.190
<v Speaker 10>how are the fuck they did it.</v>

2012
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:12.210
<v Speaker 10>They're not exactly sure.</v>

2013
00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.430
<v Speaker 10>But they know that all dogs emanate from wolves.</v>

2014
00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:15.120
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2015
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:20.120
<v Speaker 10>Somehow or another from wolves came chihuahuas and beagles and bulldogs,</v>

2016
00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:22.470
<v Speaker 10>all of them originated as well,</v>

2017
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.480
<v Speaker 10>which is really fucking fascinating.</v>

2018
00:57:24.481 --> 00:57:27.720
<v Speaker 10>When you stop thinking about it because we don't know about the origin of dogs,</v>

2019
00:57:27.721 --> 00:57:28.560
<v Speaker 10>the origin of dogs,</v>

2020
00:57:28.561 --> 00:57:31.050
<v Speaker 10>a very confusing and slippery subject.</v>

2021
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:33.450
<v Speaker 10>So then when you start talking about the origin of people,</v>

2022
00:57:33.451 --> 00:57:36.630
<v Speaker 10>what we fucking resemble dogs quite a bit folks.</v>

2023
00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.201
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

2024
00:57:37.201 --> 00:57:40.350
<v Speaker 10>And we don't look like anything else around us and we don't behave like anything</v>

2025
00:57:40.351 --> 00:57:44.460
<v Speaker 10>else around us where way fucking smarter than everything else here.</v>

2026
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:45.953
<v Speaker 10>What's going on?</v>

2027
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:46.871
<v Speaker 10>What's going on and had,</v>

2028
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:46.961
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>

2029
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:47.020
<v Speaker 10>How'd</v>

2030
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:47.853
<v Speaker 2>we get here?</v>

2031
00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.270
<v Speaker 2>It's confusing.</v>

2032
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.841
<v Speaker 2>That video.</v>

2033
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:50.680
<v Speaker 2>He was making it.</v>

2034
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:55.330
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to make it look like he was debunking the whole ancient aliens</v>

2035
00:57:55.331 --> 00:57:56.110
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

2036
00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:56.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2037
00:57:56.591 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2038
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:59.080
<v Speaker 2>he pointed out some mistakes and,</v>

2039
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:03.870
<v Speaker 2>but he was like debunking the whole ancient alien theory.</v>

2040
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.480
<v Speaker 2>There's been a million documentaries on the shit.</v>

2041
00:58:07.481 --> 00:58:08.890
<v Speaker 2>The ancient aliens is done.</v>

2042
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.650
<v Speaker 2>It would agent Allianz is doing it.</v>

2043
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 2>That's already been done,</v>

2044
00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:12.634
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing it.</v>

2045
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.100
<v Speaker 2>They're the,</v>

2046
00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:13.950
<v Speaker 2>it looks the best.</v>

2047
00:58:13.951 --> 00:58:15.340
<v Speaker 2>It's highly produced.</v>

2048
00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:16.720
<v Speaker 2>It's all that history channel.</v>

2049
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:17.853
<v Speaker 2>So when I saw it,</v>

2050
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.830
<v Speaker 2>when I first saw ancient aliens are already knew all that shit from,</v>

2051
00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:21.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2052
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know everything.</v>

2053
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2054
00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot from ancient aliens,</v>

2055
00:58:24.281 --> 00:58:26.910
<v Speaker 2>but the subjects were like the,</v>

2056
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.220
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff from Zachariah Cichon,</v>

2057
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Nia and Joe are both in disaccharides such,</v>

2058
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:32.350
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2059
00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:36.760
<v Speaker 2>so to see it on a major television network was awesome.</v>

2060
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:37.601
<v Speaker 2>Leather.</v>

2061
00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:42.601
<v Speaker 2>They get a date here or pounds off or whatever that's on the TV show.</v>

2062
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:43.381
<v Speaker 2>It's not on the,</v>

2063
00:58:43.381 --> 00:58:44.410
<v Speaker 2>the theory we've,</v>

2064
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.010
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2065
00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:45.330
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2066
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.350
<v Speaker 2>it'll be like watching a Jujitsu,</v>

2067
00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.500
<v Speaker 2>a documentary done by NBC,</v>

2068
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:50.921
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2069
00:58:50.921 --> 00:58:51.860
<v Speaker 2>The guys at NBC,</v>

2070
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.380
<v Speaker 2>they don't know Jujitsu that well,</v>

2071
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:55.030
<v Speaker 2>but they want to do it Jujitsu documentary.</v>

2072
00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:58.630
<v Speaker 2>They could easily get frauds or dudes you don't know,</v>

2073
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>

2074
00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:00.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2075
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:02.770
<v Speaker 2>they're not real experts in Jujitsu and put them on the show.</v>

2076
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2077
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2078
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 2>as a Jiu Jitsu expert,</v>

2079
00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:06.130
<v Speaker 2>you watch out and you're not going to,</v>

2080
00:59:06.131 --> 00:59:06.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2081
00:59:06.371 --> 00:59:07.720
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a dumb ass.</v>

2082
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.010
<v Speaker 2>They put that motherfucker in there,</v>

2083
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2084
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:09.970
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

2085
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:11.380
<v Speaker 2>And then someone comes around and says,</v>

2086
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:12.161
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu went,</v>

2087
00:59:12.161 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

2088
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:13.511
<v Speaker 2>that guy's a fraud.</v>

2089
00:59:13.511 --> 00:59:14.920
<v Speaker 2>He's not even a real brown belt.</v>

2090
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:15.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2091
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:15.850
<v Speaker 2>he's aligning,</v>

2092
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 2>they put them on TV,</v>

2093
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:17.940
<v Speaker 2>but that would,</v>

2094
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:20.980
<v Speaker 2>you're not denouncing Jujitsu denouncing the show.</v>

2095
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 2>And he needed to be more clear about that.</v>

2096
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.630
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't fucking up the theories.</v>

2097
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

2098
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:25.851
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2099
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:27.200
<v Speaker 2>You're going to tell me that,</v>

2100
00:59:27.201 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2101
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2102
00:59:28.101 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 2>there's so much evidence I could go on and on.</v>

2103
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 2>You're going to tell me there isn't a possibility that there's some crazy shit</v>

2104
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:34.190
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

2105
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.940
<v Speaker 2>You think like,</v>

2106
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 2>you got it all figured out.</v>

2107
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a possibility that anything could happen.</v>

2108
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.153
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2109
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:42.103
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2110
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

2111
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:44.053
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

2112
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the,</v>

2113
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:49.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different things that happened to people and one of them</v>

2114
00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:54.740
<v Speaker 1>that's the most confusing to scientists is the doubling of the human brain size</v>

2115
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 1>over a period of 2 million years.</v>

2116
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:58.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a really shocking fossil event.</v>

2117
00:59:58.610 --> 00:59:59.780
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what the fuck did that.</v>

2118
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:00.621
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2119
01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:04.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different theories about higher protein consumption.</v>

2120
01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:05.800
<v Speaker 1>If we figured out hunting and then went to,</v>

2121
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.621
<v Speaker 1>once you started hunting,</v>

2122
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>our brains are growing because they had to figure out how to outsmart the</v>

2123
01:00:09.501 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>animals and they connect connected to the throwing arm.</v>

2124
01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>The possibility that we figured out that we can throw things in a manner that no</v>

2125
01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:16.011
<v Speaker 1>other animals can.</v>

2126
01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>So then we started catching things with spears and that that accelerated our</v>

2127
01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>learning curve.</v>

2128
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like weird,</v>

2129
01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:25.280
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is it's a fucking crazy mystery.</v>

2130
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

2131
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.300
<v Speaker 1>if some alien race from another galaxy who was unbelievably brilliant and many,</v>

2132
01:00:31.701 --> 01:00:31.911
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2133
01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:32.151
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2134
01:00:32.151 --> 01:00:32.421
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2135
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:32.751
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2136
01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>many generations ahead of us in the future to the point where,</v>

2137
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2138
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>they realized that,</v>

2139
01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2140
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>in order to preserve intelligent life,</v>

2141
01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>you have to seed it.</v>

2142
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to come to a planet that already has life,</v>

2143
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:48.800
<v Speaker 1>find the smartest thing there.</v>

2144
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:49.581
<v Speaker 1>What do you got here?</v>

2145
01:00:49.581 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy monkey thing that's figured out how to use a stick to pick up</v>

2146
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>ants.</v>

2147
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.171
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2148
01:00:54.171 --> 01:00:54.501
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2149
01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:55.334
<v Speaker 1>He's thinking,</v>

2150
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:55.761
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2151
01:00:55.761 --> 01:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>let's take some of them and let's do some shit to their DNA and let's see if</v>

2152
01:00:59.811 --> 01:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>they survive.</v>

2153
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.640
<v Speaker 1>And then they come back,</v>

2154
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:05.120
<v Speaker 1>they leave for a few thousand years or whatever and come back and see what the</v>

2155
01:01:05.121 --> 01:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck we have.</v>

2156
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2157
01:01:05.881 --> 01:01:06.770
<v Speaker 1>what do we have now?</v>

2158
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>While we have some new signals?</v>

2159
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:09.470
<v Speaker 1>They've developed nuclear weapons.</v>

2160
01:01:09.471 --> 01:01:10.304
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do?</v>

2161
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that quick,</v>

2162
01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>and then they come back and check us out.</v>

2163
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible.</v>

2164
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2165
01:01:16.401 --> 01:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>it's just as possible as us sending rovers to Mars,</v>

2166
01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2167
01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>we have done that.</v>

2168
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>We have to realize that if we have done that,</v>

2169
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>and we have existed in this,</v>

2170
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.780
<v Speaker 1>in this planet for 4.6 billion years,</v>

2171
01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.930
<v Speaker 1>it took for a human being to get to this point.</v>

2172
01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>What if there's a planet that's 20 billion years old?</v>

2173
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2174
01:01:37.551 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>If there's a planet that's just double it,</v>

2175
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>let's go to 12 billion.</v>

2176
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are we going to be like?</v>

2177
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.920
<v Speaker 1>It's 6 billion years or 4 billion years.</v>

2178
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2179
01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.020
<v Speaker 2>The whole crazy thing about the,</v>

2180
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:52.190
<v Speaker 2>the 10th planet or Nibiru that planet is that,</v>

2181
01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 2>who knows if that's out there really are not,</v>

2182
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.041
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

2183
01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:55.874
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2184
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>the what,</v>

2185
01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 2>the p,</v>

2186
01:01:56.690 --> 01:02:01.690
<v Speaker 2>the way people react to that theory is that there's trillions and trillions and</v>

2187
01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:05.180
<v Speaker 2>trillions of stars and planets every fucking where.</v>

2188
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:08.180
<v Speaker 2>But if you believe there's a fucking another planet out there,</v>

2189
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:09.170
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking crazy.</v>

2190
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Problem with the Nibiru theory is that the,</v>

2191
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>it comes in between Mars and Jupiter every 3,600 years.</v>

2192
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is that have depictions</v>

2193
01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:23.440
<v Speaker 10>of shit that happened 3,600 years ago.</v>

2194
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.240
<v Speaker 10>It's not that reliable,</v>

2195
01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.320
<v Speaker 10>but you're talking,</v>

2196
01:02:26.321 --> 01:02:27.370
<v Speaker 10>you would have to go,</v>

2197
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.010
<v Speaker 10>you would have to go to like 1000 BC.</v>

2198
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:34.450
<v Speaker 10>I think that if a planet came around and fill the sky,</v>

2199
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.060
<v Speaker 10>that would probably be a lot of stories about it.</v>

2200
01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.340
<v Speaker 10>And there's no stories about no planet.</v>

2201
01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.680
<v Speaker 10>Doesn't mean it didn't happen and didn't just,</v>

2203
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:41.970
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

2204
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:43.330
<v Speaker 10>walk people up.</v>

2205
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:02:43.541 --> 01:02:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Who knows if it happened or not.</v>

2207
01:02:44.741 --> 01:02:45.490
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2208
01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:48.700
<v Speaker 2>to re that reaction like it's so crazy,</v>

2209
01:02:48.701 --> 01:02:52.090
<v Speaker 2>like it's so magical that there's another planet out there.</v>

2210
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I would think you should be able to track that thing moving if it was in an</v>

2211
01:02:55.991 --> 01:02:56.890
<v Speaker 2>elliptical orbit.</v>

2212
01:02:56.891 --> 01:02:58.030
<v Speaker 2>If it's that big,</v>

2213
01:02:58.090 --> 01:02:58.240
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2214
01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.220
<v Speaker 2>she will knows what we're getting.</v>

2215
01:02:59.560 --> 01:02:59.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2216
01:02:59.741 --> 01:03:01.390
<v Speaker 2>who knows what Info are getting.</v>

2217
01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:01.901
<v Speaker 2>Do you know,</v>

2218
01:03:01.901 --> 01:03:02.380
<v Speaker 2>have you,</v>

2219
01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a video out right now.</v>

2220
01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:08.431
<v Speaker 2>You know how you hear about all these different 2012 December 21st theories from</v>

2221
01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:12.400
<v Speaker 2>asteroids to earthquakes to solar flares,</v>

2222
01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.390
<v Speaker 2>all that dark stuff.</v>

2223
01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>And then there's people that say,</v>

2224
01:03:14.561 --> 01:03:15.101
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2225
01:03:15.101 --> 01:03:19.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a spiritual awakening time and all the mine count.</v>

2226
01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Or they didn't,</v>

2227
01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.870
<v Speaker 2>they didn't say anything about any total destruction or anything.</v>

2228
01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.130
<v Speaker 2>You hear there's all these theories,</v>

2229
01:03:24.131 --> 01:03:24.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2230
01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.070
<v Speaker 2>So there's this one very,</v>

2231
01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.630
<v Speaker 2>that was fucking great.</v>

2232
01:03:28.631 --> 01:03:29.980
<v Speaker 2>It's probably all bullshit,</v>

2233
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's great,</v>

2234
01:03:31.061 --> 01:03:31.240
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2235
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a video on youtube.</v>

2236
01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:33.910
<v Speaker 2>This is that.</v>

2237
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:38.910
<v Speaker 2>If you Youtube Mayan explains December 21st,</v>

2238
01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:39.970
<v Speaker 2>2012,</v>

2239
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a f he looks like a mind like an Indian dark skin,</v>

2240
01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>long black hair.</v>

2241
01:03:43.991 --> 01:03:48.991
<v Speaker 2>He's got his mind little headset on or as a Bandana on or something like white</v>

2242
01:03:49.721 --> 01:03:51.140
<v Speaker 2>clothes that kind of look like,</v>

2243
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.570
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2244
01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:53.980
<v Speaker 2>cause that dealt in genres that mine kind of weird.</v>

2245
01:03:53.981 --> 01:03:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2246
01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:58.270
<v Speaker 2>And he gave a lecture in Santa Monica and the video is everywhere.</v>

2247
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:59.770
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2248
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

2249
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how popular it is.</v>

2250
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.660
<v Speaker 2>It might be nothing now that I think about it.</v>

2251
01:04:04.661 --> 01:04:05.200
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

2252
01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.160
<v Speaker 2>the video is interesting.</v>

2253
01:04:06.161 --> 01:04:10.750
<v Speaker 2>He gives a lecture on what's going to happen December 21st,</v>

2254
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:13.180
<v Speaker 2>2012 and he explains the whole Mayan Pyramids and everything.</v>

2255
01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:13.710
<v Speaker 2>They should make</v>

2256
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.660
<v Speaker 10>that guy put all the money that he gets from that lecture in a Bach.</v>

2257
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:17.870
<v Speaker 10>Okay?</v>

2258
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.490
<v Speaker 10>And if 2000 and listen to the story as well.</v>

2259
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.910
<v Speaker 10>December 23rd rolls around,</v>

2260
01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.450
<v Speaker 10>give you a 24 hour grace period.</v>

2261
01:04:24.451 --> 01:04:25.284
<v Speaker 10>Nothing happened.</v>

2262
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:25.930
<v Speaker 10>Okay?</v>

2263
01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:26.980
<v Speaker 2>We plan to take that money.</v>

2264
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

2265
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:27.641
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2266
01:04:27.641 --> 01:04:28.720
<v Speaker 2>this is what he says happens.</v>

2267
01:04:28.721 --> 01:04:29.680
<v Speaker 2>This is what he says happens.</v>

2268
01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:31.870
<v Speaker 2>He comes out and he says,</v>

2269
01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.153
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2270
01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:35.250
<v Speaker 11>is this the guy?</v>

2271
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:35.860
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

2272
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.693
<v Speaker 11>I don't know.</v>

2273
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.260
<v Speaker 11>Men's side of the day</v>

2274
01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:44.100
<v Speaker 11>to all my brother's son,</v>

2275
01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:46.360
<v Speaker 11>he used to listen to this message.</v>

2276
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.350
<v Speaker 12>It's a Mayan explains.</v>

2277
01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:52.190
<v Speaker 2>This is probably just hustling.</v>

2278
01:04:52.191 --> 01:04:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so interesting?</v>

2279
01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:53.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2282
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:58.270
<v Speaker 12>This one,</v>

2283
01:04:58.270 --> 01:04:59.570
<v Speaker 10>the story is bad ass</v>

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:03.813
<v Speaker 12>that guy,</v>

2287
01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.413
<v Speaker 12>what is it?</v>

2288
01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 11>Are you actually going to hear it in post?</v>

2289
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:15.400
<v Speaker 2>So now in these times</v>

2290
01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.150
<v Speaker 11>there's</v>

2291
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:23.150
<v Speaker 13>something that really bothers me [inaudible] and it has to do with the</v>

2292
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:26.263
<v Speaker 13>alignment.</v>

2293
01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.480
<v Speaker 13>The planetary alignment that's going to happen on the 21st of December of this</v>

2294
01:05:29.481 --> 01:05:29.920
<v Speaker 13>year.</v>

2295
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.860
<v Speaker 13>Are you in grand experimenters in difficult by you want a cow?</v>

2296
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.550
<v Speaker 13>There's a great experiment that is going to be a fulfilled on that day.</v>

2297
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:41.850
<v Speaker 13>[inaudible] and this experiment and uses the particle accelerators.</v>

2298
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 13>[inaudible] scientists are looking for the anti matter.</v>

2299
01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.200
<v Speaker 13>Those are scaling up.</v>

2300
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:54.200
<v Speaker 13>Roy [inaudible] and so they want to use this planetary alignment</v>

2301
01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:58.570
<v Speaker 13>degenerate.</v>

2302
01:05:58.570 --> 01:05:59.800
<v Speaker 13>A very high vibration.</v>

2303
01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:02.800
<v Speaker 13>There's an experimental Cassie Gamma Proton Proton.</v>

2304
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 13>Proton.</v>

2305
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.593
<v Speaker 13>Proton.</v>

2306
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:06.150
<v Speaker 13>Okay.</v>

2307
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:08.040
<v Speaker 13>It's called the Proton Proton</v>

2308
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 13>[inaudible].</v>

2309
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:15.740
<v Speaker 13>It's a proton is generated with very large mat machines.</v>

2310
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.300
<v Speaker 13>It's on both parts.</v>

2311
01:06:17.301 --> 01:06:22.301
<v Speaker 13>The colors can Kathy [inaudible] and they're two particles that Jen,</v>

2312
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:23.803
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

2313
01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:25.540
<v Speaker 13>revolve in opposite directions.</v>

2314
01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:25.991
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2315
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:26.824
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

2316
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Stop now.</v>

2317
01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:28.541
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2318
01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:29.260
<v Speaker 2>This is what it was.</v>

2319
01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I was going to really listen to him.</v>

2320
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:35.920
<v Speaker 2>He's full of Shit and he has a sleeveless shirt on because of two things I don't</v>

2321
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:36.190
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2322
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.341
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2323
01:06:36.341 --> 01:06:37.174
<v Speaker 2>but this is what he says.</v>

2324
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:39.240
<v Speaker 2>He says what's happening on 2012.</v>

2325
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to know why sucks.</v>

2326
01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:44.043
<v Speaker 2>These guys guys,</v>

2327
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:45.310
<v Speaker 2>just a bullshit artist.</v>

2328
01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2329
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2330
01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying,</v>

2331
01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's a cool story.</v>

2332
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:48.671
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2333
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.400
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2334
01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's just keep it going then.</v>

2335
01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.213
<v Speaker 2>I forget it.</v>

2336
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Forget it.</v>

2337
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Well he's just some crazy guy with a fucking bullshit story toad.</v>

2338
01:06:57.890 --> 01:07:00.640
<v Speaker 2>But those guys are annoying to him.</v>

2339
01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:01.520
<v Speaker 2>But I love chocolate broken</v>

2340
01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:02.640
<v Speaker 13>when they come together,</v>

2341
01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:09.270
<v Speaker 13>when they collide they let go and they release all of these protons.</v>

2342
01:07:09.271 --> 01:07:11.340
<v Speaker 13>What I mean fuck though for the impact</v>

2343
01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:17.930
<v Speaker 13>and these protons [inaudible] they stimulate another round and the machine,</v>

2344
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.620
<v Speaker 13>you work there on the theater and they hit the earth</v>

2345
01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:29.160
<v Speaker 13>and when they hit the earth [inaudible] they create a chain reaction,</v>

2346
01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:32.570
<v Speaker 13>say protons and Directional Madman.</v>

2347
01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.960
<v Speaker 13>They create a reaction towards the direction of the magma.</v>

2348
01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.890
<v Speaker 13>Joke on those proton is the nine my hits,</v>

2349
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.920
<v Speaker 13>the protons disparate Alison a theater and it shoots out to the exterior of the</v>

2350
01:07:46.681 --> 01:07:51.681
<v Speaker 13>earth when the those and so when they are released roping open couple of sick</v>

2351
01:07:51.811 --> 01:07:54.390
<v Speaker 13>Tony because they break the tectonic plates,</v>

2352
01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.550
<v Speaker 13>I say cause they're [inaudible]</v>

2353
01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:01.440
<v Speaker 13>so they ignite the methane gas.</v>

2354
01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:05.730
<v Speaker 13>You've got silent era and then gas escapes in the earth.</v>

2355
01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.890
<v Speaker 13>[inaudible]</v>

2356
01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:14.010
<v Speaker 13>and one moment of that friction and he has a insane yet the um,</v>

2357
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:16.790
<v Speaker 13>the methane catches on fire,</v>

2358
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:22.120
<v Speaker 13>see Stereo and Munich Re is released into the just talking about what happened</v>

2359
01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:25.040
<v Speaker 13>and then the large Hadron collider</v>

2360
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.340
<v Speaker 13>experiments 2012 fire.</v>

2361
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

2362
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:30.950
<v Speaker 13>I understand what he's saying.</v>

2363
01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 13>He's just stupid that he is the boss case.</v>

2364
01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:39.030
<v Speaker 13>And so that's how hundreds of hectares of of forests are burned as like a woman</v>

2365
01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:42.360
<v Speaker 13>miss and to wall off about a month ago that you would,</v>

2366
01:08:42.361 --> 01:08:43.280
<v Speaker 13>I'm not sure you can stop.</v>

2367
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:44.143
<v Speaker 13>You could stop.</v>

2368
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:46.880
<v Speaker 13>How did you ever get this far?</v>

2369
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:50.120
<v Speaker 13>How did you ever get too far and then repeat it,</v>

2370
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.390
<v Speaker 2>bring it to us and with will Ferrell doing in it is that welfare?</v>

2371
01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2372
01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:58.670
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying is really exciting for,</v>

2373
01:08:58.710 --> 01:08:59.820
<v Speaker 2>for uh,</v>

2374
01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:00.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2375
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:01.463
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

2376
01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.090
<v Speaker 2>during the galactic alignment.</v>

2377
01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.120
<v Speaker 2>The reason he's explained this part does the particle collider is that on,</v>

2378
01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:11.630
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do that on the 2000,</v>

2379
01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>the 21st,</v>

2380
01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:15.360
<v Speaker 2>right when the sun is in the,</v>

2381
01:09:15.570 --> 01:09:15.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2382
01:09:15.931 --> 01:09:19.500
<v Speaker 2>when it passes through the center of the galaxy quest for eight minutes.</v>

2383
01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.480
<v Speaker 2>This is what he says for eight minutes,</v>

2384
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:22.381
<v Speaker 2>that this is what,</v>

2385
01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:23.910
<v Speaker 2>why I'm great minutes.</v>

2386
01:09:23.911 --> 01:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be hit with like energy from the center of the galaxy.</v>

2387
01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.700
<v Speaker 2>That where we feel enlightened,</v>

2388
01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:30.560
<v Speaker 2>like in a dream.</v>

2389
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that Neil degrasse Tyson says that that alignment happens all the</v>

2390
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>time and it's total bullshit.</v>

2391
01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that.</v>

2392
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2393
01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:38.150
<v Speaker 1>he's an astronomer.</v>

2394
01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I would go with him and what does he,</v>

2395
01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:41.840
<v Speaker 1>he does,</v>

2396
01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 1>he says it's bullshit.</v>

2397
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:43.551
<v Speaker 1>He says that a,</v>

2398
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:45.110
<v Speaker 1>that alignment happens all the time.</v>

2399
01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:47.240
<v Speaker 1>And then these people that are talking about this alignment,</v>

2400
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.320
<v Speaker 1>they're not astronomers.</v>

2401
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:49.430
<v Speaker 1>They really don't know what they're saying.</v>

2402
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>That it's,</v>

2403
01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen every 26,000 years,</v>

2404
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:55.430
<v Speaker 1>not according to Neil degrasse Tyson and he's a fucking brilliant man.</v>

2405
01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.870
<v Speaker 1>He says that that every,</v>

2406
01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>that 26,000 year cycle is bullshit.</v>

2407
01:09:58.801 --> 01:09:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Nonsense.</v>

2408
01:09:59.530 --> 01:09:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.840
<v Speaker 1>He says it happens all the time.</v>

2410
01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2411
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the procession of Equinox is a 26,000 year cycle.</v>

2412
01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a completely different thing.</v>

2413
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.230
<v Speaker 1>The procession of the equinox is the wobble of the earth and that is a hundred</v>

2414
01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.060
<v Speaker 1>that there's 26,000 years,</v>

2415
01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.010
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure</v>

2416
01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:12.843
<v Speaker 2>proven.</v>

2417
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I thought that here's the center of the galaxy,</v>

2418
01:10:15.731 --> 01:10:17.680
<v Speaker 2>like a disk and our son,</v>

2419
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:23.050
<v Speaker 2>it takes 26 it rotates like this around it like that and it takes 26,000 years</v>

2420
01:10:23.771 --> 01:10:27.460
<v Speaker 2>to make that loop and then it goes through the center and then it goes this way</v>

2421
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:29.860
<v Speaker 2>down upward and then it goes through the center.</v>

2422
01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:30.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what I read,</v>

2423
01:10:30.941 --> 01:10:32.110
<v Speaker 2>but I could be totally wrong.</v>

2424
01:10:32.111 --> 01:10:32.261
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2425
01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that means.</v>

2426
01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure I know what that,</v>

2427
01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:35.081
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2428
01:10:35.081 --> 01:10:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Like the the the center of the galaxy.</v>

2429
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.330
<v Speaker 2>The galaxy is a disk.</v>

2430
01:10:37.331 --> 01:10:38.830
<v Speaker 2>You were doing shit with your hands,</v>

2431
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:40.570
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I'm talking about.</v>

2432
01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Hey Dude,</v>

2433
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:42.280
<v Speaker 2>this is not a good place.</v>

2434
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Confusing the shit out of me.</v>

2435
01:10:43.361 --> 01:10:44.111
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking over my shoulder,</v>

2436
01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:44.944
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing people.</v>

2437
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:47.913
<v Speaker 12>MMM.</v>

2438
01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:48.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2439
01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2440
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it doesn't work that way.</v>

2441
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2442
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what I read.</v>

2443
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:53.811
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

2444
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:54.644
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2445
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:55.250
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2446
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.450
<v Speaker 2>or saw on the Internet.</v>

2447
01:10:58.090 --> 01:10:59.060
<v Speaker 2>See that's the problem.</v>

2448
01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.240
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm Neil degrasse Tyson says nothing's going to happen.</v>

2449
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 2>So is it that,</v>

2450
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 2>that connection that's like that Shit's there all the time.</v>

2451
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:07.383
<v Speaker 12>Hmm.</v>

2452
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.840
<v Speaker 1>So the sun passes through the center of the galaxy all the time apparently.</v>

2453
01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:12.541
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he's saying?</v>

2454
01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>We proudly the position that's going</v>

2455
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.221
<v Speaker 10>to be,</v>

2456
01:11:14.221 --> 01:11:15.054
<v Speaker 10>and he said it's,</v>

2457
01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:16.230
<v Speaker 10>it's happened many times.</v>

2458
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:17.490
<v Speaker 10>Hmm.</v>

2459
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:18.323
<v Speaker 10>That's what he says.</v>

2460
01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.960
<v Speaker 10>These motherfuckers working on the large Hadron collider though they are</v>

2461
01:11:21.961 --> 01:11:22.794
<v Speaker 10>unchecked,</v>

2462
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.371
<v Speaker 10>unchecked,</v>

2463
01:11:23.371 --> 01:11:24.690
<v Speaker 10>crazy super geniuses.</v>

2464
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:25.471
<v Speaker 10>You know.</v>

2465
01:11:25.471 --> 01:11:26.160
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

2466
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 10>I'm not saying that we should,</v>

2467
01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:27.750
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

2468
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:31.800
<v Speaker 10>stop the program that I am saying that there's a far to people that aren't</v>

2469
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 10>concerned about the possibilities of what all the crazy shit they're doing.</v>

2470
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:36.181
<v Speaker 10>They're making,</v>

2471
01:11:36.181 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 10>they're,</v>

2472
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:39.000
<v Speaker 10>they're absolutely making little black holes.</v>

2473
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.013
<v Speaker 10>Absolutely.</v>

2474
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:44.340
<v Speaker 10>When you create that Higgs Boson particle cause he's microscopic black holes</v>

2475
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:46.800
<v Speaker 10>that are made that they don't have enough gravity to stay,</v>

2476
01:11:46.801 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

2477
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:47.941
<v Speaker 10>stay active.</v>

2478
01:11:47.941 --> 01:11:49.230
<v Speaker 10>So they disappear really quickly.</v>

2479
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.360
<v Speaker 10>But what the fuck?</v>

2480
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:52.161
<v Speaker 10>Like what,</v>

2481
01:11:52.161 --> 01:11:57.161
<v Speaker 10>what kind of a crazy ass hole uses a machine with the possibility of making a</v>

2482
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:00.360
<v Speaker 10>black hole because what's going to happen next and they're going to be happy</v>

2483
01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:02.130
<v Speaker 10>with these results and just stop there.</v>

2484
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.280
<v Speaker 10>What if there's like more spectacular energy that can be created but there's a</v>

2485
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:11.500
<v Speaker 10>smaller chance the black holes sticks around a while?</v>

2486
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:12.571
<v Speaker 10>Well they're going to go,</v>

2487
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:13.860
<v Speaker 10>of course they're going to go for that.</v>

2488
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:15.000
<v Speaker 10>They're going to keep doing it.</v>

2489
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:19.890
<v Speaker 10>They're gonna keep doing it because people are fucking infatuated with figuring</v>

2490
01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:24.510
<v Speaker 10>out how shit works and they're going to things like the large Hadron collider.</v>

2491
01:12:24.511 --> 01:12:24.871
<v Speaker 10>It just,</v>

2492
01:12:24.871 --> 01:12:29.871
<v Speaker 10>it's just one step and a never ending process until they get to technology that</v>

2493
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 10>could end the universe instantly all at once.</v>

2494
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:35.460
<v Speaker 10>That's like,</v>

2495
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.220
<v Speaker 10>it's almost inevitable if you think about what they're doing now.</v>

2496
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.580
<v Speaker 10>Large Hadron collider is a courageous.</v>

2497
01:12:40.581 --> 01:12:41.414
<v Speaker 10>The idea,</v>

2498
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.380
<v Speaker 10>they are finding the,</v>

2499
01:12:43.381 --> 01:12:45.450
<v Speaker 10>they're recreating the conditions.</v>

2500
01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:49.750
<v Speaker 10>Millie millions of a second after the the,</v>

2501
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:51.180
<v Speaker 10>the universe was created.</v>

2502
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.940
<v Speaker 10>That's what they're doing by smashing those atoms together.</v>

2503
01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:55.620
<v Speaker 10>They're recreating this particle way.</v>

2504
01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 10>They figured that out to build.</v>

2505
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 10>Is it like 17 miles?</v>

2506
01:12:58.591 --> 01:12:59.424
<v Speaker 10>Like and,</v>

2507
01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:01.460
<v Speaker 10>and I'm the circle like that.</v>

2508
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:04.260
<v Speaker 10>I think it's 22 I think it's 22 miles.</v>

2509
01:13:04.261 --> 01:13:05.430
<v Speaker 10>It might be 22 kilometers,</v>

2510
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.390
<v Speaker 10>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2511
01:13:06.391 --> 01:13:08.910
<v Speaker 10>And they saw and they smashed these Adam's together.</v>

2512
01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:09.680
<v Speaker 10>But it's,</v>

2513
01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:09.950
<v Speaker 10>it's,</v>

2514
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:10.710
<v Speaker 10>it's crazy.</v>

2515
01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 10>They think not only did they figure it out,</v>

2516
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.370
<v Speaker 10>they've explained it,</v>

2517
01:13:14.371 --> 01:13:17.190
<v Speaker 10>got funding and then they're out there and doing it.</v>

2518
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.360
<v Speaker 10>That is some,</v>

2519
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.081
<v Speaker 10>that is alien,</v>

2520
01:13:19.081 --> 01:13:19.291
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2521
01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:20.100
<v Speaker 10>They're not us.</v>

2522
01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:20.580
<v Speaker 10>Those who,</v>

2523
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.170
<v Speaker 10>I don't know any other people that can do that.</v>

2524
01:13:22.171 --> 01:13:23.280
<v Speaker 10>And how the fuck did they do that?</v>

2525
01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.473
<v Speaker 10>Those are aliens.</v>

2526
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:25.200
<v Speaker 10>I mean it's,</v>

2527
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.990
<v Speaker 10>it's like it's a circle,</v>

2528
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:32.730
<v Speaker 10>like a tube in a circle and they run particles like simultaneously and then they</v>

2529
01:13:32.731 --> 01:13:33.570
<v Speaker 10>run into each other.</v>

2530
01:13:33.571 --> 01:13:34.770
<v Speaker 10>So I don't understand it.</v>

2531
01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 10>I'm not swollen.</v>

2532
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:37.110
<v Speaker 10>Then when they collide,</v>

2533
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:42.710
<v Speaker 10>the explosion that they're taking snapshots of the explosion to see what the</v>

2534
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:44.610
<v Speaker 10>hell is going on.</v>

2535
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:47.190
<v Speaker 10>They're trying to find the God particle.</v>

2536
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:49.590
<v Speaker 10>They believe they've isolated that.</v>

2537
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:54.720
<v Speaker 10>And there's also something called cork glue on plasma that that's another thing</v>

2538
01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:55.471
<v Speaker 10>that they've created.</v>

2539
01:13:55.471 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 10>They've created a new kind of matter that didn't exist before,</v>

2540
01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:00.600
<v Speaker 10>that did to do a lot of freaky shit.</v>

2541
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.460
<v Speaker 10>This cork gluon plasma.</v>

2542
01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:04.590
<v Speaker 10>I think if you made,</v>

2543
01:14:04.591 --> 01:14:09.591
<v Speaker 10>I think the dimensions are a sugar cube would weigh 40 million pounds.</v>

2544
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:12.110
<v Speaker 10>It might be billion.</v>

2545
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.771
<v Speaker 10>Let me see.</v>

2546
01:14:12.771 --> 01:14:13.250
<v Speaker 10>Cork.</v>

2547
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:16.280
<v Speaker 10>I gotta I gotta pull that up cause it's fucking crazy.</v>

2548
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 10>When I read the quote glue on Plasma,</v>

2549
01:14:21.441 --> 01:14:21.710
<v Speaker 10>wait,</v>

2550
01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:23.030
<v Speaker 10>when I read the quote I was like,</v>

2551
01:14:23.031 --> 01:14:24.890
<v Speaker 10>what the fuck are they doing?</v>

2552
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:28.880
<v Speaker 10>They're making some shit that it's just like infinitely heavy.</v>

2553
01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:32.770
<v Speaker 10>And uh,</v>

2554
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 10>this is something that it was a,</v>

2555
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:37.770
<v Speaker 10>I believe this was all basically they were,</v>

2556
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.720
<v Speaker 10>this is all theoretical until really recently.</v>

2557
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.760
<v Speaker 10>I know that the um,</v>

2558
01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>

2559
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 10>oh my God,</v>

2560
01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.353
<v Speaker 12>okay.</v>

2561
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:48.021
<v Speaker 10>They,</v>

2562
01:14:48.021 --> 01:14:52.970
<v Speaker 10>the court glow on plasma has an approximate temperature of 4 trillion degrees</v>

2563
01:14:52.971 --> 01:14:53.810
<v Speaker 10>Celsius.</v>

2621
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:46.781

<v Speaker 10>stories and occasionally a rope you in.</v>

2629
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:55.901
<v Speaker 10>And someone was like,</v>

2636
01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:05.180
<v Speaker 10>It's just a fake fuck it.</v>

2637
01:17:05.181 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 10>It's not,</v>

2638
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.650
<v Speaker 10>it's not even remotely weird enough to be fake.</v>

2639
01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 10>You should check out the young Turks</v>

2647
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 7>We talked about it yesterday.</v>

2648
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:19.240
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2649
01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 7>I talked about it with um,</v>

2650
01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:21.550
<v Speaker 7>machine Smith the other day too.</v>

2653
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:23.850
<v Speaker 7>I did.</v>

2654
01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:25.760
<v Speaker 7>Did you know that that's the number one news right now.</v>

2655
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:26.570
<v Speaker 7>Her channel,</v>

2656
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:28.370
<v Speaker 7>her channel is the number one online news.</v>

2657
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.181
<v Speaker 7>That makes sense.</v>

2658
01:17:29.181 --> 01:17:30.014
<v Speaker 7>Isn't that crazy?</v>

2659
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.863
<v Speaker 10>Makes Sense.</v>

2660
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:33.290
<v Speaker 10>People don't want to watch CNN online anymore.</v>

2661
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.450
<v Speaker 10>They did another getting bullshitted and then by the way,</v>

2662
01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:37.970
<v Speaker 10>they also know they're going to have to sit through these fucking commercials</v>

2663
01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 10>every time it jumps to a new story.</v>

2664
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:41.210
<v Speaker 10>You ever go to cnn.com?</v>

2665
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.630
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2666
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:42.950
<v Speaker 10>Great source of information.</v>

2667
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:45.800
<v Speaker 10>But it makes you want to put your fucking head through a wall when you start</v>

2668
01:17:45.801 --> 01:17:48.440
<v Speaker 10>listening to their videos because if you watch their video,</v>

2669
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.360
<v Speaker 10>every fucking video,</v>

2670
01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:52.670
<v Speaker 10>you have to watch a 32nd commercial.</v>

2671
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.160
<v Speaker 10>So it's over and over and over again.</v>

2672
01:17:55.161 --> 01:17:57.410
<v Speaker 10>And usually it's the same God damn commercial.</v>

2673
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.360
<v Speaker 10>So over and over and over again,</v>

2674
01:17:59.361 --> 01:18:02.930
<v Speaker 10>you're listening to this stupid nonsense about detergent or whatever the fuck it</v>

2675
01:18:02.931 --> 01:18:03.320
<v Speaker 10>is.</v>

2676
01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 10>And you get to the point where like,</v>

2677
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.263
<v Speaker 10>this is crazy.</v>

2678
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 10>Play me 10 in a row.</v>

2679
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:07.131
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>

2680
01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:08.270
<v Speaker 10>play me three in a row.</v>

2681
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:11.690
<v Speaker 10>You can't have a fucking commercial after each God damn video.</v>

2682
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.580
<v Speaker 10>So that's how the young Turks,</v>

2683
01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:16.250
<v Speaker 10>they just sneak in steel CNNs thunder.</v>

2684
01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:19.420
<v Speaker 7>She says he'll come on the podcast if we ever liner.</v>

2685
01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:19.810
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2686
01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:20.530
<v Speaker 7>That'd be just fine.</v>

2687
01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:21.221
<v Speaker 7>She was fine.</v>

2688
01:18:21.221 --> 01:18:21.821
<v Speaker 7>I think you'd like her.</v>

2689
01:18:21.821 --> 01:18:22.840
<v Speaker 7>She's very intelligent.</v>

2690
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:23.590
<v Speaker 7>It's cool.</v>

2691
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:24.423
<v Speaker 7>Pretty cool.</v>

2692
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:25.060

2693
01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:25.391
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2694
01:18:25.391 --> 01:18:27.670
<v Speaker 10>I wonder how much the CIA has been following her.</v>

2695
01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.510
<v Speaker 10>If you tell him some real news on the Internet,</v>

2696
01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.860
<v Speaker 10>who act like one of those people?</v>

2697
01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:33.161
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

2698
01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:33.994
<v Speaker 10>this is a different one.</v>

2699
01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:34.761

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:44.253
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

2706
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:45.890
<v Speaker 7>they're like glow sticks that attached to your,</v>

2707
01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.000
<v Speaker 7>your fingers.</v>

2708
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:47.960
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2709
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:49.850
<v Speaker 7>I haven't been to a club in a long time.</v>

2710
01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:50.841
<v Speaker 7>It's so funny.</v>

2711
01:18:50.841 --> 01:18:53.870
<v Speaker 7>I saw a guy the other day in San Diego and he had these like little things that</v>

2712
01:18:53.871 --> 01:18:55.360
<v Speaker 7>you attached to your fingers that,</v>

2713
01:18:55.361 --> 01:18:56.450
<v Speaker 7>that are like glow sticks,</v>

2714
01:18:56.451 --> 01:18:58.310
<v Speaker 7>but you go like this and they flash around like,</v>

2715
01:18:58.311 --> 01:19:00.950
<v Speaker 7>I guess it's like are a rave thing now that a popular,</v>

2716
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:04.910
<v Speaker 7>but it was hilarious watching him dance with that shit too lazy for glow sticks.</v>

2717
01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:05.571
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

2720
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.890
<v Speaker 7>I like glow sticks but I don't want to carry things.</v>

2721
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.490
<v Speaker 7>Can you make them stick to my fingers so I could just move my fingers right now?</v>

2722
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:14.420
<v Speaker 7>It's so weird.</v>

2723
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.080
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2724
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:15.890
<v Speaker 7>it's the gay,</v>

2725
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:17.150
<v Speaker 7>the gay is with an age thing.</v>

2726
01:19:17.151 --> 01:19:19.700
<v Speaker 7>You will ever see somebody dance around with those things on his finger.</v>

2727
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:20.241
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:22.880
<v Speaker 7>I've seen a lot of sad shit.</v>

2731
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:27.290
<v Speaker 7>At least glowsticks kind of look cool in your high something to them.</v>

2732
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.540
<v Speaker 7>It's funny how one sort of a thing got attached to one drug,</v>

2733
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2734

<v Speaker 7>it's kind of interesting.</v>

2737
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.461
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2738
01:19:37.461 --> 01:19:40.040

2741
01:19:42.941 --> 01:19:44.500
<v Speaker 10>and also it's like hypnotic.</v>

2742
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:46.570
<v Speaker 10>When you see it like trailing in the air,</v>

2743
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:47.111
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2744
01:19:47.111 --> 01:19:50.630
<v Speaker 10>there's like a certain trail quality to those glow sticks.</v>

2745
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.321

2755
01:20:05.941 --> 01:20:06.774
<v Speaker 7>around.</v>

2756
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 7>Oh</v>

2757
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.061

2758
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:11.280
<v Speaker 10>it's the most ridiculous thing ever.</v>

2759
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.390
<v Speaker 10>I don't know if they're saying south.</v>

2760
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.333
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2761
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:18.360
<v Speaker 14>but like this was like,</v>

2762
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:20.370
<v Speaker 14>I saw all these people in San Diego have them.</v>

2763
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.820
<v Speaker 14>They got me and Doug Benson were at a dance club and saw it like a guy doing</v>

2764
01:20:23.821 --> 01:20:24.301
<v Speaker 14>this shit.</v>

2765
01:20:24.301 --> 01:20:25.134
<v Speaker 14>And it's just like,</v>

2766
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.280
<v Speaker 14>is that the new thing?</v>

2767
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:28.740
<v Speaker 14>I feel like an old man.</v>

2768
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.300
<v Speaker 14>I would say it's definitely not the new thing.</v>

2769
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:31.591
<v Speaker 14>I do not see that.</v>

2770

2772
01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:36.590
<v Speaker 10>I didn't even know it existed.</v>

2773
01:20:36.591 --> 01:20:37.310
<v Speaker 10>Man.</v>

2774
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:38.143
<v Speaker 10>What'd you ever do that again?</v>

2775
01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:38.840
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 10>sure.</v>

2778
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:40.603
<v Speaker 10>It's a movement.</v>

2779
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.943
<v Speaker 10>Even in Austin.</v>

2780
01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.160
<v Speaker 10>If the rhythm gets me,</v>

2781
01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.890
<v Speaker 10>I might go and put on some fucking low stick thing,</v>

2782
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:48.800
<v Speaker 10>ease and dance like a motherfucker.</v>

2784
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:57.710
<v Speaker 10>that turned him into a gay sex and gambling act?</v>

2785
01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:01.280
<v Speaker 10>The court has upheld this ruling.</v>

2786
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:02.143
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

2787
01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.890
<v Speaker 10>The a ruling against the pharmaceutical giant Glasko Smith.</v>

2788
01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.920
<v Speaker 10>They had to pay 197,000 euros to a man who claimed that the drug used to treat</v>

2789
01:21:13.521 --> 01:21:14.660
<v Speaker 10>his Parkinson's,</v>

2790

2792
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.770
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2794
01:21:22.941 --> 01:21:24.520
<v Speaker 14>Was that 10 bucks that they had to pay?</v>

2795
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:25.150
<v Speaker 14>Oh,</v>

2796
01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:25.983
<v Speaker 14>I didn't do it.</v>

2797
01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:28.060
<v Speaker 14>$51,000</v>

2798
01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:34.030
<v Speaker 10>they paid him $151,000 how's that possible?</v>

2799
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:35.171
<v Speaker 10>I don't know,</v>

2800
01:21:35.171 --> 01:21:35.890
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

2801
01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.810
<v Speaker 10>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>

2802
01:21:38.050 --> 01:21:42.460
<v Speaker 10>So the guy said the drug made him addicted to internet gambling and caused him</v>

2803
01:21:42.461 --> 01:21:47.461
<v Speaker 10>to lose the family savings and steal to feed the habit that cost him 82,000</v>

2804
01:21:48.641 --> 01:21:49.474
<v Speaker 10>euros.</v>

2805
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:54.760
<v Speaker 10>Then he said he attempted suicide eight ten eight times and became a compulsive</v>

2806
01:21:54.761 --> 01:21:59.761
<v Speaker 10>gay sex addict exposing himself on the Internet and cross dressing is risky.</v>

2807
01:22:00.401 --> 01:22:03.010
<v Speaker 10>Sexual encounters led to him being raped.</v>

2808
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:07.570
<v Speaker 10>All that stopped when he ceased taking Requip.</v>

2809
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:09.370
<v Speaker 10>This is the stuff called Rep quip,</v>

2810
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.761
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2811
01:22:09.761 --> 01:22:14.350
<v Speaker 10>Quip Rec clip has been known for years to have undesired side effects,</v>

2812
01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.940
<v Speaker 10>but a warning only appeared on its package insert in 2006 the Lord said,</v>

2813
01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:19.571
<v Speaker 10>who is,</v>

2814
01:22:19.571 --> 01:22:24.040
<v Speaker 10>so this was in 2003 this guy was taking this stuff before the company admitted</v>

2815
01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:27.310
<v Speaker 10>that there's some horrific side effects with certain peeves,</v>

2816
01:22:27.311 --> 01:22:28.230
<v Speaker 10>engage juice in there.</v>

2817
01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:28.960
<v Speaker 10>So well,</v>

2818
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.793
<v Speaker 10>it's funny man.</v>

2819
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.390
<v Speaker 10>People are a series of,</v>

2820
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:32.940
<v Speaker 10>you know like the way your,</v>

2821
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:34.540
<v Speaker 10>your whole system works as he,</v>

2822
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.550
<v Speaker 10>there's a series of chemicals that interact with the body and everybody has a</v>

2823
01:22:39.551 --> 01:22:43.150
<v Speaker 10>different set up and we all know people who can't drink.</v>

2824
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:45.970
<v Speaker 10>We all know people you ever met anybody who can't eat peanuts.</v>

2825
01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:46.541
<v Speaker 10>This they,</v>

2826
01:22:46.541 --> 01:22:48.640
<v Speaker 10>those mother fuckers get nervous around peanuts.</v>

2827
01:22:48.641 --> 01:22:49.630
<v Speaker 10>Like they can't eat peanuts.</v>

2828
01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:49.821
<v Speaker 10>Third,</v>

2829
01:22:49.821 --> 01:22:50.980
<v Speaker 10>their throat would close up.</v>

2830
01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.620
<v Speaker 10>There's some people that like normal shit,</v>

2831
01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:54.700
<v Speaker 10>they're allergic to something.</v>

2832
01:22:54.701 --> 01:22:56.050
<v Speaker 10>A lot of people are alerted to wheat.</v>

2833
01:22:56.051 --> 01:22:59.440
<v Speaker 10>It turns out there's a lot of gluten out so the body's weird,</v>

2834
01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:04.330
<v Speaker 10>but I've never heard of something turning into a gay sex addict who was the</v>

2835
01:23:04.331 --> 01:23:07.780
<v Speaker 10>lawyer or the pharmaceutical company and like Earl shy or something like that.</v>

2836
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 10>Maybe this guy is just a really good liar.</v>

2837
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 10>Doesn't like to see his testimony please.</v>

2838
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.580
<v Speaker 10>If they paid,</v>

2839
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.110
<v Speaker 10>doesn't that kind of mean that?</v>

2840
01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:17.691
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

2841
01:23:17.691 --> 01:23:18.530
<v Speaker 10>it actually works.</v>

2842
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.410
<v Speaker 10>What means they were able to prove to the jury and what does that mean?</v>

2843
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:27.610
<v Speaker 10>I mean the jury's generally try to side with people.</v>

2844
01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:28.910
<v Speaker 10>I think when they would check,</v>

2845
01:23:28.911 --> 01:23:31.850
<v Speaker 10>can't pharmaceutical companies so the guy could just have it.</v>

2846
01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:33.820
<v Speaker 10>He could've got caught on this,</v>

2847
01:23:33.821 --> 01:23:38.821
<v Speaker 10>just mad fucking gay sex and gambling binge and his wife found out and she's</v>

2848
01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:39.851
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>

2849
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:41.320
<v Speaker 10>if you don't seek help,</v>

2850
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.680
<v Speaker 10>but they over and they cited something on in 2006 they out.</v>

2851
01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:46.930
<v Speaker 10>They admitted the side effects,</v>

2852
01:23:46.931 --> 01:23:47.800
<v Speaker 10>but that actually,</v>

2853
01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:48.371
<v Speaker 10>I have to admit,</v>

2854
01:23:48.371 --> 01:23:49.204
<v Speaker 10>don't they?</v>

2855
01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.800
<v Speaker 10>The actual side effects that happened.</v>

2856
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:51.311
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2857
01:23:51.311 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 10>I would assume it's not gay sex addict because that shit would have been out by</v>

2858
01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 10>now.</v>

2859
01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:59.290
<v Speaker 10>I would imagine that there's a lot of people that take this Parkinson's</v>

2860
01:23:59.291 --> 01:23:59.861
<v Speaker 10>medication.</v>

2861
01:23:59.861 --> 01:24:02.570
<v Speaker 10>If they all became crazy gay sex addict,</v>

2862
01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:03.404
<v Speaker 10>I just want to try it.</v>

2863
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.410
<v Speaker 10>That would be like a gay sex Voodoo drug.</v>

2864
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:09.610
<v Speaker 10>Could you imagine if you took some shit and it made you a gay sex addict?</v>

2865
01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.390
<v Speaker 10>Like if it was,</v>

2866
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Speaker 10>if this human sexuality was that manipulate manipulatable manipulable,</v>

2867
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:19.240
<v Speaker 10>if it was at that age you to manipulate where someone can actually add something</v>

2868
01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:22.620
<v Speaker 10>to your system and we'll turn you into a sex addict,</v>

2869
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.990
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>

2870
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:25.030
<v Speaker 10>that'd be so many gay dudes doing that.</v>

2871
01:24:25.031 --> 01:24:25.810
<v Speaker 10>Two straight guys.</v>

2872
01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:29.080
<v Speaker 10>What's funny is the CIA tried to do that in Iraq.</v>

2873
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.420
<v Speaker 10>They were trying to create a gay bomb.</v>

2874
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:33.010
<v Speaker 10>This is a true story.</v>

2875
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 10>They were,</v>

2876
01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:37.750
<v Speaker 10>they were trying to find out if it was possible to make something that could</v>

2877
01:24:37.751 --> 01:24:39.340
<v Speaker 10>blow up over the city.</v>

2878
01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:44.020
<v Speaker 10>It would rain down on these people and they would all fall in love with men and</v>

2879
01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:46.840
<v Speaker 10>it would kill their morale and they wouldn't want to fight anymore.</v>

2880
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.480
<v Speaker 10>And they would be ashamed and they would like,</v>

2881
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:51.250
<v Speaker 10>they would lose their ambition to fight.</v>

2882
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.250
<v Speaker 10>That's amazing.</v>

2883
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:55.001
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2884
01:24:55.001 --> 01:24:56.260
<v Speaker 10>it's really ridiculous too,</v>

2885
01:24:56.261 --> 01:24:57.094
<v Speaker 10>because the,</v>

2886
01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:02.130
<v Speaker 10>the greatest warriors in the history of humanity have been gay guys.</v>

2887
01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:05.020
<v Speaker 10>There's been a lot of gay sex and the Romans,</v>

2888
01:25:05.021 --> 01:25:06.970
<v Speaker 10>a lot of gay sex and the Greeks,</v>

2889
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.780
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

2890
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:12.780
<v Speaker 10>before North America ever even was populated with houses,</v>

2891
01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.930
<v Speaker 10>these guys were fucking people up with swords and banging each other in the ass.</v>

2892
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:22.150
<v Speaker 10>So they were the kings back then.</v>

2893
01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:27.010
<v Speaker 10>So the idea that you could drop a bomb on these Iraqis and then all of a sudden,</v>

2894
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:30.190
<v Speaker 10>other's butts acts would just be going off and no one,</v>

2895
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.800
<v Speaker 10>no one would feel like they would need to fight back.</v>

2896
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:35.320
<v Speaker 10>But if you turn them into like some crazy super warrior,</v>

2897
01:25:35.321 --> 01:25:36.580
<v Speaker 10>Greek homo gods,</v>

2898
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:40.450
<v Speaker 10>and they just all started fucking Americans up because they loved each other</v>

2899
01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:43.480
<v Speaker 10>because they're all gay sex in each other all day and they don't want,</v>

2900
01:25:43.481 --> 01:25:46.420
<v Speaker 10>they fight even harder because they don't want to lose their boyfriends.</v>

2901
01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:47.773
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2902
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:49.990
<v Speaker 10>They love going on the road.</v>

2903
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:51.103
<v Speaker 10>You know what I mean?</v>

2904
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:52.170
<v Speaker 10>Like for,</v>

2905
01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:53.170
<v Speaker 10>they're like camels.</v>

2906
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:53.860
<v Speaker 10>You don't need it.</v>

2907
01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:54.910
<v Speaker 10>They don't need any pussy.</v>

2908
01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:57.700
<v Speaker 10>That's a good way looking at it,</v>

2909
01:25:57.701 --> 01:25:58.030
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

2910
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:59.260
<v Speaker 10>They could just wander through the woods.</v>

2911
01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:00.220
<v Speaker 10>Imagine that Shit.</v>

2912
01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.053
<v Speaker 10>If they really could.</v>

2913
01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.800
<v Speaker 10>The CIA really was trying to do that.</v>

2914
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:03.763
<v Speaker 10>The</v>

2915
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.660
<v Speaker 1>CIA gay bomb.</v>

2916
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 1>If you just Google that,</v>

2917
01:26:07.281 --> 01:26:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that study.</v>

2918
01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:09.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2919
01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.040
<v Speaker 1>it's hilarious.</v>

2920
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Probably be best.</v>

2921
01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were running shit and Spain back in the conquistador days to get a</v>

2922
01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:18.170
<v Speaker 1>crew of nothing to gay dates,</v>

2923
01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:18.351
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2924
01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Because then you won't have to worry about them being,</v>

2925
01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I'll starve at the Saxon love,</v>

2926
01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:24.253
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2927
01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:24.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2928
01:26:24.591 --> 01:26:24.921
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2929
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2930
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:27.230
<v Speaker 1>the other thing they would do is,</v>

2931
01:26:27.231 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2932
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:32.830
<v Speaker 1>they would apparently the CIA would make a fake Islamic gay porn.</v>

2933
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:35.023
<v Speaker 1>They would like.</v>

2934
01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:35.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2935
01:26:35.721 --> 01:26:40.721
<v Speaker 1>they would organize the gay porn and make it like dudes it speaking Arabic.</v>

2936
01:26:41.391 --> 01:26:41.920
<v Speaker 1>So they fill,</v>

2937
01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:42.171
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2938
01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:45.010
<v Speaker 1>he goes to talks from Erin Burg than you know soccer's deck and he's going to</v>

2939
01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.920
<v Speaker 1>put in your ass and they would organize the show themselves.</v>

2940
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:51.350
<v Speaker 1>They would organize the gay porn shoots themselves.</v>

2941
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:52.790
<v Speaker 1>So then they would say,</v>

2942
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:53.091
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2943
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:54.770
<v Speaker 1>look at all this Islamic gay porn.</v>

2944
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So the CIA was making gay porn in order to make the other side look bad.</v>

2945
01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there were executive producing it or if they were like,</v>

2946
01:27:05.241 --> 01:27:06.074
<v Speaker 2>actually</v>

2947
01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.780
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to do this ourselves.</v>

2948
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.220
<v Speaker 2>We can't trust actors.</v>

2949
01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:11.900
<v Speaker 2>But what if they tell our story</v>

2950
01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:16.000
<v Speaker 1>and the government could lose its battle with the Islamic terrorists.</v>

2951
01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:16.541
<v Speaker 1>So listen,</v>

2952
01:27:16.541 --> 01:27:17.590
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to suck my dick.</v>

2953
01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to fuck you and ridiculous to him.</v>

2954
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Good ideas.</v>

2955
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Now I was in the CIA.</v>

2956
01:27:24.461 --> 01:27:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I'd be,</v>

2957
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:25.511
<v Speaker 2>I'll be out for,</v>

2958
01:27:25.511 --> 01:27:26.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pushing for that one.</v>

2959
01:27:26.411 --> 01:27:27.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll be voting for that one.</v>

2960
01:27:27.341 --> 01:27:28.174
<v Speaker 2>This would be funny.</v>

2961
01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Would you want to be in the CIA and Ma and be in the gay porn division?</v>

2962
01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.360
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think that would be?</v>

2963
01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:37.160
<v Speaker 1>How would you want to one the worst jobs?</v>

2964
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to be in the brainwash division.</v>

2965
01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Like all the different ways to brainwash people.</v>

2966
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I'd be fascinated with that.</v>

2967
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 1>They really did think that they were going to be able to do that in the 1990s.</v>

2968
01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:47.840
<v Speaker 1>They were uh,</v>

2969
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.340
<v Speaker 1>they spent a lot of money on this man.</v>

2970
01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:53.300
<v Speaker 1>The theory was that the bomb would release a chemical compound that would render</v>

2971
01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:57.650
<v Speaker 1>the opposing troops so irresistibly horny that instead of raising their rifles</v>

2972
01:27:57.651 --> 01:27:58.670
<v Speaker 1>to defend their nations,</v>

2973
01:27:58.671 --> 01:28:03.530
<v Speaker 1>they would turn ravenously gay and raise something else in [inaudible] and have</v>

2974
01:28:03.531 --> 01:28:05.090
<v Speaker 1>passionate sex with each other.</v>

2975
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Did it sounds like they figured it out.</v>

2976
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:08.143
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2977
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.100
<v Speaker 1>And as an added bonus,</v>

2978
01:28:10.101 --> 01:28:11.920
<v Speaker 1>the burst of gay sex would leave.</v>

2979
01:28:11.921 --> 01:28:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2980
01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.740
<v Speaker 2>The enemy troops in masculinity with shame.</v>

<v Speaker 2>understood.</v>

2999
01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:48.461
<v Speaker 1>Like the Sim man,</v>

3000
01:28:48.461 --> 01:28:49.520
<v Speaker 1>a man understands a man.</v>

3001
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Women pretend to understand men just to keep you around and sort of stare at you</v>

3002
01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:55.220
<v Speaker 1>and shake their head at you every now and then.</v>

01:28:55.221 --> 01:28:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause it disappointed.</v>

3004
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:57.470
<v Speaker 1>But it dude understands it.</v>

3005
01:28:57.471 --> 01:28:58.304
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3006
01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:01.100
<v Speaker 2>The smells of a guy being gay must be awful.</v>

3007
01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Being a gay person</v>

3008
01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:04.170
<v Speaker 1>in the daily smells you have to deal with.</v>

3009
01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't all bumped.</v>

3010
01:29:05.601 --> 01:29:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3011
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them just blow each other.</v>

3012
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:10.560
<v Speaker 1>So the smells would be pretty similar to what you're smelling already.</v>

3013
01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:10.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3014
01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>But when you're spinning up to your man at night and you just smell it,</v>

3015
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's going to be worse than a check.</v>

3016
01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

3017
01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Probably like really clean what it feel like a Vegan.</v>

3018
01:29:18.970 --> 01:29:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about bears guys know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh I know you get the clean one.</v>

3021
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:24.630
<v Speaker 1>This is that what you think you would get?</v>

3022
01:29:24.631 --> 01:29:28.590
<v Speaker 1>You'd get like a time sucker or Bert Kreischer but would you guys be like dual</v>

3023
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:29.790
<v Speaker 1>bears or would you,</v>

3024
01:29:29.791 --> 01:29:30.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3025
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:34.350
<v Speaker 1>would you like battle like those bears do when those open fields they start</v>

3026
01:29:34.351 --> 01:29:37.110
<v Speaker 1>pulling their hair out or would you just let them be the top bear?</v>

3027
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.453
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3028
01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:41.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question cause bear seem to always get along for a little while</v>

3029
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:44.970
<v Speaker 1>until there's some pussy around and then you see bears going off on each other</v>

3030
01:29:44.971 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 1>and brawl and in the fields.</v>

3031
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So is pussy that brings them to that.</v>

3032
01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:49.621
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3033
01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:49.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3034
01:29:49.831 --> 01:29:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there was no pussy involved,</v>

3035
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it was just a two dudes.</v>

3036
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:54.773
<v Speaker 1>Would that even,</v>

3037
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 1>would that even be an issue?</v>

3038
01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3039
01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe gay bears would be cool to like camp near hybrid net with them.</v>

3040
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Hibernate hybrid nut.</v>

3041

<v Speaker 1>I mean it happened that all over this man.</v>

3042
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.600
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to have a gay relationship,</v>

01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:10.950
<v Speaker 1>would you want a gay relationship with a bear type gay dude?</v>

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:07.773

3115
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:30.490

3116
01:32:30.491 --> 01:32:34.750
<v Speaker 10>if we're ever going to separate the idea of sex and making people.</v>

3117
01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.670
<v Speaker 10>Because if you look at,</v>

3118
01:32:36.671 --> 01:32:41.671
<v Speaker 10>like if you look at all the images that people claim to have seen like of these</v>

3122
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:47.560
<v Speaker 10>They have no organs that have no sex organs.</v>

3123
01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:48.870
<v Speaker 10>And you got to wonder man,</v>

3124
01:32:48.871 --> 01:32:49.150
<v Speaker 10>if,</v>

3125
01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:49.840
<v Speaker 10>if we,</v>

3126
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:54.190
<v Speaker 10>we keep fucking around with genetics and we keep fucking around with artificial</v>

3127
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:58.480
<v Speaker 10>scan and all this weird shit that's going on right now that they're there in the</v>

3128
01:32:58.481 --> 01:33:01.780
<v Speaker 10>middle of a experimenting with artificial cells,</v>

3129
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.770
<v Speaker 10>artificial.</v>

3130
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:05.440
<v Speaker 10>Adam's like all really strange.</v>

3131
01:33:05.441 --> 01:33:08.230
<v Speaker 10>I don't know if they could do artificial atoms but really strange shit.</v>

3132
01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.990
<v Speaker 10>And the idea is that one day,</v>

3133
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 10>what if they just say,</v>

3134
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:13.270
<v Speaker 10>listen,</v>

3135
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:14.770
<v Speaker 10>when we have sex,</v>

3136
01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:18.670
<v Speaker 10>we have these problems and there's a lot of emotions.</v>

3137
01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.250
<v Speaker 10>We've figured out a way to isolate those sayings,</v>

3138
01:33:21.251 --> 01:33:23.350
<v Speaker 10>feelings and you can get that with a pill.</v>

3139
01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.800
<v Speaker 10>And then we could just recreate people with like skin cells.</v>

3140
01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:30.430
<v Speaker 10>We can make you a person and you could raise that person and the person just</v>

3141
01:33:30.431 --> 01:33:30.850
<v Speaker 10>take a,</v>

3142
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:34.120
<v Speaker 10>take a skin cell from you and run it through a fucking computer.</v>

3143
01:33:34.121 --> 01:33:34.511
<v Speaker 10>What do you want?</v>

3144
01:33:34.511 --> 01:33:35.031
<v Speaker 10>You want a boy?</v>

3145
01:33:35.031 --> 01:33:35.864
<v Speaker 10>You want a girl?</v>

3146
01:33:35.970 --> 01:33:36.491
<v Speaker 10>It doesn't matter.</v>

3147
01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:41.110
<v Speaker 10>Everybody looks the same that he's got a deck and they'd come out and if we keep</v>

3148
01:33:41.111 --> 01:33:41.800
<v Speaker 10>going,</v>

3149
01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.210
<v Speaker 10>if the technology and the,</v>

3150
01:33:43.211 --> 01:33:43.591
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3151
01:33:43.591 --> 01:33:43.980
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3152
01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:46.870
<v Speaker 10>the symbiotic relationship that human beings have to it.</v>

3153
01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.070
<v Speaker 10>If that shit keeps going,</v>

3154
01:33:48.071 --> 01:33:49.450
<v Speaker 10>which it obviously it's going to,</v>

3155
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:52.380
<v Speaker 10>we're going to start fucking with the human body and we're,</v>

3156
01:33:52.381 --> 01:33:57.381
<v Speaker 10>we're certainly more likely to move away from monkey instincts and,</v>

3157
01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:58.920
<v Speaker 10>and the,</v>

3158
01:33:58.920 --> 01:33:59.231
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3159
01:33:59.231 --> 01:33:59.530
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3160
01:33:59.530 --> 01:34:03.490
<v Speaker 10>the certain needs that caused people to want to dominate others,</v>

3161
01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:04.740
<v Speaker 10>to want to fuck others,</v>

3162
01:34:04.770 --> 01:34:05.710
<v Speaker 10>to want to plant seeds.</v>

3163
01:34:05.710 --> 01:34:05.980
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>

3164
01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:06.460
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

3165
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:08.470
<v Speaker 10>if we really look at it all objectively,</v>

3166
01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 10>we might one day decide to slowly move away from that.</v>

3167
01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.360
<v Speaker 10>And it might take a few thousand years,</v>

3168
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:18.250
<v Speaker 10>but if it might get to a point where as a culture they recognize that these</v>

3169
01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 10>lustful feelings that we enjoy today and that motivate people to build buildings</v>

3170
01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:27.160
<v Speaker 10>and drive fast cars and fucking learn how to fly a jet.</v>

3171
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:29.710
<v Speaker 10>Those that might be,</v>

3172
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:31.120
<v Speaker 10>that might be a thing of the past.</v>

3173
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:35.920
<v Speaker 10>They might figure out a way to engineer human beings to the point where sex is</v>

3174
01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:37.450
<v Speaker 10>no longer part of the equation.</v>

3175
01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.060
<v Speaker 10>That's a real mind fuck man.</v>

3176
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:42.460
<v Speaker 10>If they come up with something that feels better than sex though,</v>

3177
01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:43.510
<v Speaker 10>it's totally possible.</v>

3178
01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.330
<v Speaker 10>They come up with some sort of an artificial reality,</v>

3179
01:34:46.331 --> 01:34:47.580
<v Speaker 10>some simulated thing,</v>

3180
01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:48.390
<v Speaker 10>some fucking</v>

3181
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:51.480
<v Speaker 4>or sex that you can eat sex that you could eat,</v>

3182
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:54.920
<v Speaker 4>like imagine something ambitious and it's it.</v>

3183
01:34:54.921 --> 01:34:56.340
<v Speaker 4>It fulfills your sexual flow.</v>

3184
01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:57.110
<v Speaker 4>The more you fuck,</v>

3185
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 4>the better it gets.</v>

3186
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:00.041
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>

3187
01:35:00.041 --> 01:35:00.861
<v Speaker 4>how many people out there?</v>

3188
01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:02.240
<v Speaker 4>I had zero sex drive,</v>

3189
01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.740
<v Speaker 4>like they just had a condition.</v>

3190
01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Zero sex drive.</v>

3191
01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:07.460
<v Speaker 4>They do not want to fuck ever.</v>

3192
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's quite a few.</v>

3193
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:10.040
<v Speaker 4>Who are those guys?</v>

3194
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:11.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's quite a few.</v>

3195
01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.270
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if if it's,</v>

3196
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:14.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3197
01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.150
<v Speaker 4>there's super happy people like that.</v>

3198
01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3199
01:35:18.650 --> 01:35:18.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3200
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Can you be super happy?</v>

3201
01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:20.720
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3202
01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:21.080
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

3203
01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Have like hobbies,</v>

3204
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:23.083
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3205
01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.200
<v Speaker 4>motivate you.</v>

3206
01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.660
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people are just not motivated by sex.</v>

3207
01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:27.111
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3208
01:35:27.111 --> 01:35:30.080
<v Speaker 4>I met a lot of people that are in relationships that don't have sex anymore.</v>

3209
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:32.390
<v Speaker 4>That's when it gets really weird and they tell you,</v>

3210
01:35:32.391 --> 01:35:32.571
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3211
01:35:32.571 --> 01:35:34.100
<v Speaker 4>we're like more friends than anything.</v>

3212
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:34.281
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3213
01:35:34.281 --> 01:35:35.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't even care anymore.</v>

3214
01:35:35.890 --> 01:35:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Like what I know.</v>

3215
01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:37.700
<v Speaker 4>And Dude,</v>

3216
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.690
<v Speaker 4>his wife had a baby,</v>

3217
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.320
<v Speaker 4>he had a hard time having getting some sex as it was.</v>

3218
01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:42.441
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3219
01:35:42.441 --> 01:35:45.050
<v Speaker 4>it was always the joke around the set.</v>

3220
01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:45.913
<v Speaker 4>We worked together.</v>

3221
01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:47.180
<v Speaker 4>It was always a joke around the set.</v>

3222
01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:47.481
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3223
01:35:47.481 --> 01:35:48.540
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about he can't get laid.</v>

3224
01:35:48.570 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would talk about this poor guy who couldn't get laid.</v>

3225
01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.640
<v Speaker 4>And then finally his wife had a kid.</v>

3226
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:57.850
<v Speaker 4>So I guess he got laid and she got pregnant and then she shut it off no more.</v>

3227
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.000
<v Speaker 4>And His kid is now three and he has had no sex with her since you got pregnant.</v>

3228
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:06.710
<v Speaker 4>And that's just madness.</v>

3229
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:07.131
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3230
01:36:07.131 --> 01:36:07.670
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

3231
01:36:07.670 --> 01:36:08.990
<v Speaker 4>how can I go live like that?</v>

3232
01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:09.821

<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3247
01:36:22.930 --> 01:36:25.760
<v Speaker 4>it's disrespectful to the baby or some kind of shit.</v>

3263
01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.850
<v Speaker 4>that's a bad situation for a guy to be in.</v>

3264
01:36:43.851 --> 01:36:44.684
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

3265
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:45.360
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

3266
01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.193
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

3267
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:51.610
<v Speaker 4>that guy is like a heroin addict that lives with a big fat Stasha heroines</v>

3268
01:36:52.521 --> 01:36:53.960
<v Speaker 4>sitting on the kitchen table,</v>

3269
01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3270
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.310
<v Speaker 4>it's all the,</v>

3271
01:36:56.311 --> 01:36:56.510
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3272
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:59.600
<v Speaker 4>all his needs could be sexually fulfilled by this other person.</v>

3273
01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.070
<v Speaker 4>But this other person's like,</v>

3274
01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:02.773
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

3275
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:03.763
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it.</v>

3276
01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:04.933
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do it.</v>

3277
01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:05.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3278
01:37:05.421 --> 01:37:08.070
<v Speaker 4>she does that then obviously that's good to hurt her.</v>

3279
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:09.680
<v Speaker 4>He said allowed to cheat.</v>

3280
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:10.220
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

3281
01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:10.760
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

3282
01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:10.921
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3283
01:37:10.921 --> 01:37:12.230
<v Speaker 4>he should get out of the relationship.</v>

3284
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:14.000
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad relationship.</v>

3285
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:15.140
<v Speaker 4>We're just don't bring it up around it.</v>

3286
01:37:15.141 --> 01:37:16.340
<v Speaker 4>And you've got a kid involved.</v>

3287
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3288
01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:17.960
<v Speaker 4>she'd probably be happy if he cheated.</v>

3289
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.741
<v Speaker 4>Get out of here,</v>

3290
01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:19.574
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

3291
01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:20.240
<v Speaker 4>Trying to fuck me.</v>

3292
01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had sex in three years.</v>

3293
01:37:21.381 --> 01:37:24.280
<v Speaker 4>Three years for 100% I wouldn't bullshit.</v>

3294
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:25.333
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't bullshit.</v>

3295
01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:27.293
<v Speaker 4>He's a good dude.</v>

3296
01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 4>He's a real good dude.</v>

3297
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:31.550
<v Speaker 4>Shit that went on the last three months.</v>

3298
01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:32.781
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3299
01:37:32.781 --> 01:37:34.280
<v Speaker 4>How long do you think you would last with,</v>

3300
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:36.680
<v Speaker 4>with a woman if she would refuse to have,</v>

3301
01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:36.860
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

3302
01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:37.550
<v Speaker 4>three months,</v>

3303
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:39.200
<v Speaker 4>but three months is a long time.</v>

3304
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:40.640
<v Speaker 4>What kind of reason she had?</v>

3305
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:43.240
<v Speaker 4>What was the reason you dig stank?</v>

3306
01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:46.701
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3307
01:37:46.701 --> 01:37:47.270
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

3308
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:48.350
<v Speaker 4>It would depend on the reason.</v>

3309
01:37:48.351 --> 01:37:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had did something wrong</v>

3310
01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 4>and if everything's fine and there's no sex for couple of weeks,</v>

3311
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3312
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.970
<v Speaker 1>would think something was wrong.</v>

3313
01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Like wait,</v>

3314
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:58.081
<v Speaker 1>there's two weeks,</v>

3315
01:37:58.081 --> 01:37:58.890
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

3316
01:37:58.890 --> 01:37:59.723
<v Speaker 1>Two weeks.</v>

3317
01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.410
<v Speaker 1>One week was ridiculous,</v>

3318
01:38:01.411 --> 01:38:02.244
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3319
01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:02.791
<v Speaker 1>two weeks.</v>

3320
01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:03.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just something's wrong.</v>

3321
01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3322
01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.660
<v Speaker 1>they just don't need it as much.</v>

3323
01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:08.123
<v Speaker 1>Some of them.</v>

3324
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Some of them needed more.</v>

3325
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 1>That's when shit gets annoying.</v>

3326
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are addicted to it.</v>

3327
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:14.580
<v Speaker 1>The worst is when your check once a fuck one you do and you're like,</v>

3328
01:38:14.581 --> 01:38:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

3329
01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I got shit to do.</v>

3330
01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3331
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you want another one?</v>

3332
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3333
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.070
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

3334
01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Can I just go to sleep?</v>

3335
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:22.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3336
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Those are in the early days.</v>

3337
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:24.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3338
01:38:24.241 --> 01:38:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of,</v>

3339
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.411
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3340
01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:26.790
<v Speaker 1>young people do that too,</v>

3341
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.590
<v Speaker 1>to sort of distract them from the,</v>

3342
01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:28.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3343
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the realities of life.</v>

3344
01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Life is just so fucking confusing when you're younger.</v>

3345
01:38:32.571 --> 01:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>You just want to escape and just fuck all the time and fall in love.</v>

3346
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.180
<v Speaker 7>I think they're just really,</v>

3347
01:38:36.181 --> 01:38:38.550
<v Speaker 7>really hydrated and the need to get that shit out of them.</v>

3348
01:38:40.890 --> 01:38:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it that I can't see your face.</v>

3349
01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:45.810
<v Speaker 1>You were going to move this screen.</v>

3350
01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.310
<v Speaker 1>No more of this.</v>

3351
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:49.170
<v Speaker 1>You're hiding behind their throwing shit.</v>

3352
01:38:49.171 --> 01:38:50.004
<v Speaker 1>Balls,</v>

3353
01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:55.573
<v Speaker 7>bunker.</v>

3354
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.601
<v Speaker 7>It's fun,</v>

3355
01:38:56.601 --> 01:38:58.790
<v Speaker 7>but it's also quite a conversation killer.</v>

3356
01:38:58.791 --> 01:38:59.624
<v Speaker 7>You're fuck</v>

3357
01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:01.480
<v Speaker 1>occasionally they worked though.</v>

3358
01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:02.471
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally.</v>

3359
01:39:02.471 --> 01:39:03.304
<v Speaker 1>They're really good.</v>

3360
01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:06.200
<v Speaker 1>My ex was a squirter and that's what I was saying.</v>

3361
01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:06.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3362
01:39:06.471 --> 01:39:07.370
<v Speaker 1>that shits nasty.</v>

3363
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

3364
01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of girls like Dana Deanna and she says that's just pissed.</v>

3365
01:39:11.630 --> 01:39:12.463
<v Speaker 1>She's the line.</v>

3366
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:13.670
<v Speaker 1>But she's a girl,</v>

3367
01:39:13.671 --> 01:39:14.110
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3368
01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I can you say she knows what's up.</v>

3369
01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Squirt in the girl's pissing all over you son snap pics.</v>

3370
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:21.200
<v Speaker 1>It has a piss smell type smell to it.</v>

3371
01:39:21.201 --> 01:39:23.720
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think as long as it has a piss type smelling,</v>

3372
01:39:23.721 --> 01:39:26.690
<v Speaker 1>that probably precludes the possibility of it being pissed.</v>

3373
01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:27.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3374
01:39:27.231 --> 01:39:29.360
<v Speaker 1>why would it be pissed if it had a piss like smell?</v>

3375
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we need to get the point drew in here.</v>

3376
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3377
01:39:31.551 --> 01:39:32.181
<v Speaker 1>Dr Drew,</v>

3378
01:39:32.181 --> 01:39:35.660
<v Speaker 1>it has no information that's accurate about marijuana.</v>

3379
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:37.490
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do you think he would tell you that?</v>

3380
01:39:39.130 --> 01:39:39.350
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

3381
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:41.550
<v Speaker 7>Do you still have your going off all of the information to his show?</v>

3382
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:42.611
<v Speaker 7>I would definitely do it.</v>

3383
01:39:42.611 --> 01:39:42.731
<v Speaker 7>Should.</v>

3384
01:39:42.731 --> 01:39:44.740
<v Speaker 7>You would think that he probably wouldn't want no,</v>

3385
01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:44.930
<v Speaker 7>she,</v>

3386
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:45.241
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>

3387
01:39:45.241 --> 01:39:45.991
<v Speaker 7>I've never said anything.</v>

3388
01:39:45.991 --> 01:39:46.030
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3389
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.990
<v Speaker 1>well that's not true.</v>

3390
01:39:47.490 --> 01:39:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3391
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:51.980
<v Speaker 1>he's done some silly things when it came to marijuana and the silliest thing is</v>

3392
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.541
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

3393
01:39:52.541 --> 01:39:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And he says on a CNN show about these horrible,</v>

3394
01:39:55.421 --> 01:39:59.680
<v Speaker 1>a addictive withdrawals that people have and the withdrawal symptoms that people</v>

3395
01:39:59.681 --> 01:40:00.580
<v Speaker 1>have for marijuana.</v>

3396
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:02.170
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3397
01:40:02.171 --> 01:40:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And he knows it.</v>

3398
01:40:03.011 --> 01:40:05.140
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking crazy.</v>

3399
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:10.470
<v Speaker 1>The people who have any physical withdrawal from marijuana are extremely rare</v>

3400
01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.920
<v Speaker 7>shrimi way.</v>

3401
01:40:13.930 --> 01:40:14.231
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

3402
01:40:14.231 --> 01:40:14.870
<v Speaker 7>I could get,</v>

3403
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:15.221
<v Speaker 7>get,</v>

3404
01:40:15.221 --> 01:40:18.880
<v Speaker 7>get we've away from Joey Diaz that he would probably go through physical</v>

3405
01:40:18.881 --> 01:40:19.600
<v Speaker 7>withdrawals.</v>

3406
01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:20.433
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>

3407
01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:20.930
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

3408
01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:22.270
<v Speaker 7>He takes days off a week,</v>

3409
01:40:22.271 --> 01:40:22.601
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3410
01:40:22.601 --> 01:40:23.950
<v Speaker 7>It's not a physical thing.</v>

3411
01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:25.710
<v Speaker 7>Joey likes to be high for sure.</v>

3412
01:40:25.711 --> 01:40:25.860
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3413
01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:29.100
<v Speaker 1>definitely add medicating or whatever the fuck he has,</v>

3414
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.851
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3415
01:40:29.851 --> 01:40:31.410
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about the dude.</v>

3416
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:32.383
<v Speaker 1>He could not,</v>

3417
01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.660
<v Speaker 1>he would get annoyed with you.</v>

3418
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:34.171
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3419
01:40:34.171 --> 01:40:35.400
<v Speaker 1>He would want to be high again,</v>

3420
01:40:35.401 --> 01:40:38.490
<v Speaker 1>but physically his body would not be addicted to it.</v>

3421
01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's where withdrawal syndrome,</v>

3422
01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.750
<v Speaker 7>you're probably sweating at night.</v>

3423
01:40:41.751 --> 01:40:42.170
<v Speaker 7>I think.</v>

3424
01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:43.370
<v Speaker 7>I just see him maybe</v>

3425
01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:44.240
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

3426
01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:44.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3427
01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3428
01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:45.071
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3429
01:40:45.071 --> 01:40:47.080
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that get addicted to toothpaste.</v>

3430
01:40:47.081 --> 01:40:47.321
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3431
01:40:47.321 --> 01:40:48.880
<v Speaker 1>There's people that get addicted to everything.</v>

3432
01:40:49.150 --> 01:40:51.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness in the world of addictions.</v>

3433
01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>But to say that it's one of the more dangerous</v>

3434
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.920
<v Speaker 10>drugs and then there's like dangerous withdrawal syndromes.</v>

3435
01:40:57.070 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 10>That's nonsense and knows it's not the gateway theory,</v>

3436
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:02.110
<v Speaker 10>there's no connection,</v>

3437
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:06.010
<v Speaker 10>there's no connection in marijuana physically to addiction.</v>

3438
01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:10.300
<v Speaker 10>It's not like opiates where there's an established connection of addiction.</v>

3439
01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:10.630
<v Speaker 10>The,</v>

3440
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:15.630
<v Speaker 10>there's no chemical established like connection of addiction to marijuana.</v>

3441
01:41:15.881 --> 01:41:20.000
<v Speaker 10>It's not something that like Rob's your brain of dopamine and then you need it</v>

3442
01:41:20.001 --> 01:41:20.621
<v Speaker 10>to like read,</v>

3443
01:41:20.621 --> 01:41:21.730
<v Speaker 10>get your high again.</v>

3444
01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:22.900
<v Speaker 10>It doesn't work that way.</v>

3445
01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:23.200
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

3446
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.560
<v Speaker 10>So for someone that discounts it and then the other problem is they,</v>

3447
01:41:27.561 --> 01:41:28.060
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>

3448
01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.020
<v Speaker 10>they belittle it.</v>

3449
01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:29.441
<v Speaker 10>They say,</v>

3450
01:41:29.441 --> 01:41:30.131
<v Speaker 10>well look,</v>

3451
01:41:30.131 --> 01:41:30.941
<v Speaker 10>Hey I'm,</v>

3452
01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:31.780
<v Speaker 10>I'm all for it.</v>

3453
01:41:31.781 --> 01:41:32.261
<v Speaker 10>You want out?</v>

3454
01:41:32.261 --> 01:41:33.130
<v Speaker 10>Smoke your pot.</v>

3455
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:34.510
<v Speaker 10>Go ahead and smoke your pot.</v>

3456
01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:35.500
<v Speaker 10>That's what you want to do.</v>

3457
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:36.820
<v Speaker 10>Some people like to drink,</v>

3458
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.260
<v Speaker 10>some people like to smoke pot.</v>

3459
01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:43.420
<v Speaker 10>And the problem with that is that they're talking from a non experienced point</v>

3460
01:41:43.421 --> 01:41:43.810
<v Speaker 10>of view.</v>

3461
01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:47.290
<v Speaker 10>They're not a person who has had any psychedelic experiences and they're not a</v>

3462
01:41:47.291 --> 01:41:50.680
<v Speaker 10>person who has had any cannabis experiences that were enlightening.</v>

3463
01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:55.360
<v Speaker 10>And you and I both have had some crazy experiences eating and smoking at</v>

3464
01:41:55.361 --> 01:42:00.070
<v Speaker 10>whatever where we broke down some certain aspect of our life and change things</v>

3465
01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:03.550
<v Speaker 10>and looked at things in a different way and created things.</v>

3466
01:42:03.570 --> 01:42:06.520
<v Speaker 10>And music has come from it and ideas have come from it.</v>

3467
01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:08.770
<v Speaker 10>And then an understanding of yourself comes from it.</v>

3468
01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:11.920
<v Speaker 10>And to discount that is ignorance.</v>

3469
01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:14.590
<v Speaker 10>Especially if you haven't experienced it and you,</v>

3470
01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:18.640
<v Speaker 10>you are dealing with a broken group of people.</v>

3471
01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.390
<v Speaker 10>You're dealing primarily with people that come to someone when shit is fallen</v>

3472
01:42:22.391 --> 01:42:23.110
<v Speaker 10>apart.</v>

3473
01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:23.591
<v Speaker 10>But guess what?</v>

3474
01:42:23.591 --> 01:42:25.330
<v Speaker 10>There's a lot of people that aren't falling apart.</v>

3475
01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.650
<v Speaker 10>It's not the same drug as all these drugs that people are taking when a</v>

3476
01:42:30.651 --> 01:42:33.610
<v Speaker 10>scratching their face off and you can't call it a drug.</v>

3477
01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:35.530
<v Speaker 10>You cannot call it a drug because there's,</v>

3478
01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:36.940
<v Speaker 10>there's no meth advocates,</v>

3479
01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:38.020
<v Speaker 10>there's no people,</v>

3480
01:42:38.021 --> 01:42:38.231
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3481
01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:38.890
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3482
01:42:38.890 --> 01:42:41.830
<v Speaker 10>trying to tell you that you just get a little crystal and you're going to get</v>

3483
01:42:41.831 --> 01:42:42.700
<v Speaker 10>your life in order.</v>

3484
01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:43.600
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

3485
01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.080
<v Speaker 10>get a little crystal and change your perspective cause man,</v>

3486
01:42:47.110 --> 01:42:49.750
<v Speaker 10>why don't you just look at things in a fresh manner,</v>

3487
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:50.231
<v Speaker 10>broach,</v>

3488
01:42:50.231 --> 01:42:52.630
<v Speaker 10>get a little crystal in your system and then listen to this song.</v>

3489
01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:53.730
<v Speaker 10>Math magazines</v>

3490
01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:59.290
<v Speaker 10>when they show have posters of like the pinups of the crystal up close.</v>

3491
01:42:59.300 --> 01:42:59.920
<v Speaker 10>So you shit,</v>

3492
01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.753
<v Speaker 10>oh this is,</v>

3493
01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:01.720
<v Speaker 10>this is ice.</v>

3494
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:02.351
<v Speaker 10>Oh Shit.</v>

3495
01:43:02.351 --> 01:43:03.910
<v Speaker 10>This is the shit from breaking bad.</v>

3496
01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:08.380
<v Speaker 10>This is the shit that the chemicals make the um,</v>

3497
01:43:08.410 --> 01:43:11.620
<v Speaker 10>the photos and the high times and all those things are so hilarious.</v>

3498
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:13.150
<v Speaker 10>They have like pinups of weed.</v>

3499
01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:13.901
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3500
01:43:13.901 --> 01:43:14.740
<v Speaker 10>I never got that.</v>

3501
01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:15.471
<v Speaker 10>That's ridiculous.</v>

3502
01:43:15.471 --> 01:43:16.001
<v Speaker 10>I love weed,</v>

3503
01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:16.420
<v Speaker 10>you know that.</v>

3504
01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:18.970
<v Speaker 10>But I've never been into wheat so much where I'm going to put up a pinup of</v>

3505
01:43:18.971 --> 01:43:19.630
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>

3506
01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:20.140
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3507
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:21.310
<v Speaker 10>purple haze or some shit.</v>

3508
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:22.600
<v Speaker 10>It really is beautiful.</v>

3509
01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.440
<v Speaker 10>I can't wait until it becomes legal because when it becomes legal,</v>

3510
01:43:26.441 --> 01:43:27.580
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to start eating it.</v>

3511
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:29.680
<v Speaker 10>And I don't even mean to get you high.</v>

3512
01:43:29.681 --> 01:43:31.030
<v Speaker 10>I mean eating it raw,</v>

3513
01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:31.871
<v Speaker 10>which by the way,</v>

3514
01:43:31.871 --> 01:43:32.860
<v Speaker 10>it can't get you high.</v>

3515
01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:38.130
<v Speaker 10>But apparently it's super nutritious like marijuana and the seeds and like</v>

3516
01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.130
<v Speaker 10>eating it raw.</v>

3517
01:43:39.490 --> 01:43:40.430
<v Speaker 10>Apparently bud,</v>

3518
01:43:40.431 --> 01:43:41.660
<v Speaker 10>like the mud,</v>

3519
01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.340
<v Speaker 10>the leaves,</v>

3520
01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:43.060
<v Speaker 10>all that Shit.</v>

3521
01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:43.380
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

3522
01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:43.810
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

3523
01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:45.070
<v Speaker 10>You just pluck it off the stem.</v>

3524
01:43:45.071 --> 01:43:46.030
<v Speaker 10>You don't eat the stems,</v>

3525
01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:49.450
<v Speaker 10>but all those leaves and shit apparently it's like really nutritious.</v>

3526
01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.190
<v Speaker 10>Apparently eating marijuana,</v>

3527
01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 10>it's like super good</v>

3528
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.180
<v Speaker 4>for you and it doesn't get you high at all.</v>

3529
01:43:53.181 --> 01:43:55.730
<v Speaker 4>You could juice it really good for you if you juice it.</v>

3530
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:58.190
<v Speaker 4>It's just so many different personalities.</v>

3531
01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:59.121
<v Speaker 4>It's almost,</v>

3532
01:43:59.121 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 4>it's almost seems like a joke when you start talking about all the different</v>

3533
01:44:01.941 --> 01:44:02.780
<v Speaker 4>things that it can do.</v>

3534
01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:03.411
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3535
01:44:03.411 --> 01:44:03.771
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

3536
01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:05.090
<v Speaker 4>If it could do all those things,</v>

3537
01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:05.990
<v Speaker 4>let's be realistic.</v>

3538
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:06.853
<v Speaker 4>It would be legal.</v>

3539
01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:07.190
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

3540
01:44:07.190 --> 01:44:08.300
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't even make any sense,</v>

3541
01:44:08.610 --> 01:44:09.980
<v Speaker 4>but you find out you can eat it.</v>

3542
01:44:09.981 --> 01:44:11.210
<v Speaker 4>You can make houses out of it,</v>

3543
01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:11.581
<v Speaker 4>like why?</v>

3544
01:44:11.581 --> 01:44:12.321
<v Speaker 4>It's what,</v>

3545
01:44:12.321 --> 01:44:12.950
<v Speaker 4>what else?</v>

3546
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:15.350
<v Speaker 4>What gets you high and you can make houses out of it.</v>

3547
01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:16.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3548
01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:18.470
<v Speaker 4>Henry Ford made the first fucking car out of it,</v>

3549
01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.030
<v Speaker 4>the first fucking car,</v>

3550
01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:22.280
<v Speaker 4>the fenders of the car,</v>

3551
01:44:22.281 --> 01:44:23.810
<v Speaker 4>the body of the car was made out of hemp.</v>

3552
01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.120
<v Speaker 4>That's how much they respected.</v>

3553
01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:27.320
<v Speaker 4>The drug thing is ridiculous too,</v>

3554
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:29.600
<v Speaker 4>because 95% of all the stoners,</v>

3555
01:44:29.601 --> 01:44:31.280
<v Speaker 4>I know they don't do heroin or Meth,</v>

3556
01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:32.300
<v Speaker 4>they just smoke weed.</v>

3557
01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.530
<v Speaker 4>If it was a gateway drug,</v>

3558
01:44:33.531 --> 01:44:37.100
<v Speaker 4>that'd be a big problem with all my friends with math and heroin,</v>

3559
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:38.001
<v Speaker 4>there's not a problem.</v>

3560
01:44:38.001 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 4>The whole gateway thing is all bullshit.</v>

3561
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.870
<v Speaker 4>They're going to,</v>

3562
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:44.810
<v Speaker 4>they're going to find the a way to stop people from smoking weed.</v>

3563
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:48.350
<v Speaker 4>And what they're going to do is they're going to mix up that shit from that</v>

3564
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:49.580
<v Speaker 4>Parkinson's medication.</v>

3565
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:54.740
<v Speaker 4>They're going to get into the weeds supply and everybody's going to go gay bomb</v>

3566
01:44:54.741 --> 01:44:55.221
<v Speaker 4>with the week.</v>

3567
01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:55.360
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3568
01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 4>with Colorado,</v>

3569
01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:56.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3570
01:44:56.731 --> 01:44:57.171
<v Speaker 4>you hear,</v>

3571
01:44:57.171 --> 01:44:58.920
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about this about a week ago,</v>

3572
01:44:58.921 --> 01:45:02.540
<v Speaker 4>that they had one of the worst economies in the state and now with,</v>

3573
01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.970
<v Speaker 4>with we that one of the best in the states.</v>

3574
01:45:04.971 --> 01:45:05.804
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3575
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:06.710
<v Speaker 4>that's what I was told.</v>

3576
01:45:06.711 --> 01:45:07.401
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's true,</v>

3577
01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:07.640
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

3578
01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.630
<v Speaker 4>that's the metal that doesn't seem like they would,</v>

3579
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:10.191
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

3580
01:45:10.191 --> 01:45:10.461
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3581
01:45:10.461 --> 01:45:10.730
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

3582
01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:11.320
<v Speaker 4>let's look,</v>

3583
01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:11.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3584
01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.120
<v Speaker 4>economic impact in Colorado,</v>

3585
01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.400
<v Speaker 4>unless I was told total bullshit.</v>

3586
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:16.911
<v Speaker 4>And it could be,</v>

3587
01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:17.270
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3588
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:18.350
<v Speaker 4>that sounds like one of those,</v>

3589
01:45:18.351 --> 01:45:19.040
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3590
01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:24.040
<v Speaker 4>they were ready to totally close the state and quit being a state and then we'd</v>

3591
01:45:24.501 --> 01:45:27.860
<v Speaker 4>came along and now they're rich San hazing.</v>

3592
01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:28.131
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3593
01:45:28.131 --> 01:45:29.000
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like quite like,</v>

3594
01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:29.571
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3595
01:45:29.571 --> 01:45:30.080
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3596
01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.640
<v Speaker 4>I have weed in Colorado.</v>

3597
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:32.803
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3598
01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 4>If that's true,</v>

3599
01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.580
<v Speaker 4>isn't that I should write Merrill's and that's something that would influence</v>

3600
01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:38.690
<v Speaker 4>other states if it did that,</v>

3601
01:45:38.691 --> 01:45:40.490
<v Speaker 4>if it completely turned their economy around,</v>

3602
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:43.040
<v Speaker 4>the real issue is the problem that dummies get to vote.</v>

3603
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:45.890
<v Speaker 4>That's the real problem.</v>

3604
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:48.680
<v Speaker 4>The real problem is dummies get the vote and a lot of dummies have these like</v>

3605
01:45:48.681 --> 01:45:50.870
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalist ideas about it and they just,</v>

3606
01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:52.970
<v Speaker 4>they just can't accept the fact that first of all,</v>

3607
01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.070
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>

3608
01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:55.911
<v Speaker 4>I'm a grown man.</v>

3609
01:45:55.911 --> 01:45:56.744
<v Speaker 4>You're a grown man.</v>

3610
01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:58.070
<v Speaker 4>Just cause you believe in,</v>

3611
01:45:58.071 --> 01:45:58.904
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3612
01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.153
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3613
01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:03.050
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean you can stop me from doing what I want to do if it doesn't hurt</v>

3614
01:46:03.051 --> 01:46:03.884
<v Speaker 4>anybody else.</v>

3615
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.641
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

3616
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:07.130
<v Speaker 4>that right away as a problem because not everybody agrees with that.</v>

3617
01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:07.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

3618
01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:09.260
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of fucking dummies.</v>

3619
01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:10.520
<v Speaker 4>It's dummy's get the vote.</v>

3620
01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:11.840
<v Speaker 4>But how many,</v>

3621
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.840
<v Speaker 4>how many states have medical marijuana now?</v>

3622
01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:18.930
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's a 16 or something like that.</v>

3623
01:46:18.931 --> 01:46:20.510
<v Speaker 4>And now they just made,</v>

3624
01:46:20.511 --> 01:46:20.930
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3625
01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:22.940
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts just got through.</v>

3626
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:24.380
<v Speaker 4>Can you find that out Brian?</v>

3627
01:46:24.381 --> 01:46:26.350
<v Speaker 4>How many states are medical marijuana?</v>

3628
01:46:26.351 --> 01:46:27.320
<v Speaker 4>Cause it was 13,</v>

3629
01:46:27.321 --> 01:46:29.210
<v Speaker 4>like it seemed like eight years ago.</v>

3630
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.520
<v Speaker 4>And like now,</v>

3631
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:33.223
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

3632
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:34.220
<v Speaker 4>you didn't want to do that?</v>

3633
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.500
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3634
01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:38.120
<v Speaker 4>the Internet's not working on that,</v>

3635
01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:39.200
<v Speaker 4>this laptop very well,</v>

3636
01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:40.730
<v Speaker 4>so I'm sure really fuck anything up.</v>

3637
01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:41.690
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3638
01:46:41.690 --> 01:46:43.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm using my phone just to look at Twitter and there.</v>

3639
01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.031
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

3640
01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:45.230
<v Speaker 4>well let's assume it's a lot.</v>

3641
01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:47.030
<v Speaker 4>Let's say I think it's like 16,</v>

3642
01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:48.051
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

3643
01:46:48.051 --> 01:46:48.884
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3644
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:49.783
<v Speaker 4>I think that</v>

3645
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.770
<v Speaker 10>eventually the,</v>

3646
01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:52.070
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3647
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:53.670
<v Speaker 10>the Washington state's and the,</v>

3648
01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.580
<v Speaker 10>the Colorados two places 18.</v>

3649
01:46:56.581 --> 01:46:57.270
<v Speaker 10>Wow.</v>

3650
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.451
<v Speaker 10>The,</v>

3651
01:46:57.451 --> 01:47:00.660
<v Speaker 10>the two states that made it legal,</v>

3652
01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:01.050
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

3653
01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:04.080
<v Speaker 10>what's going to be really interesting to see is what happens from here.</v>

3654
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:08.100
<v Speaker 10>Because if the federal government still decides to fuck with them,</v>

3655
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:08.934
<v Speaker 10>they can.</v>

3656
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Speaker 10>And that's where it gets really strange.</v>

3657
01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:11.910
<v Speaker 10>So if these people start up legitimate,</v>

3658
01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:14.520
<v Speaker 10>we'd stores that are legitimate under their state law,</v>

3659
01:47:14.670 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 10>just like liquor stores pay their pay,</v>

3660
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:17.760
<v Speaker 10>their taxes and all that shit.</v>

3661
01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.540
<v Speaker 10>Does the government come down on them because they can't if they want and they</v>

3662
01:47:21.541 --> 01:47:22.410
<v Speaker 10>have before.</v>

3663
01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.430
<v Speaker 10>There's a case of a guy from Montana and it's a,</v>

3664
01:47:26.431 --> 01:47:30.240
<v Speaker 10>he's becoming a big martyr once people found out about it on the Internet,</v>

3665
01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:33.480
<v Speaker 10>cause this guy regularly had law enforcement from state law enforcement.</v>

3666
01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.970
<v Speaker 10>He invited them on tours of his grow up.</v>

3667
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:37.410
<v Speaker 10>He did everything legit.</v>

3668
01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:40.020
<v Speaker 10>Everything by the book checked double checked with everybody,</v>

3669
01:47:40.021 --> 01:47:41.610
<v Speaker 10>follow the state law to a t.</v>

3670
01:47:41.850 --> 01:47:45.420
<v Speaker 10>But the government came in and arrested him under federal laws.</v>

3671
01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:48.840
<v Speaker 10>They wouldn't even let him use the term medical marijuana because it doesn't</v>

3672
01:47:48.841 --> 01:47:49.800
<v Speaker 10>exist federally.</v>

3673
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.060
<v Speaker 10>So this guy's looking at 80 years in prison and this guy did everything correct.</v>

3674
01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:57.480
<v Speaker 10>That's where it gets Montana.</v>

3675
01:47:57.990 --> 01:48:00.030
<v Speaker 10>That's where it gets really fucking squirrely.</v>

3676
01:48:00.031 --> 01:48:00.864
<v Speaker 10>Because look,</v>

3677
01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:04.680
<v Speaker 10>when there's a guy who's not hurting anybody and he's giving someone something</v>

3678
01:48:04.681 --> 01:48:09.300
<v Speaker 10>that should be legal in your area because the people voted on it.</v>

3679
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.790
<v Speaker 10>If you want to lock that guy up,</v>

3680
01:48:11.970 --> 01:48:12.391
<v Speaker 10>your,</v>

3681
01:48:12.391 --> 01:48:14.460
<v Speaker 10>the criminal and that,</v>

3682
01:48:14.461 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

3683
01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:15.923
<v Speaker 10>that's uh,</v>

3684
01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:21.080
<v Speaker 10>that's an important point to make in this society that just because someone</v>

3685
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:27.620
<v Speaker 10>wrote some shit down on paper and you can interpret it in a way that you decide</v>

3686

<v Speaker 10>anyone any danger and he puts him in jail for 80 fucking years for selling happy</v>

<v Speaker 10>That's someone who we have to pay.</v>

3694
01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.480
<v Speaker 10>We pay them tax dollars and they arrest people who aren't hurting anyone.</v>

3695
01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:51.030
<v Speaker 10>You're telling me there was another shit you guys could have done.</v>

3696
01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:53.220
<v Speaker 10>You're telling me those cops that arrested that guy,</v>

3697
01:48:53.230 --> 01:48:58.230
<v Speaker 10>they couldn't have been like busting burglaries or burglar or leaves or uh,</v>

<v Speaker 10>Why the fuck are they going after this guy who keeps having cops and law</v>

3701
01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:12.300
<v Speaker 10>enforcement and mayors over his property to show them his grow up because</v>

3702
01:49:12.301 --> 01:49:16.140
<v Speaker 10>everything's done under state law and paying his taxes because there's a bunch</v>

3703
01:49:16.141 --> 01:49:17.460
<v Speaker 10>of criminals in government,</v>

3704
01:49:17.461 --> 01:49:18.294
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>

3705
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:20.040
<v Speaker 10>the actual government itself,</v>

3706
01:49:20.041 --> 01:49:23.310
<v Speaker 10>it's filled with criminals and they think that they're allowed to do it because</v>

3707
01:49:23.311 --> 01:49:24.900
<v Speaker 10>it's written down somewhere.</v>

3708
01:49:25.150 --> 01:49:26.190
<v Speaker 10>It's a federal law.</v>

3709
01:49:26.191 --> 01:49:29.230
<v Speaker 10>The federal law against marijuana has been the same since</v>

3710
01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:33.480
<v Speaker 10>federal government to change its position.</v>

3711
01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:36.030
<v Speaker 10>The federal government doesn't change his position.</v>

3712
01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.620
<v Speaker 10>That's whole Harris.</v>

3713

<v Speaker 10>That is one thing.</v>

3716
01:49:41.431 --> 01:49:45.000
<v Speaker 10>I mean there's anything that makes the government out to be horse.</v>

3717
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 10>It's their stance on marijuana.</v>

3718
01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:47.441
<v Speaker 10>It's one of the,</v>

3719
01:49:47.441 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 10>one of the biggest</v>

3720
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:53.130
<v Speaker 1>whore like stances because scientists should have long ago convinced politicians</v>

3721
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:58.030
<v Speaker 1>that there's massive benefit to this country if we grow this stuff,</v>

3722
01:49:58.180 --> 01:49:58.961
<v Speaker 1>if we grow it,</v>

3723
01:49:58.961 --> 01:49:59.800
<v Speaker 1>if we sell it,</v>

3724
01:49:59.801 --> 01:50:00.160
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3725
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.600
<v Speaker 1>it's cultural benefit.</v>

3726
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:06.280
<v Speaker 1>There's artistic benefit and then there's farmers benefiting financially,</v>

3727
01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:07.750
<v Speaker 1>not just by selling the drug,</v>

3728
01:50:07.751 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 1>but by selling the hamp and all this shit.</v>

3729
01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:14.770
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the kind of fucking law enforcement we have here.</v>

3783
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3784
01:51:33.291 --> 01:51:35.540
<v Speaker 2>the government is like the neighborhood whore,</v>

01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:37.213
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3787
01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.150
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3788
01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:41.300
<v Speaker 2>if she gets accused of boning your friend Tommy,</v>

3789

<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3790

<v Speaker 2>it's probably happened.</v>

3792
01:51:43.401 --> 01:51:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Even if it didn't happen,</v>

01:51:46.670 --> 01:51:48.800
<v Speaker 1>The actual hidden footage,</v>

3796
01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.090
<v Speaker 1>no airplane.</v>

3797
01:51:50.091 --> 01:51:53.480
<v Speaker 1>This was October of 2012 so that must be the new shit,</v>

3798
01:51:53.481 --> 01:51:53.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3799
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Only 992 views.</v>

3800
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I would think it was around for like more than a month.</v>

3801
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:59.960
<v Speaker 1>More than a thousand people.</v>

3802
01:51:59.961 --> 01:52:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3803
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:02.010
<v Speaker 2>So maybe there's a bunch of videos like that.</v>

3804
01:52:02.011 --> 01:52:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they made copies.</v>

3805
01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:04.391
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3806
01:52:04.391 --> 01:52:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what happens here.</v>

3807
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3808
01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:11.351
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

3809
01:52:11.351 --> 01:52:12.250
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to tell.</v>

3810
01:52:13.690 --> 01:52:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3811
01:52:14.290 --> 01:52:15.370
<v Speaker 1>it looks like,</v>

3812
01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:16.811
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3813
01:52:16.811 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Speaker 1>it's way in the distance and it's really blurry as fuck.</v>

3814
01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is like a security camera,</v>

3815
01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:27.820
<v Speaker 1>but it actually does look like someone flies in there.</v>

3816
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:29.380
<v Speaker 1>It actually does,</v>

3817
01:52:29.381 --> 01:52:29.930

3819
01:52:32.170 --> 01:52:32.800

<v Speaker 1>the last one.</v>

3822
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:34.540
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

3823
01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:35.780
<v Speaker 2>you know what people are saying?</v>

3824
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:37.790
<v Speaker 2>It's either a bomb or a missile.</v>

3825
01:52:38.230 --> 01:52:38.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3826

3827
01:52:38.741 --> 01:52:41.380
<v Speaker 1>there's actually something like really clear watch.</v>

3828
01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:42.693
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

3829
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:43.721
<v Speaker 1>Look at this slide here.</v>

3830
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 1>There's something really clear that in right now.</v>

3831
01:52:45.951 --> 01:52:46.784
<v Speaker 1>Watch.</v>

3832
01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:50.063
<v Speaker 12>See that.</v>

3833
01:52:50.110 --> 01:52:50.861
<v Speaker 1>See that white thing.</v>

3834
01:52:50.861 --> 01:52:51.694
<v Speaker 1>And then boom.</v>

3835
01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.193
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

3836
01:52:53.230 --> 01:52:54.070
<v Speaker 1>that's like a plane.</v>

3837
01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.890
<v Speaker 1>There's something right here under this that comes at it.</v>

3838
01:52:57.190 --> 01:52:58.340
<v Speaker 1>And then it hits set.</v>

3839
01:52:58.690 --> 01:52:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Watch one more time.</v>

3840
01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:01.723
<v Speaker 12>Right here.</v>

3841
01:53:03.670 --> 01:53:04.460
<v Speaker 12>It's right there.</v>

3842
01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:05.293
<v Speaker 12>See that?</v>

3843
01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:06.673
<v Speaker 12>Boom.</v>

3844
01:53:06.930 --> 01:53:09.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like she could see something fly into it cause people are crazy.</v>

3845
01:53:11.210 --> 01:53:12.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3846
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:13.261
<v Speaker 1>listen to the news.</v>

3847
01:53:13.261 --> 01:53:15.360
<v Speaker 1>It would actually listen to the audio and listen what they say.</v>

3848
01:53:15.570 --> 01:53:16.640
<v Speaker 1>They say there's no point.</v>

3849
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I look and guess what?</v>

3850
01:53:18.151 --> 01:53:18.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no plane.</v>

3851
01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3852
01:53:19.171 --> 01:53:20.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're retarded.</v>

3853
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Those people that are reading the news man thing,</v>

3854
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:23.343
<v Speaker 1>so smart,</v>

3855
01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:24.811
<v Speaker 1>those fuckers,</v>

3856
01:53:24.811 --> 01:53:26.550
<v Speaker 1>all they do is they just read off a prompter.</v>

3857
01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I've never been impressed with the knowledge of the people that read the news.</v>

3858
01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Then they can all suck it.</v>

3859
01:53:33.570 --> 01:53:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened to the Pentagon,</v>

3860
01:53:34.951 --> 01:53:36.270
<v Speaker 1>but that shit looked like a plane.</v>

3861
01:53:36.271 --> 01:53:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Just hit it.</v>

3862
01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:42.020
<v Speaker 1>But doesn't mean it wasn't like also there's the big theory is that it was some</v>

3863
01:53:42.241 --> 01:53:46.470
<v Speaker 1>sort of a remote control plane that they've had remote control planes since the</v>

3864
01:53:46.471 --> 01:53:47.221
<v Speaker 1>1960s.</v>

3865
01:53:47.221 --> 01:53:50.370
<v Speaker 1>We know that because they wanted to use them in that operation Northwoods,</v>

3866
01:53:50.670 --> 01:53:53.370
<v Speaker 1>one of the plans involved using a drone airliner,</v>

3867
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:56.190
<v Speaker 1>sending it up in the air and blowing it up and blaming it on the Cubans.</v>

3868
01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:59.100
<v Speaker 1>So if they could do that in the 1960s,</v>

3869
01:53:59.130 --> 01:54:01.410
<v Speaker 1>if they could blow up a plane back then,</v>

3870
01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:05.100
<v Speaker 1>they could probably pilot things remote by now.</v>

3871
01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:05.831
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3872
01:54:05.831 --> 01:54:07.170
<v Speaker 1>apparently they can.</v>

3873
01:54:07.230 --> 01:54:08.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's been proven that they can,</v>

3874
01:54:08.970 --> 01:54:10.170
<v Speaker 1>they absolutely can.</v>

3875
01:54:10.171 --> 01:54:10.981
<v Speaker 1>They can land them,</v>

3876
01:54:10.981 --> 01:54:11.940
<v Speaker 1>they can take them off.</v>

3877
01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:12.570
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>

3878
01:54:12.570 --> 01:54:14.460
<v Speaker 1>they can actually put planes in the air.</v>

3879
01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:15.800
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

3880
01:54:15.801 --> 01:54:18.390
<v Speaker 1>the crazy conspiracy theory as far as I was concerned,</v>

3881
01:54:18.391 --> 01:54:19.230
<v Speaker 1>was that the Ma,</v>

3882
01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:21.000
<v Speaker 1>the one of the most fascinating ones,</v>

3883
01:54:21.150 --> 01:54:21.510
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>

3884
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:22.010
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>

3885
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:22.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3886
01:54:22.251 --> 01:54:23.250
<v Speaker 1>have a hint of nuttiness.</v>

3887
01:54:23.610 --> 01:54:27.690
<v Speaker 1>But the most fascinating once was that there was some sort of a drone and that</v>

3888
01:54:27.691 --> 01:54:31.440
<v Speaker 1>that's how those planes crashed into the buildings and that they couldn't be,</v>

3889
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:31.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3890
01:54:31.890 --> 01:54:32.790
<v Speaker 1>engineered,</v>

3891
01:54:33.330 --> 01:54:33.930
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3892
01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:34.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3893
01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.300
<v Speaker 1>or rather the,</v>

3894
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:40.100
<v Speaker 1>the people that were flying them probably couldn't have pulled off those</v>

3895
01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:40.943
<v Speaker 1>maneuvers.</v>

3896
01:54:41.130 --> 01:54:43.200
<v Speaker 1>But that if you had it on a remote control,</v>

3897
01:54:43.201 --> 01:54:44.070
<v Speaker 1>it could work.</v>

3898
01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:45.180
<v Speaker 1>That was where the,</v>

3899
01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:46.980
<v Speaker 1>some pilots had speculated,</v>

3900
01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:48.450
<v Speaker 1>especially like the Pentagon one,</v>

3901
01:54:48.690 --> 01:54:52.290
<v Speaker 1>the Pentagon and apparently pilots like really trip out about because they've</v>

3902
01:54:52.291 --> 01:54:54.960
<v Speaker 1>done like these simulations and no one's been able to recreate it in a</v>

3903
01:54:54.961 --> 01:54:55.794
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>

3904
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:56.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3905
01:54:56.161 --> 01:54:57.510
<v Speaker 1>they have like a simulation machine.</v>

3906
01:54:57.511 --> 01:55:01.590
<v Speaker 1>It shows like exactly the path that the plane took when it hit the Pentagon and</v>

3907
01:55:01.591 --> 01:55:02.850
<v Speaker 1>these pilots can't even do it.</v>

3908
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to do so low and the grounds down.</v>

3909
01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.780
<v Speaker 1>You've got a time itself.</v>

3910
01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:09.661
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

3911
01:55:09.661 --> 01:55:09.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3912
01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:10.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've,</v>

3913
01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've seen a video where a pilot was able to recreate it.</v>

3914
01:55:13.591 --> 01:55:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen failures,</v>

3915
01:55:14.701 --> 01:55:18.000
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that people haven't done it just means I haven't seen it,</v>

3916
01:55:18.001 --> 01:55:18.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3917
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:19.183
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3918
01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3919
01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:21.053
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

3920
01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:21.270
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3921
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.751
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

3922
01:55:21.751 --> 01:55:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't put it past any nefarious organization,</v>

3923
01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:27.810
<v Speaker 1>domestic or foreign that they could look if they,</v>

3924
01:55:27.811 --> 01:55:28.180
<v Speaker 1>if they're,</v>

3925
01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:28.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3926
01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:31.020
<v Speaker 1>if anybody's willing to fly planes into buildings,</v>

3927
01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.010
<v Speaker 1>are they?</v>

3928
01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3929
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Clearly we saw it happen somehow or another.</v>

3930
01:55:34.651 --> 01:55:35.670
<v Speaker 1>That was somebody's idea.</v>

3931
01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:36.181
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3932
01:55:36.181 --> 01:55:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Those planes that flew into those buildings,</v>

3933
01:55:37.711 --> 01:55:39.000
<v Speaker 1>they didn't just fly in on their own.</v>

3934
01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3935
01:55:39.630 --> 01:55:43.650
<v Speaker 1>So for sure somebody piloted planes the building,</v>

3936
01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 1>why</v>

3937
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.110
<v Speaker 2>would we think that they wouldn't do it remotely?</v>

3938
01:55:47.130 --> 01:55:47.941
<v Speaker 2>Why would they,</v>

3939
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:48.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3940
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.580
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3941
01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:48.820
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3942
01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:49.411
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

3943
01:55:49.411 --> 01:55:49.951
<v Speaker 2>we really,</v>

3944
01:55:49.951 --> 01:55:53.100
<v Speaker 2>truly convinced that people piloted them themselves.</v>

3945
01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a really tough to be sure that someone is going to fly a plane into</v>

3946
01:55:58.471 --> 01:55:59.280
<v Speaker 2>a fucking building.</v>

3947
01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.640
<v Speaker 2>It's really tough to be sure you can hope they do it,</v>

3948
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:04.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's better to be safe.</v>

3949
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.840
<v Speaker 2>And the way to save is get them to do it.</v>

3950
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Tell them I'm going to do it.</v>

3951
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I just wire the whole thing.</v>

3952
01:56:09.061 --> 01:56:09.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>

3953
01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:10.380
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it ourselves.</v>

3954
01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:12.870
<v Speaker 2>So in case they check it out,</v>

3955
01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:14.671
<v Speaker 2>check it out,</v>

3956
01:56:14.671 --> 01:56:15.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3957
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:17.100
<v Speaker 2>You might like fucking one more pass.</v>

3958
01:56:17.101 --> 01:56:17.560
<v Speaker 2>One more pass.</v>

3959
01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:18.393
<v Speaker 2>We'll go around again.</v>

3960
01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go around again.</v>

3961
01:56:19.230 --> 01:56:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Keep those passengers out of here.</v>

3962
01:56:20.670 --> 01:56:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Like you might get close then pull up,</v>

3963
01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:22.620
<v Speaker 2>pull up.</v>

3964
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:24.170
<v Speaker 2>You know that crazy Guy John Lear.</v>

3965
01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3966
01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:26.730
<v Speaker 2>He's like one of the craziest dudes ever.</v>

3967
01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:27.930
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious though.</v>

3968
01:56:27.931 --> 01:56:28.581
<v Speaker 2>The shitty sentence.</v>

3969
01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:29.970
<v Speaker 2>He'll say the craziest shit.</v>

3970
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:32.750
<v Speaker 2>And I heard his take on that and he said,</v>

3971
01:56:32.751 --> 01:56:32.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3972
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.680
<v Speaker 2>he is a CIA pilot.</v>

3973
01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:35.843
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3974
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:36.870
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3975
01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:38.640
<v Speaker 2>he's the craziest motherfucker out there.</v>

3976
01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:40.650
<v Speaker 2>He's probably a disinfecting agent.</v>

3977
01:56:41.210 --> 01:56:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Told him he,</v>

3978
01:56:42.150 --> 01:56:44.230
<v Speaker 2>if anybody was one that do,</v>

3979
01:56:44.231 --> 01:56:45.260
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a CIA shit,</v>

3980
01:56:45.370 --> 01:56:46.900
<v Speaker 2>say like a billionaire or some point.</v>

3981
01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:47.970
<v Speaker 2>He was uh,</v>

3982
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.331
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

3983
01:56:48.331 --> 01:56:51.120
<v Speaker 2>his dad owned Leer jets and he was,</v>

3984
01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:51.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3985
01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:56.130
<v Speaker 2>as far as him being a pilot for the CIA and being a highly decorated pilot,</v>

3986
01:56:56.131 --> 01:56:57.480
<v Speaker 2>he's got like records and shit.</v>

3987
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:58.583
<v Speaker 2>That's all true.</v>

3988
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.030
<v Speaker 2>But he says crazy,</v>

3989
01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:00.600
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit.</v>

3990
01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.600
<v Speaker 2>He says that there's no way that someone could have hit that tower without</v>

3991
01:57:05.971 --> 01:57:09.500
<v Speaker 2>practicing because you're going so fast that you would have to take a couple</v>

3992
01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 2>rounds and time.</v>

3993
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.980
<v Speaker 2>He said you'd have to look at a building and go well and that building hits</v>

3994
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:17.940
<v Speaker 2>after be right here and it takes a couple of passes to nail a building cause</v>

3995
01:57:17.941 --> 01:57:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you're going so fast.</v>

3996
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:19.801
<v Speaker 2>That's what he said.</v>

3997
01:57:19.801 --> 01:57:21.360
<v Speaker 2>But he could be full of Shit and I dunno,</v>

3998
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I dunno anything about being a pilot but that's what he said.</v>

3999
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:24.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4000
01:57:24.151 --> 01:57:29.151
<v Speaker 2>I don't imagine that they will leave it to chance if they do have remote control</v>

4001
01:57:29.490 --> 01:57:31.050
<v Speaker 2>things that they get put on airlines.</v>

4002
01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that it would just do that.</v>

4003
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.110
<v Speaker 2>That would be the way to do it.</v>

4004
01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:39.300
<v Speaker 2>You know like the latest shit coming out on the conspiracy theory has been</v>

4005
01:57:39.301 --> 01:57:40.380
<v Speaker 2>looking at all this fishy shit.</v>

4006
01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Now the latest shit is like what companies and securities companies and</v>

4007
01:57:47.161 --> 01:57:51.570
<v Speaker 2>brokerage and like tying it into the collapse of Russia when Russia was</v>

4008
01:57:51.571 --> 01:57:52.404
<v Speaker 2>collapsing,</v>

4009
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:56.670
<v Speaker 2>all these shady ass people high up,</v>

4010
01:57:56.671 --> 01:58:01.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you want to call them or buying up all this Russian shit and</v>

4011
01:58:01.381 --> 01:58:03.420
<v Speaker 2>laundering it through securities.</v>

4012
01:58:03.690 --> 01:58:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Like oh $250 billion of securities.</v>

4013
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Like they were just snatching,</v>

4014
01:58:07.741 --> 01:58:09.390
<v Speaker 2>they made a cash grab in Russia.</v>

4015
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:12.810
<v Speaker 2>But it was all illegal laundering shit and every 10 years,</v>

4016
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:14.940
<v Speaker 2>every 10 years like that was,</v>

4017
01:58:14.970 --> 01:58:19.900
<v Speaker 2>that was in 1991 so 2001 was the year that they had a review that,</v>

4018
01:58:19.901 --> 01:58:20.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4019
01:58:20.170 --> 01:58:21.001
<v Speaker 2>it takes 10 years,</v>

4020
01:58:21.001 --> 01:58:22.590
<v Speaker 2>it review and make sure everything,</v>

4021
01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:25.590
<v Speaker 2>all the securities to make sure they're all legit and all that shit.</v>

4022
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know how it runs,</v>

4023
01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:29.640
<v Speaker 2>but they're tying it into,</v>

4024
01:58:30.210 --> 01:58:31.350
<v Speaker 2>they had a blow up,</v>

4025
01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 2>the security broke,</v>

4026
01:58:33.481 --> 01:58:36.770
<v Speaker 2>it broke ridges on the building because that recommend checking that we're going</v>

4027
01:58:36.771 --> 01:58:39.210
<v Speaker 2>to find out like George w Bush's Dad,</v>

4028
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.871
<v Speaker 2>what does he,</v>

4029
01:58:39.871 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 2>George Herbert Bush or he like,</v>

4030
01:58:42.161 --> 01:58:45.580
<v Speaker 2>it was all CIA international banker shit.</v>

4031
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.820
<v Speaker 2>And it all ties into the collapse of Russia.</v>

4032
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.440
<v Speaker 2>And this is why weed is illegal.</v>

4033
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:53.750
<v Speaker 2>These kind of conversations because when you smoke weed,</v>

4034
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:54.570
<v Speaker 2>go to,</v>

4035
01:58:54.570 --> 01:58:56.470
<v Speaker 2>it was hauled tied in man.</v>

4036
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:57.761
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy shit.</v>

4037
01:58:57.761 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Like who knows what's real or not,</v>

4038
01:58:59.201 --> 01:59:01.960
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like tying it all together now,</v>

4039
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.920
<v Speaker 10>the craziest one.</v>

4040
01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:03.970
<v Speaker 10>And I,</v>

4041
01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:04.420
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4042
01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 10>I try to be as open minded as I can with these things,</v>

4043
01:59:06.671 --> 01:59:08.800
<v Speaker 10>but if you don't admit that this one's nuts,</v>

4044
01:59:09.130 --> 01:59:10.090
<v Speaker 10>I think you're crazy.</v>

4045
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:12.010
<v Speaker 10>And that's the Donald Rumsfeld one.</v>

4046
01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:17.160
<v Speaker 10>When Donald's Rumsfeld came on television on September 10th and told everybody</v>

4047
01:59:17.441 --> 01:59:20.230
<v Speaker 10>that there's this real issue with missing money,</v>

4048
01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:22.120
<v Speaker 10>there's trillions of dollars,</v>

4049
01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:23.500
<v Speaker 10>but they're going to get to the bottom of it.</v>

4050
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:25.040
<v Speaker 2>220 trillion,</v>

4051
01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:26.600
<v Speaker 2>230 trillion or something.</v>

4052
01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the number was?</v>

4053
01:59:28.110 --> 01:59:28.943
<v Speaker 2>It was 100 trillion.</v>

4054
01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:30.013
<v Speaker 2>1 trillion.</v>

4055
01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:30.873
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking,</v>

4056
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.903
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of money.</v>

4057
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4058
01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:33.150
<v Speaker 10>but they,</v>

4059
01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:33.570
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

4060
01:59:33.570 --> 01:59:34.050
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>

4061
01:59:34.050 --> 01:59:34.620
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

4062
01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:39.150
<v Speaker 10>the very area where they were working on this and the accounting offices was hit</v>

4063
01:59:39.151 --> 01:59:39.380
<v Speaker 10>by the</v>

4064
01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:40.130
<v Speaker 2>playing.</v>

4065
01:59:40.130 --> 01:59:40.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4066
01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:41.990
<v Speaker 2>And this is on youtube,</v>

4067
01:59:41.991 --> 01:59:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Rumsfeld making that it's on youtube.</v>

4068
01:59:44.541 --> 01:59:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Donald's run felt saying that,</v>

4069
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:47.600
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

4070
01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.430
<v Speaker 2>The real enemy is here,</v>

4071
01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:51.050
<v Speaker 2>here in our country,</v>

4072
01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:52.490
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to get to the bottom of this.</v>

4073
01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Apparently there's 213 trillion plus the money.</v>

4074
01:59:56.181 --> 01:59:57.050
<v Speaker 2>That number was that.</v>

4075
01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:58.520
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get to the bottom of it.</v>

4076
01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:01.370
<v Speaker 2>The enemy is here in the Pentagon next day.</v>

4077
02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.230
<v Speaker 2>They blow up the accounting office and,</v>

4078
02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:08.560
<v Speaker 2>and apparently the naval intelligence they were on to what was going on this</v>

4079
02:00:11.241 --> 02:00:13.610
<v Speaker 2>covert laundry and skiing with through securities.</v>

4080
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:15.280
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

4081
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:15.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4082
02:00:15.650 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 2>most of the people that died in the Pentagon where all the accountants and a lot</v>

4083
02:00:21.081 --> 02:00:25.250
<v Speaker 2>of all the high ups in the naval intelligence because naval intelligence was</v>

4084
02:00:25.251 --> 02:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>actually looking into these securities and these Russian so that a blow and the</v>

4085
02:00:28.971 --> 02:00:31.400
<v Speaker 2>naval intelligence course tower seven.</v>

4086
02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

4087
02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:32.181
<v Speaker 10>The crazy,</v>

4088
02:00:32.181 --> 02:00:36.250
<v Speaker 10>one of the craziest things is that the government investigates the government</v>

4089
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:37.360
<v Speaker 10>like the,</v>

4090
02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:39.310
<v Speaker 10>this whole thing with his general Patraeus.</v>

4091
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:40.510
<v Speaker 10>Do you know how this happened?</v>

4092
02:00:40.511 --> 02:00:41.010
<v Speaker 10>The guy got,</v>

4093
02:00:41.010 --> 02:00:43.510
<v Speaker 10>he got busted having an affair and he had to resign.</v>

4094
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:47.140
<v Speaker 10>It's because the FBI was investigating the CIA.</v>

4095
02:00:47.650 --> 02:00:48.850
<v Speaker 10>Like they investigate each other.</v>

4096
02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.113
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4097
02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:50.891
<v Speaker 10>Like they,</v>

4098
02:00:50.891 --> 02:00:53.950
<v Speaker 10>the FBI listened to a complaint by this woman.</v>

4099
02:00:53.951 --> 02:00:57.880
<v Speaker 10>She calls the FBI and says that this other woman sending her harassing letters.</v>

4100
02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:58.691
<v Speaker 10>And so she,</v>

4101
02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:01.480
<v Speaker 10>they read the letters and then they go back and forth.</v>

4102
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:02.110
<v Speaker 10>The whole thing.</v>

4103
02:01:02.110 --> 02:01:02.943
<v Speaker 10>Hilarious.</v>

4104
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:05.620
<v Speaker 10>This is a government was spying on the government.</v>

4105
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.420
<v Speaker 10>So they,</v>

4106
02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:06.700
<v Speaker 10>they,</v>

4107
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:07.950
<v Speaker 10>these motherfuckers,</v>

4108
02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.700
<v Speaker 10>it's so addictive to them.</v>

4109
02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:12.950
<v Speaker 10>To like spy on people and bus people.</v>

4110
02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Bull apparently shade don't like the FBI and the Dea,</v>

4111
02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:21.560
<v Speaker 2>the DEA and the FBI are like Kinda together and the CIA,</v>

4112
02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:22.453
<v Speaker 2>they're separated.</v>

4113
02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:23.150
<v Speaker 10>Wow,</v>

4114
02:01:23.150 --> 02:01:23.710
<v Speaker 10>that's crazy.</v>

4115
02:01:23.710 --> 02:01:25.270
<v Speaker 10>Well then there's the NSA,</v>

4116
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.991
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4117
02:01:25.991 --> 02:01:26.291
<v Speaker 10>that's,</v>

4118
02:01:26.291 --> 02:01:27.610
<v Speaker 10>that's where it gets really squirrely.</v>

4119
02:01:27.630 --> 02:01:29.170
<v Speaker 10>Like ooze or what is that?</v>

4120
02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:30.650
<v Speaker 10>What's going on in,</v>

4121
02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:34.510
<v Speaker 10>there's so many of these fucking things and this is some shit that Kennedy was</v>

4122
02:01:34.511 --> 02:01:38.440
<v Speaker 10>scared of in the 1960s Kennedy was saying in the 1960s we have a shadow</v>

4123
02:01:38.441 --> 02:01:39.274
<v Speaker 10>government.</v>

4124
02:01:39.390 --> 02:01:41.460
<v Speaker 10>You know there's like what that when he got into office,</v>

4125
02:01:41.461 --> 02:01:46.461
<v Speaker 10>I bet it was like why a big crazy ass shadow government running things and then</v>

4126
02:01:49.741 --> 02:01:51.360
<v Speaker 10>you get a guy like Obama in place.</v>

4127
02:01:51.361 --> 02:01:54.360
<v Speaker 10>It's like this is our last hope or rational,</v>

4128
02:01:54.361 --> 02:01:56.250
<v Speaker 10>sensible guy that looks like us.</v>

4129
02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:58.590
<v Speaker 10>It seems like that was a good one.</v>

4130
02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:00.510
<v Speaker 10>I wonder if that's what it is or if it's a he get,</v>

4131
02:02:00.511 --> 02:02:03.360
<v Speaker 10>he just can't really doesn't have the power change.</v>

4132
02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:04.213
<v Speaker 10>Now that is the trick.</v>

4133
02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:06.030
<v Speaker 10>The trick is he has no power.</v>

4134
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.170
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

4135
02:02:06.170 --> 02:02:10.620
<v Speaker 10>just trying as much as he can to sort of slowly turn the tide.</v>

4136
02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:13.500
<v Speaker 10>But that the people that are in positions of power,</v>

4137
02:02:13.501 --> 02:02:17.490
<v Speaker 10>they've done it this way for so long and that's what's really fucked up about</v>

4138
02:02:17.491 --> 02:02:17.551
<v Speaker 10>it.</v>

4139
02:02:17.551 --> 02:02:19.640
<v Speaker 10>The idea that these guys got away with it like this.</v>

4140
02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:22.770
<v Speaker 2>You know what's crazy is tower six.</v>

4141
02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>There's tower one tower to tower seven tower one two and seven.</v>

4142
02:02:26.250 --> 02:02:31.020
<v Speaker 2>They implode and they fall at free fall speed tower six and tower for just had</v>

4143
02:02:31.021 --> 02:02:34.610
<v Speaker 2>massive bomb explosions and debris falling on it,</v>

4144
02:02:34.611 --> 02:02:37.020
<v Speaker 2>but bombs exploded and it bombs.</v>

4145
02:02:37.021 --> 02:02:38.280
<v Speaker 2>It's bombs exploded.</v>

4146
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:39.223
<v Speaker 2>And six,</v>

4147
02:02:39.490 --> 02:02:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I never heard this man.</v>

4148
02:02:40.711 --> 02:02:42.630
<v Speaker 2>There's so much and bombs and car sex.</v>

4149
02:02:42.690 --> 02:02:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4150
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Bottle.</v>

4151
02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:46.080
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be careful though because people make shit up.</v>

4152
02:02:46.081 --> 02:02:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard anything about bombs.</v>

4153
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Go to go to nine one one conspiracy nine 11.</v>

4154
02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry that but a nine 11 conspiracy.</v>

4155
02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Not going to get me.</v>

4156
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it.</v>

4157
02:02:56.630 --> 02:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4158
02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:57.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the time.</v>

4159
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:59.000
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

4160
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't think a bomb went off and tower sex.</v>

4161
02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4162
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hear what if they did though.</v>

4163
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say what if it did and this is the story of a bomb went off and</v>

4164
02:03:08.041 --> 02:03:08.670
<v Speaker 2>tower.</v>

4165
02:03:08.670 --> 02:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>There's pictures and goody outlets.</v>

4166
02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:13.500
<v Speaker 2>How can that be crazy when you,</v>

4167
02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:15.630
<v Speaker 2>you're bashing the government all the time,</v>

4168
02:03:15.631 --> 02:03:17.930
<v Speaker 2>but then a bomb goes off in tower six and nine.</v>

4169
02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:18.870
<v Speaker 2>I think those are fine.</v>

4170
02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:20.290
<v Speaker 10>I think that there is,</v>

4171
02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.070
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

4172
02:03:21.070 --> 02:03:21.670
<v Speaker 10>amongst,</v>

4173
02:03:21.670 --> 02:03:23.290
<v Speaker 10>especially amongst people on the Internet,</v>

4174
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:28.550
<v Speaker 10>there is a very real desire to uncover hidden secrets and sometimes it gets so</v>

4175
02:03:29.171 --> 02:03:32.050
<v Speaker 10>far that they reached the bombs went off everywhere.</v>

4176
02:03:32.110 --> 02:03:34.420
<v Speaker 10>Maybe I believe it's possible.</v>

4177
02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:35.790
<v Speaker 10>I've seen the testimony,</v>

4178
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:38.890
<v Speaker 10>well I think there was also explosions and it might not have been bombs because</v>

4179
02:03:38.891 --> 02:03:39.970
<v Speaker 10>there were so many fires.</v>

4180
02:03:39.971 --> 02:03:40.930
<v Speaker 10>I mean that was one of the,</v>

4181
02:03:40.931 --> 02:03:41.510
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

4182
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:44.440
<v Speaker 10>the excuses they use for tower seven.</v>

4183
02:03:44.441 --> 02:03:48.340
<v Speaker 10>The only one that makes sense is that there was diesel fires because they had</v>

4184
02:03:48.341 --> 02:03:49.450
<v Speaker 10>diesel generators and they,</v>

4185
02:03:49.451 --> 02:03:53.770
<v Speaker 10>apparently they had just a fuck load of diesel and that shit caught on fire.</v>

4186
02:03:53.771 --> 02:03:54.280
<v Speaker 10>And if,</v>

4187
02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:55.540
<v Speaker 10>if that was the case,</v>

4188
02:03:55.541 --> 02:03:59.770
<v Speaker 10>I could see it like gutting the place with some crazy fire and maybe it falls</v>

4189
02:03:59.771 --> 02:04:00.250
<v Speaker 10>down.</v>

4190
02:04:00.250 --> 02:04:01.550
<v Speaker 10>I was like,</v>

4191
02:04:01.551 --> 02:04:02.320
<v Speaker 10>I'm not writing,</v>

4192
02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:03.710
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't it be weird if it,</v>

4193
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:04.810
<v Speaker 2>if it was true,</v>

4194
02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you're saying maybe it is,</v>

4195
02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:06.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe it isn't.</v>

4196
02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:08.710
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying definitely it doesn't cause you know,</v>

4197
02:04:08.711 --> 02:04:09.544
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't say that.</v>

4198
02:04:09.610 --> 02:04:14.610
<v Speaker 2>So maybe let's just say a bomb did go off and there's pictures and video of it</v>

4199
02:04:14.681 --> 02:04:15.341
<v Speaker 2>looks like a,</v>

4200
02:04:15.341 --> 02:04:20.341
<v Speaker 2>the Oklahoma City bombing that building and the office that was bombed was the</v>

4201
02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:22.181
<v Speaker 2>El Dorado Task Force,</v>

4202
02:04:22.181 --> 02:04:26.650
<v Speaker 2>which investigates all of these securities and the money laundering and all that</v>

4203
02:04:26.651 --> 02:04:26.820
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

4204
02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Never investigating the whole Russian collapse.</v>

4205
02:04:29.111 --> 02:04:29.944
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of shit.</v>

4206
02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:34.530
<v Speaker 2>It was a covert economic operation and uh,</v>

4207
02:04:35.490 --> 02:04:37.090
<v Speaker 2>and there it was being investigated.</v>

4208
02:04:37.150 --> 02:04:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4209
02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:38.140
<v Speaker 2>how</v>

4210
02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:41.530
<v Speaker 4>many people would have to be involved in something like that?</v>

4211
02:04:41.531 --> 02:04:44.820
<v Speaker 4>And they blew that office up there was at that office and tower six,</v>

4212
02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:45.700
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't even Taiwan.</v>

4213
02:04:45.850 --> 02:04:47.260
<v Speaker 4>A bomb goes off and tower six.</v>

4214
02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:47.861
<v Speaker 4>It was that off.</v>

4215
02:04:47.861 --> 02:04:48.694
<v Speaker 4>They just blew it up.</v>

4216
02:04:49.130 --> 02:04:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Or do you think would have to be involved in something like that?</v>

4217
02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:53.673
<v Speaker 4>How would they,</v>

4218
02:04:53.770 --> 02:04:54.700
<v Speaker 4>how would they do this?</v>

4219
02:04:54.701 --> 02:04:55.810
<v Speaker 4>Would they do it through emails?</v>

4220
02:04:55.811 --> 02:04:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4221
02:04:56.050 --> 02:04:57.490
<v Speaker 4>according to this theory.</v>

4222
02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:57.821
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4223
02:04:57.821 --> 02:04:58.720
<v Speaker 4>According to this theory,</v>

4224
02:04:58.721 --> 02:04:59.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's true or not.</v>

4225
02:04:59.621 --> 02:05:00.454
<v Speaker 4>I'm just reading these things.</v>

4226
02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:01.630
<v Speaker 4>According to this theory,</v>

4227
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:06.490
<v Speaker 4>it was all about they had to get rid of these brokerages and the people naval</v>

4228
02:05:06.491 --> 02:05:10.060
<v Speaker 4>intelligence and the Eldorado task force because they were about to investigate</v>

4229
02:05:10.061 --> 02:05:12.340
<v Speaker 4>at the 10 year cause our 10 years securities,</v>

4230
02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:13.361
<v Speaker 4>whatever that means.</v>

4231
02:05:13.361 --> 02:05:17.620
<v Speaker 4>They're like bonds or something or CDs or something worth over 240 million.</v>

4232
02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:19.780
<v Speaker 4>That's what the investigation was about.</v>

4233
02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:20.711
<v Speaker 4>They finally,</v>

4234
02:05:20.711 --> 02:05:21.210
<v Speaker 4>we're going to,</v>

4235
02:05:21.210 --> 02:05:21.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4236
02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:23.980
<v Speaker 4>there's still only like AIG is,</v>

4237
02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:25.173
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

4238
02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:27.260
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4239
02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:28.970
<v Speaker 4>supposedly according to this theory,</v>

4240
02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:29.990
<v Speaker 4>Aig,</v>

4241
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:31.320
<v Speaker 4>that insurance company will,</v>

4242
02:05:31.321 --> 02:05:32.570
<v Speaker 4>they're more than just insurance.</v>

4243
02:05:32.571 --> 02:05:34.100
<v Speaker 4>Like they're involved in all,</v>

4244
02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:36.680
<v Speaker 4>they got CIA ties and all this crazy shit.</v>

4245
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:37.820
<v Speaker 4>They had to cover it up.</v>

4246
02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:38.450
<v Speaker 4>They had,</v>

4247
02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:39.770
<v Speaker 4>this is according to this theory,</v>

4248
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:44.890
<v Speaker 4>they needed a blow all that shit up so there's transactions could slide through</v>

4249
02:05:45.381 --> 02:05:49.460
<v Speaker 4>during the chaos and they wouldn't because the Federal Reserve at nine one one,</v>

4250
02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:49.971
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4251
02:05:49.971 --> 02:05:50.271
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4252
02:05:50.271 --> 02:05:50.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4253
02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:52.640
<v Speaker 4>they took executive like emergency power.</v>

4254
02:05:52.730 --> 02:05:55.130
<v Speaker 4>So that day they took emergency parts so they can do whatever they want.</v>

4255
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:58.280
<v Speaker 4>The security and Exchange Commission they did.</v>

4256
02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:00.770
<v Speaker 4>They had an emergency um,</v>

4257
02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:01.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4258
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:02.930
<v Speaker 4>procedure that they've never done before,</v>

4259
02:06:02.931 --> 02:06:05.420
<v Speaker 4>which meant that we got a lot of chaos here.</v>

4260
02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:08.780
<v Speaker 4>Let's just run all the securities without checking them and just run these</v>

4261
02:06:08.781 --> 02:06:09.590
<v Speaker 4>through Pam.</v>

4262
02:06:09.590 --> 02:06:10.423
<v Speaker 4>That's what they did.</v>

4263
02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:11.690
<v Speaker 4>So that's a theory.</v>

4264
02:06:11.691 --> 02:06:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Who knows if it's true but it sounds pretty fucking crazy.</v>

4265
02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:15.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he did that.</v>

4266
02:06:15.291 --> 02:06:19.640
<v Speaker 4>So I think speculating about us but what I do know is that a lot of people</v>

4267
02:06:19.641 --> 02:06:24.110
<v Speaker 4>banked on those airlines fucking up and they like it's sold allow their shares.</v>

4268
02:06:24.111 --> 02:06:27.470
<v Speaker 4>Like they knew some things were going at like huge significant numbers on</v>

4269
02:06:27.471 --> 02:06:28.340
<v Speaker 4>American Airlines.</v>

4270
02:06:28.341 --> 02:06:30.620
<v Speaker 4>They shorter their stocks is that alone.</v>

4271
02:06:30.621 --> 02:06:32.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like really squirrely.</v>

4272
02:06:32.361 --> 02:06:34.370
<v Speaker 4>Like let off fuck that.</v>

4273
02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:35.210
<v Speaker 4>That alone,</v>

4274
02:06:35.210 --> 02:06:38.120
<v Speaker 4>if it is true and apparently it is that the,</v>

4275
02:06:38.121 --> 02:06:43.121
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that should be like a big point of investigation and if it is true</v>

4276
02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:48.340
<v Speaker 4>and I've seen it reported in multiple supposedly valid websites that the deal</v>

4277
02:06:48.351 --> 02:06:49.184
<v Speaker 4>with the news,</v>

4278
02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:50.120
<v Speaker 4>if that is true,</v>

4279
02:06:50.230 --> 02:06:53.210
<v Speaker 4>like this is just the fact that that hasn't been investigated.</v>

4280
02:06:53.211 --> 02:06:54.044
<v Speaker 4>It makes you just go,</v>

4281
02:06:54.170 --> 02:06:55.440
<v Speaker 4>how many is meant cradle?</v>

4282
02:06:55.730 --> 02:07:00.730
<v Speaker 4>How many people can be involved in it if we really have a really crazy sort of a</v>

4283
02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:08.040
<v Speaker 4>fake democracy and they're just stealing and engineering shit and blowing shit</v>

4284
02:07:08.201 --> 02:07:12.070
<v Speaker 4>up on occasion taken people have to be involved and how come nobody wants to rat</v>

4285
02:07:12.071 --> 02:07:12.371
<v Speaker 4>him out?</v>

4286
02:07:12.371 --> 02:07:16.010
<v Speaker 4>How come nobody wants to make like the ultimate book from the shadows and then</v>

4287
02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:18.070
<v Speaker 4>they're going right to Afghanistan,</v>

4288
02:07:18.071 --> 02:07:19.210
<v Speaker 4>taken all the heroin.</v>

4289
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:21.010
<v Speaker 4>C'Mon gangsters,</v>

4290
02:07:21.011 --> 02:07:21.311
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4291
02:07:21.311 --> 02:07:22.030
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

4292
02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:22.421
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

4293
02:07:22.421 --> 02:07:23.290
<v Speaker 4>everyone just accepts.</v>

4294
02:07:23.291 --> 02:07:24.370
<v Speaker 4>It was so amazing.</v>

4295
02:07:24.371 --> 02:07:25.091
<v Speaker 4>It feels fake.</v>

4296
02:07:25.091 --> 02:07:30.091
<v Speaker 4>But I think that part of the thing is that they did it this way for so long that</v>

4297
02:07:32.111 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 4>that became how you did things and then when the came along</v>

4298
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:37.330
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden people go,</v>

4299
02:07:37.331 --> 02:07:38.110
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

4300
02:07:38.110 --> 02:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are they doing?</v>

4301
02:07:39.550 --> 02:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>They can do that and they could do this.</v>

4302
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Like who would have found out about the national defense authorization act and</v>

4303
02:07:44.921 --> 02:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>the indefinite detention of American civilians without right to trow.</v>

4304
02:07:48.521 --> 02:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Who to found out about that?</v>

4305
02:07:49.481 --> 02:07:50.380
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for the Internet,</v>

4306
02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:52.180
<v Speaker 1>of course you wouldn't have found out it from CNN.</v>

4307
02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't even find out about it from cnn.com when people say,</v>

4308
02:07:55.450 --> 02:07:56.050
<v Speaker 1>when people say,</v>

4309
02:07:56.050 --> 02:07:56.261
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4310
02:07:56.261 --> 02:07:57.960
<v Speaker 1>where do you get your information?</v>

4311
02:07:57.970 --> 02:07:58.721
<v Speaker 1>The Internet,</v>

4312
02:07:58.721 --> 02:08:01.980
<v Speaker 1>like what are you go fucking libraries when going to go to fucking lie.</v>

4313
02:08:02.070 --> 02:08:02.903
<v Speaker 1>You go to the library,</v>

4314
02:08:03.070 --> 02:08:03.851
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking 12,</v>

4315
02:08:03.851 --> 02:08:04.720
<v Speaker 1>you're going to the library,</v>

4316
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

4317
02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:06.220
<v Speaker 1>you go on your computer,</v>

4318
02:08:06.221 --> 02:08:06.671
<v Speaker 1>dumb ass.</v>

4319
02:08:06.671 --> 02:08:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Everyone gets their information from the inner,</v>

4320
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4321
02:08:08.450 --> 02:08:10.900
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets really weird though because you've got to make sure that</v>

4322
02:08:10.901 --> 02:08:12.250
<v Speaker 1>you really trust your sources.</v>

4323
02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:13.151
<v Speaker 1>So there's like,</v>

4324
02:08:13.151 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 1>there's some sources that you know,</v>

4325

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4328
02:08:16.090 --> 02:08:20.740
<v Speaker 1>like there's like in England they have the daily mail and now they're,</v>

4329
02:08:20.770 --> 02:08:21.940
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers were right.</v>

4337
02:08:30.221 --> 02:08:31.240
<v Speaker 1>but it might be bullshit.</v>

02:08:31.241 --> 02:08:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Listen to amber lions.</v>

4339

4342
02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:37.930

<v Speaker 1>You got to question it.</v>

4344

4345
02:08:40.121 --> 02:08:41.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't ever trust the government.</v>

4346
02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:41.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4347
02:08:41.711 --> 02:08:42.760

<v Speaker 1>They're running a show.</v>

4349
02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Those new shows,</v>

4350
02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:47.290
<v Speaker 1>they check them for ratings.</v>

4351
02:08:47.410 --> 02:08:50.110
<v Speaker 1>They want to make sure that people are tuning in and if they're not tuning in to</v>

4352
02:08:50.111 --> 02:08:54.490
<v Speaker 1>replace a girl and move a guy and do this or do that to amber lions,</v>

4354
02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about ratings,</v>

4355
02:08:56.891 --> 02:08:58.120
<v Speaker 1>it's about their certain shit.</v>

4358
02:09:00.191 --> 02:09:01.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a business.</v>

4359
02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:01.961
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

4360
02:09:01.961 --> 02:09:04.120
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the business of of news,</v>

4361
02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:05.110
<v Speaker 1>there's only way,</v>

4362
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:07.270
<v Speaker 1>the one way you get access to that news.</v>

4363
02:09:07.271 --> 02:09:07.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4364
02:09:07.511 --> 02:09:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to go to countries you have to be able to do as soon as you</v>

4365
02:09:10.901 --> 02:09:11.141
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4366
02:09:11.141 --> 02:09:12.160
<v Speaker 1>piss those people off.</v>

4367
02:09:12.190 --> 02:09:12.341
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4368
02:09:12.341 --> 02:09:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you can't get in there anymore.</v>

4369
02:09:13.481 --> 02:09:14.030
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>

4370
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] removed from this.</v>

4371
02:09:15.481 --> 02:09:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So he can't go to Congress anymore like this.</v>

4372
02:09:17.231 --> 02:09:18.160
<v Speaker 1>People to this day,</v>

4373
02:09:18.161 --> 02:09:23.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that have websites or what people that you know want to get press</v>

4374
02:09:23.381 --> 02:09:24.670
<v Speaker 1>passes for certain things.</v>

4375
02:09:24.671 --> 02:09:28.930
<v Speaker 1>They want to be able to get into areas where the New York Times and the Wall</v>

4376
02:09:28.930 --> 02:09:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Street Journal get to and they can't get in.</v>

4377
02:09:30.130 --> 02:09:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Just because you have a website,</v>

4378
02:09:31.121 --> 02:09:32.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a million hits a day.</v>

4379
02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:33.920
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that they're going to let you into the,</v>

4380
02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:37.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't like lob questions at the president just because you have a big</v>

4381
02:09:37.721 --> 02:09:38.554
<v Speaker 1>antenna,</v>

4382
02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:40.570
<v Speaker 1>but it really should be that way.</v>

4383
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:40.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4384
02:09:40.871 --> 02:09:43.060
<v Speaker 1>if a guy has a big antenna that means like Perez Hilton,</v>

4385
02:09:43.061 --> 02:09:46.150
<v Speaker 1>she'd be able to ask the president questions then why not?</v>

4386
02:09:46.151 --> 02:09:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Perez Hilton's got millions of fucking hits every day.</v>

4387
02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:49.683
<v Speaker 1>Why not him?</v>

4388
02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking him feel like he would have probably questions more along the lines</v>

4389
02:09:53.471 --> 02:09:56.620
<v Speaker 1>of how I would think that a lot of these fucking Weirdos that you see that he'd</v>

4390
02:09:56.621 --> 02:09:58.990
<v Speaker 1>get elected to Congress and get elected to the Senate.</v>

4391
02:09:59.290 --> 02:09:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Well you like,</v>

4392
02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:00.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4393
02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:02.770
<v Speaker 1>like that dude that was trying to be a president,</v>

4394
02:10:02.771 --> 02:10:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Paul Ryan,</v>

4395
02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:05.110
<v Speaker 1>the dude was running for vice president.</v>

4396
02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:06.153
<v Speaker 1>That's silly bitch.</v>

4397
02:10:06.370 --> 02:10:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Did you pay attention to him and all pay attention?</v>

4398
02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

4399
02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:10.413
<v Speaker 1>The Mitt Romney guy.</v>

4400
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:11.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4401
02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:11.981
<v Speaker 1>Well his,</v>

4402
02:10:11.981 --> 02:10:13.390
<v Speaker 1>his running mate.</v>

4403
02:10:13.391 --> 02:10:13.960
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4404
02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:14.710
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

4405
02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:17.590
<v Speaker 1>he lied about like how fast he could run a marathon,</v>

4406
02:10:18.130 --> 02:10:18.641
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

4407
02:10:18.641 --> 02:10:19.510
<v Speaker 1>around American man,</v>

4408
02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:22.630
<v Speaker 1>like a three hour plus sub sub four hour marathon,</v>

4409
02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:25.280
<v Speaker 1>which apparently is like world class.</v>

4410
02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to be like a serious fucking athlete to be able to run a marathon</v>

4411
02:10:29.530 --> 02:10:32.590
<v Speaker 1>in under four hours and then he changed it afterwards.</v>

4412
02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Like days.</v>

4413
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I was like six hours.</v>

4414
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:34.581
<v Speaker 1>One hour.</v>

4415
02:10:34.581 --> 02:10:35.414
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4416
02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:37.370
<v Speaker 1>They probably picked him because he was terrible.</v>

4417
02:10:37.371 --> 02:10:38.090
<v Speaker 1>They call up,</v>

4418
02:10:38.090 --> 02:10:40.400
<v Speaker 1>get it get wasn't it Paul Ryan?</v>

4419
02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:41.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4420
02:10:41.121 --> 02:10:41.954
<v Speaker 1>he's a good speaker.</v>

4421
02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>He's a good speaker and a,</v>

4422
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:44.480
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty charismatic.</v>

4423
02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:47.810
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is under the really bright lights he folded and the really</v>

4424
02:10:47.811 --> 02:10:48.261
<v Speaker 1>bright lights.</v>

4425
02:10:48.261 --> 02:10:49.910
<v Speaker 1>He just bullshitted a little too much.</v>

4426
02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Got a little too cocky,</v>

4427
02:10:51.170 --> 02:10:52.820
<v Speaker 1>some shit that you get a set in Idaho.</v>

4428
02:10:52.821 --> 02:10:54.800
<v Speaker 1>He got away with it on the local news.</v>

4429
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:57.860
<v Speaker 1>You really can't get away with that shit when it's on Fox News and everybody</v>

4430
02:10:58.040 --> 02:10:58.561
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

4431
02:10:58.561 --> 02:10:59.510
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck you say?</v>

4432
02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Whoever put him in that position.</v>

4433
02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I knew that about him.</v>

4434
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:03.441
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4435
02:11:03.441 --> 02:11:04.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4436
02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:06.240
<v Speaker 1>it's no one else.</v>

4437
02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:06.921
<v Speaker 1>John Mccain.</v>

4438
02:11:06.921 --> 02:11:07.754
<v Speaker 1>When John Mccain,</v>

4439
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:08.623
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4440
02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:09.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4441
02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:14.450
<v Speaker 1>the world is one by corporations and Wall Street and all that.</v>

4442
02:11:14.451 --> 02:11:15.770
<v Speaker 1>They have all the goddamn power.</v>

4443
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:16.540
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking,</v>

4444
02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:17.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4445
02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you can try to try and get a guy like Paul Ryan into position,</v>

4446
02:11:20.271 --> 02:11:22.070
<v Speaker 1>they do it because it seems like it would work.</v>

4447
02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:23.150
<v Speaker 1>He's going to listen to us.</v>

4448
02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:23.601
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4449
02:11:23.601 --> 02:11:23.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4450
02:11:23.961 --> 02:11:26.000
<v Speaker 1>he's going to play ball and it'll work.</v>

4451
02:11:26.150 --> 02:11:26.390
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4452
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

4453
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:27.763
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4454
02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:28.700
<v Speaker 1>but to me,</v>

4455
02:11:28.701 --> 02:11:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm just throwing this out that who the fuck?</v>

4456
02:11:30.681 --> 02:11:30.801
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4457
02:11:30.801 --> 02:11:33.080
<v Speaker 1>so you're looking for a conspiracy in the conspiracy.</v>

4458
02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:35.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking John Mccain and Sarah Palin,</v>

4459
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.860
<v Speaker 1>John Mccain aside,</v>

4460
02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:38.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like get mother.</v>

4461
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:40.760
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that dude who's about to die,</v>

4462
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:43.460
<v Speaker 1>it's going to become president and then then we put a crazy bitch as vice</v>

4463
02:11:43.461 --> 02:11:44.090
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

4464
02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>It almost seems like we need Obama to,</v>

4465
02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:46.461
<v Speaker 1>to win,</v>

4466
02:11:46.461 --> 02:11:49.420
<v Speaker 1>to handle all this shit took us all up.</v>

4467
02:11:49.450 --> 02:11:49.820
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4468
02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:51.170
<v Speaker 1>that's one way I'm looking at it.</v>

4469
02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:52.430
<v Speaker 1>This is the way I looked at it.</v>

4470
02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I think that in order to get to any position of power,</v>

4471
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:58.190
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a senator or congressman,</v>

4472
02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.080
<v Speaker 1>when by the time you get there,</v>

4473
02:12:00.081 --> 02:12:04.740
<v Speaker 1>you got so many motherfucking skeletons in your closet that you like.</v>

4474
02:12:04.741 --> 02:12:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Teddy Kennedy never could really run for president after he drowned that girl.</v>

4475
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:10.820
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of shit that these dudes do.</v>

4476
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:11.061
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

4477
02:12:11.061 --> 02:12:11.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4478
02:12:11.161 --> 02:12:15.200
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to find a guy who was pretty clean and Paul Ryan pretty clean,</v>

4479
02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:16.820
<v Speaker 1>seems like a nice family man,</v>

4480
02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.720
<v Speaker 1>says a lot of shit about taking personal responsibility toes the republican</v>

4481
02:12:20.721 --> 02:12:21.554
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

4482
02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:21.831
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4483
02:12:21.831 --> 02:12:22.341
<v Speaker 1>the guy looks,</v>

4484
02:12:22.341 --> 02:12:23.180
<v Speaker 1>he looks fit.</v>

4485
02:12:23.181 --> 02:12:26.000
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a man's man and yet have you had done marathons,</v>

4486
02:12:26.001 --> 02:12:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Paul?</v>

4487
02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I did a marathon in under four hours.</v>

4488
02:12:27.770 --> 02:12:29.960
<v Speaker 1>He did a marathon in under four hours.</v>

4489
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:32.840
<v Speaker 1>He's our guy and then they get in there and they find out the guy's a</v>

4490
02:12:32.841 --> 02:12:33.470
<v Speaker 1>bullshitter.</v>

4491
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more likely that,</v>

4492
02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:38.660
<v Speaker 1>but I do agree that in order to get to that position,</v>

4493
02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:40.040
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4494
02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:42.440
<v Speaker 1>they got to think that they can do something with you.</v>

4495
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:44.750
<v Speaker 1>They got to think that you're going to be able to play ball with them.</v>

4496
02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And a girl like Sarah Palin,</v>

4497
02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:49.010
<v Speaker 1>they went with her because they were,</v>

4498
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:50.300
<v Speaker 1>they were desperate.</v>

4499
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:51.440
<v Speaker 1>There was no one else.</v>

4500
02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:53.120
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know what the fuck they were doing,</v>

4501
02:12:53.121 --> 02:12:53.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4502
02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:56.900
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to figure out some way to reach women voters.</v>

4503
02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And one of the best ways is to have a strong woman that represents women and you</v>

4504
02:13:02.421 --> 02:13:02.571
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

4505
02:13:02.571 --> 02:13:06.440
<v Speaker 1>she represented the strongest aspects of like a frontiers woman.</v>

4506
02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Bitch lives in Alaska.</v>

4507
02:13:08.090 --> 02:13:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4508
02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Just got big old titties and a gun.</v>

4509
02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Like they thought women were going to go bananas for that,</v>

4510
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:16.970
<v Speaker 1>that women and they'll go yes and that would be enough to push them over the</v>

4511
02:13:16.971 --> 02:13:17.300
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

4512
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:21.170
<v Speaker 1>They would get all the women votes the same way Obama got a lot of the black</v>

4513
02:13:21.171 --> 02:13:21.650
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>

4514
02:13:21.650 --> 02:13:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people were like,</v>

4515
02:13:22.611 --> 02:13:24.530
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I'm not voting against Obama.</v>

4516
02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:25.610
<v Speaker 1>And people got mad.</v>

4517
02:13:25.611 --> 02:13:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Black people got mad at other black people that were gonna vote for Mccain.</v>

4518
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:34.260
<v Speaker 1>You never saw anybody that was black that had a fucking a Paul Ryan Shirt on,</v>

4519
02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:34.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4520
02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>No one had a Mitt Romney,</v>

4521
02:13:36.091 --> 02:13:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Paul Ryan shirt on.</v>

4522
02:13:37.261 --> 02:13:38.710
<v Speaker 1>That was by maybe a few dudes.</v>

4523
02:13:38.711 --> 02:13:39.810
<v Speaker 1>And just wanted attention.</v>

4524
02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>But if they really thought it through,</v>

4525
02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no way they would have done that.</v>

4526
02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Just seems like a big show to me.</v>

4527
02:13:44.190 --> 02:13:45.790
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's all like a regional edition.</v>

4528
02:13:45.970 --> 02:13:46.803
<v Speaker 1>A big show.</v>

4529
02:13:47.070 --> 02:13:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Almost scripted.</v>

4530
02:13:48.150 --> 02:13:48.983
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a big chunk.</v>

4531
02:13:49.170 --> 02:13:50.370
<v Speaker 1>You know that because they don't,</v>

4532
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:52.140
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any more than two candidates.</v>

4533
02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:55.680
<v Speaker 1>They used to let extra candidates in when they,</v>

4534
02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:57.570
<v Speaker 1>last time they did that was with Ross Perot.</v>

4535
02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.350
<v Speaker 1>He was the last independent and that guy fucked everything up man.</v>

4536
02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Cause he,</v>

4537
02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:04.320
<v Speaker 1>he got his own television show,</v>

4538
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:08.280
<v Speaker 1>he took over NBC like during prime time.</v>

4539
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:11.490
<v Speaker 1>He bought the time and he went on and told everybody,</v>

4540
02:14:11.491 --> 02:14:12.450
<v Speaker 1>how are you getting fucked?</v>

4541
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Told everybody what the Federal Bank is.</v>

4542
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:18.300
<v Speaker 1>And he told everybody where taxes go and told everybody that's insurmountable</v>

4543
02:14:18.301 --> 02:14:20.460
<v Speaker 1>debt and this is how you've been set up and you,</v>

4544
02:14:21.330 --> 02:14:22.770
<v Speaker 1>and he did it on television.</v>

4545
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And because of the fact that he had so much money that he could get away with</v>

4546
02:14:26.491 --> 02:14:29.940
<v Speaker 1>doing shit that traditionally only the Democrats and the Republicans could do.</v>

4547
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:32.550
<v Speaker 1>But all of a sudden there's this independent that's like stealing,</v>

4548
02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:33.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4549
02:14:33.001 --> 02:14:33.391
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

4550
02:14:33.391 --> 02:14:36.270
<v Speaker 1>30% of the vote and it fucked up the whole thing.</v>

4551
02:14:36.450 --> 02:14:39.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's how Bill Clinton became president because they're like,</v>

4552
02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and there you go.</v>

4553
02:14:41.850 --> 02:14:42.391
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

4554
02:14:42.391 --> 02:14:43.200
<v Speaker 1>he ruined everything.</v>

4555
02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.210
<v Speaker 1>So then the commission for presidential debates,</v>

4556
02:14:45.211 --> 02:14:47.880
<v Speaker 1>they changed what it takes to,</v>

4557
02:14:47.881 --> 02:14:48.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4558
02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:51.690
<v Speaker 1>to be able to compete at the highest levels.</v>

4559
02:14:51.691 --> 02:14:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah,</v>

4560
02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:52.500
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4561
02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:53.071
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't,</v>

4562
02:14:53.071 --> 02:14:53.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4563
02:14:53.371 --> 02:14:56.130
<v Speaker 1>they'll let a lot of kooks like when you have like Republicans,</v>

4564
02:14:56.131 --> 02:14:57.210
<v Speaker 1>you have like 10 Republicans,</v>

4565
02:14:57.390 --> 02:15:01.020
<v Speaker 1>they'll let the heroin canes and that they know Herman Cain like that dude fucks</v>

4566
02:15:01.021 --> 02:15:01.561
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

4567
02:15:01.561 --> 02:15:03.480
<v Speaker 1>He's got like 50 bitches on the side.</v>

4568
02:15:03.481 --> 02:15:06.000
<v Speaker 1>He just couldn't keep them from bubbling up under the woodwork.</v>

4569
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4570
02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:07.660
<v Speaker 1>the guy who ran a,</v>

4571
02:15:07.660 --> 02:15:11.100
<v Speaker 1>he ran the pizza company and you see all the different women that came out and</v>

4572
02:15:11.101 --> 02:15:11.934
<v Speaker 1>said he was,</v>

4573
02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:13.013
<v Speaker 1>he was banging them.</v>

4574
02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:14.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4575
02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:16.560
<v Speaker 1>well you can't do that and run for president.</v>

4576
02:15:16.561 --> 02:15:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you can do that and brought a pizza company.</v>

4577
02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:19.980
<v Speaker 1>He totally did it and pulled it off.</v>

4578
02:15:20.190 --> 02:15:22.050
<v Speaker 1>But they know certain shit like that.</v>

4579
02:15:22.051 --> 02:15:23.610
<v Speaker 1>They know guys like not going to get that far.</v>

4580
02:15:23.610 --> 02:15:26.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a little song and dance until they get down to the main guy.</v>

4581
02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:30.360
<v Speaker 1>And there was a couple of main guys and the big main guy was this Mitt Romney</v>

4582
02:15:30.361 --> 02:15:30.930
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

4583
02:15:30.930 --> 02:15:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that Sarah.</v>

4584
02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:34.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was always going to happen the way this way and all the people that</v>

4585
02:15:34.771 --> 02:15:35.970
<v Speaker 1>are in place behind the scenes,</v>

4586
02:15:35.971 --> 02:15:37.290
<v Speaker 1>they all watch it all play out,</v>

4587
02:15:37.291 --> 02:15:41.370
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter who wins the same people are paying those people socially.</v>

4588
02:15:41.371 --> 02:15:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I think we're better off with a guy like Obama.</v>

4589
02:15:43.810 --> 02:15:44.101
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4590
02:15:44.101 --> 02:15:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it gives people hope.</v>

4591
02:15:45.330 --> 02:15:45.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4592
02:15:45.601 --> 02:15:48.540
<v Speaker 1>he's a young black guy from a single mom.</v>

4593
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:50.460
<v Speaker 1>You know that that makes people feel better.</v>

4594
02:15:50.461 --> 02:15:51.990
<v Speaker 1>It makes people believe that hey,</v>

4595
02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:52.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4596
02:15:52.471 --> 02:15:55.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe that racism shit is kind of in the past and maybe,</v>

4597
02:15:55.441 --> 02:15:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4598
02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:56.750
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

4599
02:15:56.750 --> 02:16:00.440
<v Speaker 1>if racism didn't stop a black man from being president like you,</v>

4600
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:01.740
<v Speaker 1>it's surmountable.</v>

4601
02:16:01.741 --> 02:16:02.760
<v Speaker 1>You can overcome this.</v>

4602
02:16:02.970 --> 02:16:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Like this is good example for the culture.</v>

4603
02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:09.810
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is that dude does a lot of the same shit that pushed it.</v>

4604
02:16:10.110 --> 02:16:11.130
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem.</v>

4605
02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:13.170
<v Speaker 1>We thought we were going to get this dude who's like us,</v>

4606
02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but they're still using drones.</v>

4607
02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:18.240
<v Speaker 1>They still got Guantanamo Bay trying to take our guns.</v>

4608
02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:21.120
<v Speaker 1>That's shit is predict all that shit is ridiculous.</v>

4609
02:16:21.121 --> 02:16:23.580
<v Speaker 1>All that clamping down on rights and going,</v>

4610
02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:24.481
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>

4611
02:16:24.481 --> 02:16:24.871
<v Speaker 1>there's not.</v>

4612
02:16:24.871 --> 02:16:25.704
<v Speaker 1>That's not a problem.</v>

4613
02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Put your finger in the air,</v>

4614
02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:27.451
<v Speaker 1>Dee Dee,</v>

4615
02:16:27.451 --> 02:16:29.070
<v Speaker 1>do you see revolution?</v>

4616
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you see problems</v>

4617
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:30.843
<v Speaker 10>in the streets?</v>

4618
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.000
<v Speaker 10>Do you see rampant violence everywhere and our children are unsafe now that's</v>

4619
02:16:36.431 --> 02:16:39.250
<v Speaker 10>not what's happening is that massive terrorist attacks on America.</v>

4620
02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.230
<v Speaker 10>Why do you need to like look at people's email?</v>

4621
02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:44.050
<v Speaker 10>Like why do you need to store every phone call that's ever made?</v>

4622
02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:44.560
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>

4623
02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:45.130
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4624
02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:47.530
<v Speaker 10>don't assume that everyone's fucking crib.</v>

4625
02:16:47.531 --> 02:16:51.920
<v Speaker 10>It'll cause in reality most people are pretty fucking cool the most.</v>

4626
02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.260
<v Speaker 10>The vast majority of people are pretty fucking cool and for you to ruin that</v>

4627
02:16:56.261 --> 02:17:00.400
<v Speaker 10>shit and take it away and take all the fun away out of life,</v>

4628
02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:04.960
<v Speaker 10>just because there's a certain unavoidable percentage of douchebags in the world</v>

4629
02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:06.040
<v Speaker 10>is ridiculous.</v>

4630
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:08.230
<v Speaker 10>Knowing all the fucked up shit.</v>

4631
02:17:08.231 --> 02:17:09.850
<v Speaker 10>The government's been like people high,</v>

4632
02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:10.930
<v Speaker 10>high in the government.</v>

4633
02:17:10.931 --> 02:17:13.300
<v Speaker 10>I'm not talking about your average congressman or anything,</v>

4634
02:17:13.301 --> 02:17:15.850
<v Speaker 10>but the people that are really running shit,</v>

4635
02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:17.770
<v Speaker 10>knowing all the fucked up,</v>

4636
02:17:17.771 --> 02:17:19.030
<v Speaker 10>they shit they've done,</v>

4637
02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:22.290
<v Speaker 10>the JFK staff and all that Gulf of Tonkin wouldn't.</v>

4638
02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:24.670
<v Speaker 10>Do you think the liberties that are,</v>

4639
02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 10>they're taking from us on a daily basis?</v>

4640
02:17:26.770 --> 02:17:28.210
<v Speaker 10>You think that's part of a plan?</v>

4641
02:17:28.211 --> 02:17:29.830
<v Speaker 10>It just seems they're so aggressive with it.</v>

4642
02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:34.980
<v Speaker 10>I think they worry about any sort of an uprising and the best way to keep any</v>

4643
02:17:35.801 --> 02:17:39.010
<v Speaker 10>sort of an uprising from coming to fruition is to nip it in the bud.</v>

4644
02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:42.010
<v Speaker 10>And when you're in a position of power,</v>

4645
02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:42.491
<v Speaker 10>especially,</v>

4646
02:17:42.491 --> 02:17:44.200
<v Speaker 10>it's an undeserved position of power.</v>

4647
02:17:44.201 --> 02:17:47.920
<v Speaker 10>If it turns out that you're using your money to influence politicians and</v>

4648
02:17:47.921 --> 02:17:48.370
<v Speaker 10>you're,</v>

4649
02:17:48.370 --> 02:17:51.790
<v Speaker 10>you're manipulating the system in order to gain an advantage so that it helps</v>

4650
02:17:51.791 --> 02:17:55.480
<v Speaker 10>your business and all that stuff is exposed well that,</v>

4651
02:17:55.481 --> 02:17:56.800
<v Speaker 10>that that should be a crime.</v>

4652
02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.560
<v Speaker 10>That should be way worse than insider trading.</v>

4653
02:17:59.710 --> 02:18:00.221
<v Speaker 10>That should be.</v>

4654
02:18:00.221 --> 02:18:00.791
<v Speaker 10>But meanwhile,</v>

4655
02:18:00.791 --> 02:18:02.530
<v Speaker 10>it's standard operational procedure.</v>

4656
02:18:03.250 --> 02:18:05.890
<v Speaker 10>And when there's any sort of a threat to that,</v>

4657
02:18:05.891 --> 02:18:08.440
<v Speaker 10>they're going to try to stop that threat in advance.</v>

4658
02:18:08.470 --> 02:18:11.710
<v Speaker 10>And one of the best ways to stop that threat and advance it's fear.</v>

4659
02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:14.290
<v Speaker 10>Make people scared to speak out,</v>

4660
02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:15.730
<v Speaker 10>make people scared to act.</v>

4661
02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:20.140
<v Speaker 10>And one of the best ways to make people scared is to give yourself God like</v>

4662
02:18:20.141 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 10>powers.</v>

4663
02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:22.270
<v Speaker 10>Give yourself the ability to just,</v>

4664
02:18:22.271 --> 02:18:27.271
<v Speaker 10>I can take this person and lock them in that cage and never let them out ever.</v>

4665
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:29.770
<v Speaker 10>And that's what the NDA says.</v>

4666
02:18:30.010 --> 02:18:31.330
<v Speaker 10>That's crazy.</v>

4667
02:18:31.530 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 10>Cause even Hitler would've got a trial.</v>

4668
02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:34.240
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

4669
02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.380
<v Speaker 10>If we had captured Hitler and supposedly in no Searle soldier had gone crazy and</v>

4670
02:18:38.381 --> 02:18:39.214
<v Speaker 10>shot him in the head,</v>

4671
02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:40.450
<v Speaker 10>which is probably unlikely,</v>

4672
02:18:40.451 --> 02:18:41.770
<v Speaker 10>they probably would have shot him just like they did.</v>

4673
02:18:41.771 --> 02:18:42.604
<v Speaker 10>Kadafi right.</v>

4674
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.170
<v Speaker 10>But if we did capture him,</v>

4675
02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:45.610
<v Speaker 10>they would have given Hitler a trial.</v>

4676
02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:48.520
<v Speaker 10>And what they're saying is you,</v>

4677
02:18:48.550 --> 02:18:51.400
<v Speaker 10>this average person that they decide to detain,</v>

4678
02:18:51.610 --> 02:18:56.610
<v Speaker 10>they can choose to use tactics on you that they would have used that Hitler,</v>

4679
02:18:57.670 --> 02:19:00.160
<v Speaker 10>they can choose to just lock you up and definitely,</v>

4680
02:19:00.161 --> 02:19:01.960
<v Speaker 10>and not give you access to lawyers.</v>

4681
02:19:02.410 --> 02:19:03.820
<v Speaker 10>That's not good for anybody.</v>

4682
02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:06.010
<v Speaker 10>And that's not American.</v>

4683
02:19:06.130 --> 02:19:07.660
<v Speaker 10>That's not what we're supposed to be about.</v>

4684
02:19:07.661 --> 02:19:09.220
<v Speaker 10>And you can't have that kind of power.</v>

4685
02:19:09.550 --> 02:19:12.250
<v Speaker 10>And that's exactly what's happening in Egypt right now.</v>

4686
02:19:12.251 --> 02:19:12.491
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

4687
02:19:12.491 --> 02:19:16.930
<v Speaker 10>they let this new dude in in Egypt and now 200,000 people are rallying in the</v>

4688
02:19:16.931 --> 02:19:21.931
<v Speaker 10>streets trying to get this guy to get out of office because he changed the laws.</v>

4689
02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:24.490
<v Speaker 10>He made it so you can't arrest him.</v>

4690
02:19:24.491 --> 02:19:25.890
<v Speaker 10>He can't be tried for anything.</v>

4691
02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:27.360
<v Speaker 10>He just turned himself into a god.</v>

4692
02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:29.010
<v Speaker 10>He just got in there and then they went,</v>

4693
02:19:29.011 --> 02:19:29.611
<v Speaker 10>fuck you.</v>

4694
02:19:29.611 --> 02:19:29.911
<v Speaker 10>We just,</v>

4695
02:19:29.911 --> 02:19:31.080
<v Speaker 10>we already been through this shit.</v>

4696
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.261
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

4697
02:19:31.261 --> 02:19:32.220
<v Speaker 10>you can't do that.</v>

4698
02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:37.820
<v Speaker 10>They all get to the point of governing and I think the possibility of being</v>

4699
02:19:38.341 --> 02:19:42.360
<v Speaker 10>overthrown by some completely new organization is terrifying for them.</v>

4700
02:19:42.690 --> 02:19:47.400
<v Speaker 10>What if like the Green party all of a sudden took off in this country and what</v>

4701
02:19:47.401 --> 02:19:52.230
<v Speaker 10>if it was like the Green Party became the number one party in the country?</v>

4702
02:19:52.410 --> 02:19:52.561
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

4703
02:19:52.561 --> 02:19:52.850
<v Speaker 10>look,</v>

4704
02:19:52.850 --> 02:19:54.360
<v Speaker 10>look how many people go to wholefoods?</v>

4705
02:19:54.450 --> 02:19:55.020
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>

4706
02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:56.430
<v Speaker 10>look how many people want to recycle.</v>

4707
02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:56.731
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>

4708
02:19:56.731 --> 02:20:00.210
<v Speaker 10>what does that shit spreads would've had spreads and all of a sudden the Green</v>

4709
02:20:00.211 --> 02:20:03.000
<v Speaker 10>party becomes the prominent party in this country.</v>

4710
02:20:03.090 --> 02:20:06.630
<v Speaker 10>When we realize that we're poisoning our food and poison our water and poisoning</v>

4711
02:20:06.631 --> 02:20:08.490
<v Speaker 10>the ocean and killing all the fish.</v>

4712
02:20:08.491 --> 02:20:11.400
<v Speaker 10>And if they ever did get to that position,</v>

4713
02:20:11.401 --> 02:20:14.880
<v Speaker 10>that would be a terrible loss of power for the Republicans,</v>

4714
02:20:14.881 --> 02:20:17.250
<v Speaker 10>the Democrats and all the corporations that support them.</v>

4715
02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:20.220
<v Speaker 10>If the public's opinion changed.</v>

4716
02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:25.340
<v Speaker 10>And people really did get behind a party that was independent and not reliant</v>

4717
02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:27.870
<v Speaker 10>whatsoever on corporations,</v>

4718
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:30.090
<v Speaker 10>that would be fucking terrifying to the powers that be.</v>

4719
02:20:30.091 --> 02:20:32.940
<v Speaker 10>Instead of going around making billions and billions of dollars a year,</v>

4720
02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:34.920
<v Speaker 10>traveled around a fat yachts,</v>

4721
02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:36.053
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4722
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:38.490
<v Speaker 10>banging supermodels and then cut their heads off.</v>

4723
02:20:38.610 --> 02:20:39.810
<v Speaker 10>Instead of doing that,</v>

4724
02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:41.610
<v Speaker 10>you would make nothing.</v>

4725
02:20:42.270 --> 02:20:43.830
<v Speaker 10>You wouldn't be in power anymore.</v>

4726
02:20:44.010 --> 02:20:47.190
<v Speaker 10>Your corporations would have to stand up on the merit of the products that they</v>

4727
02:20:47.191 --> 02:20:47.850
<v Speaker 10>sell,</v>

4728
02:20:47.850 --> 02:20:52.850
<v Speaker 10>not on your ability to change laws so that you can make products cheaper and in</v>

4729
02:20:53.671 --> 02:20:55.410
<v Speaker 10>the meantime ruin the earth.</v>

4730
02:20:56.010 --> 02:20:58.800
<v Speaker 10>And that's a terrifying thing for those fuck heads.</v>

4731
02:20:58.950 --> 02:21:01.290
<v Speaker 10>So what they try to do is take away your rights,</v>

4732
02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:03.090
<v Speaker 10>take away your right to express yourself,</v>

4733
02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:06.240
<v Speaker 10>be able to come in and shut down your website at any point in time.</v>

4734
02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:07.440
<v Speaker 10>No file sharing.</v>

4735
02:21:07.441 --> 02:21:08.450
<v Speaker 10>I don't what the fuck you're sending.</v>

4736
02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:08.640
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

4737
02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:08.771
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4738
02:21:08.771 --> 02:21:08.851
<v Speaker 10>no.</v>

4739
02:21:08.851 --> 02:21:09.750
<v Speaker 10>I've got to look at that shit.</v>

4740
02:21:09.970 --> 02:21:10.331
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

4741
02:21:10.331 --> 02:21:10.551
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4742
02:21:10.551 --> 02:21:10.631
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4743
02:21:10.631 --> 02:21:10.741
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4744
02:21:10.741 --> 02:21:10.870
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4745
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.971
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4746
02:21:10.971 --> 02:21:11.051
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4747
02:21:11.051 --> 02:21:11.161
<v Speaker 10>no.</v>

4748
02:21:11.161 --> 02:21:13.190
<v Speaker 10>I gotta be able to look at everybody's email at anytime.</v>

4749
02:21:13.230 --> 02:21:14.790
<v Speaker 10>This is a matter of national security.</v>

4750
02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:16.260
<v Speaker 10>We are the government.</v>

4751
02:21:16.261 --> 02:21:21.261
<v Speaker 10>This is the Homeland Security Department of security of the mothers and the</v>

4752
02:21:21.541 --> 02:21:22.830
<v Speaker 10>children of this country.</v>

4753
02:21:23.070 --> 02:21:24.840
<v Speaker 10>And I have to look at a few emails.</v>

4754
02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:25.551
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to do it.</v>

4755
02:21:25.551 --> 02:21:26.384
<v Speaker 10>God Damn it.</v>

4756
02:21:26.970 --> 02:21:28.440
<v Speaker 10>And that's where we find ourselves.</v>

4757
02:21:28.441 --> 02:21:32.880
<v Speaker 10>We find ourselves in this ridiculous position where we're clearly being run by</v>

4758
02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:33.310
<v Speaker 10>fuckheads.</v>

4759
02:21:33.310 --> 02:21:38.130
<v Speaker 10>How realistic is Texas from actually seceding from the nation going to happen?</v>

4760
02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:40.080
<v Speaker 10>There's no way it's not going to happen,</v>

4761
02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:41.371
<v Speaker 10>but meanwhile,</v>

4762
02:21:41.371 --> 02:21:43.370
<v Speaker 10>Texas doesn't give a fuck taxes.</v>

4763
02:21:43.470 --> 02:21:47.880
<v Speaker 10>They're supposedly constitutionally being one of the few countries or cities</v>

4764
02:21:47.881 --> 02:21:50.160
<v Speaker 10>were con states states that can,</v>

4765
02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:53.730
<v Speaker 10>because I think technically they view themselves as a republic.</v>

4766
02:21:54.210 --> 02:21:54.670
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

4767
02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:57.540
<v Speaker 10>I think maybe all other states do as well,</v>

4768
02:21:57.660 --> 02:22:01.020
<v Speaker 10>but from what I understood the way they're the TX,</v>

4769
02:22:01.050 --> 02:22:04.290
<v Speaker 10>Texas state declaration or they're,</v>

4770
02:22:04.310 --> 02:22:04.590
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

4771
02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:06.120
<v Speaker 10>whatever the fuck their constitution is,</v>

4772
02:22:06.121 --> 02:22:07.980
<v Speaker 10>whatever the fuck that states have,</v>

4773
02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:09.780
<v Speaker 10>th th the defines themselves,</v>

4774
02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:13.050
<v Speaker 10>they define themselves slightly different than most dates and they,</v>

4775
02:22:13.051 --> 02:22:13.201
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

4776
02:22:13.201 --> 02:22:15.240
<v Speaker 10>they believe that they're their own sort of situation.</v>

4777
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:17.440
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

4778
02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:21.480

4779
02:22:22.110 --> 02:22:23.460

02:22:52.871 --> 02:22:52.991
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4804
02:22:52.991 --> 02:22:53.111
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4805
02:22:53.111 --> 02:22:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Austin's that strong enough.</v>

4806
02:22:54.131 --> 02:22:54.611
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4807
02:22:54.611 --> 02:22:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Austin is probably the best place,</v>

4808
02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:02.520
<v Speaker 1>like socially and liberally and intellectually.</v>

4809
02:23:02.891 --> 02:23:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best places in the country and it's,</v>

4810
02:23:05.431 --> 02:23:09.190
<v Speaker 1>it's the best place in Texas for like free thinking or free thinkers,</v>

4811
02:23:09.191 --> 02:23:10.300
<v Speaker 1>open minded people.</v>

4812
02:23:10.570 --> 02:23:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4813
02:23:11.050 --> 02:23:11.980
<v Speaker 1>well read people,</v>

4814
02:23:11.981 --> 02:23:15.910
<v Speaker 1>people that are hip people at turn tuned in to what the fuck is going on in the</v>

4815
02:23:15.911 --> 02:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

4816
02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:19.810
<v Speaker 1>But they're surrounded by silly people.</v>

4817
02:23:19.870 --> 02:23:20.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4818
02:23:20.111 --> 02:23:20.381
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

4819
02:23:20.381 --> 02:23:23.620
<v Speaker 1>there's people all around like the middle of Texas and crazy places.</v>

4820
02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:27.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lot of like churches and people are nutty and they're,</v>

4821
02:23:27.341 --> 02:23:31.600
<v Speaker 1>they're doing exorcisms and it's like a sexist is a mix,</v>

4822
02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:32.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4823
02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:33.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a mix of really quick.</v>

4824
02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Like Houston's really cool at Dallas is really cool.</v>

4825
02:23:35.561 --> 02:23:40.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a mix of like a lot of really cool spots and the spots when you drive to</v>

4826
02:23:40.181 --> 02:23:44.790
<v Speaker 1>the really cool spots and you go through hours and hours of these backwoodsy</v>

4827
02:23:44.791 --> 02:23:46.030
<v Speaker 1>type towns and you're like,</v>

4828
02:23:46.031 --> 02:23:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4829
02:23:47.430 --> 02:23:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4830
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:49.570
<v Speaker 1>what have you were born here?</v>

4831
02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:51.100
<v Speaker 1>What if you were born there?</v>

4832
02:23:51.101 --> 02:23:52.210
<v Speaker 1>And Eddie Bravo had to grow up.</v>

4833
02:23:52.211 --> 02:23:52.690
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4834
02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:54.100
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

4835
02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of spots that soc,</v>

4836
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:59.380
<v Speaker 1>and the problem is those people get devote too.</v>

4837
02:23:59.830 --> 02:24:02.470
<v Speaker 1>So shit like medical marijuana does not pass.</v>

4838
02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:06.580
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why it doesn't pass is that civilization hasn't spread through</v>

4839
02:24:06.581 --> 02:24:07.510
<v Speaker 1>the entire state.</v>

4840
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:11.050
<v Speaker 1>It's only in pockets of intensive course.</v>

4841
02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4842
02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they've tried.</v>

4843
02:24:12.821 --> 02:24:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone's picked him.</v>

4844
02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Forgive me if I'm wrong,</v>

4845
02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:19.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure someone's tried to come up with some sort of legislation,</v>

4846
02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:20.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's never been like officially on the ballot.</v>

4847
02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4848
02:24:21.730 --> 02:24:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4849
02:24:22.270 --> 02:24:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4850
02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:23.171
<v Speaker 1>but I know that it,</v>

4851
02:24:23.171 --> 02:24:23.411
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4852
02:24:23.411 --> 02:24:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it just lost in Oregon,</v>

4853
02:24:24.911 --> 02:24:26.170
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty surprising,</v>

4854
02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but it might sometimes it's the way the,</v>

4855
02:24:28.031 --> 02:24:28.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4856
02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:30.550
<v Speaker 1>the language is written on the law.</v>

4857
02:24:30.700 --> 02:24:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes they get stupid with the language,</v>

4858
02:24:33.310 --> 02:24:34.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4859
02:24:34.210 --> 02:24:35.620
<v Speaker 1>and you can flip 16 year olds,</v>

4860
02:24:35.621 --> 02:24:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4861
02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:37.510
<v Speaker 1>they throw something in,</v>

4862
02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:39.493
<v Speaker 1>be</v>

4863
02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:42.670
<v Speaker 1>nice just to come back.</v>

4864
02:24:43.810 --> 02:24:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the language of the law was,</v>

4865
02:24:45.371 --> 02:24:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but I would've thought Oregon,</v>

4866
02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:47.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4867
02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.430
<v Speaker 1>be in Portland and all that.</v>

4868
02:24:48.431 --> 02:24:48.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4869
02:24:48.671 --> 02:24:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Portland is pretty fucking hip.</v>

4870
02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:51.290
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4871
02:24:51.290 --> 02:24:51.820
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>

4872
02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:52.990
<v Speaker 1>one of the spots I would live.</v>

4873
02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I would live in Portland if I,</v>

4874
02:24:55.571 --> 02:24:56.081
<v Speaker 1>if I had to,</v>

4875
02:24:56.081 --> 02:24:57.640
<v Speaker 1>for some reason to get out of California.</v>

4876
02:24:57.660 --> 02:24:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Portland is a good spot.</v>

4877
02:24:58.830 --> 02:25:00.760
<v Speaker 1>The very cool people at things a lot though.</v>

4878
02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Rain's like a motherfucker drove Salami back.</v>

4911
02:25:37.031 --> 02:25:41.290
<v Speaker 10>there's a gray that happens in Boston for a few months during the winter that</v>

4912
02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:44.740
<v Speaker 10>dulls the happiness of the people and it's palpable.</v>

4913
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:46.420
<v Speaker 10>You can sense that shit in the air.</v>

4914
02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:47.680
<v Speaker 10>When the gray is there,</v>

4915
02:25:47.681 --> 02:25:49.600
<v Speaker 10>the gray of the January gray,</v>

4916
02:25:49.601 --> 02:25:50.111
<v Speaker 10>the February.</v>

4917
02:25:50.111 --> 02:25:53.230
<v Speaker 10>Occasionally you get a nice sunny day like wow.</v>

<v Speaker 10>Beautiful Day to day,</v>

02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:56.500
<v Speaker 10>step outsides three fucking degrees.</v>

<v Speaker 10>That shit.</v>

4921
02:25:58.510 --> 02:25:59.980
<v Speaker 10>That shit wears away at you man.</v>

4922
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:05.680
<v Speaker 10>Salami made up a good story and I was wondering about that man because people</v>

4923
02:26:05.681 --> 02:26:07.300
<v Speaker 10>will always bullshit you about that.</v>

4924
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:08.980
<v Speaker 10>They'll never tell you like,</v>

4925
02:26:08.981 --> 02:26:09.970
<v Speaker 10>what's it like up here man?</v>

4929
02:26:11.891 --> 02:26:12.341

4931
02:26:14.441 --> 02:26:15.020
<v Speaker 10>I don't know man.</v>

4932
02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:16.090
<v Speaker 10>Maybe there's a bad idea.</v>

02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:17.380
<v Speaker 10>It's awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 10>It's the best choice.</v>

4936
02:26:19.330 --> 02:26:20.230
<v Speaker 10>I made the best choice,</v>

4937
02:26:20.231 --> 02:26:20.800
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

4938
02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:22.480
<v Speaker 10>I'm so happy you should move up here to,</v>

4939
02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:25.120

4943
02:26:29.741 --> 02:26:30.670
<v Speaker 10>I don't know what to do.</v>

4944
02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:32.230
<v Speaker 10>Thinking about going back to Arizona,</v>

4945
02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:36.370
<v Speaker 10>what did his testimony influenced me?</v>

4946
02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:37.210
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

4947
02:26:37.210 --> 02:26:38.050
<v Speaker 10>son of a bitch.</v>

4948
02:26:38.510 --> 02:26:39.430
<v Speaker 10>They didn't even make it.</v>

4949
02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:41.141
<v Speaker 10>He had a school up there,</v>

4950
02:26:41.141 --> 02:26:41.341
<v Speaker 10>right.</v>

4951
02:26:41.341 --> 02:26:43.480
<v Speaker 10>It wasn't he running a 10th planet because he has his black pot now.</v>

4952
02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:45.610
<v Speaker 10>He has a black belt in the G.</v>

4953
02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:46.890
<v Speaker 10>Does he really under that?</v>

4954
02:26:47.290 --> 02:26:48.123
<v Speaker 10>Oh Wow.</v>

4955
02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:48.981
<v Speaker 10>Salami.</v>

4956
02:26:48.981 --> 02:26:49.814
<v Speaker 10>Such a good dude.</v>

4957
02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:50.050
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

4958
02:26:50.050 --> 02:26:50.771
<v Speaker 10>he's a friendly guy,</v>

4959
02:26:50.771 --> 02:26:51.550
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

4960
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:53.710
<v Speaker 10>Even if he's a lying motherfucker about the climate.</v>

4961
02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:57.400
<v Speaker 10>Maybe he liked it initially and then it just wore down on them.</v>

4962
02:26:57.550 --> 02:26:58.031
<v Speaker 10>I think.</v>

4963
02:26:58.031 --> 02:26:58.480
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

4964
02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:00.790
<v Speaker 10>I think especially if you live in California,</v>

4965
02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:02.740
<v Speaker 10>it would be really hard to go to a place.</v>

4966
02:27:02.741 --> 02:27:03.940
<v Speaker 10>It rained all the time.</v>

4967
02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:04.990
<v Speaker 10>Really?</v>

4968
02:27:04.990 --> 02:27:06.190
<v Speaker 10>The rain sometimes.</v>

4969
02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:06.941
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

4970
02:27:06.941 --> 02:27:10.480
<v Speaker 10>the one thing that it's amazing for is the vegetation God,</v>

4971
02:27:10.481 --> 02:27:11.860
<v Speaker 10>their forests out there.</v>

4972
02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:12.940
<v Speaker 10>When you go,</v>

4973
02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:13.930
<v Speaker 10>if you've ever been on a hike,</v>

4974
02:27:13.931 --> 02:27:15.310
<v Speaker 10>like through the Pacific rain forest,</v>

4975
02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:17.651
<v Speaker 10>you ever been like,</v>

4976
02:27:17.651 --> 02:27:17.830
<v Speaker 10>no.</v>

4977
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:18.190
<v Speaker 10>Walk,</v>

4978
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:19.001
<v Speaker 10>walked around.</v>

4979
02:27:19.001 --> 02:27:20.280
<v Speaker 10>Like if we go to the redwood forest,</v>

4980
02:27:20.310 --> 02:27:21.143
<v Speaker 10>ever do that?</v>

4981
02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:24.220
<v Speaker 10>Maybe as a child you got to do that.</v>

4982
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:25.810
<v Speaker 10>Then at the same thing,</v>

4983
02:27:25.811 --> 02:27:26.644
<v Speaker 10>redwoods the,</v>

4984
02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:27.760
<v Speaker 10>I don't think so.</v>

4985
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:29.170
<v Speaker 10>I think sequoia is a different thing,</v>

4986
02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:29.710
<v Speaker 10>but they're,</v>

4987
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:30.341
<v Speaker 10>they're huge too,</v>

4988
02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:31.060
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

4989
02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:32.710
<v Speaker 10>It's not the idea as a kid,</v>

4990
02:27:33.050 --> 02:27:34.970
<v Speaker 10>but the those forests,</v>

4991
02:27:34.971 --> 02:27:35.261
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>

4992
02:27:35.261 --> 02:27:39.700
<v Speaker 10>those crazy like rain forest and like Washington stay where it rains constantly.</v>

4993
02:27:40.210 --> 02:27:41.043
<v Speaker 10>Dude,</v>

4994
02:27:41.050 --> 02:27:45.550
<v Speaker 10>that that's a different feeling when you're walking through that kind of life.</v>

4995
02:27:45.870 --> 02:27:50.590
<v Speaker 10>Like there's so much vegetation life around you that as you're like you're,</v>

4996
02:27:50.591 --> 02:27:54.040
<v Speaker 10>you're in that there's like this bright green forest.</v>

4997
02:27:54.370 --> 02:27:59.370
<v Speaker 10>You kind of understand where all the old myths of like fairies and elves and</v>

4998
02:28:00.251 --> 02:28:05.251
<v Speaker 10>would sprites appearing because as you're walking there's so much energy in the</v>

4999
02:28:05.891 --> 02:28:09.580
<v Speaker 10>air that you're almost thinking someone's watching you the almost looking at</v>

5000
02:28:09.581 --> 02:28:13.120
<v Speaker 10>trees and shit and thinking their period at you and looking back at you because</v>

5001
02:28:13.121 --> 02:28:14.050
<v Speaker 10>you're feeling,</v>

5002
02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:16.750
<v Speaker 10>you're sensing that there's other life there.</v>

5003
02:28:16.810 --> 02:28:21.130
<v Speaker 10>You're sensing it because there's this incredible wealth of vegetation.</v>

5004
02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:23.180
<v Speaker 10>It fucking rains every day.</v>

5005
02:28:23.330 --> 02:28:26.150
<v Speaker 10>The grass is glowing green.</v>

5006
02:28:26.390 --> 02:28:27.190
<v Speaker 10>I mean the glass,</v>

5007
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:30.560
<v Speaker 10>the grass and Oregon is like neon green.</v>

5008
02:28:30.650 --> 02:28:31.880
<v Speaker 10>It's beautiful.</v>

5009
02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:33.740
<v Speaker 10>Like just looking at the grass was like,</v>

5010
02:28:33.741 --> 02:28:34.610
<v Speaker 10>wow,</v>

5011
02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:37.280
<v Speaker 10>I never fucking saw grass like that in studio city.</v>

5012
02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:42.490
<v Speaker 10>That grass is dry and gray and all fucked up and brown that Portland grass is</v>

5013
02:28:43.101 --> 02:28:43.934
<v Speaker 10>alive.</v>

5014
02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:45.740
<v Speaker 10>And if you walk into those woods,</v>

5015
02:28:45.741 --> 02:28:46.400
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>

5016
02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:50.900
<v Speaker 10>there's something about those dense rain forest that give off this weird sort of</v>

5017
02:28:50.901 --> 02:28:54.650
<v Speaker 10>feeling cause it's strange silence and you hear animals.</v>

5018
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:55.650
<v Speaker 10>But like the sign,</v>

5019
02:28:55.680 --> 02:29:00.350
<v Speaker 10>it's a weird sound because there's so much vegetation that it's like being in a</v>

5020
02:29:00.351 --> 02:29:02.540
<v Speaker 10>room that's like stuffed with things.</v>

5021
02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:04.940
<v Speaker 10>Like there's not little sound doesn't travel the same way.</v>

5022
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:07.790
<v Speaker 10>It's not like being in a place where you're on top of a hill and you overlook</v>

5023
02:29:07.791 --> 02:29:08.391
<v Speaker 10>canyons.</v>

5024
02:29:08.391 --> 02:29:08.870
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

5025
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:12.680
<v Speaker 10>you're walking through this dense thing that feels like you're inside of a</v>

5026
02:29:12.681 --> 02:29:13.670
<v Speaker 10>living thing.</v>

5027
02:29:14.270 --> 02:29:17.540
<v Speaker 10>And it is that rain forest is like a living thing.</v>

5028
02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:18.231
<v Speaker 10>In fact,</v>

5029
02:29:18.231 --> 02:29:22.160
<v Speaker 10>the Pacific rain forest has the biggest single organism on the face of the</v>

5030
02:29:22.161 --> 02:29:22.670
<v Speaker 10>earth.</v>

5031
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:27.020
<v Speaker 10>There's a mushroom colony and the Pacific northwest that's so enormous.</v>

5032
02:29:27.021 --> 02:29:29.630
<v Speaker 10>It's bigger than like x amount of blue whales.</v>

5033
02:29:29.810 --> 02:29:30.560
<v Speaker 10>It's huge.</v>

5034
02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:31.700
<v Speaker 10>And it's this connection,</v>

5035
02:29:31.850 --> 02:29:33.050
<v Speaker 10>like almost like a,</v>

5036
02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:33.440
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

5037
02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:36.030
<v Speaker 10>like a neural connection underneath the,</v>

5038
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.910
<v Speaker 10>like in the,</v>

5039
02:29:36.910 --> 02:29:37.840
<v Speaker 10>the way it's worked in,</v>

5040
02:29:37.841 --> 02:29:38.750
<v Speaker 10>in the ground,</v>

5041
02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:39.450
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

5042
02:29:39.450 --> 02:29:39.981
<v Speaker 10>in the,</v>

5043
02:29:39.981 --> 02:29:41.020
<v Speaker 10>in this entire area,</v>

5044
02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:41.871
<v Speaker 10>load a mushroom,</v>

5045
02:29:41.871 --> 02:29:44.480
<v Speaker 10>but it's one giant organism here.</v>

5046
02:29:44.481 --> 02:29:46.120
<v Speaker 10>I better Google this because there's,</v>

5047
02:29:46.270 --> 02:29:46.600
<v Speaker 10>it's a,</v>

5048
02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:48.120
<v Speaker 10>it's very hard to describe it.</v>

5049
02:29:48.170 --> 02:29:49.280
<v Speaker 10>Like a giant mushroom.</v>

5050
02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:50.473
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5051
02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:53.150
<v Speaker 10>Well it'll take bites out of it.</v>

5052
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:54.471
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

5053
02:29:54.471 --> 02:29:56.950
<v Speaker 10>but there's a fuck load of mushrooms up there,</v>

5054
02:29:56.980 --> 02:29:57.280
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

5055
02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:00.400
<v Speaker 10>You hear about those people that died in la or California recently.</v>

5056
02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:02.970
<v Speaker 10>A bunch of people are dying from eating poisonous my shirt.</v>

5057
02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:06.110
<v Speaker 10>There's a lot of people that try to like go,</v>

5058
02:30:06.111 --> 02:30:08.330
<v Speaker 10>like hunting for edible mushrooms.</v>

5059
02:30:08.331 --> 02:30:11.750
<v Speaker 10>It's like a hobby with a lot of people because you can find like some delicious</v>

5060
02:30:11.751 --> 02:30:12.920
<v Speaker 10>mushrooms in the wild.</v>

5061
02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:14.690
<v Speaker 10>But if you're all get high just to,</v>

5062
02:30:14.691 --> 02:30:14.990
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

5063
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:15.650
<v Speaker 10>just to eat.</v>

5064
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:18.650
<v Speaker 10>But if you're old and you can't see this cook,</v>

5065
02:30:18.651 --> 02:30:18.860
<v Speaker 10>Cook.</v>
