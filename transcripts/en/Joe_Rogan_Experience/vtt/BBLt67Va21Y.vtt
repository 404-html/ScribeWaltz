<v Speaker 1>I thought you brought me on to talk </v>

13
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:34.261
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's trump get onto that.</v>

14
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's talking about politics these </v>

15
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God important thing.</v>

16
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>We should bring it up because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I.</v>

17
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:48.141
<v Speaker 1>I went on a few celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter pages and I was like freaking </v>

18
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:49.270
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freaking out.</v>

19
00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 1>They won't shut the fuck up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nonstop.</v>

20
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And half of it is almost like,</v>

21
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I think like they want everyone to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're upset.</v>

22
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.930
<v Speaker 1>They want everyone to know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the upset people and they're,</v>

23
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>they're not one of the make America </v>
<v Speaker 1>great again.</v>

24
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>People they promote that they're upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I promote a live show.</v>

25
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I want people to know where they're at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they stand on it was this one </v>

26
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.411
<v Speaker 1>female comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to her page every now and then and </v>

27
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I just go Jesus Christ to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost want to send a dm just like you</v>

28
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 1>gotta chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just relax,</v>

29
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just see what is happening with </v>

30
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Amy Schumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

31
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>so anti trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't,</v>

32
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>you can't make it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

33
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>that part of the act like we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting in tickets and people just like </v>

34
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>walking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she keeps harping on it.</v>

35
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways to look at is one way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people will say they have a voice </v>

37
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and if they have a voice it needs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

38
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to use that voice to get the </v>

39
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>word out.</v>

40
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Not at a comedy show though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to cut you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

42
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.000
<v Speaker 1>but make me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even call her a bitch.</v>

43
00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.770
<v Speaker 1>She would call herself a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

44
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>This back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would.</v>

45
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like way more.</v>

46
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 1>She's way more like political in </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist now than ever before.</v>

47
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to the old amy Schumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was on,</v>

48
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:10.870
<v Speaker 1>like opie and Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't into that at all.</v>

49
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like one of the guys that was </v>

50
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>like a selling point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she was still May.</v>

51
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 1>She got a little older and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

52
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about them and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the platform for it.</v>

53
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't write well if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be really funny.</v>

54
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have like an anti Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump joke,</v>

55
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:26.830
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

56
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be just like,</v>

57
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>there's no room for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it used to be that comics could </v>

58
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.151
<v Speaker 1>have like these rants where they made </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really important points inside of </v>

59
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>funding wouldn't be funny and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of accepted it.</v>

60
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.320
<v Speaker 1>But that's what a podcast is for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This a new world.</v>

61
00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>We live in a new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to a,</v>

62
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an action movie.</v>

63
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to an action movie to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massage.</v>

64
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden when you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual movie,</v>

65
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 1>someone comes over and massage you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>

66
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to relax?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be less tense because you're</v>

67
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>really concerned about this action film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really relevant.</v>

68
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It was like watching a porno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit about the story I've</v>

69
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>asked through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

70
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I fast forward to the good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

71
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like I need them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people do like the story with the </v>

72
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.980
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want these people to be in love or </v>

73
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>they want them to be escaping a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and mommy issues.</v>

74
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:23.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying there's a place in time </v>

75
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:25.411
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you see Dave Chappelle on </v>

76
00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:25.411
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny time.</v>

77
00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Made a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

78
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also supportive is brilliant.</v>

79
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>He a master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a master.</v>

80
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also a very sincere person.</v>

81
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that is driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>me crazy about a lot of this tweeting </v>

82
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.081
<v Speaker 1>and craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was in New York City for the </v>

83
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:46.171
<v Speaker 1>fights and me and my friend campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the gym and young Jamie was </v>

84
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:51.421
<v Speaker 1>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you weren't with us when we were </v>

85
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>stuck in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the swarm of humans with just me and </v>

86
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>cam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to the gym,</v>

87
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on our way back,</v>

88
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.670
<v Speaker 1>the protest had marched through the area</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we walked through and all of a </v>

89
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>sudden we couldn't go anywhere.</v>

90
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>It was just jammed with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're literally shoulder to shoulder</v>

91
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>with people like just everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>touching everybody.</v>

92
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>There's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to deal with it.</v>

93
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:12.931
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the reasons why a fanny </v>

94
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:15.391
<v Speaker 1>pack is so important folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you keep your money in your </v>

95
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:15.391
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

96
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's pickpocket and zipped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My shirt goes over.</v>

97
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.220
<v Speaker 1>That sentence is going to know to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

98
00:04:19.221 --> 00:04:24.221
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take some work because </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickpockets do go to those things you </v>

99
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>need to be aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're one of those super lefties.</v>

100
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 1>It likes to go going down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit checked.</v>

101
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>So while we're walking this one guy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this perfectly manicured beard,</v>

102
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:38.221
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a really nice like wool jacket </v>

103
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:38.221
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

104
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>He was obviously like a wealthy liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>character and he's screaming out.</v>

105
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean screaming in my fucking ear.</v>

106
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>He's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

107
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>he's touching me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's touching me.</v>

108
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>The shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racist,</v>

110
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't stop.</v>

111
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't stop partying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of me wanting to go,</v>

112
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you just like if you want to go in</v>

<v Speaker 1>the protests in the street,</v>

114
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 1>like you're on the sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the protest,</v>

115
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the answer because some </v>

116

<v Speaker 1>noncommittal shit you're doing like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be out in the be all in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>somehow or another,</v>

142
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>the way to get them back is to rape his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife or even to suggest raping his wife.</v>

143

<v Speaker 1>That's just what a comedian would say.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're just as disgusting as the people </v>

174
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.181
<v Speaker 1>who voted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That people will actually expect me to </v>

175
00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:54.671
<v Speaker 1>move or just as disgusting as the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who voted for that anti gay woman hater </v>

176
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever she called them,</v>

177
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.670
<v Speaker 1>but series of insults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just so upset and then obviously </v>

178
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.380
<v Speaker 1>she's performing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's doing theaters in stadiums,</v>

179
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>even bigger arenas.</v>

180
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's killing it.</v>

181
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.140
<v Speaker 1>She's been to Kennedy Election Day sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

182
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>here's what you need to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do,</v>

183
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

184
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>if you do wind up moving to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you move to Canada,</v>

185
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you realize that Canada has a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar immigration policy to a Donald </v>

186
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Trump is proposing strict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strict.</v>

187
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly difficult to immigrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Canada.</v>

188
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't just do it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just go over there and all of </v>

189
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.121
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe for Amy Schumer and you've </v>

190
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:40.121
<v Speaker 1>got some cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's still straight.</v>

191
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize how strict it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking strict.</v>

192
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to go to Cayman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

193
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially very similar to a </v>

194
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is proposing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing about Canada and I love</v>

195
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan.</v>

196
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>They're like some of my favorite people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

197
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.490
<v Speaker 1>When you go to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a drunk driving thing on </v>

198
00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>your record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get in.</v>

199
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.260
<v Speaker 1>They fucking send you home habits all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time to deal with the UFC too with </v>

200
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:08.470
<v Speaker 1>American fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have anything you the chance to </v>

201
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.470
<v Speaker 1>be getting up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting cleared.</v>

202
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Customs as strict as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Kevin James got into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:17.031

<v Speaker 1>was younger and I believe he was,</v>

205
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was arrested but no charges</v>
<v Speaker 1>were filed and was all dropped.</v>

206
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.480
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a brawl and he was a part of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got arrested with a couple other </v>

208
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.490
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No big deal.</v>

209
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.500
<v Speaker 1>You something a young guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived here to fucking to just for </v>

210
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>laughs and they flag them for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turned them around.</v>

211
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo went up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo legally was carrying a gun </v>

212
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.940
<v Speaker 1>legally because he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

214
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:46.131

<v Speaker 1>even met him,</v>

217
00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:51.020

<v Speaker 1>large sums of cash and he had a license </v>

218
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:56.331
<v Speaker 1>to carry a pistol because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he gets pulled over for speeding or </v>

219
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>something and he tells the cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Give me all your paperwork in this down.</v>

225
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.390

<v Speaker 1>really was sort of organization that was</v>

295
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:18.430
<v Speaker 1>paying people off to lie about the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>being flat,</v>

296

<v Speaker 1>and all these people that claim to be </v>

299
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.561

313
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't quite gone flat.</v>

314
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flat.</v>

00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Earth pulls them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start messing with it a little bit.</v>

316
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs aren't real.</v>

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs aren't real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the in the moon is fake.</v>

319
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 1>We've never been to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

320
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:05.950
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the footage of NASA are all the NASA</v>

321
00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:07.140
<v Speaker 1>footage is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA.</v>

322
00:14:07.141 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Everything was shit and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bands,</v>

323
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.340
<v Speaker 1>all the bands like the Beatles were made</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the CIA and quite apparent to paying </v>

324
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 1>your claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is though,</v>

325
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:20.251
<v Speaker 1>if you know Eddie and he's a fun dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>and half of this stuff is because he </v>

326
00:14:20.251 --> 00:14:24.421
<v Speaker 1>enjoys it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He enjoys looking at conspiracies just </v>

327
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:24.421
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looks.</v>

328
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

329
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 1>There's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

330
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.680

<v Speaker 1>The real,</v>

331
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 1>some are true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has an argument on some stuff,</v>

332
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:36.241
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard for keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So balls deep into conspiracies that </v>

333
00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:40.711
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for him to just like deep that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's bent over like a clothes pin and </v>

<v Speaker 1>No one else knows and I can just ask the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie because he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

373
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have it in me.</v>

374
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an inmate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what that one was about.</v>

375
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Something about money or something or </v>
<v Speaker 1>tower.</v>

376
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:38.630
<v Speaker 1>So he loves him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves does to sport to him.</v>

377
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.820

<v Speaker 1>it's what he's into.</v>

378
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time anymore to people.</v>

379
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking Solo.</v>

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.490
<v Speaker 1>No Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck no,</v>

381
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

382
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 1>If you solve the Kennedy assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will not help your life.</v>

383
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's also not on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

384
00:16:53.651 --> 00:16:55.660
<v Speaker 1>tell you that it's probably not in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>chat room you're in.</v>

385
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.700
<v Speaker 1>It might be on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of find the video.</v>

386
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.990
<v Speaker 1>You just got to go down deep enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to about 600 views so far.</v>

387
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.990
<v Speaker 1>But if we can get it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone sent me a fucking three hour one</v>

388
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 1>just two days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well to assassination one.</v>

389
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

390
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I can't simply too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it anymore,</v>

391
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 1>can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they do figure it out it would be</v>

392
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>

393
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how they could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're never going to get past </v>

394
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 1>where they're at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some evidence.</v>

395
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.290
<v Speaker 1>There's some non evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some speculation.</v>

396
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that Zapruder footage,</v>

397
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.870
<v Speaker 1>there's some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is there any expert like actually </v>

398
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 1>opened the case back up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did they really give a shit?</v>

399
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.870
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough evidence right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like current physical evidence.</v>

400
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

401
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't do it anyway because who </v>

402
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.060
<v Speaker 1>are you going to try?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also everyone gets a shit.</v>

403
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.060
<v Speaker 1>He's Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

404
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.060
<v Speaker 1>everyone's dead.</v>

405
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.900
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

406
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.390
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

407
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Still isn't bringing back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all so fucking weird.</v>

408
00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Like because we know the government does</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of fucked up things.</v>

409
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 1>We know they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

410
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.730
<v Speaker 1>it's spending time trying to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

411
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was thinking when I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump sit next to Obama.</v>

412
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if Obama told him how much work</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to actually do and that's why he </v>

413
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.800
<v Speaker 1>lived so fucked up because trump was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting next to obama and it was just.</v>

414
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 1>He looked like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked like he was like,</v>

415
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it hit it.</v>

416
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During that meeting I was like,</v>

417
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 1>this is my daily life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you go,</v>

418
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy look at it is what it says.</v>

419
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Trump reportedly surprised at scope of </v>
<v Speaker 1>new presidential doozies.</v>

420
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Surprised at scope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's various.</v>

421
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have 100 jobs.</v>

422
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.930
<v Speaker 1>This is a reason why the age so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be one man.</v>

423
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Shannon be responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've spoken about it before.</v>

424
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:46.401
<v Speaker 1>We'd have one guy with that much power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have all that on his pressure </v>

425
00:18:46.401 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 1>should be a committee of just straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>geniuses that figuring it out.</v>

426
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Well man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to look at the bright cloud,</v>

427
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.480
<v Speaker 1>if there's any bright cloud about Donald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump being in office,</v>

428
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 1>is that he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an outsider,</v>

429
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.760
<v Speaker 1>like complete outsiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics guy and so we'll get to see </v>

430
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.360
<v Speaker 1>just by watching them sort of duke it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

431
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 1>what shape they take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

432
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.030
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to see like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

433
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.980
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's.</v>

434
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 1>We'll get a better view of the mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the machine.</v>

435
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Then if Hillary Clinton was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think with.</v>

436
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I think people are really surprised at </v>
<v Speaker 1>how little power he's actually.</v>

437
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.520
<v Speaker 1>The president actually has probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they think he's going to do all </v>

438
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:25.520
<v Speaker 1>this crazy stuff and then p room like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

439
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 1>bitch don't work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have jumped through all these holes.</v>

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.160
<v Speaker 1>The house of Lake state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>

441
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what's going to be </v>

442
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.190
<v Speaker 1>interesting to hear him talk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>complain about that and see what happens</v>

443
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a culture battle going on </v>

444
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 1>right now to like all those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>marched down the street screaming.</v>

557
00:23:50.441 --> 00:23:50.441
<v Speaker 1>in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had this feel to it.</v>

558
00:23:50.441 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 1>That was very different than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>show we'd ever put together.</v>

559
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.100
<v Speaker 1>It shows that that was the one show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was that because it was so </v>

560
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.100
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be tough to beat that,</v>

561
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 1>but it'll never be.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

563
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.460

<v Speaker 1>that was the last block.</v>

564

567
00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:15.341
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when I was in Atlanta doing </v>

<v Speaker 1>And it was kind of weird.</v>

572
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

575
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.240
<v Speaker 1>and then the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he looked a little more serious and </v>

576
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:28.240
<v Speaker 1>then the night of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't have written a better show.</v>

578
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

579
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight that night,</v>

580
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 1>the way everything happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>

581
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By far,</v>

582
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 1>the best ufc I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was by far the main event was almost.</v>

583
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.830
<v Speaker 1>It was almost bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost bizarre how good.</v>

584
00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:50.831
<v Speaker 1>Connor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost bizarre the way you picked </v>

585
00:24:50.831 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>apart Eddie Alverez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost bizarre.</v>

586
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Like magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost the word I wanna use.</v>

587
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he touches motherfuckers with that </v>

588
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.391
<v Speaker 1>left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen Eddie Alvarez just </v>

589
00:25:01.391 --> 00:25:02.270
<v Speaker 1>like they'd even look like they were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same planet.</v>

590
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Like one guy like looked like he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Mars.</v>

591
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.670
<v Speaker 1>The other guy look like he's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal dude trying to figure it out.</v>

592
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like Eddie.</v>

593
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 1>The moment he got hit with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck we could see on his face.</v>

594
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:14.360
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy Jesus,</v>

595
00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>

596
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

597
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.280
<v Speaker 1>He's not very good at wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me try this.</v>

598
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Wrestling coach like that was your shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Bro.</v>

599
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 1>You're in for a long night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that he realized like,</v>

600
00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys are already touched up a little bit</v>

601
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 1>when he finally went in for the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

602
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:30.500
<v Speaker 1>and I just think I'm connor new.</v>

603
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Then also that he had them and how calm </v>
<v Speaker 1>was he?</v>

604
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just come upright and just waiting.</v>

605
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 1>And then the accuracy of that Combo that</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally finished Eddie.</v>

606
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think makes connor so </v>
<v Speaker 1>specials is accuracy.</v>

607
00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:47.981
<v Speaker 1>When he throws punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's moving as he's laying in this </v>

608
00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:48.210
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like,</v>

609
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.780
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was straight up magical and like,</v>

610
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we've never seen a guy like this.</v>

611
00:25:52.941 --> 00:25:54.410
<v Speaker 1>We just haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we ever.</v>

612
00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Well either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting too when I was</v>

613
00:25:56.061 --> 00:26:01.061
<v Speaker 1>interviewing him and it's like you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to have some attributes if you want </v>

614
00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:01.061
<v Speaker 1>to beat me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be tall,</v>

615
00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:04.691
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be these guys my size to what </v>

616
00:26:04.691 --> 00:26:08.890
<v Speaker 1>he's doing though it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a once in a lifetime guy because</v>

617
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 1>he sent in the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no,</v>

618
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:12.380
<v Speaker 1>there's no boundaries for him.</v>

619
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight nate at 70,</v>

620
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll 45 sure on merch Aldo in 13 seconds</v>

621
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and they'll come to 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we've never seen this kind of </v>

622
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.431
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've also never seen the UFC allow </v>

623
00:26:27.431 --> 00:26:27.431
<v Speaker 1>someone to do this either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

624
00:26:27.431 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Well he's just such a unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

625
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 1>It's undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also his style in a lot of ways.</v>

626
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It kind of does a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with wonderboy does,</v>

627
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.580
<v Speaker 1>but with less kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he throws kicks to the body.</v>

628
00:26:39.581 --> 00:26:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw like some front kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

629
00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:42.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 70 percent as many kicks.</v>

630
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy is a little more kick heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's that sideway style and he's.</v>

631
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.140
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

632
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he does it better.</v>

633
00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Like there's maybe something about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus of the shots that he's landing,</v>

634
00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:00.950
<v Speaker 1>the precision of them because wonderboy </v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely like touches somebody up </v>

635
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:01.770
<v Speaker 1>like that with a punch.</v>

636
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.320
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't have that kind of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

637
00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:08.321
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think wonder is better at surprising </v>

638
00:27:08.321 --> 00:27:11.361
<v Speaker 1>guys with this kicks in his angles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but connor set it up and he's landing </v>

639
00:27:11.361 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 1>combos that are all so precise in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

640
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.440
<v Speaker 1>like he's touching dudes and you can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on their faith.</v>

641
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 1>He touched Eddie and Eddie's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what stuff?</v>

642
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

643
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:25.221
<v Speaker 1>he's like he's hitting them in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise way and it's not telegraphing </v>

644
00:27:25.221 --> 00:27:28.731
<v Speaker 1>it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his ability to like go from </v>

645
00:27:28.731 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 1>bouncing around to launching that shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so quick.</v>

646
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:36.800
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so precise and it's so focused and </v>

647
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.490
<v Speaker 1>there's no fat in his movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

648
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they said there's going to be a big </v>

649
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:43.340
<v Speaker 1>announcement afterwards and off these </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls pregnant,</v>

650
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.210
<v Speaker 1>which I mean it's a personal big </v>
<v Speaker 1>announcement for him,</v>

651
00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:50.211
<v Speaker 1>but I think he said he's going to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>time off and he wants a piece of the </v>

652
00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:50.211
<v Speaker 1>Pie.</v>

653
00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 1>He wants a piece of wme and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

655
00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:54.780
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

656
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

657
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's the first fighter ever that can</v>

658
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:00.090
<v Speaker 1>talk like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is.</v>

659
00:28:00.091 --> 00:28:04.260
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of 26,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 27,</v>

660
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:09.030
<v Speaker 1>26,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to think 28.</v>

661
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a smart guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

662
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:16.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would hope at least I don't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>him fighting deep into his thirties </v>

663
00:28:16.401 --> 00:28:16.730
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially the way he talked to.</v>

664
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.940
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I have a kid,</v>

665
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I know what I bring to the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't be set financially for the rest </v>

666
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:23.300
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys want me to fight again?</v>

667
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving.</v>

668
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 1>You need to be set for the rest of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

669
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:29.691
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a part of this pie and he's his </v>

670
00:28:29.691 --> 00:28:30.630
<v Speaker 1>next fight and it's gonna be such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight is with wme.</v>

671
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not with anyone out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

672
00:28:32.331 --> 00:28:35.460
<v Speaker 1>If you think he's fighting for center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be your batshit crazy.</v>

673
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.290
<v Speaker 1>That's not happening for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

674
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they work it out and I don't think</v>

675
00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:41.070
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the next slide again,</v>

676
00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just me going off.</v>

677
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the hell I think Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think his next fight would be nate</v>

678
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:49.440
<v Speaker 1>for the belt at 55 because if you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be even Tony,</v>

679
00:28:49.441 --> 00:28:53.100
<v Speaker 1>they're both deserving and we're mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pierce were balls deep in mma.</v>

680
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:55.620
<v Speaker 1>We love it and one of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves it.</v>

681
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.710
<v Speaker 1>As far as numbers and in in a big pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>per view,</v>

682
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be native to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they would do nate again,</v>

683
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:06.080
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Nader economy will fight </v>

684
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.080
<v Speaker 1>unless it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's.</v>

685
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>If that has to be the matchup.</v>

686
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I think connor will fight someone out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think connor might even fight Woodley </v>

687
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd see a fight with Woodley </v>

688
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 1>before you see qbb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson I think could be the first one.</v>

689
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Will fight each other before anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

690
00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.930
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>

691
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:21.210
<v Speaker 1>It would be if he decided to go up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight Woodley.</v>

692
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.800

<v Speaker 1>wonderboy again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does he has,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dana said that's the.</v>

696
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:35.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit he says is fighting for </v>

697
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:35.540
<v Speaker 1>the title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good point.</v>

698
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.010
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he does that all the time.</v>

701
00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that means anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

702
00:29:41.111 --> 00:29:46.111
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going based off what your boys </v>

703
00:29:46.111 --> 00:29:46.111
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

704
00:29:46.111 --> 00:29:49.201
<v Speaker 1>that's the next rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but put it on me more your friend than </v>

705
00:29:49.201 --> 00:29:49.201
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

706
00:29:49.201 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Your real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've worked with him forever.</v>

707
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I liked the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

708
00:29:52.031 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

709
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:57.931
<v Speaker 1>I liked Dana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think you know you have a closer </v>

710
00:29:57.931 --> 00:30:00.411
<v Speaker 1>relationship so say you're a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he does say things impulse back if </v>

711
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 1>woodland that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This other thing I worry about though,</v>

712
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:08.910
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about something </v>

713
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.291
<v Speaker 1>to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much power are they going to give </v>

714
00:30:10.291 --> 00:30:10.291
<v Speaker 1>connor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>40th five.</v>

715
00:30:10.291 --> 00:30:11.540
<v Speaker 1>50 five slash 70 just wraps up all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

716
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

717
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 1>That would be if he did it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say let them do it.</v>

718
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Let them try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use is gone.</v>

719

<v Speaker 1>He's got to take this pitching woodley.</v>

720

<v Speaker 1>Let him try.</v>

721
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.940

722
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Woodley looks compared to him.</v>

723
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Ju Ju,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ju Ju ginormous.</v>

724
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.330
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at Woodley inside the octagon.</v>

725
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:28.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

726
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.630
<v Speaker 1>He's the most Jack Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think other than your.</v>

727
00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Well Romero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in there.</v>

728
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.740
<v Speaker 1>He's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other one and two.</v>

729
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.570
<v Speaker 1>One and two right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interchangeable,</v>

730
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

731
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Speaker 1>It depends what you're into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're well flies through the air.</v>

732
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 1>You'll weld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does backflips at the beginning of every</v>

733
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:50.250
<v Speaker 1>fight at the beginning of your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes into the audience or it goes </v>

734
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:52.891
<v Speaker 1>into the cage and he does backhand </v>
<v Speaker 1>springs and literally launches himself </v>

735
00:30:52.891 --> 00:30:57.031
<v Speaker 1>through the air and lands on his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the Olympics and it's a solid </v>

736
00:30:57.031 --> 00:30:57.190
<v Speaker 1>landing and he's 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

737
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.240
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's flying.</v>

738
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the freakiest freak.</v>

739
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Cascade uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

740
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

741
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My goal being you do that for me.</v>

742
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Somebody needs to help him with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing.</v>

743
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Change a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he lost so much.</v>

744
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:23.040
<v Speaker 1>He lost so much fan support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he said a four,</v>

745
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.110
<v Speaker 1>four was he say for the gay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

746
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.730
<v Speaker 1>we thought he said gay Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he said,</v>

747
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.790
<v Speaker 1>don't forget Jesus is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English was so bad.</v>

748
00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:35.600
<v Speaker 1>People went bad on them so fast they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he kept calling bisbing boy.</v>

749
00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's okay because I like that he's </v>

750
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.500
<v Speaker 1>allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If bisbing did that to him,</v>

751
00:31:41.501 --> 00:31:45.760
<v Speaker 1>we had some shit on her hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot say that to a man of color.</v>

752
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh he does.</v>

753
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He's so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor Weidman in New York.</v>

754
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Hometown needed to win bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only getting no love in New York and</v>

755
00:31:57.491 --> 00:32:02.020
<v Speaker 1>then just a fucking knee from Cuba just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

756
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.990
<v Speaker 1>just flew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flew through the air and as he hit him,</v>

757
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:07.570
<v Speaker 1>like he was flying over them afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

758
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was insanely impressive,</v>

759
00:32:09.671 --> 00:32:14.671
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was almost as impressive as the way </v>

760
00:32:14.671 --> 00:32:14.671
<v Speaker 1>he took waibans back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tripped him.</v>

761
00:32:14.671 --> 00:32:16.300
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tied up together.</v>

762
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:21.420
<v Speaker 1>He trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman throws him to the ground and </v>

763
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.420
<v Speaker 1>then spins around behind him and takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>his back like the trip.</v>

764
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.290
<v Speaker 1>How about the world class trip trip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

765
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.140
<v Speaker 1>that's world class level trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman's an absolute monster and he was</v>

766
00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:34.150
<v Speaker 1>just throwing them around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing them the difference between a </v>

767
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:38.821
<v Speaker 1>wrestler from the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who medaled in every single world </v>

768
00:32:38.821 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>tournament he entered and</v>

769
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 4>built like a Ninja Turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's ridiculous.</v>

770
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has like a fuse disc in his neck.</v>

771
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.340
<v Speaker 4>I would assume he had a serious injury </v>
<v Speaker 4>in his neck just like Weidman has.</v>

772
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.860
<v Speaker 4>But why may that disectomy Wyman?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That surgery?</v>

773
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.310
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So ul has a big scar in the back of his </v>

774
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.310
<v Speaker 4>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could see it.</v>

775
00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like a big slice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all stitched up like ving rhames </v>

776
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:00.980
<v Speaker 4>from pulp fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very different.</v>

777
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.130
<v Speaker 4>But you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same scar.</v>

778
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 4>Black Guy Lights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

779
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:05.560
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

780
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it before on other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but spinal surgeries,</v>

781
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 4>fucking no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

782
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had Weidman when that fight till then </v>

783
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.530
<v Speaker 4>he won the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you thought he wanted the second </v>

784
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:17.530
<v Speaker 4>round when yoga was throwing them </v>
<v Speaker 4>around?</v>

785
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

786
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Not winning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I thought as the fight would go on,</v>

787
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.110
<v Speaker 4>it would help Weidman.</v>

788
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I thought in the second round you well </v>
<v Speaker 4>started implementing his wrestling and I</v>

789
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 4>thought he was running away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>

790
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 4>So one one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

791
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:29.510
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

792
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.490
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

793
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.700
<v Speaker 4>one one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I thought it was like shocking how </v>

794
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.501
<v Speaker 4>good his wrestling was in comparison and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that doesn't mean he doesn't </v>

795
00:33:38.501 --> 00:33:38.720
<v Speaker 4>show it very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rarely,</v>

796
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 4>but when he does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes go flying more because he's having</v>

797
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:46.650
<v Speaker 4>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a good time to.</v>

798
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
<v Speaker 4>For Real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At first when he was talking stuff that </v>

799
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.000
<v Speaker 4>busy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

800
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.930
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a terrible fight for bisping.</v>

801
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's terrible.</v>

802
00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.920
<v Speaker 4>And then it hit me like five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bisbing really doesn't initiate in that </v>

803
00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 4>grappling and he has cardio four days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough fight to call.</v>

804
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.670
<v Speaker 4>At first I'll they get Romeo is going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking destroy business.</v>

805
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 4>Not really though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think about it.</v>

806
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what could happen,</v>

807
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.650
<v Speaker 4>but Dan Henderson caught bisping twice </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad in their last title fight at 45 </v>

808
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:19.000
<v Speaker 4>years old or whatever it is to catch him</v>
<v Speaker 4>really bad.</v>

809
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.100
<v Speaker 4>And Dan Henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is one of the most ruthless power </v>

810
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 4>strikers in the game for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and bisping survived that,</v>

811
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.340
<v Speaker 4>so that's good for bisping was able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>survive that.</v>

812
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:33.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be good to think Yoel Romero </v>

813
00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.040
<v Speaker 4>doesn't just have a right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He flies.</v>

814
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.260
<v Speaker 4>He literally launches himself at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he gets a hold of you,</v>

815
00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:38.830
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

816
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.960
<v Speaker 4>the wrestling coach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan Henderson's a silver medalist in the</v>

817
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Olympics as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a different.</v>

818
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 4>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Different.</v>

819
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially Dan right now.</v>

820
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:50.180
<v Speaker 4>What's Dan Forty eight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's 46 or 45.</v>

821
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.640
<v Speaker 4>He's up there either way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but broome is basically,</v>

822
00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:55.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his prime as an MMA fighter.</v>

823
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.290
<v Speaker 4>Well also there's like the range of </v>
<v Speaker 4>motion,</v>

824
00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.900
<v Speaker 4>like Dan's almost like locked up.</v>

825
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.120
<v Speaker 4>Some would say stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

826
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 4>he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if he hits you,</v>

827
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:04.400
<v Speaker 4>you're Foxville.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's like,</v>

828
00:35:04.401 --> 00:35:08.960
<v Speaker 4>his range of motion is very limited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas well is like a super athlete.</v>

829
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.180
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have any limitations in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>range of motion.</v>

830
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:16.181
<v Speaker 4>He's ridiculously flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he does like a half split before </v>

831
00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:16.181
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

832
00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:20.080
<v Speaker 4>for a fight he was like down there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like stretching out your like sky's </v>

833
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 4>range of motions and saying those knees </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the flying knees though,</v>

834
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:27.221
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with Weidman came from </v>

835
00:35:27.221 --> 00:35:27.221
<v Speaker 4>Weidman going for that single leg and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

836
00:35:27.221 --> 00:35:27.221
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go for it again.</v>

837
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.400
<v Speaker 4>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

838
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.280
<v Speaker 4>And were busying doesn't entertain the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grappling at all.</v>

839
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.600
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

840
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.360
<v Speaker 4>And he stays on the outside and he also </v>
<v Speaker 4>has that beast of a coach.</v>

841
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 4>But at first right away I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

842
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:40.050
<v Speaker 4>that sucks because I love Bisbee like </v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

843
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:40.950
<v Speaker 4>that's a bad fight for him.</v>

844
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 4>I was sitting there like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

845
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.780
<v Speaker 4>cardio five rounds if he can survive </v>
<v Speaker 4>those first two,</v>

846
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 4>maybe three dragon lake water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fun fight to watch that bad,</v>

847
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.320
<v Speaker 4>bad boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can't.</v>

848
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.790
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do mma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Math,</v>

849
00:35:53.791 --> 00:35:54.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm mad man.</v>

850
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Style style matchups though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

851
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:57.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

852
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I was saying like bisping last,</v>

853
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.120
<v Speaker 4>Tim Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tim Kennedy last url,</v>

854
00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.760
<v Speaker 4>but Tim Kennedy was beating your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

855
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.100
<v Speaker 4>like that's another thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>always corner did this,</v>

856
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.920
<v Speaker 4>that it was fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They covered him with water.</v>

857
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:16.190
<v Speaker 4>They threw water on him while he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there resting between first </v>

858
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.880
<v Speaker 4>second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put an ice pack on him and they,</v>

859
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.240
<v Speaker 4>he poured water on himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He put her on his legs,</v>

860
00:36:21.241 --> 00:36:26.241
<v Speaker 4>he poured it on his arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he poured it all over them and they </v>

861
00:36:26.241 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 4>wiped him down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was trying to cool himself off</v>

862
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 4>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not allowed to do that.</v>

863
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.840
<v Speaker 4>And they spent time wiping him down </v>
<v Speaker 4>before the round started.</v>

864
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.020
<v Speaker 4>So like they wiped him down in between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the corner,</v>

865
00:36:37.021 --> 00:36:40.890
<v Speaker 4>but then the referee stopped it and made</v>
<v Speaker 4>them wipe them down more because more so</v>

866
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.790
<v Speaker 4>it gets more rest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

867
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.580
<v Speaker 4>look for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are aware when,</v>

868
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:50.650
<v Speaker 4>when that happened with Tim Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Tim Kennedy had fucked up at the </v>

869
00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 4>end of that second round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he absolutely,</v>

870
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 4>and on-purpose stayed on that stool long</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he was,</v>

871
00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:59.440
<v Speaker 4>some would say it was a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it ended up working in his </v>

872
00:36:59.440 --> 00:36:59.440
<v Speaker 4>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smart.</v>

873
00:36:59.440 --> 00:36:59.850
<v Speaker 4>If you're a cheater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're okay with cheating,</v>

874
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 4>but it is cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cheating.</v>

875
00:37:01.531 --> 00:37:02.880
<v Speaker 4>You haven't a lot of percentage </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheating.</v>

876
00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:06.450
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent in that fight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the referee should have probably stopped</v>

877
00:37:06.451 --> 00:37:11.451
<v Speaker 4>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm sure big John didn't want the </v>

878
00:37:11.451 --> 00:37:13.701
<v Speaker 4>fight to end it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't want to cheat everybody out of </v>

879
00:37:13.701 --> 00:37:13.701
<v Speaker 4>the fight and just wanting to get back </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

880
00:37:13.701 --> 00:37:15.930
<v Speaker 4>But then you cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tim Kennedy who has done one person.</v>

881
00:37:15.931 --> 00:37:17.600
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to cheat out of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>champ.</v>

882
00:37:17.601 --> 00:37:20.580
<v Speaker 4>Tim is walking around like yelling while</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all going off piste.</v>

883
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing was a mess.</v>

884
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.840
<v Speaker 4>It was a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a cluster fuck of a moment,</v>

885
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.380
<v Speaker 4>but it just shows you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy has a massive amount of </v>

886
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.251
<v Speaker 4>experience in international competition </v>
<v Speaker 4>in wrestling and there's like a lot of </v>

887
00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:36.060
<v Speaker 4>shit that goes on and wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know where your.</v>

888
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.120
<v Speaker 4>You have to take advantage of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can to win the all these years of </v>

889
00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.350
<v Speaker 4>high level competition on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>international scene.</v>

890
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:48.740
<v Speaker 4>He's probably got a bunch of little </v>
<v Speaker 4>tricks like that he could do to slow </v>

891
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:48.830
<v Speaker 4>down the pace or give himself a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>extra time and,</v>

892
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.390
<v Speaker 4>and we and what people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

893
00:37:50.391 --> 00:37:51.330
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's 15,</v>

894
00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 4>20 seconds?</v>
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>

895
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:56.500
<v Speaker 4>20 seconds for a guy like Yoel Romero to</v>
<v Speaker 4>replenish giant it.</v>

896
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking giant night and day </v>

897
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:01.760
<v Speaker 4>difference for a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it was also a 30 seconds for</v>

898
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.870
<v Speaker 4>the Tim Kennedy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I remember maybe 23.</v>

899
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.930
<v Speaker 4>I felt like it was longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember talking about stool </v>

900
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.930
<v Speaker 4>gait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

901
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.930
<v Speaker 4>Gait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

902
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:13.580
<v Speaker 4>but also then there's a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue because Kennedy now thinks the </v>

903
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.060
<v Speaker 4>fights over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it not over?</v>

904
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.550
<v Speaker 4>Like he doesn't know where he's at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing worse than that when you</v>

905
00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:19.250
<v Speaker 4>think the fight's over and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

906
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:24.310
<v Speaker 4>back in man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what kills me about glory when </v>

907
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.190
<v Speaker 4>they have that extra round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here we go one more round.</v>

908
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.400
<v Speaker 4>Imagine you get through three rounds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing and then finally you're </v>

909
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.800
<v Speaker 4>drinking water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got your arms up her for her.</v>

910
00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.500
<v Speaker 4>He says blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

911
00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

912
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 4>And it's draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What will think if you're tyrone Woodley</v>

913
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 4>Woodley?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

914
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:40.420
<v Speaker 4>how about Bruce?</v>

915
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Buffer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking it up.</v>

916
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 4>Where what was going on that decision </v>
<v Speaker 4>was because you were like,</v>

917
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone chill,</v>

918
00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.230
<v Speaker 4>chill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

919
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 4>here's what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

920
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.410
<v Speaker 4>Bruce said it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was not a majority decision.</v>

921
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.010
<v Speaker 4>It was a majority draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

922
00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 4>But they probably wrote it down wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them.</v>

923
00:38:55.930 --> 00:39:00.930
<v Speaker 4>The New York does not do any MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've never done that in May before </v>

924
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:02.020
<v Speaker 4>the first event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never shod shot.</v>

925
00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

926
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:08.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they do this thing where they tally </v>

927
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.311
<v Speaker 4>up the scorecards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they give it to bruce and I guess it </v>

928
00:39:11.311 --> 00:39:11.311
<v Speaker 4>said majority decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tyron Woodley,</v>

929
00:39:11.311 --> 00:39:15.991
<v Speaker 4>they read to judges quarter to draw one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judge scores it for Woodley and Woodley </v>

930
00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:18.040
<v Speaker 4>retains the title,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's supposed to be majority draw.</v>

931
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:23.070
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the majority of the people </v>

932
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:23.070
<v Speaker 4>thought it was a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a majority draw.</v>

933
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 4>So Bruce said it wrong whether they gave</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to them wrong,</v>

934
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:24.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

935
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.040
<v Speaker 4>And Real Steve Harvey moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

936
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.830
<v Speaker 4>And then they and then tire and freaked </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

937
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.070
<v Speaker 4>And then the audience booed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The audience went crazy and I said,</v>

938
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:34.720
<v Speaker 4>do you still have your title?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just hold.</v>

939
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.970
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they wanted bruce to say it again.</v>

940
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:41.971
<v Speaker 4>So Bruce says it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to say it again onto the </v>

941
00:39:41.971 --> 00:39:41.971
<v Speaker 4>microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're like,</v>

942
00:39:41.971 --> 00:39:42.580
<v Speaker 4>insisted he get the mic and he says it </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

943
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:47.581
<v Speaker 4>So he says it again and he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he wanted to correct the </v>

944
00:39:47.581 --> 00:39:50.641
<v Speaker 4>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he says it again and then I have to </v>

945
00:39:50.641 --> 00:39:50.641
<v Speaker 4>say that the audience is booing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

946
00:39:50.641 --> 00:39:51.400
<v Speaker 4>this is the exact same score.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

947
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 4>it's the exact same score.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a wrong definition.</v>

948
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:54.830
<v Speaker 4>Just read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>run yet.</v>

949
00:39:54.831 --> 00:39:59.831
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it was probably pretty </v>

950
00:39:59.831 --> 00:39:59.831
<v Speaker 4>accurate too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was right before it.</v>

951
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.350
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe with 10 seconds left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at Brian and I went,</v>

952
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 4>I bet you anything.</v>

953
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.520
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I even tweeted out before this,</v>

954
00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a draw triangles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no championship math.</v>

955
00:40:09.731 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's a draw I give.</v>

956
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:16.260
<v Speaker 4>I give that a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight and then I scored the other </v>

957
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:16.260
<v Speaker 4>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what scoring.</v>

958
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.430
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people didn't give Woodley eight </v>

959
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.270
<v Speaker 4>for the fourth insane because at the end</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the round wondered where it was on </v>

960
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 4>top of him punching him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

961
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I say bully beat death,</v>

962
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:28.570
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he didn't do that,</v>

963
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.690
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm wonder wonderboy didn't get out </v>

964
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:33.690
<v Speaker 4>and wasn't on top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be at 10,</v>

965
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.780
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because not only did he hurt him with </v>

966
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.410
<v Speaker 4>big punches then he almost choked the </v>
<v Speaker 4>life out of them.</v>

967
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:43.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean he had them in a deep getting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were telling me that wasn't a </v>

968
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.520
<v Speaker 4>good team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like out of your fucking mind.</v>

969
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.310
<v Speaker 4>You're insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have a guy,</v>

970
00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:52.360
<v Speaker 4>a guy as strong as Woodley May.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say his position is a little off </v>

971
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.070
<v Speaker 4>to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just for the record.</v>

972
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.390
<v Speaker 4>And what round is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lauren?</v>

973
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Was that third round?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Third round.</v>

974
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.140
<v Speaker 4>So your cardio running fourth round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fourth Round.</v>

975
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:04.290
<v Speaker 4>You already exhausted and you have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred 70 pound monster around your </v>

976
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:06.040
<v Speaker 4>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not one 70 now.</v>

977
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:07.180
<v Speaker 4>He's every bit of what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pr?</v>

978
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 4>200.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably 200 pounds.</v>

979
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.600
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a brown belt.</v>

980
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.600
<v Speaker 4>He's a brown belt in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think tyron woodley does not a choke</v>

981
00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:14.620
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking crazy.</v>

982
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.690
<v Speaker 4>It was a very good choke and I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was amazed.</v>

983
00:41:17.691 --> 00:41:18.150
<v Speaker 4>He too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men,</v>

984
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:23.210
<v Speaker 4>I think I was thinking was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderful as that skinny ass net and </v>

985
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.311
<v Speaker 4>tiny head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller head than me and a small head </v>

986
00:41:26.311 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 4>things that woody said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woody said,</v>

987
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:30.520
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew he had a little head did.</v>

988
00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:31.720
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

989
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even think about his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was about the size of his neck.</v>

990
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:38.060
<v Speaker 1>He has a slender neck yet tiny head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it amazing?</v>

991
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.480
<v Speaker 1>The human body can take that like nodded</v>
<v Speaker 1>his head and not rip off his neck.</v>

992
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Not Break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

993
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.440
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave broken neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you if you had that in the </v>

994
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 1>first round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably would have been able to.</v>

995
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how tough is it?</v>

996
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

997
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It have been a different story.</v>

998
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.950
<v Speaker 1>How tough is wonderboy though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous and I've,</v>

999
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.320
<v Speaker 1>and this is an I know wonderboy st </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager.</v>

1000
00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 1>We've trained together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bunch love the guy.</v>

1001
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just me,</v>

1002
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:09.491
<v Speaker 1>I've always questioned his toughness </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he does come from a privileged </v>

1003
00:42:09.491 --> 00:42:13.721
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have this huge Taekwondo </v>

1004
00:42:13.721 --> 00:42:13.721
<v Speaker 1>Academy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Carolina,</v>

1005
00:42:13.721 --> 00:42:14.180
<v Speaker 1>and he has a great home life and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad's,</v>

1006
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:17.360
<v Speaker 1>his coach and his brothers are studs </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quando or just karate.</v>

1007
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

1008
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Just karate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karate style.</v>

1009
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably right.</v>

1010
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:23.340
<v Speaker 1>One of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1011
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 1>But he had this huge school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1012
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:29.921
<v Speaker 1>Very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been to dinners with his dad and the </v>

1013
00:42:29.921 --> 00:42:29.921
<v Speaker 1>whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1014
00:42:29.921 --> 00:42:31.880
<v Speaker 1>this guy has everything going for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I see that's like,</v>

1015
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Calabasas kids thing,</v>

1016
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:38.891
<v Speaker 1>like you've never seen the tufts can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell bass isn't gonna do shit in the </v>

1017
00:42:38.891 --> 00:42:41.321
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that when they're privileged </v>

1018
00:42:41.321 --> 00:42:41.321
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the going gets rough,</v>

1019
00:42:41.321 --> 00:42:44.801
<v Speaker 1>I've always kind of questioned wonderboy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've never seen it though because </v>

1020
00:42:44.801 --> 00:42:44.801
<v Speaker 1>the Matt Brown fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1021
00:42:44.801 --> 00:42:47.190

<v Speaker 1>There's a scrap.</v>

1022
00:42:47.191 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1028
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.570
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fucking hard is Tyron Woodley head?</v>

1029
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.740

<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>

1032
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1033
00:43:12.051 --> 00:43:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a guy who fought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional kickboxing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>combined kickbox and record amateur and </v>

1035

<v Speaker 1>kickbox and circled that punches his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest and not with four ounce gloves.</v>

<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1038
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:29.710
<v Speaker 1>The other big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can punch faster with those little </v>

1039
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:29.940
<v Speaker 1>gloves on and it hurts more wetlands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let.</v>

1040
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:34.990
<v Speaker 1>So let's say Dana does do the rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do conor Woodley and they do </v>

1041
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 1>do the rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it.</v>

1042
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Three titles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three titles,</v>

1043
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:38.660
<v Speaker 1>but focus me third.</v>

1044
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:45.680
<v Speaker 1>But a woodley was a slight underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen to Duke Roufus who was</v>

1045
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:47.180
<v Speaker 1>talking about their game plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1046
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I think you're starting on the post </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight press conference.</v>

1047
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Third Game Plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1048
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 1>And you even mentioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1049
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't get why tyrone is against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage and I didn't like it either.</v>

1050
00:43:55.531 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's he doing?</v>

1051
00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:58.810
<v Speaker 1>He's get murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was their game plan because what do</v>

1052
00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does that a lot.</v>

1053
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does that a lot.</v>

1054
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And then wonder boys a counter striker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they wanted to bring him to Woodley.</v>

1055
00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:09.521
<v Speaker 1>That was their thinking by him being </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the cage and do all that and </v>

1056
00:44:09.521 --> 00:44:09.521
<v Speaker 1>then get him to commit to take them </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1057
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.130
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it surprised wonderboy a little bit,</v>

1058
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.580
<v Speaker 1>but in the rematch I think it favors </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderboy so much more because now he </v>

1059
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.340
<v Speaker 1>knows Woodley's going to fight like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1060
00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:21.410
<v Speaker 1>He might not fight like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not find like that.</v>

1061
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:22.870
<v Speaker 1>So then he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1062
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:27.010
<v Speaker 1>and this is my thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the ability to change and,</v>

1063
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:32.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be more dynamic in wonder boys </v>

1064
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 1>favorite his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying</v>

1065
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 4>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing.</v>

1066
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Woodley only took him down once in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole fight and mauled him.</v>

1067
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 4>Once he got onto the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is avoiding tee off,</v>

1068
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:45.290
<v Speaker 4>what if one would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Woodley decides to do that every </v>

1069
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.290
<v Speaker 4>fucking round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1070
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:48.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much wonderboy can stop</v>
<v Speaker 4>woodley from taking them down.</v>

1071
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:53.601
<v Speaker 4>Woodley so much bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much stronger in a way better </v>

1072
00:44:53.601 --> 00:44:55.881
<v Speaker 4>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woodley takes him down like he took him </v>

1073
00:44:55.881 --> 00:44:58.221
<v Speaker 4>down to the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that might've been the strategic </v>

1074
00:44:58.221 --> 00:44:58.730
<v Speaker 4>error because Woodley mauled him in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first round.</v>

1075
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.900
<v Speaker 4>By the end of the round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his nose is fucked up.</v>

1076
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 4>He's got a giant caught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's leaking blood and Woodley just held</v>

1077
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:06.300
<v Speaker 4>him down and dominated him on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

1078
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.480
<v Speaker 4>So if he just does that in the round two</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean if he was able to do that </v>

1079
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:11.760
<v Speaker 4>instead of trying to stay and knock him </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

1080
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.890
<v Speaker 4>he might've been able to stop him.</v>

1081
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:19.130
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reason why he got that takedown </v>

1082
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.040
<v Speaker 4>is based off those kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then one boy stopped kicking as like</v>

1083
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.250
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't looking for the knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

1084
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 4>Like he was so hesitant after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1085
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like the reason he got that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was it because of the kick.</v>

1086
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:33.650
<v Speaker 4>So I think wonderboy can make changes </v>
<v Speaker 4>more of changes to win the next flight.</v>

1087
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Maybe who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying as far as game plan wise,</v>

1088
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 4>I think it favors wonderboy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:44.091
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that tyron knows like wonder boys </v>

1090
00:45:44.091 --> 00:45:46.630
<v Speaker 4>timing and he's be able to rock them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna have some serious confidence </v>

1091
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:50.391
<v Speaker 4>in launching that right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But go ahead and move forward on one </v>

1092
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:50.391
<v Speaker 4>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what happens.</v>

1093
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But sometimes it works.</v>

1094
00:45:51.211 --> 00:45:56.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's been able to take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other people being able to take them </v>

1095
00:45:56.211 --> 00:45:57.570
<v Speaker 4>down and when he gets them down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the difference in the grappling was</v>

1096
00:45:57.571 --> 00:46:00.730
<v Speaker 4>pretty fucking evident to me look like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>white belt versus you know,</v>

1097
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.550
<v Speaker 4>just so much stronger.</v>

1098
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.130
<v Speaker 4>It's so much better at holding them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

1099
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:04.830
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1100
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.850
<v Speaker 4>if this fight goes this way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woodley's going to run away with.</v>

1101
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.200
<v Speaker 4>It was what I thought I thought to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

1102
00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:11.490
<v Speaker 4>busted them open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad,</v>

1103
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.520
<v Speaker 4>bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when you're dealing with </v>

1104
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.401
<v Speaker 4>wonderboy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with that weird sideways </v>

1105
00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:19.950
<v Speaker 4>stance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just popping that jab and his face,</v>

1106
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 4>hands down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands down.</v>

1107
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:24.380
<v Speaker 4>He's a weird guy to spar with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is one boy,</v>

1108
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 4>he didn't let his hands go at all at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1109
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.000
<v Speaker 4>That lefthand and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so good going south.</v>

1110
00:46:31.001 --> 00:46:32.610
<v Speaker 4>Paul traditionally can go back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>forth,</v>

1111
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.970
<v Speaker 4>but it was all kicks for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he,</v>

1112
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.100
<v Speaker 4>I think he was worried after that </v>
<v Speaker 4>takedown and getting busted up,</v>

1113
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.190
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1114
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 4>opening up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting taken down again.</v>

1115
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:45.980
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tyron is a totally different animal to </v>

1116
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:45.980
<v Speaker 4>is a different animal than Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hendricks.</v>

1117
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Like great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny.</v>

1118
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:51.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the Johnny Hendricks that wonderboy </v>

1119
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:51.130
<v Speaker 4>faced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's be honest,</v>

1120
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:51.820
<v Speaker 4>he's not the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not even close.</v>

1121
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.980
<v Speaker 4>He just not know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1122
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.220
<v Speaker 4>He's not the same guy that knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>John Fitch.</v>

1123
00:46:55.221 --> 00:46:57.060
<v Speaker 4>He's not the same guy that knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>Martin Kampmann.</v>

1124
00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:58.240
<v Speaker 4>He's just not the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1125
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:03.320
<v Speaker 4>just not know for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speculate all you want Internet for </v>

1126
00:47:03.331 --> 00:47:05.190
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe it's motivation.</v>

1127
00:47:05.191 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a personal problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Camps,</v>

1128
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He opened up a steak restaurant and it </v>

1129
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 4>went out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrible idea.</v>

1130
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:15.120
<v Speaker 4>But maybe he just terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to worst of your celebrity,</v>

1131
00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:17.310
<v Speaker 4>you've got some cash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the worst idea of restaurants.</v>

1132
00:47:17.311 --> 00:47:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Not The way to gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to be successful and happy.</v>

1133
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.350
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather be stressed out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>broke.</v>

1134
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:27.470
<v Speaker 4>I hate money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a restaurant I can invest </v>

1135
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.470
<v Speaker 4>in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1136
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrible idea.</v>

1137
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Even if they just put his name on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's still associated with that failure.</v>

1138
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he had to have some form of </v>
<v Speaker 4>commitment to it.</v>

1139
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:36.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you got a sign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will people even fucking t-bones for 30 </v>

1140
00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:36.450
<v Speaker 4>percent off or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>

1141
00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:37.510
<v Speaker 4>the not read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1142
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:42.570
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yahoo and yelp reviews rather they were </v>

1143
00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:42.570
<v Speaker 4>terribly bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other were the worst.</v>

1144
00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:44.800
<v Speaker 4>It was like one star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can be associated with that.</v>

1145
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 4>Like if you want to open up a restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're a celebrity,</v>

1146
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.550
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she'd be a really small place or ubs</v>

1147
00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 4>or it'd be a silent investor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like don't be,</v>

1148
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.170
<v Speaker 4>don't be the face of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1149
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.360
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of places like that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>La.</v>

1150
00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:58.950
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1151

<v Speaker 4>Travis Barker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Humans,</v>

1153
00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 4>a crossroads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't see a mark and stuff like </v>

1154
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.661
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like an obviously not your cup </v>

1155
00:48:09.661 --> 00:48:10.130
<v Speaker 4>of tea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all a Vegan restaurant though.</v>

1156
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like the number one place in La as </v>
<v Speaker 4>far as Vegan killing it.</v>

1157
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.280

1158
00:48:15.281 --> 00:48:18.130
<v Speaker 4>like his face on the front of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant rather than playing the drums</v>

1159
00:48:18.131 --> 00:48:19.990
<v Speaker 4>while they're serving up spring rolls.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Rocky did the last one,</v>

1178
00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:57.290
<v Speaker 4>but it's also for an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially a fighter where your mind and</v>

1179
00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1181
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.570
<v Speaker 4>but for everybody listening it happened.</v>

1182
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.080
<v Speaker 4>It takes months before the event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're thinking about this event.</v>

1183
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 4>We're preparing for the event and an </v>
<v Speaker 4>event is one night.</v>

1184
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Anything that can fuck your head up </v>
<v Speaker 4>along the way should be avoided.</v>

1185
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:16.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be thinking about getting </v>

1186
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.721
<v Speaker 4>mass discounts on t bones and filet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be really worried about </v>

1187

<v Speaker 4>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Anything that could fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1189
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>can creep into your mind.</v>

1190
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.110
<v Speaker 4>Will look great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Transition.</v>

1191
00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tate.</v>

1192
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:32.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told him I'm not taking anything away </v>

1193
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:32.220
<v Speaker 4>from Pennington.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought she was brilliant.</v>

1194
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:36.421
<v Speaker 4>She did her job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought there was a real bad matchup </v>

1195
00:49:36.421 --> 00:49:36.421
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show,</v>

1196
00:49:36.421 --> 00:49:36.421
<v Speaker 4>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super underrated,</v>

1197
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.870
<v Speaker 4>but she.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's underrated for sure.</v>

1198
00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:41.040
<v Speaker 4>I also think that version of me shut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I and I,</v>

1199
00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.330
<v Speaker 4>I just said that's Misha doesn't look </v>
<v Speaker 4>into it or something else is going on.</v>

1200
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.630
<v Speaker 4>She said I'm an off night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

1201
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:51.690
<v Speaker 4>it didn't look like the normal meesha </v>
<v Speaker 4>were used to seeing and for Misha for </v>

1202
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:52.290
<v Speaker 4>her to say I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

1203
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:57.440
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't hear it because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching with a live crowd so I </v>

1204
00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:57.440
<v Speaker 4>can hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she retired.</v>

1205
00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.540
<v Speaker 4>She retired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When she say she was just like,</v>

1206
00:49:58.541 --> 00:49:59.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1207
00:49:59.531 --> 00:50:01.090
<v Speaker 4>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to say I'm done.</v>

1208
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:02.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1209
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:04.200
<v Speaker 4>it was this based entirely on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance?</v>

1210
00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Is that something you planned?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>

1211
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:07.480
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was based on my performance.</v>

1212
00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:12.840
<v Speaker 4>And then she said that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've taken a lot of punishment and I'm </v>

1213
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.990
<v Speaker 4>fairman that's fair and she's also to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1214
00:50:15.991 --> 00:50:18.130
<v Speaker 4>someone you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want your daughters to look up to.</v>

1215
00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:23.131
<v Speaker 4>Like she's such a great face for women's</v>
<v Speaker 4>MMA just because obviously she's a </v>

1216
00:50:23.131 --> 00:50:24.940
<v Speaker 4>beautiful young lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably the best looking one the UFC,</v>

1217
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:27.100
<v Speaker 4>but she also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she speaks very well.</v>

1218
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.090
<v Speaker 4>She has the skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about a lady who,</v>

1219
00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.850
<v Speaker 4>if you would've told her she'd been </v>
<v Speaker 4>champion in the UFC,</v>

1220
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:37.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after you've seen our fights with ron </v>

1221
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.150
<v Speaker 4>and these other fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1222
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure she.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1223
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.961
<v Speaker 4>you're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she just came back from adversity </v>

1224
00:50:40.961 --> 00:50:41.000
<v Speaker 4>like when she beat Holly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing,</v>

1225
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.480
<v Speaker 4>amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for her now there's so much more for</v>

1226
00:50:44.481 --> 00:50:49.481
<v Speaker 4>her to do this why I'm proud of her and </v>
<v Speaker 4>her getting out when she did because I </v>

1227
00:50:49.481 --> 00:50:51.050
<v Speaker 4>don't know if you've heard her breakdown</v>
<v Speaker 4>fights as a female analyst.</v>

1228
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 4>She is so damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

1229
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.270
<v Speaker 4>She's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's very smart.</v>

1230
00:50:56.271 --> 00:51:01.271
<v Speaker 4>She's very good at breaking down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights as far as not like Joe Rogan </v>

1231
00:51:01.271 --> 00:51:01.271
<v Speaker 4>style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1232
00:51:01.271 --> 00:51:02.780
<v Speaker 4>Brian Stann style dump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Krista.</v>

1233
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:07.870
<v Speaker 4>She's good as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an analyst on when she's up there </v>

1234
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:08.750
<v Speaker 4>with like Stan and business and those </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1235
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.120
<v Speaker 4>And have you had on your show?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have not had another show.</v>

1236
00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 4>I listened to her on your show and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought she was brilliant.</v>

1237
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:14.500
<v Speaker 4>She's got her own show now too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does she?</v>

1238
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Has she has her own podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1239
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.240
<v Speaker 4>Well she's already doing it the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1240
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.570
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1241
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.110
<v Speaker 4>I think for her man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sky's the limit.</v>

1242
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.190
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

1243
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.410
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think if she really mean,</v>

1244
00:51:24.411 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 4>everybody always says that if you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>one foot out the door,</v>

1245
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:28.520
<v Speaker 4>you should just walk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just go there.</v>

1246
00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:31.580
<v Speaker 4>You go here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why he sent me down here.</v>

1247
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Well excuse me sir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're telling Dick Jokes and trying to </v>

1248
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.910
<v Speaker 4>fight right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's one thing?</v>

1249
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Watching somebody who you don't love </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's just like,</v>

1250
00:51:39.441 --> 00:51:41.360
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or even you do love,</v>

1251
00:51:41.361 --> 00:51:42.890
<v Speaker 4>you don't have that close of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with.</v>

1252
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.170
<v Speaker 4>But as a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1253
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 4>you have a close friendship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>

1254
00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 4>You see the path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's one of those things,</v>

1255
00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:51.620
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see it time and time again.</v>

1256
00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can name you 100 guys that I know that</v>

1257

<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>then they get knocked out or they'll </v>

<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1264
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:15.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably going to be the </v>

1265
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:15.100
<v Speaker 4>best thing for me should too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that I said to me,</v>

1266
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:15.100
<v Speaker 4>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1267
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.420
<v Speaker 4>you've already achieved the highest </v>
<v Speaker 4>achievement ever in mma.</v>

1268
00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:19.160
<v Speaker 4>You were world champion in the UFC.</v>

1269
00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 4>So like you know that no one could ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>take that from her.</v>

1270
00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 4>She wanted it in spectacular fashion and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was an amazing accomplishment.</v>

1271
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.320
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant thing to have on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>resume.</v>

1272
00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:30.650
<v Speaker 4>Former world champion and she's at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect time.</v>

1273
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Just talking about from a business side </v>
<v Speaker 4>of things is the,</v>

1274
00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:37.040
<v Speaker 4>the UFC contract with Fox is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is coming up.</v>

1275
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:42.100
<v Speaker 4>So what they're going to do from my </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding is it's going to be on </v>

1276
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:46.541
<v Speaker 4>multiple networks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's going to be like the NFL or Mba </v>

1277
00:52:46.541 --> 00:52:48.920
<v Speaker 4>or whatever these other sports leagues </v>
<v Speaker 4>with just tied to Fox,</v>

1278
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.860
<v Speaker 4>which opens up the door for espn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>CBS,</v>

1279
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:56.890
<v Speaker 4>all these other networks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that opens up the door for all these </v>

1280
00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:57.630
<v Speaker 4>other shows for her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I,</v>

1281
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.070
<v Speaker 4>if I'm a Misha tate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't sign with Fox right now.</v>

1282
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.650
<v Speaker 4>She's the best female analyst in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game to me.</v>

1283
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:08.950
<v Speaker 4>I think she waits to that deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes and then fields all the offers and </v>

1284
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.621
<v Speaker 4>she has the time to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She might or UFC might offer some sort </v>

1285
00:53:12.621 --> 00:53:12.621
<v Speaker 4>of an in house Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1286
00:53:12.621 --> 00:53:13.890
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see that saying,</v>

1287
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:15.330
<v Speaker 4>don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do that man.</v>

1288
00:53:15.331 --> 00:53:20.331
<v Speaker 4>The farmer manager don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let them play the negotiating game and </v>

1289
00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:23.471
<v Speaker 4>she has so many talents and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming along like crew who speaks or it </v>

1290
00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:23.471
<v Speaker 4>looks like her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that happening with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't there a network issue?</v>

1292
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is some sort of an issue with you </v>

1293
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:32.961
<v Speaker 4>guys being on Fox for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for us it's just a brag.</v>

1294
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Don't talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Rogan and we before.</v>

1295
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:40.821
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to talk about it and you don't </v>

1296
00:53:40.821 --> 00:53:40.821
<v Speaker 4>mean I'm an open book and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do what?</v>

1297
00:53:40.821 --> 00:53:42.120
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to talk about it if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to know.</v>

1298
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I know we always talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me it's just a um,</v>

1299
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:46.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always,</v>

1300
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:52.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm always in the understanding of we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't need anybody and you've always </v>

1301
00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.060
<v Speaker 4>said that and I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fire and the kid fan base and,</v>

1302
00:53:55.061 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 4>and what we've achieved has literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing to do with Fox,</v>

1303
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:00.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they gave us a studio and I,</v>

1304
00:54:00.151 --> 00:54:02.190
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm grateful for that stuff,</v>

1305
00:54:02.191 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 4>but we would be here with or without </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1306
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>studios not that big a deal.</v>

1307
00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 4>You just want to rent office space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys,</v>

1308
00:54:08.851 --> 00:54:11.880
<v Speaker 4>we all know people that do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom and Christina do it.</v>

1309
00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Joey Diaz does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

1310
00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:15.570
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just rent space,</v>

1311
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 4>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Hard to do.</v>

1312
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1313
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.780
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our biggest issue would be finding a,</v>

1314
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:25.070
<v Speaker 4>a good producer to help us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a young Jamie you would have to do </v>

1315
00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:27.090
<v Speaker 4>is put out the ad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw the bat signal up online.</v>

1316
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:32.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the best signal signal we're </v>

1317
00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:33.020
<v Speaker 4>looking for one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:38.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you find someone who knows how to </v>

1319
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.460
<v Speaker 4>handle the internet side of things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure Jamie can help them,</v>

1320
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.920
<v Speaker 4>what's going on today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting,</v>

1321
00:54:40.921 --> 00:54:45.921
<v Speaker 4>and podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we've kind of talked about this </v>

1322
00:54:45.921 --> 00:54:47.661
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is that the real network is the </v>

1323
00:54:47.661 --> 00:54:48.750
<v Speaker 4>organic network between friends?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1324
00:54:48.751 --> 00:54:53.751
<v Speaker 4>It's between all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Between Joey and bill burr and Bert </v>

1325
00:54:53.751 --> 00:54:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Kreischer and Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all just a bunch of friends and we</v>

1326
00:54:56.041 --> 00:55:01.041
<v Speaker 4>talk about each other and we have each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other on and everybody finds out about </v>

1327
00:55:01.041 --> 00:55:03.810
<v Speaker 4>each other from each other and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>retweet each other and re instagram each</v>

1328
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 4>other and support each other and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not like a real network where there's no</v>

1329
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:12.090
<v Speaker 4>deals going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no paper signed.</v>

1330
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.460
<v Speaker 4>It's an and then everybody sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefiting from it.</v>

1331
00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.770
<v Speaker 4>Equally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets something out of it,</v>

1332
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:18.390
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real network.</v>

1333
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:23.391
<v Speaker 4>This other thing is a weird business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're noncreative people capitalize on </v>

1334
00:55:23.391 --> 00:55:25.660
<v Speaker 4>the work of creative people and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>provide you with what?</v>

1335
00:55:25.661 --> 00:55:29.250
<v Speaker 4>A fucking series of walls and an </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet connection.</v>

1336
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you for that.</v>

1337
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:33.570
<v Speaker 4>You definitely should get half the money</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of your fucking mind.</v>

1338
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.340
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1339
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.280
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a different age now that,</v>

1340
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:38.460
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're going into.</v>

1341
00:55:38.461 --> 00:55:40.010
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1342
00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 4>we're in a good spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing.</v>

1343
00:55:41.731 --> 00:55:46.731
<v Speaker 4>We're in a good spot and we have offers </v>
<v Speaker 4>from all these other networks and stuff </v>

1344
00:55:46.731 --> 00:55:48.000
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's all good in the hood.</v>

1345
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:53.060
<v Speaker 4>The most important thing is just you </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys love what you do and the show is </v>

1346
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.120
<v Speaker 4>fun and that's the biggest thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then people are going to still enjoy it.</v>

1347
00:55:54.121 --> 00:55:56.550
<v Speaker 4>So it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it as little as you can.</v>

1348
00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Speaker 4>I guess for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see it as a opportunity.</v>

1349
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 4>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we were discussing it today,</v>

1350
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 4>I was excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1351
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:07.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you kind of get our Joe Rogan now,</v>

1352
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:09.030
<v Speaker 4>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to do that for sure.</v>

1353
00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:10.390
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys have done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you know,</v>

1354
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 4>my friend Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was on last week,</v>

1355
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 4>he had a similar situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was with one network.</v>

1356
00:56:14.701 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 4>He left that and went with another </v>
<v Speaker 4>network and he was like,</v>

1357
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:19.020
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I told him,</v>

1358
00:56:19.021 --> 00:56:20.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm like to just keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just be free.</v>

1359
00:56:20.921 --> 00:56:22.110
<v Speaker 4>You just get out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1360
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 4>I think what people don't is like all</v>

1361
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marketing,</v>

1362
00:56:25.691 --> 00:56:28.810
<v Speaker 1>the merchandise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have five hired our own booker.</v>

1363
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:31.210
<v Speaker 1>We found our own published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all in house.</v>

1364
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:36.240
<v Speaker 1>It's all whatever I want to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we literally just show up to the </v>

1365
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.931
<v Speaker 1>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine how they thought that </v>

1366
00:56:39.931 --> 00:56:39.931
<v Speaker 1>they'd get 50 percent of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

1367
00:56:39.931 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just maybe they just don't know how</v>

1368
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 1>much money it is or they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was literally laughing,</v>

1369
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 1>like physically laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1370
00:56:46.691 --> 00:56:48.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to resolve it.</v>

1371
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:51.630
<v Speaker 1>How'd you end it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's off to the agents call agent.</v>

1372
00:56:51.631 --> 00:56:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Like there you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1373
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I should have never brought you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place at all.</v>

1374
00:56:55.661 --> 00:57:00.661
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's supposed to be done with </v>
<v Speaker 1>agents and that's supposed to bring you </v>

1375
00:57:00.661 --> 00:57:00.940
<v Speaker 1>in and talk financials with you with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1376
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1377
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if to almost to a fault,</v>

1378
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm very in on as far as the business </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

1379
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Things go with fighter and the kid like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be involved now.</v>

1380
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Now when it goes to negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1381
00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:18.391
<v Speaker 1>you guys do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to change the logo from a </v>

1382
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:20.710
<v Speaker 1>maroon to an orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better fucking go over it with me.</v>

1383
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 1>If you do some without me knowing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have issues.</v>

1384
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Do they think they can do that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit though?</v>

1385
00:57:25.031 --> 00:57:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they would start doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they did it once and I was like,</v>

1386
00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:29.320
<v Speaker 1>well what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1387
00:57:29.321 --> 00:57:31.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they changed something if some logo,</v>

1388
00:57:31.601 --> 00:57:34.540
<v Speaker 1>they tweeted something out that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>approve and you know,</v>

1389
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you can call me a control freak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1390
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.090
<v Speaker 1>So this is like the network did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox.</v>

1391
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1392
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Well they have certain people run the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1393
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.100
<v Speaker 1>the accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1394
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:44.040
<v Speaker 1>So they just decided that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1395
00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

1396
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1397
00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a weird gray area,</v>

1398
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your own show.</v>

1399
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 1>You have a very limited amount of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in charge of that show,</v>

1400
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.070
<v Speaker 1>but all these other people that are sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of used to like if they have a show,</v>

1401
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 1>they get a say they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I remember when they were telling</v>

1402
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you not to swear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1403
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Other than that they sent you is for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys to go get free money.</v>

1404
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You've been saying that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No swearing.</v>

1405
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1406
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.180
<v Speaker 1>It makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes the audience like almost you think</v>

1407
00:58:10.181 --> 00:58:12.430
<v Speaker 1>they're stupid or they can't handle the </v>
<v Speaker 1>swear words.</v>

1408
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 1>People were getting upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes away everything.</v>

1409
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:20.161
<v Speaker 1>That's great about the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's great about the Internet is you </v>

1410
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:20.161
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be yourself.</v>

1411
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:20.810
<v Speaker 1>You got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You be yourself in.</v>

1412
00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:23.400
<v Speaker 1>But also what they don't realize any.</v>

1413
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just an old school way of thinking.</v>

1414
00:58:24.971 --> 00:58:29.971
<v Speaker 1>They don't realize how big podcasting is</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting because whether I'm at Fox,</v>

1415
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Joe Rogan's bathroom doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1416
00:58:32.711 --> 00:58:34.720
<v Speaker 1>The listeners just want the audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1417
00:58:34.721 --> 00:58:36.310
<v Speaker 1>They just want the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do it.</v>

1418
00:58:36.311 --> 00:58:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a little microphone that I hook up</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mark.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he really does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get the point.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they didn't fire us.</v>

1473
01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I have to set some outlandish shit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that show.</v>

1474
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:51.170

<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1475
01:00:51.171 --> 01:00:52.820

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1476
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they pay attention or </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1477
01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>they know the numbers so they know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

1478
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing they do know because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on their network.</v>

1479
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>So the Lord Jesus is because there's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing that they have,</v>

1480
01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>especially kind of down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a time there when I,</v>

1481
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>especially right when I retired and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1482
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was angry.</v>

1483
01:01:09.651 --> 01:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I was angry at certain things may not </v>
<v Speaker 1>lash out on the mic and stuff like that.</v>

1484
01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Especially in their office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in cahoots with the UFC.</v>

1485
01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>So how they didn't fire me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1486
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the worst thing could be that </v>

1487
01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>they did fire you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually smart.</v>

1488
01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>They didn't because you know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streisand effect is.</v>

1489
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see now band me and I went</v>

<v Speaker 1>like that that have happened where </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone gets bigger because like Milo </v>

01:01:36.881 --> 01:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>He got banned from twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>banned from twitter because he was </v>

1496
01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>making fun of ghostbusters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Became bigger than ever became like this</v>

1497
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>cultural icon because it's publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't pay for it.</v>

1498
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Look at Ariel Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad example in Hawaii.</v>

1499
01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when the use banned him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kicked him out and they went on.</v>

1500
01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>All those networks use like my bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My bad.</v>

1501
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:54.630

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1502
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he's.</v>

1503
01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Is he out again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1504
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the brock lesnar thing.</v>

1505
01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he was in New York?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1506
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Was He there in the arena?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he have press credentials?</v>

1507
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I saw him walking around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1508
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>he was fired from Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was fired from Fox.</v>

1509
01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1510
01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>but not fired from his shot and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC me.</v>

1511
01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So he's banned from being in the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a little while.</v>

1512
01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Then they let them back in and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dana's defense and the ucs defenses,</v>

1514
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:24.490
<v Speaker 1>the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1515
01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>certain leagues do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

1516
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:32.331
<v Speaker 1>they don't allow certain people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like as much as North Korea </v>

1517
01:02:32.611 --> 01:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>is that we thought like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are leaks.</v>

1518
01:02:34.741 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Who Band guys from coming to the events?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I dunno,</v>

1519
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what the fuck the NFL does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not even worth me talking about </v>

1520
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.690
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about Habib number?</v>

1521
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Good men off the fucking scary monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guys.</v>

1522
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did get clipped,</v>

1523
01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:53.830
<v Speaker 1>slept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson clipped him and I'm </v>

1524
01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:53.830
<v Speaker 1>watching that.</v>

1525
01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would connor due to this kid bright</v>

1526
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>because before I'm like kind of get </v>
<v Speaker 1>marked by Khabib.</v>

1527
01:02:56.350 --> 01:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>And I saw him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if Johnson lands that you bet your </v>

1528
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:01.460
<v Speaker 1>sweet ass connor's going to land that </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical lefthand.</v>

1529
01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done questioned what conner's </v>

1530
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>capable of because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie is a tough matchup.</v>

1531
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I think he's gonna win this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1532
01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared for this fight.</v>

1533
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I kind of want to see him fight Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see him fight Brock Lesnar.</v>

1534
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him take months off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see him take six months off </v>

1535
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:19.350
<v Speaker 1>and bulk up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's crazy?</v>

1536
01:03:19.351 --> 01:03:24.351
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that outlandish to see that </v>

1537
01:03:24.351 --> 01:03:24.750
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1538
01:03:24.751 --> 01:03:26.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible.</v>

1539
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:26.720
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1540
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.780
<v Speaker 1>the hiccup in that is the UFC is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we just let him get all the belts</v>

1541
01:03:30.781 --> 01:03:33.300
<v Speaker 1>and all the control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where do we stop it before,</v>

1542
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:38.390
<v Speaker 1>before he's running this stuff to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>up one of his belts to take on another </v>

1543
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.390
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1544
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:40.350
<v Speaker 1>He needs to get about 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45,</v>

1545
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never going to fight there again.</v>

1546
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.950
<v Speaker 1>He might know that that cut down a tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>match,</v>

1547
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but the cuts different now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to begin your rehydration</v>

1548
01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:51.570
<v Speaker 1>much earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can weigh in at 8:00</v>

1549
01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight to 10 in the morning.</v>

1550
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.240
<v Speaker 1>So by the time the ceremonial way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolls around,</v>

1551
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 1>it was in New York City at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM.</v>

1552
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.300
<v Speaker 1>He was full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he looked great.</v>

1553
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:05.390
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look dehydrated at all at 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even at 55 you used to look </v>

1554
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.390
<v Speaker 1>dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1555
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40th five.</v>

1556
01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>He lived near the door of death and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

1557
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:11.850
<v Speaker 1>We've never really seen him at 55 in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

1558
01:04:11.851 --> 01:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen him in case or some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

1559
01:04:14.681 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>So it was 45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1560
01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how even makes it even as </v>
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

1561
01:04:17.741 --> 01:04:18.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1562
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:19.350
<v Speaker 1>it's way too tough on him.</v>

1563
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Just let that belt go though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you did your thing.</v>

1564
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Let it go because you're keeping that </v>
<v Speaker 1>division hostage.</v>

1565
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>You got pedes Max Holloway coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

1566
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hilarious too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because it's not my </v>

1567
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.390
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I was,</v>

1568
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:35.481
<v Speaker 1>although I'd be fucking freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he was the champ forever three </v>

1569
01:04:35.481 --> 01:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>match so bad it ain't happening because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he really retired.</v>

1570
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>He retired and then thought he was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go do something else,</v>

1571
01:04:40.201 --> 01:04:42.810
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he thought the use was like,</v>

1572
01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:43.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1573
01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:48.530
<v Speaker 1>do your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he realized how tough those </v>

1574
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.530
<v Speaker 1>contractors and came back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1575
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:52.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like I have to fight and let's do </v>

1576
01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:52.820
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1577
01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:52.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's he gonna fight.</v>

1578
01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if Petterson Holloway always </v>
<v Speaker 1>been knocking on the fucking door for a </v>

1579
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:57.330
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1580
01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Nine straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How he does this ridiculous.</v>

1581
01:04:59.481 --> 01:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Just needs a bigger name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

1582
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs getting more famous.</v>

1583
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:05.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the day and age when he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked to get famous or get on the mic,</v>

1584
01:05:05.671 --> 01:05:10.671
<v Speaker 1>talk some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really interested to see him versus </v>

1585
01:05:10.671 --> 01:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>pedes pedes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's real diminished by that.</v>

1586
01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1587
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard cut for him to get on 45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1588
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I love this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan,</v>

1589
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't looked the same as of late.</v>

1590
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 4>Max Holloway is a slick motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1591
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 4>You realize it now after you watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>Frankie Edgar and Jeremy Stevens fight,</v>

1592
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 4>you realize how Slick Holloway is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was never in trouble in that fight,</v>

1593
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:35.610
<v Speaker 4>never went.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then also think about his last last </v>

1594
01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:35.610
<v Speaker 4>was conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conor,</v>

1595
01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:37.540
<v Speaker 4>how jacked up knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I went to decision the only decision</v>

1596
01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:40.980
<v Speaker 4>congress had in the UFC and think how </v>
<v Speaker 4>much better Max Holloway's now.</v>

1597
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he wins this one,</v>

1598
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:43.800
<v Speaker 4>dear God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone's listening to that,</v>

1599
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:45.100
<v Speaker 4>get a title shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1600
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 4>What's you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1601
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.820
<v Speaker 4>What do you do with Tony and Khabib </v>
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>

1602
01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:54.060
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about too crazy wind </v>
<v Speaker 4>streaks to like how do you even just </v>

1603
01:05:54.521 --> 01:05:56.970
<v Speaker 4>making flight has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the life thing.</v>

1604
01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:58.660
<v Speaker 4>You make them fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

1605
01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.150
<v Speaker 4>but let's say you had to pick one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1606
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:03.400
<v Speaker 4>If is a guy off at 55 and three months.</v>

1607
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.750
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck wants some?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1608
01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before that fight,</v>

1609
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:08.650
<v Speaker 4>Tony Ferguson was the number one </v>
<v Speaker 4>contender.</v>

1610
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.110
<v Speaker 4>Rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just beat Hoffeld.</v>

1611
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Dos Anjos beat a shitload of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so active.</v>

1612
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:13.690
<v Speaker 4>Your speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Edson Barboza,</v>

1613
01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:16.570
<v Speaker 4>he was the number one contender </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to whatever the rankings are,</v>

1614
01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:21.571
<v Speaker 4>which I don't think are accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden toss some of them kind </v>

1615
01:06:21.571 --> 01:06:21.571
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

1616
01:06:21.571 --> 01:06:24.070
<v Speaker 4>But the second position right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he's still number one,</v>

1617
01:06:24.071 --> 01:06:26.050
<v Speaker 4>is clearly habib.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Habib was number one,</v>

1618
01:06:26.051 --> 01:06:28.130
<v Speaker 4>but have has been way more inactive than</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tony.</v>

1619
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.990
<v Speaker 4>But the way a be mauled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Johnson,</v>

1620
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.420
<v Speaker 4>I think he makes his case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was an old hall.</v>

1621
01:06:34.421 --> 01:06:37.900
<v Speaker 4>We both have a cake ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Undefeated ones on knife fight,</v>

1622
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:39.850
<v Speaker 4>win streak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Tony,</v>

1623
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought he dismantled RDF.</v>

1624
01:06:42.341 --> 01:06:43.390
<v Speaker 4>It looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

1625
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.800
<v Speaker 4>Khabib.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1626
01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:49.801
<v Speaker 4>Ragdolled dos Anjos two and then fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a destroy.</v>

1627
01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:51.100
<v Speaker 4>Johnson was horrible.</v>

1628
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.230
<v Speaker 4>Watching them beat up Johnson because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>

1629
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:58.240
<v Speaker 4>He's so good at tying up that one arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ties up the one arm then fucking </v>

1630
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:58.240
<v Speaker 4>smashes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

1631
01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.990
<v Speaker 4>Wish you had them in mountain home with </v>
<v Speaker 4>one arm.</v>

1632
01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:05.290
<v Speaker 4>Try to protect them and he's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>just thumped in the head.</v>

1633
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:08.380
<v Speaker 4>It's got a hold of that chicken wing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other than snap that bitch up.</v>

1634
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not good.</v>

1635
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.920
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'd tap.</v>

1636
01:07:11.921 --> 01:07:13.570
<v Speaker 4>Please tap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like brave heart.</v>

1637
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.550
<v Speaker 4>Just come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say it deep.</v>

1638
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:20.610
<v Speaker 4>It was so deep too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking Nog when Nog and Frank </v>

1639
01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Mir fall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was thinking.</v>

1640
01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is going to snap,</v>

1641
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:24.670
<v Speaker 4>but like same with Henzel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you refused the tap,</v>

1642
01:07:24.671 --> 01:07:27.670
<v Speaker 4>I get that you're pursuing Jiu Jitsu to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the day you die.</v>

1643
01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:29.730
<v Speaker 4>Like with trump saying let's go ahead </v>
<v Speaker 4>and tap those,</v>

1644
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.300
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1645
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:31.960
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad he tapped me to.</v>

1646
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.960
<v Speaker 4>I was literally squeezing my hands </v>
<v Speaker 4>together when I was doing the </v>

1647
01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:36.960
<v Speaker 4>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm come on tap.</v>

1648
01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Come on top just to let now thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just when he got them down and then</v>

1649
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:41.290
<v Speaker 4>immediately slid right into mounted </v>
<v Speaker 4>guillotine.</v>

1650
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.730
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ and his GRANDPA.</v>

1651
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So good.</v>

1652
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:47.470
<v Speaker 4>His grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So good.</v>

1653
01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:49.170
<v Speaker 4>It's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1654
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:50.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If so,</v>

1655
01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.760
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those two?</v>

1656
01:07:51.761 --> 01:07:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Fighting the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fight conor and Habiba the fight.</v>

1657
01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not happening,</v>

1658
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.960
<v Speaker 4>but I think Khabib needs to get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>title,</v>

1659
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get a title shot.</v>

1660
01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:02.410
<v Speaker 4>At least that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should.</v>

1661
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 4>I think he deserves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the only undefeated challenger.</v>

1662
01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.750
<v Speaker 4>He's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's mauled everybody in front of him.</v>

1663
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.580
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't had a single God damn close </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

1664
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 4>He said one moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one moment where he gets dinged,</v>

1665
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 4>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking,</v>

1666
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:17.060
<v Speaker 4>you're speaking logically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think getting guys that deserve it.</v>

1667
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:18.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're.</v>

1668
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 4>We're an entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>

1669
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Just the same way conor leapfrogged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone got the title shot.</v>

1670
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.140
<v Speaker 4>Listen to what I'm saying to you right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1671
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:29.600
<v Speaker 4>The UFC is about to go to Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that?</v>

1672
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:30.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to get in.</v>

1673
01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:32.000
<v Speaker 4>The downloads are going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1674
01:08:32.001 --> 01:08:32.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1675
01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:37.680
<v Speaker 4>To see in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conor mcgregor versus Habib Yarmulke met</v>

1676
01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:41.530
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think is common gi.</v>

1677
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:46.760
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of rush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just shy kids got on the mic right?</v>

1678
01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:47.320
<v Speaker 4>And was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1679
01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 4>you know how much bigger fucking Russia </v>
<v Speaker 4>is than Ireland,</v>

1680
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.200
<v Speaker 4>but he's not the same star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well here's the rushes bigger than </v>

1681
01:08:56.421 --> 01:09:01.421
<v Speaker 4>Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the United States bigger than </v>

1682
01:09:01.421 --> 01:09:03.701
<v Speaker 4>Ireland too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when fucking connor is fighting in </v>

1683
01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:06.491
<v Speaker 4>New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is an hour and a half from Eddie </v>

1684
01:09:06.491 --> 01:09:06.491
<v Speaker 4>Alvarez House,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're booing.</v>

1685
01:09:06.491 --> 01:09:09.050
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Alvarez is walking to the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

1686
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.950
<v Speaker 4>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

1687
01:09:09.951 --> 01:09:12.400
<v Speaker 4>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ireland is the biggest star by far.</v>

1688
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you go to Russia,</v>

1689
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:19.910
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he gets booed in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you think if Kobi was that big of </v>

1690
01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:21.200
<v Speaker 4>a star in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

1691
01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:23.870
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a sanction and stuff and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going there.</v>

1692
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:26.540
<v Speaker 4>If you check my instagram page every </v>
<v Speaker 4>time a fucking photo gets up,</v>

1693
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.590
<v Speaker 4>I know time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading time.</v>

1694
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.630
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>King.</v>

1695
01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:30.830
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he champ.</v>

1696
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.920
<v Speaker 4>He deserves it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a reason why it hasn't been </v>

1697
01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.650
<v Speaker 4>the headline of a paper view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe in the states here.</v>

1698
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.670
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1699
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:42.700
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he is a fucking monster and he's a </v>

1700
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.690
<v Speaker 4>hero to the Russian mma fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1701
01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.880
<v Speaker 4>This guy from Dagestan has been mall in </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

1702
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.700
<v Speaker 4>They put in front of them and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>think and rightly so,</v>

1703
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:53.570
<v Speaker 4>that he's unjustly keeping being kept </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather from a title shot.</v>

1704
01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.800
<v Speaker 4>We can't say it's been kept from Natasha</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's been injured for a long.</v>

1705
01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 4>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's keeping them from getting injured?</v>

1706
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:00.380
<v Speaker 4>The blame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then a AK.</v>

1707
01:10:00.381 --> 01:10:01.850
<v Speaker 4>That's not commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true,</v>

1708
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:06.110
<v Speaker 4>but they did promise him this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was something that they said,</v>

1709
01:10:06.111 --> 01:10:07.540
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Habib gets the next shot.</v>

1710
01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.560
<v Speaker 4>The title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was something that was publicly </v>

1711
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.141
<v Speaker 4>stated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which made sense at the time because </v>

1712
01:10:14.141 --> 01:10:16.421
<v Speaker 4>it'd be was 23 and he's going to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive square garden for the title </v>

1713
01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:20.470
<v Speaker 4>because what they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about the connor versus Eddie </v>

1714
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:21.040
<v Speaker 4>Alvarez can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't sell tickets exactly how it</v>

1715
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:21.430
<v Speaker 4>went.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

1716
01:10:21.431 --> 01:10:23.630
<v Speaker 4>I want to fight that with cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll keep you on the car once you.</v>

1717
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:28.750
<v Speaker 4>Once you find on the undercard though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine how he feels when he hears </v>

1718
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.750
<v Speaker 4>that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1719
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:29.090
<v Speaker 4>He gets that phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks this is it.</v>

1720
01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:34.091
<v Speaker 4>Finally I got the title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went in his backyard and beat the </v>

1721
01:10:34.091 --> 01:10:34.091
<v Speaker 4>shit out of Kodiak bear.</v>

1722
01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:37.100
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever seen that video?</v>

1723
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:38.930
<v Speaker 4>He was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>

1724
01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:39.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a kid.</v>

1725
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:43.120

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:48.310
<v Speaker 4>He's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His grappling is ridiculous and I'm </v>

1727
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:49.470
<v Speaker 4>really interested in seeing whether or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not he can get past that lefthand and I.</v>

1728
01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:52.160
<v Speaker 4>If you are correct and that's the fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Russia,</v>

1729
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:57.370
<v Speaker 4>the amount of money they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to pay connor to fight him in </v>

1730
01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:00.581
<v Speaker 4>Russia when connor is still the draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about a different </v>

1731
01:11:00.581 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 4>ballgame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show me the money.</v>

1732
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:07.090

<v Speaker 4>like what other Russian bad assets are </v>

1733
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:07.090
<v Speaker 4>there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fighting UFC.</v>

1734
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:08.300
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a chorus.</v>

1735
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:13.310
<v Speaker 4>Cough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just got knocked the fuck out in </v>

<v Speaker 4>To him as a</v>

1738
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 1>bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1739
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla Monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Russians are in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not to flip the script here,</v>

1741
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:26.091
<v Speaker 1>but this weekend is Andre Ward verse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fricking Kovalev boxing match up a </v>

1742
01:11:28.091 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's talking about either.</v>

1743
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:31.050
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1744
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching all the countdowns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

1745
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't get enough of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1746
01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I've watched that last countdown thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did too.</v>

1747
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>It was on after the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victor Ortiz fight.</v>

1748
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like shit.</v>

1749
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the duty fall was like on sort of </v>

1750
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.130
<v Speaker 1>survival mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was terrified.</v>

1751
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:47.690
<v Speaker 1>He didn't throw any punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1752
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.590
<v Speaker 1>They sit through the whole fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He threw 100 and something.</v>

1753
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>He was so scared and then Ortiz was </v>
<v Speaker 1>touching me.</v>

1754
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Pretend to fall down because he's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for.</v>

1755
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Lydia was grabbing his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Diego hit in the back of the head a </v>

1756
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.750
<v Speaker 1>couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a terrible fight.</v>

1757
01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet you're right.</v>

1758
01:12:00.031 --> 01:12:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Right after that was Andre Ward Kovalev </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the countdown,</v>

1759
01:12:04.081 --> 01:12:06.720
<v Speaker 1>kind of their background and Andre Ward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

1760
01:12:06.721 --> 01:12:08.640
<v Speaker 1>he's just a bigger version of floyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather.</v>

1761
01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Like his defense is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has knockout.</v>

1762
01:12:11.011 --> 01:12:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Power isn't lost since he's 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give him the advantage.</v>

1763
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Some people think a cove to when I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what the betting odds are.</v>

1764
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I was stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way [inaudible] handled hopkins </v>

1765
01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:23.730
<v Speaker 1>and I know Bernard's old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 100 years old.</v>

1766
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.380
<v Speaker 1>It was a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a turtle.</v>

1767
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.240
<v Speaker 1>He looks old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fighting again,</v>

1768
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.410
<v Speaker 1>December 10th or twelfth in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to lie.</v>

1769
01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to that sort of leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in.</v>

1770
01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:37.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the Toronto UFC that weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the weekend of glory.</v>

1771
01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:40.290
<v Speaker 1>That's Badr Hari versus Rico Verhoeven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the best weekend ever?</v>

1772
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been site.</v>

1773
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a good fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Toronto card is static.</v>

1774
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:47.070
<v Speaker 1>It is now because you've got Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>

1775
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:52.280
<v Speaker 1>cowboy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Brown cowboy versus Matt Brown is </v>

1776
01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:52.820
<v Speaker 1>better than cowboy versus gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>

1777
01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.360
<v Speaker 1>That fight did nothing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1778
01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:56.880
<v Speaker 1>gaslamp's done now man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in a bad,</v>

1779
01:12:56.881 --> 01:12:58.080
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad place.</v>

1780
01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Dana says 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's missed.</v>

1781
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.300
<v Speaker 1>He's said that before and made him fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>85 mayberry beat.</v>

1782
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Nate Marquardt a five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1783
01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't a 5:35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark know if my mark artist 70 was it?</v>

1784
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:14.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those fights that he beat </v>

1785
01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:17.361
<v Speaker 1>somebody because he got sent up to 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he proved that he could make the </v>

1786
01:13:17.361 --> 01:13:18.030
<v Speaker 1>weight and he's blaming George Lockhart </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1787
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Now the only person you can blame is </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1788
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>

1791

<v Speaker 1>It's so frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shows you.</v>

1792
01:13:26.521 --> 01:13:27.660
<v Speaker 1>What kind of car do you have?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't bat an eye that.</v>

1795
01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1799
01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Well now Toronto's just gassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alum is a really elite fighter.</v>

1800
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:45.240
<v Speaker 1>He's a very tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough guys.</v>

1801
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kid I think is awesome,</v>

1802
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.650

<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

1803
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a heavyweight.</v>

1804
01:13:50.941 --> 01:13:53.850
<v Speaker 1>You're not Cain Velasquez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't walk around with that much body</v>

1805
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:56.400
<v Speaker 1>when he posts on instagram like a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1806
01:13:56.401 --> 01:13:58.770
<v Speaker 1>two weeks before a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like real Mexican dinner.</v>

1807
01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:00.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like these fucking Burritos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enchiladas stuff,</v>

1808
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:02.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't have that.</v>

1809
01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:04.530
<v Speaker 1>We cannot have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can do that.</v>

1810
01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's an elite professional </v>

1811
01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:11.331
<v Speaker 1>athlete who absolutely could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still to this day when the world title </v>

<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

1816
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:26.400
<v Speaker 4>That was a decision where he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking make weight and Woodley being a </v>

1817
01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.820
<v Speaker 4>great guy that he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't take the percentage.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Thirty percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think it is.</v>

1820
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:31.080
<v Speaker 4>When your opponent doesn't make her </v>
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>

<v Speaker 4>30.</v>

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:34.320
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1823
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Woodley being a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has said I don't want that money.</v>

1824
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.940
<v Speaker 4>And he beat him by decision because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So will he got the win bonus too?</v>

1825
01:14:39.941 --> 01:14:44.941
<v Speaker 4>But Calvin,</v>

1826
01:14:44.941 --> 01:14:48.630

<v Speaker 4>but he's been forced at one point in </v>

1827
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:51.010
<v Speaker 4>time to go up to 85.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She needs to fucking lose body fat.</v>

1830
01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Mike Dolce jumps out like Chris Hanson </v>
<v Speaker 4>from to catch a predator.</v>

1831

<v Speaker 4>Ah Man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1837
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.760
<v Speaker 4>Will don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a whole staff.</v>

1838
01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.780
<v Speaker 4>He's got a staff of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's expensive but yeah,</v>

1839
01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:20.860
<v Speaker 4>he's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it is expensive for a reason.</v>

1840
01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:22.570
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got an office building.</v>

1841
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:29.530
<v Speaker 4>Well he's an employee of the UFC too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think he has like nine employees </v>

1842
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:30.520
<v Speaker 4>or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just looking up.</v>

1843
01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Shoot to fucking lose weight and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1844
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:38.310
<v Speaker 4>but it comes out of the curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of sway disagree with him </v>

1845
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:41.581
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people disagree with some of </v>

1846
01:15:41.581 --> 01:15:41.581
<v Speaker 4>his methods and lock arms.</v>

1847
01:15:41.581 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 4>Bj Penn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Well he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just upset that.</v>

1849
01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.280
<v Speaker 4>Well he was upset for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

1850
01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:47.440
<v Speaker 4>You need to wait though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was upset.</v>

1851
01:15:47.441 --> 01:15:50.980
<v Speaker 4>They don't charge them so much and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>knoW that he really didn't do much.</v>

1852
01:15:50.981 --> 01:15:53.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the whole story either.</v>

1853
01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm not taking sides there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I will tell you this.</v>

1854
01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Bj penn's tHat got damn legend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm siding with him usually he's from</v>

1855
01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:00.940
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1856
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

1857
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:07.500
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point is like if you have </v>

1858
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.970
<v Speaker 4>someone who is monitoring every aspect </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your weight,</v>

1859
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:12.600
<v Speaker 4>cut like your hydration levels with </v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1860
01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:17.660
<v Speaker 4>what kind of fluid you're drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of foods you're eating and it </v>

1861
01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.371
<v Speaker 4>doesn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you did what that guy said and the </v>

1862
01:16:20.371 --> 01:16:21.520
<v Speaker 4>weight didn't come off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody fucked up who fucked up.</v>

1863
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be the case,</v>

1864
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:23.980
<v Speaker 4>but let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>

1865
01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:25.480
<v Speaker 4>if some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1866
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:29.830
<v Speaker 4>if let's say it's not ufc 205 this week </v>
<v Speaker 4>by 10 pounds though,</v>

1867
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.780
<v Speaker 4>which is ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's say it's not use to.</v>

1868
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:35.290
<v Speaker 4>If I were to card not a stack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say it's a main event in toronto,</v>

1869
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with dc and a grumble,</v>

1870
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:41.590
<v Speaker 4>which before that card was pure shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Besides that fight now to amazing card,</v>

1871
01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:42.880
<v Speaker 4>yet metallica,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anthony pettis,</v>

1872
01:16:42.881 --> 01:16:43.120
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1873
01:16:43.121 --> 01:16:48.121
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would it be crazy for the new ufc suits </v>

1874
01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:52.720
<v Speaker 4>to hire nutritionist and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for those maybe just the main card,</v>

1875
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:56.710
<v Speaker 4>they designate you a guide to help you </v>
<v Speaker 4>lose weight because it's your product.</v>

1876
01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.690
<v Speaker 4>It's not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

1877
01:16:58.691 --> 01:17:03.691
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe michael j.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works with everyone and he has a </v>

1878
01:17:03.691 --> 01:17:04.020
<v Speaker 4>team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's not my dolce,</v>

1879
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:09.030
<v Speaker 4>but he's writing the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This your diet and this person is </v>

1880
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:11.581
<v Speaker 4>assigned to you and they're following up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with you because who it hurt when they </v>

1881
01:17:11.581 --> 01:17:14.801
<v Speaker 4>don't make weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hurts the fighter and then it hurts </v>

1882
01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:14.801
<v Speaker 4>the ufc to sign cards.</v>

1883
01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:18.860
<v Speaker 4>I think an even better strategy is seek </v>
<v Speaker 4>to eliminate weight cuts.</v>

1884
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Seek to cut it out of sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's unnecessary.</v>

1885
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:26.530
<v Speaker 4>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It puts guys at risk health wise when </v>

1886
01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:26.960
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to be at risk health </v>
<v Speaker 4>wise.</v>

1887
01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.480
<v Speaker 4>If I think the only thing that's holding</v>
<v Speaker 4>it back,</v>

1888
01:17:29.481 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 4>our championship belts and more options </v>
<v Speaker 4>await classes.</v>

1889
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:38.110
<v Speaker 4>I think if they could figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 4>wait guys are where they compete at </v>

1890
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:41.500
<v Speaker 4>optimally and then the same way you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>us a da or usada testing.</v>

1891
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:44.720
<v Speaker 4>You do hydration testing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how.</v>

1892
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:47.930
<v Speaker 4>But how many weight class you'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>give these guys killing weight class?</v>

1893
01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1894
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:53.860
<v Speaker 4>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have more weight class with any of </v>

1895
01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:53.860
<v Speaker 4>boxing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1896
01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:53.860
<v Speaker 4>that's what's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a problem with boxing.</v>

1897
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.420
<v Speaker 4>They'll look and they're going to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1898
01:17:56.450 --> 01:18:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Will you have less organizations?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you have five different </v>

1899
01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:02.390
<v Speaker 4>world title organizations and plus </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight classes.</v>

1900
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:06.150
<v Speaker 4>You would just have plus weight classes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you would have more champions.</v>

1901
01:18:06.151 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 4>You'd have more opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 4>championship titles.</v>

1902
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.230
<v Speaker 4>I liked that because was stars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You also have more opportunity for,</v>

1903
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:17.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>title bouts between guys where the one </v>

1904
01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:17.290
<v Speaker 4>guy decides to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One guy said to go down,</v>

1905
01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:20.540
<v Speaker 4>but instead of them doing it by </v>
<v Speaker 4>dehydrating themselves,</v>

1906
01:18:20.541 --> 01:18:25.541
<v Speaker 4>24 hours out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you make a contract to fight at a </v>

1907
01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:27.140
<v Speaker 4>certain weight because that's what way </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are in a healthy way,</v>

1908
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.200
<v Speaker 4>which is which maximizes their skills </v>
<v Speaker 4>and performance and it doesn't put them </v>

1909
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.030
<v Speaker 4>into the dangers that you have from </v>
<v Speaker 4>being dehydrated 24 hours out.</v>

1910
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:39.380
<v Speaker 4>I Think if just the ufe will look like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many weight classes do you have?</v>

1911
01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Where a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1912
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:45.790
<v Speaker 4>that's one belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think boxing has many and it's a real </v>

1913
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:47.130
<v Speaker 4>problem name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

1914
01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:52.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and former champions easily.</v>

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.760
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dude's crazy.</v>

1944
01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Characters like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

1945
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked idea of job,</v>

1946
01:20:07.651 --> 01:20:12.651
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is it's stuff enough for</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are trying to keep up now with the </v>

1947
01:20:12.651 --> 01:20:16.131
<v Speaker 4>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the least of our </v>

1948
01:20:16.131 --> 01:20:16.131
<v Speaker 4>concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most important things to put on.</v>

1949
01:20:16.131 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Great fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So higher kids.</v>

1950
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.200
<v Speaker 4>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much dehydration?</v>

1951
01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:24.600
<v Speaker 4>dehydration is dangerous and unnecessary</v>
<v Speaker 4>ones died that they have in Brazil.</v>

1952
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:28.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it can come close to the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it hasn't even been done.</v>

1953
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to dos anjos passed out for </v>
<v Speaker 4>three fucking minutes before his fight </v>

1954
01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 4>with eddie alvarez where it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious and unresponsive,</v>

1955
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:36.930
<v Speaker 4>but did you die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was on the doorbell,</v>

1956
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.170
<v Speaker 4>but did you die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's died,</v>

1957
01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:45.530
<v Speaker 4>but people have been diminished </v>
<v Speaker 4>considerably and I think they're know </v>

1958
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:47.460
<v Speaker 4>for their performance suffers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it makes it makes a shittier product.</v>

1959
01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:49.950
<v Speaker 4>I think if you want to look at it from a</v>
<v Speaker 4>business plus,</v>

1960
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:51.930
<v Speaker 4>if the ufc has got look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could say,</v>

1961
01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:53.550
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>steroids are part of the game.</v>

1962
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1963
01:20:55.051 --> 01:21:00.051
<v Speaker 4>not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they're fucking knocking on your </v>

1964
01:21:00.051 --> 01:21:00.051
<v Speaker 4>door at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning and making peanut cup.</v>

1965
01:21:00.051 --> 01:21:01.530
<v Speaker 4>If they decided to do that at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning,</v>

1966
01:21:01.531 --> 01:21:04.530
<v Speaker 4>they'd try to test people's hydration </v>
<v Speaker 4>levels at 6:00</v>

1967
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.140
<v Speaker 4>in the morning every day and when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would find out what your weight is,</v>

1968
01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:08.790
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what your body fat is,</v>

1969
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:10.830
<v Speaker 4>this is what your weight is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the lowest you can get.</v>

1970
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:11.760
<v Speaker 4>You can get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1971
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:14.340
<v Speaker 4>they'll test you out when you're fully </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydrated and when your,</v>

1972
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:15.810
<v Speaker 4>your body fat is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1973
01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:17.220
<v Speaker 4>wherever the fuck you are right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll say,</v>

1974
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:17.850
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1975
01:21:17.851 --> 01:21:22.851
<v Speaker 4>right now you're 178 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>LIsten to lowest you can fight is one </v>

1976
01:21:22.851 --> 01:21:22.851
<v Speaker 4>72.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1977
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:25.440
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have 1000 weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>classes.</v>

1978
01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.630
<v Speaker 4>Guys won't fight each.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>

1979
01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:30.330
<v Speaker 4>I think guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guys could gain a little weight.</v>

1980
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:31.640
<v Speaker 4>That's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So guys,</v>

1981
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

1982
01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get great performances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way better performances.</v>

1983
01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:38.790
<v Speaker 4>I think the weight class thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>your thing to do is.</v>

1984
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:43.850
<v Speaker 4>I agree they often need to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think right now the easiest thing </v>

1985
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:47.400
<v Speaker 4>to do for them is to use whoever they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want doesn't have to be like dolce.</v>

1986
01:21:47.401 --> 01:21:52.401
<v Speaker 4>Put a number of them and assIgn those to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the main card guys to make sure they're </v>

1987
01:21:52.401 --> 01:21:52.950
<v Speaker 4>coming on weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1988
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:55.170
<v Speaker 4>But what about the guys on the undercard</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck them.</v>

1989
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:58.500
<v Speaker 4>That sounds crazy to me because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they did with reebok.</v>

1990
01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.210
<v Speaker 4>Does it sound like crazy to say fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>

1991
01:22:00.211 --> 01:22:03.270
<v Speaker 4>Yes it does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the nature of the beast,</v>

1992
01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.630
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too crazy.</v>

1993
01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:08.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm just following the orders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that,</v>

1994
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:11.790
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying if.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I had the master key,</v>

1995
01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:17.210
<v Speaker 4>the first thing I would do is say come </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with a strategy to stop weight </v>

1996
01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:17.210
<v Speaker 4>cutting.</v>

1997
01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:22.040
<v Speaker 4>We're going to come up with a new plan </v>
<v Speaker 4>and whether that new plan means </v>

1998
01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.640
<v Speaker 4>abandoning world titles and making care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1999
01:22:23.641 --> 01:22:28.641
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you introduce someone as a world </v>

2000
01:22:28.641 --> 01:22:28.641
<v Speaker 4>champIon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know whoever the fuck they are,</v>

2001
01:22:28.641 --> 01:22:30.570
<v Speaker 4>they get to bring their world title to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fight,</v>

2002
01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.380
<v Speaker 4>but whenever their next title defenses </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2003
01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.080
<v Speaker 4>all this name stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>welter,</v>

2004
01:22:37.081 --> 01:22:38.580
<v Speaker 4>light feather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2005
01:22:38.581 --> 01:22:40.170
<v Speaker 4>it's goofy because it's not the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight.</v>

2006
01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Welterweight is not one 70.</v>

2007
01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:45.840
<v Speaker 4>It's 1:47.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what sugar ray leonard and thomas</v>

2008
01:22:45.841 --> 01:22:50.841
<v Speaker 4>hearns fatah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They called it fucking welterweight to </v>

2009
01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:50.841
<v Speaker 4>start the ufc and just to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2010
01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:54.660
<v Speaker 4>it's welterweight and then pride fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>it up even more because they had it.</v>

2011
01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:56.700
<v Speaker 4>It was different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like their middle weight was two.</v>

2012
01:22:56.701 --> 01:22:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>

2013
01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.720
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when the light heavyweight two.</v>

2014
01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:00.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>

2018
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:08.020
<v Speaker 1>and then the weight classes were clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined.</v>

2019
01:23:08.021 --> 01:23:13.021
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck does ufc have a 265 pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight limit to why you making brock </v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2114
01:27:00.531 --> 01:27:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Japan was a huge culture for mma at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>point in time.</v>

2115
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:08.980
<v Speaker 4>Like at one point in time the ufc was </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant over there and then it faded and </v>

2116
01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:13.031
<v Speaker 4>dropped off bat or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pride was giant and then it faded and </v>

2117
01:27:13.031 --> 01:27:17.111
<v Speaker 4>dropped off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad and dream was kind of like the end </v>

2118
01:27:17.111 --> 01:27:20.201
<v Speaker 4>of it and then how there's not really a </v>
<v Speaker 4>presence there anymore until rising </v>

2119
01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:24.230
<v Speaker 4>comes along so verizon can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to bring back the same sort of </v>

2120
01:27:24.230 --> 01:27:28.391
<v Speaker 4>excitement in the japanese culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The japanese people that they had when </v>

2121
01:27:28.391 --> 01:27:30.860
<v Speaker 4>they had the pride days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the glory days of selling outside thomas</v>

2122
01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:34.150
<v Speaker 4>super arena and those gigantic places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it gives it.</v>

2123
01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:36.830
<v Speaker 4>It'd be good business for them because </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they just come in the back door and</v>

2124
01:27:36.831 --> 01:27:37.030
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:21.710
<v Speaker 4>She plucking nodded this girl up and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it was a gogo plot and then she </v>

2171
01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:27.321
<v Speaker 4>got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She started a gogo plata and then got </v>

2172
01:29:27.321 --> 01:29:27.450
<v Speaker 4>her neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her grappling,</v>

2173
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:30.600
<v Speaker 4>I think she could come into the ufc </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now it's straw weight and just top</v>

2174
01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:33.080
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was saying her jujitsu's insane.</v>

2175
01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 4>It's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hurt her striking super amateur.</v>

2176
01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:40.461
<v Speaker 4>But the straw weight divisions at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>point where I think she could still do </v>

2177
01:29:40.461 --> 01:29:43.080
<v Speaker 4>work right now and she's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is a smoke shop.</v>

2178
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:46.950
<v Speaker 4>She's a smoke show and she speaks </v>
<v Speaker 4>english and portuguese fluently.</v>

2179
01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:51.720
<v Speaker 4>Dime pc and nasty on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nasty when st.</v>

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.450
<v Speaker 4>She writes that her water bottle just </v>
<v Speaker 4>straight,</v>

2201
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.110
<v Speaker 4>cold blooded killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love her.</v>

2202
01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:54.111
<v Speaker 4>But how much that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was surprised the first time we've </v>

2203
01:30:54.111 --> 01:30:54.111
<v Speaker 4>really seen her in a lot of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that.</v>

2204
01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.800
<v Speaker 4>She got crack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thing was a punch.</v>

2205
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:58.300
<v Speaker 4>It was a straight punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got hit by that punch.</v>

2206
01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.320
<v Speaker 4>The elbow like she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she punched and came through with that </v>

2207
01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:03.320
<v Speaker 4>right elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she was wobbly.</v>

2208
01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:07.761
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you've never really seen her in </v>

2209
01:31:07.761 --> 01:31:07.761
<v Speaker 4>that much danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You well.</v>

2210
01:31:07.761 --> 01:31:11.210
<v Speaker 4>And the thing was a shift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chanko was getting lit up for most of </v>

2211
01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:12.480
<v Speaker 4>the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's super tough.</v>

2212
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Those polish move tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And after the fight look great.</v>

2213
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:18.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean she had a lot of punches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a lot of kicks.</v>

2214
01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ilana looked worse as far as face had </v>

2215
01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:26.200
<v Speaker 4>that big mouth on her upper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either she got cracked with.</v>

2216
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I think there was a couple of hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>elbows in the clench too.</v>

2217
01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:32.690
<v Speaker 4>It was a great fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't a great fight for awhile.</v>

2218
01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.030
<v Speaker 4>For awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like it looked like valentino was</v>

2219
01:31:36.031 --> 01:31:39.560
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She just wasn't as fluid or effective.</v>

2220
01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was just hanging in there.</v>

2221
01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.440
<v Speaker 4>She never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She never stopped coming forward.</v>

2222
01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.340
<v Speaker 4>She never stopped coming forward and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>was never discouraged.</v>

2223
01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean she had some moments where she </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't solve the puzzle and you want.</v>

2224
01:31:51.451 --> 01:31:56.451
<v Speaker 4>It was doing a really good job of ending</v>
<v Speaker 4>the combinations with leg kicks inside </v>

2225
01:31:56.451 --> 01:31:57.730
<v Speaker 4>and outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inside announcing stop.</v>

2226
01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.510
<v Speaker 4>And all those leg kicks were there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was.</v>

2228
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 4>There was really making a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

2229
01:32:03.570 --> 01:32:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you follow you on it though,</v>

2230
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:06.250
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was a,</v>

2231
01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:11.340
<v Speaker 4>it was a tough fight beyond definitely </v>
<v Speaker 4>one that she said like her first fight </v>

2232
01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:13.900
<v Speaker 4>with claudia kadesia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how's the tougher fight for her.</v>

2233
01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:15.560
<v Speaker 4>She had a tough fight in the last one </v>
<v Speaker 4>with claudia.</v>

2234
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:17.950
<v Speaker 4>Dahlia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one really short one,</v>

2235
01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:19.700
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's been to some wars.</v>

2236
01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Valerie letourneau.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She fought that fight.</v>

2237
01:32:22.571 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 4>She had a broken hand somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2238
01:32:24.341 --> 01:32:26.260
<v Speaker 4>She kept punching with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's just a murder,</v>

2239
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:27.760
<v Speaker 4>a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a bad ass woman.</v>

2240
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.130
<v Speaker 4>It's as bad as tony hinchcliffe still </v>
<v Speaker 4>obsessed with her.</v>

2241
01:32:30.131 --> 01:32:32.500
<v Speaker 4>Loves her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like brother and sister though,</v>

2242

2244
01:32:37.290 --> 01:32:40.420
<v Speaker 4>She might not weigh him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough one.</v>

2245
01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:42.280
<v Speaker 4>She's not cutting weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough one,</v>

2246
01:32:42.281 --> 01:32:42.930
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He admitted that he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>She's a killer.</v>

2251
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a long ass card though.</v>

<v Speaker 4>katz's deli is 24 slash seven.</v>

2260
01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.180
<v Speaker 4>We.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was hard to find food.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Did you know that Florida was crap?</v>

2265

<v Speaker 4>Florida was popping like everything was </v>
<v Speaker 4>great and I was exhausted going man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was exhausted.</v>

2267
01:33:36.241 --> 01:33:41.241
<v Speaker 4>And then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're in southern </v>

2268
01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:42.721
<v Speaker 4>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Southern Florida is ridiculous where </v>

2269
01:33:42.721 --> 01:33:44.470
<v Speaker 4>we're at and then it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then with the time change in la,</v>

2270
01:33:44.471 --> 01:33:45.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just all messed up.</v>

2271
01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:50.730
<v Speaker 4>But that's why sports like in football,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like the heisman voting and stuff </v>

2272
01:33:50.951 --> 01:33:54.400
<v Speaker 4>like that on these coasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so late you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>night football or college games because </v>

2275
01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 4>it's just so damn late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feel lIke there's a better route to go.</v>

2276
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:03.400
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>

2278
01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:10.740

<v Speaker 4>Though the east coast doesn't mind </v>

2279
01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:10.740
<v Speaker 4>staying up late and the west coast </v>
<v Speaker 4>demands at beyond their schedule.</v>

2280
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:15.870
<v Speaker 4>So it winds up starting at seven and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more people that's filmed things out </v>

<v Speaker 4>schedule,</v>

2284
01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.450
<v Speaker 4>it happened too early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would lose money.</v>

2285
01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had a show at five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are not done working,</v>

2286
01:34:25.511 --> 01:34:28.120
<v Speaker 4>like people have to work on saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're still at work.</v>

2287
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:30.130
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it can't be at four,</v>

2288
01:34:30.190 --> 01:34:32.170
<v Speaker 4>which would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was their time,</v>

2289
01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:34.030
<v Speaker 4>our time was 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM.</v>

2290
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.150
<v Speaker 4>And then also you also have to think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the undercard.</v>

2291
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:39.700
<v Speaker 4>What if somebody wants to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 4>undercard on fs?</v>

2292
01:34:39.701 --> 01:34:44.701
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to pay for the </v>

2293
01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:44.701
<v Speaker 4>undercard fs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is going to be,</v>

2294
01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:47.341
<v Speaker 4>hey listen bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't put the undercard on a 10 in </v>

2295
01:34:47.341 --> 01:34:47.341
<v Speaker 4>the morning.</v>

2296
01:34:47.341 --> 01:34:47.341
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to watch that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Done it.</v>

2297
01:34:47.341 --> 01:34:48.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when they're in Brazil,</v>

2298
01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.960
<v Speaker 4>it's actually like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'll get mad.</v>

2299
01:34:49.961 --> 01:34:50.950
<v Speaker 4>People get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

2300
01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.990
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get the mass audience is</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously working.</v>

2301
01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these coasts stays up.</v>

2302
01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.690

<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2303
01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:58.520
<v Speaker 4>How crazy that matt square garden and </v>
<v Speaker 4>after the fight,</v>

2304
01:34:58.970 --> 01:35:01.700
<v Speaker 4>the lights on the state in which they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>never done before in the arena,</v>

2305
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.540
<v Speaker 4>we're irish colors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty intense.</v>

2306
01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:08.870
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and brian and I were arguing this,</v>

2307
01:35:08.871 --> 01:35:12.680
<v Speaker 4>do you think conor mcgregor is more well</v>
<v Speaker 4>known than floyd mayweather?</v>

2308
01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 4>Currently?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2309
01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>boston's a bigger sport.</v>

2310
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:20.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you look at,</v>

2311
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 4>you look at floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Manny,</v>

2312
01:35:21.741 --> 01:35:25.460
<v Speaker 4>like the patriot numbers destroys </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything cottage or been close to.</v>

2313
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not.</v>

2314
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2315
01:35:28.650 --> 01:35:30.230
<v Speaker 4>I was arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Connor is bigger.</v>

2316
01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.030
<v Speaker 4>He can social media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>

2317
01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.210
<v Speaker 4>But floyd has more followers and and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram,</v>

2318
01:35:35.211 --> 01:35:35.430
<v Speaker 4>twitter.</v>

2319
01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 4>You can't judge it off that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing,</v>

2320
01:35:37.011 --> 01:35:42.011
<v Speaker 4>the amount of excitement that floyd </v>
<v Speaker 4>generates does not even fucking compare </v>

2321
01:35:42.011 --> 01:35:42.940
<v Speaker 4>to the amount of excitement that connor </v>
<v Speaker 4>generates.</v>

2322
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:44.600
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean he's more popular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Understand,</v>

2323
01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:47.360
<v Speaker 4>but it does kinda because the intensity </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the popularity.</v>

2324
01:35:47.361 --> 01:35:52.361
<v Speaker 4>The law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People might know who floyd made with </v>

2325
01:35:52.361 --> 01:35:54.531
<v Speaker 4>her as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it comes to how many people </v>

2326
01:35:54.531 --> 01:35:54.531
<v Speaker 4>love floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even close.</v>

2327
01:35:54.531 --> 01:35:59.170
<v Speaker 4>He might be like some ridiculous tend to</v>
<v Speaker 4>one or 20 to one because when connor </v>

2328
01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.220
<v Speaker 4>gets out there they go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

2329
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:03.560
<v Speaker 4>How many people were there to see floyd </v>
<v Speaker 4>mayweather lose?</v>

2330
01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:08.740
<v Speaker 4>How many people were bored after floyd </v>
<v Speaker 4>mayweather fights like ford mayor with </v>

2331
01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:12.301
<v Speaker 4>their fights so skillfully and </v>
<v Speaker 4>surgically that and doesn't take any </v>

2332
01:36:12.301 --> 01:36:12.301
<v Speaker 4>chances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so hardly ever gets hit.</v>

2333
01:36:12.301 --> 01:36:16.810
<v Speaker 4>It's not connor merck's motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wins the world title in the fastest </v>

2334
01:36:16.810 --> 01:36:17.510
<v Speaker 4>ever title,</v>
<v Speaker 4>winning knockout ever.</v>

2335
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:22.660
<v Speaker 4>What did you do after that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He comes back and makes eddie alvarez </v>

2336
01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:22.660
<v Speaker 4>looked like eddie alvarez world </v>
<v Speaker 4>champion.</v>

2337
01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:27.460
<v Speaker 4>The guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's defending delmar hall of famer and </v>

2338
01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.430
<v Speaker 4>connor makes him look like he has no </v>
<v Speaker 4>business in there with them.</v>

2339
01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.520
<v Speaker 4>No business has zero success at all </v>
<v Speaker 4>except for a couple of body shots.</v>

2340
01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:36.580
<v Speaker 4>This is why I think connor's bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more trend descent because he just </v>

2341
01:36:36.831 --> 01:36:37.880
<v Speaker 4>bailed on that word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

2342
01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:38.850
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendent,</v>

2343
01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:41.270
<v Speaker 4>transcendent be because I just bailed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2344
01:36:41.271 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like.</v>

2345
01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:50.330
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm using it wrong and go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>operation he jacked,</v>

2346
01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:57.340
<v Speaker 4>but how many successful black athletes </v>
<v Speaker 4>do we know of?</v>

2347
01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Joe galen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many white irish superstars do we </v>

2348
01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:02.440
<v Speaker 4>know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One?</v>

2349
01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One.</v>

2350
01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:07.430
<v Speaker 4>One weekend was a big star before he </v>
<v Speaker 4>came to the United States and he came to</v>

2351
01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:09.820
<v Speaker 4>the United States and eventually lost </v>
<v Speaker 4>his belt,</v>

2352
01:37:09.821 --> 01:37:13.100
<v Speaker 4>but barry mcguigan at one point in time </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a huge star,</v>

2353
01:37:13.130 --> 01:37:17.090
<v Speaker 4>but nowhere near to door that comes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2354
01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:17.550
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

2355
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 4>This goes for all athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conners the green elephant in the room.</v>

2356
01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.140
<v Speaker 4>everyone else we've seen before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every once we,</v>

2357
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:28.330
<v Speaker 4>we know what they can kind of do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>connors this green elephant amongst all </v>

2358
01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:29.150
<v Speaker 4>these gray elephants and there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>like him.</v>

2359
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:30.920
<v Speaker 4>Totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally different animal.</v>

2360
01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:33.620
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's elephant with two fucking trunks to</v>

2361
01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 4>15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick's gold with a leprechaun outfit.</v>

2362
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:43.060
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now he has a little son on the way </v>

2363
01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:43.340
<v Speaker 4>and they gave him a fucking rolls royce </v>
<v Speaker 4>with his face on it.</v>

2364
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:48.490
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting is how well he </v>

2365
01:37:48.490 --> 01:37:48.710
<v Speaker 4>manages at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>

2366
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:51.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the pressure in particular,</v>

2367
01:37:51.051 --> 01:37:52.430
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't seem to have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it at all.</v>

2368
01:37:52.431 --> 01:37:55.560
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what makes him so special because</v>

2369
01:37:55.620 --> 01:38:00.620
<v Speaker 4>that magnitude and the pressure and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to deliver and he has to do those </v>

2370
01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 4>antics and then back it up.</v>

2371
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:03.610
<v Speaker 4>But he keeps pulling it off like you at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the breast.</v>

2372
01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2373
01:38:04.201 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 4>this is stupid and this getting old to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2374
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 4>But then when he pulls off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2375
01:38:07.771 --> 01:38:09.580
<v Speaker 4>that was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2376
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:11.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean the guy steps in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loses the ds,</v>

2377
01:38:11.821 --> 01:38:13.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes the diaz fight on short notice.</v>

2378
01:38:13.630 --> 01:38:15.420
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after a staph infection,</v>

2379
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.070
<v Speaker 4>here's something that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even know.</v>

2380
01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:22.300
<v Speaker 4>He had a pretty significant staph </v>
<v Speaker 4>infection was on antibiotics until like </v>

2381
01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:25.700
<v Speaker 4>two weeks before the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't think that drains your gas </v>

2382
01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:28.311
<v Speaker 4>tank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he never had a staph infection and you </v>

2383
01:38:28.311 --> 01:38:28.311
<v Speaker 4>never had to take antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Antibiotics are brutal on your,</v>

2384
01:38:28.311 --> 01:38:31.110
<v Speaker 4>on your respiratory system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're brutal on your whole body.</v>

2385
01:38:31.111 --> 01:38:36.111
<v Speaker 4>It's Just your body up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body's made up of all this shit </v>

2386
01:38:36.111 --> 01:38:37.740
<v Speaker 4>that you don't consider to be you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is you.</v>

2387
01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.880
<v Speaker 4>Stomach flora is a real part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know your body is essentially like </v>

2388
01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.610
<v Speaker 4>an ecosystem and when you have a staph </v>
<v Speaker 4>infection,</v>

2389
01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:47.940
<v Speaker 4>staph infections are dangerous as fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people die from them.</v>

2390
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:50.910
<v Speaker 4>You're so they hit you with some heavy </v>
<v Speaker 4>duty antibiotics.</v>

2391
01:38:50.911 --> 01:38:55.911
<v Speaker 4>I've had staff twice and it's not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the first time I had it and I took </v>

2392
01:38:55.911 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 4>the medication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe how I felt so weird.</v>

2393
01:38:59.491 --> 01:39:01.650
<v Speaker 4>I felt light headed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt weak.</v>

2394
01:39:01.651 --> 01:39:02.400
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

2395
01:39:02.401 --> 01:39:03.480
<v Speaker 4>I can drain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2396
01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:06.300
<v Speaker 4>You have no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super strong stuff too.</v>

2397
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:07.170
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2398
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:09.830
<v Speaker 4>imagine this guy fighting two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 4>after that saying,</v>

2399
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.340
<v Speaker 4>because there's no way you pete </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctly.</v>

2400
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.770
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he comes from that and then he fights</v>

2401
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:16.530
<v Speaker 4>nate again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2402
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.560
<v Speaker 4>few months later in a fucking crazy five</v>
<v Speaker 4>round war and beat them by the narrowest</v>

2403
01:39:21.691 --> 01:39:22.590
<v Speaker 4>of margins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2404
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:23.340
<v Speaker 4>Don't you agree?</v>

2405
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was very,</v>

2406
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:27.900
<v Speaker 4>very close fight where some people </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought that nate one,</v>

2407
01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:32.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I thoUght the decision was correct,</v>

2408
01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:33.570
<v Speaker 4>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2409
01:39:33.571 --> 01:39:36.390
<v Speaker 4>that's close Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So takes that fuCking crazy chance.</v>

2410
01:39:36.391 --> 01:39:37.650
<v Speaker 4>Comes back at fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>

2411
01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:42.800
<v Speaker 4>he kinda weighed one 69.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he weighed when he weighed </v>

2412
01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:42.800
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he weighed during the fight.</v>

2413
01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:43.620
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want them to fight at 55.</v>

2414
01:39:43.621 --> 01:39:43.990
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2415
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2416
01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:45.660
<v Speaker 4>I can be with seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me do 70.</v>

2417
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:48.510
<v Speaker 4>Nate wade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably around one 90 something.</v>

2418
01:39:48.511 --> 01:39:49.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean did,</v>

2419
01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:51.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody says that nate is a 155</v>
<v Speaker 4>pounder.</v>

2420
01:39:51.901 --> 01:39:56.901
<v Speaker 4>He is 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's away bigger man and been then </v>

2421
01:39:56.901 --> 01:39:58.080
<v Speaker 4>connor is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just is,</v>

2422
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:03.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like who's going to way more </v>

2423
01:40:03.170 --> 01:40:05.541
<v Speaker 4>when they actually get in there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nate's gonna weigh more so he does that </v>

2424
01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:08.070
<v Speaker 4>and then goes from there and just say </v>
<v Speaker 4>starches.</v>

2425
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Eddie alvarez like a world beater and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just so relaxed and loose in there.</v>

2426
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 4>So amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking madonna was at the show.</v>

2427
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.100
<v Speaker 4>Madonna was done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show mcdonald's at the fights.</v>

2428
01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.800
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mcdonald's instagramming mama.</v>

2429
01:40:22.801 --> 01:40:26.130
<v Speaker 4>We made it mama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We made it red penny night.</v>

2430
01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:29.970
<v Speaker 4>It's red penny and I and madonna europe </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks she's single.</v>

2431
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:34.880
<v Speaker 4>Where the fuck is my second belt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I envisioned this with a focus me nuts,</v>

2432
01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.960
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking character,</v>

2433
01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:38.340
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's such a character.</v>

2434
01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:40.200
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2435
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 4>I thought he was gonna make a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>announcement.</v>

2436
01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:43.710
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was announcement was he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to retire,</v>

2437
01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:47.040
<v Speaker 4>but his nephew was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to continue doing this,</v>

2438
01:40:47.041 --> 01:40:49.380
<v Speaker 4>you guys need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need a share of the company.</v>

2439
01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:54.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably what the announcement </v>

2440
01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.240
<v Speaker 4>was going to be all along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that he wants a piece of the </v>

2441
01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:56.240
<v Speaker 4>pie.</v>

2442
01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's got an argument that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably should get a percentage of the </v>

2443
01:40:59.130 --> 01:41:03.721
<v Speaker 4>promotion because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're selling is conor mcgregor </v>

2444
01:41:03.721 --> 01:41:04.180
<v Speaker 4>or selling the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus conor mcgregor.</v>

2445
01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.850
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of that card,</v>

2446
01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.030
<v Speaker 4>what would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would the paper.</v>

2447
01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:14.130
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what the numbers are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's pretend the number is 2 </v>

2448
01:41:14.130 --> 01:41:17.550
<v Speaker 4>million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would be like the greatest of all </v>

2449
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:17.550
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2450
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:17.550
<v Speaker 4>It probably wouldn't hit that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2451
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:21.590
<v Speaker 4>I bet it's thrown on one seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just say 2 million because it's </v>

2452
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:23.470
<v Speaker 4>easy to correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say that what percentage bought</v>

2453
01:41:23.471 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 4>It because of connor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be a million 1 million plus for</v>

2454
01:41:26.051 --> 01:41:27.350
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be 1 million,</v>

2455
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:33.510
<v Speaker 4>1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1 million people might have bought the </v>

2456
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.970
<v Speaker 4>paper view specifically because of one </v>
<v Speaker 4>human being.</v>

2457
01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.240
<v Speaker 4>That is not outrageous to say and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is the other thing in connor's </v>

2458
01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.020
<v Speaker 4>favorite name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another star who can do that?</v>

2459
01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda can't quite do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>she can't quite do it.</v>

2460
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:47.140
<v Speaker 4>She and she's talking about this might </v>
<v Speaker 4>be my last fight,</v>

2461
01:41:47.141 --> 01:41:49.390
<v Speaker 4>blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think she said that.</v>

2462
01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:53.050
<v Speaker 4>I think she said she's close to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which when you hear that.</v>

2463
01:41:53.190 --> 01:41:54.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>

2464
01:41:54.031 --> 01:41:57.490
<v Speaker 4>It's talking about having one foot out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say she has two fights left,</v>

2465
01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.380
<v Speaker 4>maybe three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>

2466
01:41:59.381 --> 01:42:01.300
<v Speaker 4>but she's not the same draw as connor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not.</v>

2467
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:03.710
<v Speaker 4>It's just you look at the number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not the same job,</v>

2468
01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:07.900
<v Speaker 4>but if she comes back beats and Amanda </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nunez,</v>

2469
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:10.090
<v Speaker 4>armbars and then fights board and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>

2470
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:14.110
<v Speaker 4>Holly beats beats holly gets a rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arm barcelona's biggest counter.</v>

2471
01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:18.480
<v Speaker 4>You don't know that because as that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to mr joe rody.</v>

2472
01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.380
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as these people,</v>

2473
01:42:20.381 --> 01:42:24.040
<v Speaker 4>when they're star gets more and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant as rhonda,</v>

2474
01:42:24.090 --> 01:42:25.930
<v Speaker 4>if rhonda came back and started winning </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2475
01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.090
<v Speaker 4>her star would get more and more giant.</v>

2476
01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:31.540
<v Speaker 4>It would get bigger with fuel more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The more bodies she claims,</v>

2477
01:42:31.541 --> 01:42:34.840
<v Speaker 4>the more fuel for her fire will have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is what happens all the time.</v>

2478
01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:40.020
<v Speaker 4>It means pure speculaTion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when the way connor has been </v>

2479
01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:43.441
<v Speaker 4>winning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she can win in spectacular fashion or </v>

2480
01:42:43.441 --> 01:42:43.900
<v Speaker 4>the way she was winning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When she fucked up Alexis Davis and sara</v>

2481
01:42:43.901 --> 01:42:45.490
<v Speaker 4>mcmann,</v>
<v Speaker 4>merck and girls merck,</v>

2482
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:49.300
<v Speaker 4>and then she custom 1:15</v>
<v Speaker 4>she couldn't ever make,</v>

2483
01:42:49.301 --> 01:42:52.030
<v Speaker 4>but you know saying fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

2484
01:42:52.530 --> 01:42:53.830
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's way too big,</v>

2485
01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:55.810
<v Speaker 4>but is she okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'D be,</v>

2486
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2487
01:42:56.701 --> 01:43:01.701
<v Speaker 4>beCause she lives really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really rushed away and sometimes people </v>

2488
01:43:01.701 --> 01:43:01.701
<v Speaker 4>that ain't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

2489
01:43:01.701 --> 01:43:03.080
<v Speaker 4>This is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2490
01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.170
<v Speaker 4>if for concert and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again I'm not rooting for favorites,</v>

2491
01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying from business standpoint</v>
<v Speaker 4>for connor,</v>

2492
01:43:09.311 --> 01:43:10.650
<v Speaker 4>he's such a big draw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2493
01:43:11.050 --> 01:43:12.940
<v Speaker 4>What's going to help him in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>negotiating power?</v>

2494
01:43:12.941 --> 01:43:15.430
<v Speaker 4>If rhonda worked her lose this next </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight because then he's like,</v>

2495
01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm the only motherfucker in town.</v>

2496
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.360
<v Speaker 4>You guys were claiming me and rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

2497
01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:21.460
<v Speaker 4>She just lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need my fucking money.</v>

2498
01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:22.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

2499
01:43:22.391 --> 01:43:24.580
<v Speaker 4>rhonda has a tough fight in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

2500
01:43:24.581 --> 01:43:27.850
<v Speaker 4>Amanda nunez is god damn scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's scary girl.</v>

2501
01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:30.970
<v Speaker 4>As I was saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ronda lost a holly.</v>

2502
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:33.190
<v Speaker 4>I was saying she should have got the </v>
<v Speaker 4>title fight and I said,</v>

2503
01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:35.030
<v Speaker 4>I said that I think she's the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous one.</v>

2504
01:43:35.031 --> 01:43:37.630
<v Speaker 4>And I was talking shit to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way she stopped sara mcmann,</v>

2505
01:43:37.631 --> 01:43:40.630
<v Speaker 4>she cracks with that right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She hits like a truck.</v>

2506
01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.640
<v Speaker 4>He hits like a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she.</v>

2507
01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:44.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cyborg hits like a dude.</v>

2508
01:43:44.291 --> 01:43:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Amanda hits like a strong girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big difference.</v>

2509
01:43:47.290 --> 01:43:52.290
<v Speaker 4>A board like tyrone woodley with let's </v>
<v Speaker 4>be real.</v>

2510
01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:58.901
<v Speaker 4>She hits so hard and gets no love </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she's so god damn scary and </v>

2511
01:43:58.901 --> 01:44:02.711
<v Speaker 4>can't make the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She also has a a better arsenal like </v>

2512
01:44:02.711 --> 01:44:03.860
<v Speaker 4>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks and knees on the ground.</v>

2513
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:05.870
<v Speaker 4>I think amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amanda,</v>

2514
01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:10.960
<v Speaker 4>but amanda has lost on the ground before</v>
<v Speaker 4>she got beat up by cats and gone on the </v>

2515
01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:11.630
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct cyber.</v>

2516
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:16.930
<v Speaker 4>Grip your limbs off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's getting no love but she's too </v>

2517
01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:16.930
<v Speaker 4>big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2518
01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:21.710
<v Speaker 4>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were well and again if they did </v>

2519
01:44:22.251 --> 01:44:24.590
<v Speaker 4>that whole thing where I'm talking aBout</v>
<v Speaker 4>they eliminated weight cuts,</v>

2520
01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:26.360
<v Speaker 4>so it'd be two girls cyborg with </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter,</v>

2521
01:44:26.361 --> 01:44:28.820
<v Speaker 4>like one 80,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one 80.</v>

2522
01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.160
<v Speaker 4>It'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be her and that big ass girl.</v>

2523
01:44:31.190 --> 01:44:34.780
<v Speaker 4>Gabby gets to 80,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's all we got for.</v>

2524
01:44:34.781 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 4>You would have to cut weight to me when </v>
<v Speaker 4>we fight every other weekend,</v>

2525
01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:43.110
<v Speaker 4>like tim silvia and andre arlovski.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's do that every other weekend or a </v>

2526
01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:47.960
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let them fight like every other weekend </v>

2527
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 4>because all we had in the old days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2528
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:50.600
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for rhonda,</v>

2529
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:52.730
<v Speaker 4>Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight stylists getting can.</v>

2530
01:44:52.731 --> 01:44:53.260
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

2531
01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.420
<v Speaker 4>We don't know where rhonda is a mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

2532
01:44:56.421 --> 01:45:01.421
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But stylists gates a great matchup for </v>

2533
01:45:01.421 --> 01:45:01.421
<v Speaker 4>rhonda?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>

2534
01:45:01.421 --> 01:45:02.030
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if she comes ready prepared as a</v>

2535
01:45:02.031 --> 01:45:03.050
<v Speaker 4>good camp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she mercer,</v>

2536
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:06.640
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think that you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way she fucked up me should take eagle.</v>

2537
01:45:06.641 --> 01:45:09.260
<v Speaker 4>Like that girl presents a lot of danger </v>
<v Speaker 4>with those punches.</v>

2538
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:11.540
<v Speaker 4>Especially considering what happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>with holly and ronda.</v>

2539
01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:12.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2540
01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I think she presents A lot of danes </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot 100 percent.</v>

2541
01:45:15.471 --> 01:45:16.490
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right in that,</v>

2542
01:45:16.491 --> 01:45:21.491
<v Speaker 4>but I think her marching forward is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect antidote to get marked by rhonda</v>

2543
01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 4>because she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2544
01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:26.180
<v Speaker 4>come get some of this judo armbars if </v>
<v Speaker 4>she marches forward,</v>

2545
01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:29.240
<v Speaker 4>which is really all she knows how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2546
01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:31.730
<v Speaker 4>Could it be interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great fight either way,</v>

2547
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:36.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's also interesting to see what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're rhonda his head is now she's </v>

2548
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.790
<v Speaker 4>coming back to the x factor because if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's wrong,</v>

2549
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:37.830
<v Speaker 4>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she beats her.</v>

2550
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:40.090
<v Speaker 4>I think nine out of 10 times strong </v>
<v Speaker 4>words it.</v>

2551
01:45:40.091 --> 01:45:41.810
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it's rhonda who's kinda,</v>

2552
01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.160
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do movies,</v>

2553
01:45:43.161 --> 01:45:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't for me.</v>

2554
01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.820
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get marked because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl hit so hard.</v>

2555
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:51.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what rhonda has and what you want to </v>

2556
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.910
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2557
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:56.160
<v Speaker 4>and not a whole lot of other women have </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is one thing that they do where </v>

2558
01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.160
<v Speaker 4>they're really fucking good at it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they have all those other stuff.</v>

2559
01:45:58.190 --> 01:46:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like paige vanzant is kind of </v>

2560
01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:03.190
<v Speaker 4>learning the whole sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's learning as she goes,</v>

2561
01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:04.120
<v Speaker 4>saying I should go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she,</v>

2562
01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:09.160
<v Speaker 4>what she does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what paige has is just toughness and </v>

2563
01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:09.160
<v Speaker 4>she's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That nestle,</v>

2564
01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:13.670
<v Speaker 4>that helps definitely helps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's not other girls you know,</v>

2565
01:46:13.671 --> 01:46:16.100
<v Speaker 4>other than valentina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Valentina shift chanko.</v>

2566
01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:20.060
<v Speaker 4>She's another one that's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is another super powerful striker.</v>

2567
01:46:20.130 --> 01:46:20.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2568
01:46:20.511 --> 01:46:22.550
<v Speaker 4>the way she handled holly holm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing up.</v>

2569
01:46:22.551 --> 01:46:23.600
<v Speaker 4>I know man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just countered her.</v>

2571
01:46:25.301 --> 01:46:27.290
<v Speaker 4>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That looping left hook,</v>

2572
01:46:27.291 --> 01:46:29.180
<v Speaker 4>that hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That throws off the right side.</v>

2573
01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's another one,</v>

2574
01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:34.100
<v Speaker 4>but there's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need more of those,</v>

<v Speaker 4>nobody has that sort of personality that</v>

2583
01:46:53.761 --> 01:46:56.670
<v Speaker 4>he has no one ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think even he eclipses ali.</v>

01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.830
<v Speaker 4>I've been clips is all of them.</v>

2585
01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.690
<v Speaker 4>He's bigger than shell sunnen for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As far as like his ability to talk shit.</v>

2586
01:47:03.710 --> 01:47:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Not big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2587
01:47:04.921 --> 01:47:07.950
<v Speaker 4>I think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's better than ali baba.</v>

2588
01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:09.770
<v Speaker 4>Ali stood for different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2589
01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:14.280
<v Speaker 4>His message is more important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fight for equal rights was also fighting</v>

2590
01:47:14.281 --> 01:47:19.281
<v Speaker 4>to stop the Vietnam war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At times he had several things for him </v>

2591
01:47:19.281 --> 01:47:20.010
<v Speaker 4>that were bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

2592
01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:24.780
<v Speaker 4>Is white privilege is nice suits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nice suits.</v>

2593
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:28.050
<v Speaker 4>If government is not trying to send them</v>
<v Speaker 4>over to fight in a war zone,</v>

2594
01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:33.060
<v Speaker 4>even a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not stripping his belt for how </v>

2595
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:33.060
<v Speaker 4>long?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three years.</v>

2596
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 4>Three prime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like basically taking the belt</v>

2597
01:47:34.501 --> 01:47:36.240
<v Speaker 4>from conrad in three years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll see you soon.</v>

2598
01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:38.730
<v Speaker 4>And then it comes back to three years </v>
<v Speaker 4>after not having trained at all.</v>

2599
01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Ali didn't even work out for three years</v>
<v Speaker 4>because when all he wasn't fighting,</v>

2600
01:47:42.301 --> 01:47:43.380
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I work out?</v>

2601
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:44.550
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>

2602
01:47:44.551 --> 01:47:46.170
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was never the same as he.</v>

2603
01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.170
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2604
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.660
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only was he not the same.</v>

2605
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:51.240
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have the footwork anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have the endurance.</v>

2606
01:47:51.241 --> 01:47:56.241
<v Speaker 4>And moi really came back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at his body when he came back </v>

2607
01:47:56.241 --> 01:47:56.241
<v Speaker 4>and fought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fought.</v>

2608
01:47:56.241 --> 01:47:56.720
<v Speaker 4>jerry quarry has come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yes,</v>

2609
01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.100
<v Speaker 4>smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's scary.</v>

2610
01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Not scary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to me it's just to see what happens </v>

2611
01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:04.160
<v Speaker 4>with jon jones because now they </v>
<v Speaker 4>suspended for a year.</v>

2612
01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.451
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's been out even longer and then </v>

2613
01:48:08.451 --> 01:48:08.451
<v Speaker 4>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're stupid as title.</v>

2614
01:48:08.451 --> 01:48:08.870
<v Speaker 4>And then dana obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2615
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.180
<v Speaker 4>he never sticks to what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes he does,</v>

2616
01:48:12.181 --> 01:48:15.210
<v Speaker 4>but he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll never be a main event again.</v>

2617
01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.480
<v Speaker 4>Like we can't book him at the main event</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we can't trust them anymore.</v>

2618
01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2619
01:48:19.681 --> 01:48:20.940
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for john,</v>

2620
01:48:21.090 --> 01:48:26.090
<v Speaker 4>granted he's doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that flow grappling event against the </v>

<v Speaker 4>That flow grappling.</v>

2622
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:28.470
<v Speaker 4>He could have been fighting for the ufc </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight title.</v>

2623
01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying let's see.</v>

2624
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 4>Joint something active.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like at least he's not muhammad ali.</v>

2625
01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:33.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess he's lost millions of dollars,</v>

2626
01:48:33.991 --> 01:48:37.450
<v Speaker 4>but at least he's doing something in </v>
<v Speaker 4>combat sports.</v>

2627
01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.810
<v Speaker 4>Well he's only suspended for a year </v>
<v Speaker 4>retroactively.</v>

2628
01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:40.710
<v Speaker 4>July.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Second.</v>

2629
01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.730
<v Speaker 4>July.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2630
01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:46.360
<v Speaker 4>So he has to get a while before that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did that huge laugh for you.</v>

2631
01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.440
<v Speaker 4>$200.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when he comes back it's one inch to </v>

2632
01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:51.440
<v Speaker 4>see what we get out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2633
01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.820
<v Speaker 4>And then he came back and he fought over</v>
<v Speaker 4>in st prue and you know,</v>

2634
01:48:53.821 --> 01:48:54.660
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of tentative.</v>

2635
01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:58.350
<v Speaker 4>And then you saw jimmy madame while run </v>
<v Speaker 4>through over in st prue.</v>

2636
01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.690
<v Speaker 4>All these guys are getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're getting better.</v>

2637
01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:03.360
<v Speaker 4>They're rising up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rumble rumbles,</v>

2638
01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:08.540
<v Speaker 4>fight dc for the title again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's gonna be a real interesting </v>

2639
01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:08.540
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super interesting.</v>

2640
01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:09.890
<v Speaker 4>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rumbled did land that huge.</v>

2641

<v Speaker 4>In this fight.</v>

2643
01:49:13.081 --> 01:49:15.840
<v Speaker 4>He's got neon lance in his corner now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's had them for a few years now.</v>

2644
01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:19.850
<v Speaker 4>He's worked with a lot on his grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he guarantees concentrated a lot more.</v>

2645
01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:24.890
<v Speaker 4>His wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of videos of him running </v>

2646
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:24.890
<v Speaker 4>wrestling drills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling nonstop.</v>

2647
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:28.390
<v Speaker 4>So he's preparing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>preparing to get up is preparing for </v>

2648
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.390
<v Speaker 4>takedown defense fund fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2649
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:29.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a toss up for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A toss up.</v>

2650
01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:34.850
<v Speaker 4>And then jon jones has all this laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comes back and you'd say rumble for a </v>

2651
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.850
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

<v Speaker 4>let's do it.</v>

2654
01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:41.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you think he's going to get a </v>

2655
01:49:41.210 --> 01:49:42.501
<v Speaker 4>straight shot at the title?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if we would get a </v>

2656
01:49:42.501 --> 01:49:42.501
<v Speaker 4>straight shot at the title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And upon coming back,</v>

2657
01:49:42.501 --> 01:49:44.010
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone wants to see in it.</v>

2658
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's why the fans demand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be something going on by by the</v>

2659
01:49:47.471 --> 01:49:50.680
<v Speaker 4>time this time rolls around next year or</v>
<v Speaker 4>july rolls around,</v>

2660
01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:52.840
<v Speaker 4>so he's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's free in july.</v>

2661
01:49:52.841 --> 01:49:53.890
<v Speaker 4>Whether that means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2662
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:58.891
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how suspensions work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I would have been explained to </v>

2663
01:49:58.891 --> 01:50:02.671
<v Speaker 4>me is performance enhancing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suspensions don't even allow you to </v>

2664
01:50:02.671 --> 01:50:03.850
<v Speaker 4>train with other fighters are on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>roster.</v>

2665
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:05.500
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2666
01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:07.900
<v Speaker 4>When your suspension is up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can train with them.</v>

2667
01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you're even supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>sparring with them.</v>

2668
01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 4>once they hand down a suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That regulation do know about.</v>

2669
01:50:14.201 --> 01:50:15.150
<v Speaker 4>That man is done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2670
01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.690
<v Speaker 4>I looked that up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jamie.</v>

2671
01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wrap tHis up soon.</v>

2672
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:19.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's true.</v>

2673
01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.410
<v Speaker 4>I hope it's not because it's crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you could help your teammates.</v>

2674
01:50:23.411 --> 01:50:25.810
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're suspended,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could still train and help your team</v>

2675
01:50:25.811 --> 01:50:27.610
<v Speaker 4>and also sharpen your sword a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

2676
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like telling a guy who was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>accountant.</v>

2677
01:50:29.141 --> 01:50:34.141
<v Speaker 4>You're suspended for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't even touch a calculator when </v>

2678
01:50:34.141 --> 01:50:34.720
<v Speaker 4>he's touching calculators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2679
01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:40.620
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that t three Texas Instruments?</v>

2680
01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:42.500
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2681
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:44.030
<v Speaker 4>They used to make them have them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

2682
01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Remember those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's now your phone's spike in </v>

2683
01:50:49.690 --> 01:50:52.570
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a fucking game boy.</v>

2684
01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the calculator business man.</v>

2685
01:50:54.311 --> 01:50:59.311
<v Speaker 4>They took a hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are no longer around who's buying </v>

2686
01:50:59.311 --> 01:51:00.340
<v Speaker 4>calculus?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like blockbuster.</v>

2687
01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:03.520
<v Speaker 4>There's none of theM left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men's over the same thing.</v>

2688
01:51:03.521 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say anything.</v>

2689
01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:07.540
<v Speaker 4>The first article I clicked on was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>one from last year.</v>

2690
01:51:07.541 --> 01:51:09.640
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the other thing,</v>

2691
01:51:09.641 --> 01:51:11.020
<v Speaker 4>to your point where you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll.</v>

2692
01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.630
<v Speaker 4>Who says they'll get a title shot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lightweight,</v>

2693
01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the light heavyweight division is just </v>

2694
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:21.040
<v Speaker 4>ell dinosaurs besides the top few guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are so old.</v>

2695
01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:24.340
<v Speaker 4>John's lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not fucking fighting shogun again.</v>

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how dare you fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But jimmy man was a very dangerous fight</v>

2697
01:51:28.451 --> 01:51:33.451
<v Speaker 4>for anybody right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a dangerous fight for john to the </v>

2698
01:51:33.451 --> 01:51:36.770
<v Speaker 4>region.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not matter what lit up over in st</v>

2699

<v Speaker 4>prue you see what happened when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>fought gusman he got cracked.</v>

2700
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:45.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you see what happened when you got </v>

2701
01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:45.300
<v Speaker 4>rumble?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got crack.</v>

2702
01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:45.880
<v Speaker 4>He got dealt with upper echelon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He dealt with,</v>

2703
01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:47.650
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the game well over in st.</v>

2704
01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:52.740
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] just went fucking the full </v>
<v Speaker 4>distance with jon jones and a tough </v>

2705
01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:54.250
<v Speaker 4>fight with sleepy John Jones and had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>broken arm.</v>

2706
01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got his arm broken up.</v>

2707
01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:58.120
<v Speaker 4>John broke that arm kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2708
01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my point is he went the distance and</v>

2709
01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:03.210
<v Speaker 4>st louis took them out pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's,</v>

2710
01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:06.850
<v Speaker 4>I think not st prue rather jiMmy man and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we took them out pretty quick.</v>

2711
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:09.580
<v Speaker 4>I think mountain was super dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous,</v>

2712
01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:14.850
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First round for john has come back </v>

2713
01:52:14.850 --> 01:52:17.791
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think taking him down and beating him </v>

2714
01:52:17.791 --> 01:52:20.431
<v Speaker 4>up on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be john's best 100 percent and he's a </v>

2715
01:52:20.431 --> 01:52:22.630
<v Speaker 4>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thrown to the ground and some of </v>

2716
01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:24.011
<v Speaker 4>them also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John's different than anybody else in </v>

2717
01:52:24.011 --> 01:52:24.490
<v Speaker 4>his length and his ability to use it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get hit really.</v>

2718
01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.280
<v Speaker 4>And his wrestling so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2719
01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:31.240
<v Speaker 4>He's just so scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not scared to go to the ground anybody,</v>

2720
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:36.270
<v Speaker 4>but you look at light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The light heavyweight division is </v>

2721
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:39.241
<v Speaker 4>hurting the most out of anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you could go down the roster </v>

2722
01:52:39.241 --> 01:52:39.241
<v Speaker 4>like god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dog,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2724
01:52:40.061 --> 01:52:44.170
<v Speaker 4>you might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the the main event in Brazil is ryan</v>

<v Speaker 1>but if you want to pay me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll still do it.</v>

2730
01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't taken a same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment that his brother has,</v>

2731
01:52:57.621 --> 01:52:59.800

<v Speaker 1>Could you knock them out with a risk?</v>

2734
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:04.540
<v Speaker 1>My god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like clothesline,</v>

2735
01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:09.580

<v Speaker 1>And Then the rumble one was just </v>

2736
01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:11.090
<v Speaker 1>horrendous to suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you I was in the back of the luck</v>

2737
01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:14.510
<v Speaker 1>of a warming up pat cummings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a motherfucker warmed up,</v>

2738
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:17.370
<v Speaker 1>but basically doing like arm stretches </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't hit mitts.</v>

2739
01:53:17.371 --> 01:53:18.740
<v Speaker 1>You so stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2740
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:19.930
<v Speaker 1>who's he fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2741
01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:20.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2742
01:53:21.110 --> 01:53:23.600
<v Speaker 1>he can't go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at his coach.</v>

2743
01:53:23.601 --> 01:53:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2744
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:25.970
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't speak spanish,</v>

2745
01:53:25.971 --> 01:53:28.640
<v Speaker 1>but no bueno or portuguese.</v>

2746
01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2747
01:53:29.091 --> 01:53:29.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2748
01:53:29.410 --> 01:53:30.550
<v Speaker 1>There was no committee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2749
01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:31.460
<v Speaker 1>you can't go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2750
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to grab his leg like a three year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old nutland and walk out of the octagon.</v>

2751
01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I think Brazil is such a huge hotbed for</v>
<v Speaker 1>mma right now.</v>

2752
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:43.670
<v Speaker 1>It's so gigantic that they need </v>
<v Speaker 1>brazilian stars and you know,</v>

2753
01:53:43.671 --> 01:53:45.590
<v Speaker 1>for the main event in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2754
01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:48.230
<v Speaker 1>just don't have a whole lot of options </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the light heavyweight division,</v>

2755
01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:53.260
<v Speaker 1>so someone fucking wake up little nug </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a slumber because he's </v>

2756
01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.950
<v Speaker 1>recuperating little log or big dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>little dog because they're.</v>

2757
01:53:55.951 --> 01:53:58.770
<v Speaker 1>They're waking up as slumber because </v>
<v Speaker 1>little big nugs done right.</v>

2758
01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:00.830
<v Speaker 1>He's a little nod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They woke his ass up and he's like,</v>

2759
01:54:00.831 --> 01:54:01.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fly beta.</v>

2760
01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:05.630
<v Speaker 1>he's probably asking for another fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but outside of him,</v>

2761
01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:10.900
<v Speaker 1>what other good light heavyweights from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil that are in the ufc that you </v>

2762
01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:13.010
<v Speaker 1>could sell them in a vintner gloria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they already fought.</v>

2763
01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But glover just got cracked and he </v>

2764
01:54:18.130 --> 01:54:18.620
<v Speaker 1>should probably take quite awhile off </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that knockout.</v>

2765
01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:21.260
<v Speaker 1>That was a kind of knock out that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to like not do nothing.</v>

2766
01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Lay low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2767
01:54:22.911 --> 01:54:24.260
<v Speaker 1>He got flat lined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2768
01:54:24.261 --> 01:54:26.180
<v Speaker 1>so you got that light habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got shogun,</v>

2769
01:54:26.181 --> 01:54:27.510
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sjogren's.</v>

2770
01:54:27.511 --> 01:54:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Got to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's not done,</v>

2771
01:54:29.121 --> 01:54:30.650
<v Speaker 1>he's probably real close to being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2772
01:54:30.651 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Like at light heavyweight bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go through in Brazil though.</v>

2773
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Even more so like as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>brazilian fighters as far as fame.</v>

2774
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Meticulous machida got suspended and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended for a long fucking time,</v>

2775
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:44.420
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't he have a two year?</v>

2776
01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

2777
01:54:46.371 --> 01:54:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they've decided or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I felt like he got suspended for two</v>

2778
01:54:50.151 --> 01:54:55.151
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just look at the brazilian </v>

2779
01:54:55.151 --> 01:54:55.151
<v Speaker 1>fighters that especially.</v>

2780
01:54:55.151 --> 01:54:57.910
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Light heavyweight machida was going 85 </v>

2781
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.910
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can float between two and five.</v>

2782
01:54:57.910 --> 01:55:01.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking to five guys he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>line up with in Brazil and not a lot.</v>

2783
01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Not a whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean beta already fought liotta you </v>

2784
01:55:07.210 --> 01:55:09.641
<v Speaker 1>could sell that as a rematch because </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the little knocked him out in </v>

2785
01:55:09.641 --> 01:55:09.641
<v Speaker 1>la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pad.</v>

2786
01:55:09.641 --> 01:55:11.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he suspended all the.</v>

2787
01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You're right though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the.</v>

2788
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Especially there's not a lot of new </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood in Brazil.</v>

2789
01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.820
<v Speaker 1>We get josie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get the faces.</v>

2790
01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Anderson silva is like fell off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just lost the business.</v>

2791
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2792
01:55:21.111 --> 01:55:23.280
<v Speaker 1>then he lost a dc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's basically done.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
