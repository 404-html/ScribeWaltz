<v Speaker 2>Twenty minutes.</v>

27

<v Speaker 2>Thirty minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You can kind of get lost in it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it seemed like five.</v>

32
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>It was like I remember the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>part and then all of a sudden it was </v>

33
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

34
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.121
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was some weird dream state </v>

35
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>stuff going on in the middle where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about some things,</v>

36
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking about other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was.</v>

37
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>When I was thinking about shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

38
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:31.401
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a weird state of mind right now </v>

39
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:31.401
<v Speaker 1>while I'm thinking about these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I better get back on track about </v>

<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

42
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it's funny because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done everything that I do with my </v>

43
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.651
<v Speaker 2>clients and you've experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced and he put it right is </v>

44
00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:42.651
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works definitely works well.</v>

46
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>There's different states that the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>operates in.</v>

47
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>We all know that are states when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressed out their states,</v>

48
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:57.771
<v Speaker 1>when you're super happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there states when you're very focused </v>

49
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>the states and you're in danger of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>states and you're in love and we all </v>

50
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>know that these are weird places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain can go to.</v>

51
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Weird frequencies are weird vibrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you would call it,</v>

52
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 1>but to be able to manipulate it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

53
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>to be able to put someone into a state </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that or help them,</v>

54
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>assist them getting into a state like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

55
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unique skill.</v>

56
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

57
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>oh hell hypnosis yourself at Nell's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's anyway,</v>

58
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 2>so you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just guide you into it,</v>

59
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and give you ways of just going into </v>

60
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.480
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis is a natural state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although he said,</v>

61
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 2>we said it was talking earlier like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you're driving and all of a sudden </v>

62
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 2>you end up there and you think shit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get there.</v>

63
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that because I'm rubbish at </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving,</v>

64
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>but you know other things where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

65
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 2>It just seems it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Televisions,</v>

66
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>music set.</v>

67
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:53.451
<v Speaker 2>Notice that all different states and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all in different states all the </v>

68
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:53.451
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

69
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.940
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a movie that just captures you </v>

70
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.940
<v Speaker 1>and you don't even realize you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it.</v>

71
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>You're just totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're</v>

72
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 3>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're completely absorbed in the film.</v>

73
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.360
<v Speaker 3>That's almost like a hypnotic state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely mean clumping for Superman </v>

74
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 3>for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know safe mother's next six exist,</v>

75
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 3>fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to break in one's let's mom,</v>

76
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.160
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a part and parcel of using </v>

77
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 3>your imagination to get you to a place </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you want to change.</v>

78
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.420
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

79
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 3>but that state that you achieve when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

80
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.010
<v Speaker 3>when you hypnotize someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you put someone in this really </v>

81
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.221
<v Speaker 3>relaxed place and you have them focus on</v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific things and you get them to</v>

82
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:41.791
<v Speaker 3>this weird state where your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 3>drifts off into dreamland.</v>

83
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 3>That's very different than a movie are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very different than driving home in your</v>

84
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

85
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:47.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

86
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

87
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>

88
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 3>they're all imaginative processes </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

89
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all my cheeses.</v>

90
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Processes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with hypnosis,</v>

91
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 3>you focusing on a specific properly.</v>

92
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Normally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

93
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.700
<v Speaker 3>you focus on a specific treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So lit is the lead into it.</v>

94
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 3>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what the client is.</v>

95
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't always use hypnosis.</v>

96
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 3>I am a mind coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't class myself as a hypnotist.</v>

97
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Although hypnotherapy is part and parcel</v>
<v Speaker 3>of why date,</v>

98
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 3>I class myself as a mind coach because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's different facets to it.</v>

99
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 3>These different ways of leading people </v>
<v Speaker 3>into fairies things and considerations </v>

100
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.081
<v Speaker 3>about what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially using language when it's out </v>

101
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 3>of sync sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it make sense?</v>

102
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.280
<v Speaker 3>And then you might have to make sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and then unconsciously you </v>

103
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 3>unconscious mind deciphers it and gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>you the best results really.</v>

104
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

105
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:42.441
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating to me because for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>longest time mine coaches were sort of </v>

106
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 3>unheard of in combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was almost like it was a,</v>

107
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:49.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a scarlet letter or a,</v>

108
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mark against you because you were so </v>

109
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.581
<v Speaker 3>weak that you needed someone to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to hypnotize you or how to talk </v>

110
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 3>you into being strong.</v>

111
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 3>You needed a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should just be a fucking man and get</v>

112
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 3>out there and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

113
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Like that was the attitude that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people had.</v>

114
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In England say dealt with a fucking soft</v>

115
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 3>Glendale or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that in America too.</v>

116
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they don't say it with that show to </v>

117
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 3>say with the same company to company </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling them from the north.</v>

118
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 3>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a yeti solid macho,</v>

119
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you know,</v>

120
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 3>get on with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

121
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

122
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I've seen more people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of very,</v>

123
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.730
<v Speaker 3>very skilled get beat by their own self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say not,</v>

124
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 3>you know their own minds and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be very.</v>

125
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 3>It can be very hard for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I was going to bring that</v>

126
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:42.421
<v Speaker 3>up because I think that fighting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular is probably the most </v>

127
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:48.781
<v Speaker 3>difficult of all chosen endeavors </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of being a soldier is the most </v>

128
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:55.231
<v Speaker 3>difficult of all chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chosen endeavors as far as chosen goals </v>

129
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 3>that you're trying to accomplish.</v>

130
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>What you're trying to accomplish is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to use your body,</v>

131
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.850
<v Speaker 1>use your bones and your muscle to defeat</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people who are also using their </v>

132
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>bones and muscle and the techniques are </v>
<v Speaker 1>all readily available.</v>

133
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>There's no secrets anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a few secrets.</v>

134
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>If you have a really good coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get some tips,</v>

135
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>but essentially everybody knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch.</v>

136
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:23.711
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows how to kick and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to figure out how to </v>

137
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.931
<v Speaker 1>maximize your possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize your potential for victory and </v>

138
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:34.601
<v Speaker 1>how to not get in your own way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not how to not trip over your own fears </v>

139
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:38.951
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where this mind coach thing </v>

140
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>comes into play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I think it's applicable</v>

141
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:45.371
<v Speaker 1>not just for fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for just life in general </v>

142
00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>because I think that for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

143
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.050
<v Speaker 1>their success or failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big part of it is predicated on how </v>

144
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:59.861
<v Speaker 1>they view life and how they view </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and how they approach each.</v>

145
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Each thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each obstacle,</v>

146
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.010
<v Speaker 1>each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.080
<v Speaker 1>each goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each endeavor that they,</v>

148
00:07:07.081 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attempting to,</v>

149
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve or to give their own expression</v>

150
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:17.021
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if it works on </v>

151
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll probably work on anything.</v>

152
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.380
<v Speaker 1>And if you can get someone to a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>place mentally where they can become a </v>

153
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 1>more effective fighter and stay out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own way,</v>

154
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>has terms of their anxiety and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>

155
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>like the reality of fighting is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going to get hurt at some point</v>

156
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of what you're doing.</v>

157
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:37.940
<v Speaker 1>You're in the hurt business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the hurt game,</v>

158
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>and somewhere along the line you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get hit and you're,</v>

159
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:47.591
<v Speaker 1>you're hopefully going to hit the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person more than they're going to hit </v>

160
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But bad things happen to great fighters.</v>

161
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>We've all seen it.</v>

162
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

163
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Ace is part and parcel of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

164
00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 2>if I could make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just about fires.</v>

165
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'll do what with fights is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I come from a background.</v>

166
00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been involved in it a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years now.</v>

167
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.270
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

168
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.080
<v Speaker 2>you have to find things out as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

169
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.110
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but finding yourself as well as an </v>

170
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.601
<v Speaker 2>opponent as well as trying to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Econ as well as hearing people scream </v>

171
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:18.160
<v Speaker 2>your name or other people screaming for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them or the person to kick your ass.</v>

172
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

173
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you have to kind of go with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and control everything that you do and </v>

175
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 2>then try and impose what you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do on the other person.</v>

176
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>You had doubts and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're extra weights that you carry </v>

177
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 1>into the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

178
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.100
<v Speaker 1>or into the cage and in life and again </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's analogous to life doubts and fears </v>

179
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.520
<v Speaker 1>on top of the reality of the difficulty </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what are you're trying to do.</v>

180
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those doubts and fears,</v>

181
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a heavy weight vest that </v>

182
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.591
<v Speaker 1>you're carrying on top of the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're trying to accomplish in </v>

183
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:57.880
<v Speaker 1>the first place and for fighters it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be just smothering it,</v>

184
00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.450
<v Speaker 1>getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've.</v>

185
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.480
<v Speaker 1>We've had many instances of guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>backstage that either didn't fight or </v>

186
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>almost didn't fight because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having anxiety attacks because they were</v>

187
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:12.321
<v Speaker 1>freaking out because the moment was </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally there and their mind was just </v>

188
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>running away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just your mom was trying to figure out a</v>

189
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>way out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can figure out a way out of this.</v>

190
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.570
<v Speaker 1>All we have to do is just go crazy here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the doctor will come over and you </v>

191
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.500
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about you have a few heart </v>

192
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:27.500
<v Speaker 1>palpitations and fall down and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe,</v>

193
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:27.500
<v Speaker 1>and then the doctor's going to rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

194
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Fighting to find something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With me,</v>

195
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 2>because a male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's considered though I did the </v>

196
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 2>same thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.741
<v Speaker 2>if he sees something male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male and then you don't have to go in </v>

198
00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:40.300
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

199
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.680
<v Speaker 2>it's about controlling the fight so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't last in the changing rooms </v>

200
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the time,</v>

201
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.690
<v Speaker 1>be the most self confident you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most confident motherfucker on </v>

203
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.160
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're fighting Anderson Silva </v>

204
00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.781
<v Speaker 1>and his prime and you're not that good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably still going to get lit </v>

205
00:09:58.781 --> 00:09:59.900
<v Speaker 1>up and that's a problem.</v>

206
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make yourself look as bad as you</v>

207
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:04.490
<v Speaker 2>could as you would if you didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about,</v>

208
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you know,</v>

209
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:09.560
<v Speaker 2>there's only so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

210
00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:10.400
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

211
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:10.970
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

212
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:13.340
<v Speaker 2>not everyone's going to be a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fact.</v>

213
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.590
<v Speaker 2>That is a finale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.390
<v Speaker 2>but they don't throw these belts around </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

215
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.880
<v Speaker 2>The UFC and the WBC boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't just give you about,</v>

216
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's always.</v>

217
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.460
<v Speaker 2>But from my point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like seeing people conquer,</v>

218
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.240
<v Speaker 2>share that really debilitating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether they win,</v>

219
00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 2>lose or draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's respective.</v>

220
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them saying,</v>

221
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I did lot better than I thought I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>do when you know and and all that sort </v>

222
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:40.500
<v Speaker 2>of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can live with it.</v>

223
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Some people lose and they just never </v>
<v Speaker 2>forget it and it can hold them for real.</v>

224
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.830
<v Speaker 2>That's not real.</v>

225
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They defined themselves.</v>

226
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a real issue with human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They define themselves with their past </v>

227
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.071
<v Speaker 1>failures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they've learned from those </v>

228
00:10:57.071 --> 00:10:57.071
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always look at themselves.</v>

229
00:10:57.071 --> 00:10:57.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

230
00:10:57.321 --> 00:11:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who shit his pants.</v>

231
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who got in that car </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>

232
00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who showed up late and got </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

233
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I got fired from my job and you become </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of a human being who has a </v>

234
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:17.290
<v Speaker 1>lifelong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a giant string of experiences,</v>

235
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them that you've learned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you're better because of </v>

236
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.170
<v Speaker 1>instead you have the sting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the emotional sting of those </v>

237
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.590
<v Speaker 1>failures that just haunt people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very common with people that they</v>

238
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.600
<v Speaker 1>get haunted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why some people are haunted by </v>

239
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:34.600
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

240
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.130
<v Speaker 1>by grammar school and high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullies being bullied,</v>

241
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.430
<v Speaker 1>like define them during their formative </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

242
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I've known a lot of fighters who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've carried chips on their shoulders</v>

244
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.790
<v Speaker 1>deep into their forties from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullied when they were in high school.</v>

245
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Funny Story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

246
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>when I lived in a place in England </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Michael's field and it's on a big</v>

247
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 2>hill where I used to live on a scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who's lived next door to me,</v>

248
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 2>his mom use limits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tells me Easter lived out as well.</v>

249
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:05.041
<v Speaker 2>He was 60 something like that and I seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>him at the top of the road and he was </v>

250
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:08.821
<v Speaker 2>sort of surprised and he was looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>down at the bottom of the road like </v>

251
00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:10.921
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was looking again and he just stood </v>

252
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:10.921
<v Speaker 2>there and I understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

253
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 2>And when these two guys down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to bully me at school and my </v>

254
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.080
<v Speaker 2>firm to go 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 years of age still I'm waiting for </v>

255
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was waiting for them to go.</v>

256
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:25.261
<v Speaker 2>Billy's name is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was just stood there and waited </v>

257
00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:27.031
<v Speaker 2>for them to go that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked to change and I will look to a </v>

258
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.010
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sad.</v>

259
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a long time,</v>

260
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him to,</v>

261
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's so small town Michael's feel </v>

262
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:35.610
<v Speaker 2>worries to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's probably bumped into them.</v>

263
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 2>It's probably avoided them in the store </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shops or whatever for 42,</v>

264
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 2>43 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says maybe,</v>

265
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.800
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more because before then.</v>

266
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 2>And I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

267
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sad,</v>

268
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 2>it's real sad</v>

269
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:53.010
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also seems to be bizarrely and </v>

270
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.891
<v Speaker 1>cruelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of human nature and common part </v>

271
00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 1>of animal nature with the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck with other animals.</v>

272
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:02.070
<v Speaker 1>They try to find the pecking order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it motivates the weak ones to be strong.</v>

273
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 1>It motivates people to stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

274
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the bullying is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible thing.</v>

275
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 1>But bullying is also the reason why a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of great fighters exist.</v>

276
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Guys like George St Pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's pretty open about it.</v>

277
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:19.231
<v Speaker 1>Like the reason why he became a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter because he was tired of people </v>

278
00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:22.560
<v Speaker 1>fucking with him and he might not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever become the guy who he became if it </v>

279
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.511
<v Speaker 1>wasn't for that pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for those obstacles that </v>

280
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:27.700
<v Speaker 1>are thrown in front of his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:30.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

282
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

283
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate that it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But objectively,</v>

284
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>if you step back and look at just life </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

285
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.540
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be an inexorable part of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence on this planet.</v>

286
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a pull and a push and if there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one pushing,</v>

287
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:48.390
<v Speaker 1>there's no Poland and if there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no,</v>

289
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>there's no negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes the positive doesn't reach </v>

290
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>the same heights.</v>

291
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

292
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of cases.</v>

293
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.820
<v Speaker 2>But if he can chip away at it or at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least change some perspective on it for </v>

294
00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:07.770
<v Speaker 2>a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why someone said to me,</v>

295
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:12.771
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly want it to be a mind coach </v>

296
00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:12.930
<v Speaker 2>that I'm only gonna work with athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to,</v>

297
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all therapy cell therapy,</v>

298
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.340
<v Speaker 2>regardless if fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not always about them being noticed</v>

299
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.350
<v Speaker 2>about fight in the finders and scatter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be something to do with the </v>

300
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.350
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a loss of a family member,</v>

301
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.440
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

302
00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:29.490
<v Speaker 2>it goes back way back to solve part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's journeys.</v>

303
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.830
<v Speaker 2>It's all part of people being who they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

304
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Therapy has a negative connotation in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people's minds because they </v>

305
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.390
<v Speaker 1>connected to self indulgence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like go,</v>

306
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go to therapy every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just whine and bitch about your </v>

307
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.400
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

308
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.820
<v Speaker 1>we've all met people that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

309
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all met people that are just </v>

310
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.311
<v Speaker 1>locked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for them it's sort of more about </v>

311
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 1>having opportunity to use someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about themselves.</v>

312
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:59.441
<v Speaker 1>It's an ego trip in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of trying to solve whatever,</v>

313
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever influences that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over them.</v>

314
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Say that again.</v>

315
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:10.930
<v Speaker 2>He gets to know as a mind coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She gets to know who will do carry on </v>

316
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.510
<v Speaker 2>doing that behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that secondary gay.</v>

317
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Some people do their behavior just for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

318
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:15.850
<v Speaker 2>just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.840
<v Speaker 2>get themselves where they want to get is</v>
<v Speaker 2>get really.</v>

320
00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:23.841
<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of decide from that I don't </v>

321
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:24.210
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't play that game.</v>

322
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I just kept them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

323
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.300
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

324
00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:29.880
<v Speaker 2>and it just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can be kind of tough with it,</v>

325
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.800
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want them to change,</v>

326
00:15:31.801 --> 00:15:33.420
<v Speaker 2>if they don't want to change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing you can do,</v>

327
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

328
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't have these dragged out long </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy sessions of and then this and </v>

329
00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:44.880
<v Speaker 2>this and this happened in the up and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>try and get right to it,</v>

330
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.310
<v Speaker 2>right to the right to the core of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

331
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.820
<v Speaker 2>because the way I was trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trained by a guy called Collin Mci</v>

332
00:15:50.821 --> 00:15:54.060
<v Speaker 2>who's absolutely like Yoda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:15:54.061 --> 00:15:57.870
<v Speaker 2>my teacher and I was trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trained that way and they see us.</v>

334
00:15:57.871 --> 00:15:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Good success.</v>

335
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.520
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you get involved with him?</v>

336
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got involved with Colin.</v>

337
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>

338
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I went to a seminar many years ago by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy called Keith Mayer and I was a bad </v>

339
00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 2>time in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been a bit of an idiot in snow,</v>

340
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.430
<v Speaker 2>in dancing powder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

341
00:16:17.431 --> 00:16:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't being the best it could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>under.</v>

342
00:16:19.811 --> 00:16:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I went to a seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keith Mayer loved it,</v>

343
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 2>felt great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know why.</v>

344
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I just really started reading books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

345
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wayne Dyer and all sorts of things like </v>

346
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.020
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

347
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got older,</v>

348
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do a course with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a company and the company was gone,</v>

349
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.970
<v Speaker 2>but I found out about colin and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

350
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Since then he's become a friend and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like east,</v>

351
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.390
<v Speaker 2>just small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super small.</v>

352
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because your main </v>

353
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.030
<v Speaker 1>pursuit with this or your main focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this as fighters,</v>

354
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:58.210
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a very concentrated </v>

355
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.791
<v Speaker 1>version of this kind of problem solving </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that the existence </v>

356
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 1>is so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult.</v>

357
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:08.441
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult emotionally and it's </v>

358
00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Speaker 1>very difficult physically as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many dIscipline.</v>

359
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

360
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.940
<v Speaker 1>there's so many factors involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in being a successful fighter.</v>

361
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 1>And you were involved in probably like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

362
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:24.040
<v Speaker 1>the most concentrated form of dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with anxiety and problem solving and the</v>

363
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 1>ability to see results.</v>

364
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.360
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

365
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 2>To be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of it like that.</v>

366
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't because I've been around it so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

367
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I never really thought of it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just do what I do.</v>

368
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>

369
00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:41.031
<v Speaker 1>like the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if a guy was I'm a banker or an</v>

370
00:17:41.251 --> 00:17:42.840
<v Speaker 1>insurance salesman or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

371
00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:47.841
<v Speaker 1>and they had a bunch of issues that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeping theM back from being successful </v>

372
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:47.910
<v Speaker 1>in their chosen endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

373
00:17:47.911 --> 00:17:48.650
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 1>their failure pro</v>

375
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.080
<v Speaker 3>or con is only financial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

376
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.260
<v Speaker 3>relative to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

377
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 3>It is relative to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The intensity of it.</v>

378
00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the intensity of a guy going into </v>

379
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.341
<v Speaker 3>battle like yourself about to go and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find coughs and reasons why </v>

380
00:18:04.341 --> 00:18:07.941
<v Speaker 3>someone's going to step in and rescue </v>
<v Speaker 3>you from what is ultimately your entire </v>

381
00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:12.351
<v Speaker 3>focus for the last six to eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've been ready for this one moment </v>

382
00:18:12.351 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 3>and the moments here and you're ready to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of there.</v>

383
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing like that in the world </v>

384
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.470
<v Speaker 3>of noodles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bankers suppose is not because I've been</v>

385
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.700
<v Speaker 3>around so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been around it a way.</v>

386
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.840
<v Speaker 3>Tie sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many scenes.</v>

387
00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 3>How many read he could fight isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>

388
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.850
<v Speaker 3>I also think in pot shop clenched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every famous sweet spiring was on point </v>

389
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.960
<v Speaker 3>and then just to see this different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of it like they should.</v>

390
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 3>I really like making a really nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>wedding cake and then when you can show </v>

391
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.670
<v Speaker 3>it to the people are going to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wedding just fucking squash yet.</v>

392
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 3>So I always felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's just like just destroyed our </v>

393
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.061
<v Speaker 3>own creation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the stuff that they've done in the </v>

394
00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:50.061
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a better analogy is you will,</v>

395
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:55.070
<v Speaker 3>you will that wedding cake out and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>melts instantly under the hot lights on </v>

396
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.871
<v Speaker 3>the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really what it is because when </v>

397
00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:01.941
<v Speaker 3>you have it in a regular room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lights aren't that hot and when you </v>

398
00:19:01.941 --> 00:19:01.941
<v Speaker 3>have someone in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

399
00:19:01.941 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of pressure sparring and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gym of course,</v>

400
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of,</v>

401
00:19:05.681 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's great fighters.</v>

402
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.580
<v Speaker 3>You're working out with people who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous.</v>

403
00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:12.060
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of expectatIons and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>

404
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:14.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's nothing compared to an actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight itself.</v>

405
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.100
<v Speaker 3>That's when everything's ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

406
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like you said,</v>

407
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:24.171
<v Speaker 3>there's people that I've been bullied as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well and you have to consider who you </v>

408
00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:27.471
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to consider everything about </v>

409
00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:27.471
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

410
00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:28.140
<v Speaker 3>going on that stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going into that lion's den,</v>

411
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:29.120
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

412
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 3>the gladiatorial sort of archetype of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

413
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.240
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

414
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is techniques at work really,</v>

415
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:42.171
<v Speaker 3>really well maintained techniques that </v>
<v Speaker 3>work really well to get the person out </v>

416
00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:46.641
<v Speaker 3>of these negative states of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these negative patterns to get them to </v>

417
00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:49.941
<v Speaker 3>get them because what can happen as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can go away with a train of thought so </v>

418
00:19:49.941 --> 00:19:53.230
<v Speaker 3>it might be five and goes on and on gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger and bigger and bigger than the </v>

419
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.211
<v Speaker 3>south salt gets really intense so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>trips you up completely and then can </v>

420
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.720
<v Speaker 3>overthrow you to make you a minimum of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you can actually achieve.</v>

421
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've recently started working with</v>

422
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 3>my friend ian mccall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was another great ufc fighter.</v>

423
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.460
<v Speaker 3>He's very excited about the results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very happy about the results.</v>

424
00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:14.940
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

425
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves it.</v>

426
00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:21.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about it and he was </v>

427
00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:21.231
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent sold a real,</v>

428
00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:21.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first try,</v>

429
00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Speaker 3>he said when he first started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

430
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.150
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see.</v>

431
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.780
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 3>once he really experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

433
00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:29.970
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be doing this from now on.</v>

434
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

435
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.000
<v Speaker 3>I really like him because he's a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice guy.</v>

436
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've not done that much.</v>

437
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Rarely did you work with them after his </v>
<v Speaker 3>last fight?</v>

438
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Did you work with them after the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only been,</v>

439
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't know because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

440
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.140
<v Speaker 3>no disrespect to the avid followed us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

441
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll leave now,</v>

442
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.980
<v Speaker 2>but I'm finished my coffee first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

443
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

444
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was after his last loss.</v>

445
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.800
<v Speaker 2>He said he was feeling things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

446
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Was that the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little stocky guide and just winning </v>

447

<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

450
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.380
<v Speaker 2>since working with them it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just about finding out who they </v>

451
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.611
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is different and that's why I </v>

452
00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:14.611
<v Speaker 2>liked to work with people once I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do seminars.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what makes them tick,</v>

455
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 2>to find out what stimulates them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what doesn't,</v>

00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

533
00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:00.170
<v Speaker 2>And then we got on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so smart.</v>

534
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.760
<v Speaker 2>He picks things up so quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so open to stuff.</v>

535
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.340
<v Speaker 2>We've done some really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool stuff that's I can </v>

536
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:09.560
<v Speaker 2>experiment on joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

537
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.000
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

538
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 2>some things I want to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I a dude him and he seems to work really</v>

539
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:17.820
<v Speaker 2>well on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you give us an example?</v>

540
00:24:17.821 --> 00:24:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like things that you want to explain it.</v>

541
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.040
<v Speaker 2>It's really strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

542
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I had to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm,</v>

543
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm english of sir galahad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They night gala hearts,</v>

544
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knights of the round table,</v>

545
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:35.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>king arthur and joel didn't want to get </v>

546
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:35.670
<v Speaker 2>injured because he was gonna fight.</v>

547
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I think you've robert something or </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

548
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Speaker 2>He was fought on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on gloria and then he was going to fight</v>

549
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:43.580
<v Speaker 2>on ballots or against melvin mom have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any anyway to come out unscathed.</v>

550
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.640
<v Speaker 2>So we persuaded his unconscious mind to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have armor likes the gullah heart.</v>

551
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 2>So I talked in hypnosis about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetype of knights,</v>

552
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.220
<v Speaker 2>of the knights of the round table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he will struggle a heart.</v>

553
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Not literally obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

554
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 2>so we had armor so he didn't come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we come out on injured,</v>

555
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.820
<v Speaker 2>you know the words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's going to work for </v>

556
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:09.820
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

557
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:10.460
<v Speaker 2>like I'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it bullets and stuff like that,</v>

558
00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:11.420
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was just,</v>

559
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.580
<v Speaker 2>it was getting his mindset into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into that sort of the way of thinking.</v>

560
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.650
<v Speaker 2>He was so worried about getting injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

561
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.380
<v Speaker 2>is that why it was effective?</v>

562
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Because it mitigated the stress that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about getting injured.</v>

563
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.340
<v Speaker 2>A sideline can fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

564
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't get her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get her to that getting hurt.</v>

565
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 2>He's in the back of your mind replaying </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>

566
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:34.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indeed.</v>

567
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.810
<v Speaker 2>There was one instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liam harrison was fight and it's cycled </v>

568
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.870
<v Speaker 2>cal some that I need for him before and </v>
<v Speaker 2>got stopped in Jamaica and john wayne </v>

569
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:43.970
<v Speaker 2>power for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against ballpark walk out.</v>

570
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Pulper moc and I'm leaving had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped and it was a forefront with low </v>

571
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.351
<v Speaker 2>kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we did a hypnosis to make him called </v>

572
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.450
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis in a triggered was warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

573
00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:59.620
<v Speaker 2>we kept this work because liam's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever seen liam harrison fires,</v>

574
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.630
<v Speaker 2>incredible fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And along with Jordan Watson and andy </v>

575
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.630
<v Speaker 2>house and all them from bud company in </v>
<v Speaker 2>england.</v>

576
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.420
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

577
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.160
<v Speaker 2>what we did was we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said no,</v>

578
00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:12.161
<v Speaker 2>she said when I was coming saying on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show because he was fighting unaware in </v>

579
00:26:12.161 --> 00:26:13.220
<v Speaker 2>round four and it just freaked me out </v>
<v Speaker 2>really to be honest.</v>

580
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.400
<v Speaker 2>He looks at me and he looked me straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eye and he went worrier and then </v>

581
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.180
<v Speaker 2>beat shit out of anyone when I'm points </v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

582
00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:24.160
<v Speaker 2>afterwards I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember saying worry anyway.</v>

583
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't remember it.</v>

584
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.730
<v Speaker 2>So it was that stuCk in his hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was that.</v>

585
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all fairness,</v>

586
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:31.580
<v Speaker 2>he probably got hit in the head a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of charts.</v>

587
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no fucking idea who I am.</v>

588
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times is a fighter won a fight </v>

589
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:44.150
<v Speaker 2>and then asked what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

590
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

591
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 3>does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel that I just state as well as </v>

592
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 3>both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

593
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

594
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.430
<v Speaker 3>We Saw them up a state that had not </v>
<v Speaker 3>extended it.</v>

595
00:26:52.431 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I.</v>

596
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it in the japanese martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you said it's a state.</v>

597
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 3>Did mohammed ali talk about it when </v>
<v Speaker 3>muhammad ali fought cleveland williams,</v>

598
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.170
<v Speaker 3>he was in that side kind of state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's my favorite ali fight?</v>

599
00:27:04.171 --> 00:27:06.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad you brought that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just any breathtaking.</v>

600
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 3>I've played that fight on this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>at least three times in a state.</v>

601
00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:15.561
<v Speaker 3>It was in this flow and that's before he</v>
<v Speaker 3>went away for three years before they </v>

602
00:27:15.561 --> 00:27:18.540
<v Speaker 3>took away his ability to fight cause he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't fight in the Vietnam war.</v>

603
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.910
<v Speaker 3>And then he came back and he was never </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same again.</v>

604
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:25.911
<v Speaker 3>That cleveland williams fight to me is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like quintessential and people should </v>

605
00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:25.911
<v Speaker 3>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just showed his,</v>

606
00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 3>his full potential.</v>

607
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.470
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in that sort of flow state,</v>

608
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.120
<v Speaker 3>but now way to get the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

609
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 3>he's the way he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>

610
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 3>there's one fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>harold brazier,</v>

611
00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.580
<v Speaker 3>he moved up to light welterweight to </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember and he slipped,</v>

612
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.770
<v Speaker 3>slipped out of debit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it by like they slipped,</v>

613
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.080
<v Speaker 3>slipped and they just steps around him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pat him on the ass and I'm like,</v>

614
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 3>come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous skill.</v>

615
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

616
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 3>whittaker is one of those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people kind of forget about,</v>

617
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everyone wants to talk about julio,</v>

618
00:27:52.201 --> 00:27:54.720
<v Speaker 3>cesar chavez and some great fighters </v>
<v Speaker 3>from that era.</v>

619
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.230
<v Speaker 3>You just have as that I think you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

620
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.680
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was one of those guys that for </v>

621
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.080
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have kind of forgotten about him.</v>

622
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:09.081
<v Speaker 3>Meldrick taylor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have forgotten about </v>

623
00:28:09.081 --> 00:28:10.531
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Algebra taylor taylor were meldrick </v>

624
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:10.531
<v Speaker 3>taylor.</v>

625
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When meldrick taylor last to christina </v>

626
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.340
<v Speaker 3>spanner and I think he fought in Ireland</v>
<v Speaker 3>or somewhere.</v>

627
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was on.</v>

628
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 3>They raise the roddick and lennox lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill.</v>

629
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I cried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved meldrick taylor.</v>

630
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.140
<v Speaker 3>He was like my everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

631
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

632
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.580
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

633
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:31.581
<v Speaker 3>But he was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved watching him fight with chavez </v>

634
00:28:31.581 --> 00:28:32.340
<v Speaker 3>was just classic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

635
00:28:32.341 --> 00:28:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Well chavez changed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was never the same after that fight.</v>

636
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after he got stopped in the twelfth with</v>

637
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:43.491
<v Speaker 3>like seconds to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>richard blow to something else and that </v>

638
00:28:43.491 --> 00:28:45.270
<v Speaker 3>he was swallowing his own blood from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth cuts.</v>

639
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:50.990
<v Speaker 3>But it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was heartbreaking because after that </v>

640
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.961
<v Speaker 3>he was just literally never the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember right now race destroy </v>

641
00:28:53.961 --> 00:28:57.900
<v Speaker 3>interiors is bouncing on his feet and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Terry Terry,</v>

642
00:28:57.901 --> 00:28:59.120
<v Speaker 3>now he's fucking out.</v>

643
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.760
<v Speaker 3>They're both fucked it just training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>

644
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.460
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Golovkin isn't who his trainer.</v>

645
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Abel sanchez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's now training them up in big.</v>

646
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>

647
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:16.670
<v Speaker 3>love can explain how he fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always talks about how he feels and </v>

648
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.660
<v Speaker 3>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks about how he feels and </v>

649
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:22.660
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see him,</v>

650
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.610
<v Speaker 3>even when he's in the park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seemed feeling the shot,</v>

651
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he,</v>

652
00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.720
<v Speaker 3>he can see him every single part of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>considering everything that he does.</v>

653
00:29:29.721 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 3>And apparently he's even beats people </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

654
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I think kai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kovalev at last,</v>

655
00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.230
<v Speaker 3>at last have left that gym because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gennady golovkin.</v>

656
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.760
<v Speaker 3>It really drops into the body shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

657
00:29:39.761 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 3>He's a monster Who fights 15 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heavier.</v>

658
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's rumors.</v>

659
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Spread it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spread it.</v>

660
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Even england anymore in liverpool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've moved kovalev and knocking on the </v>

661
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.820
<v Speaker 3>doors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was joe rogan's fault.</v>

662
00:29:56.821 --> 00:29:57.980
<v Speaker 3>He made me say it.</v>

663
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Kovalev was a monster to incredible and </v>
<v Speaker 3>will quite dear to bernard hopkins.</v>

664
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.900
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty shocking to see bernard hopkins </v>

665
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 3>and fully defensive survival mode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially in round 12.</v>

666
00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought,</v>

667
00:30:09.451 --> 00:30:10.160
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked like it.</v>

668
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:15.470
<v Speaker 3>He let him off a bit in rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather thought I thought he was chasing </v>

669
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:17.020
<v Speaker 3>him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know was very.</v>

670
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:22.160
<v Speaker 3>At least it's on my friend's facebook </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it yet I think names,</v>

671
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:23.380
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

672
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.310
<v Speaker 3>was before he was famous and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he seems to like violent stuff,</v>

673
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a scary guy.</v>

674
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.790
<v Speaker 3>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very scary guy.</v>

675
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed the guy in the ring one,</v>

676
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.580
<v Speaker 3>a guy died and one of his fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't seem to affect him at all.</v>

677
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times like with raymond sini </v>

678
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:41.800
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>general mcclellan fund,</v>

686
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:05.150
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to that,</v>

687
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.881
<v Speaker 3>person I'd like to thank paul mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnotizing me and making me believe in </v>

688
00:31:08.881 --> 00:31:12.331
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I met nigel been about two months </v>

689
00:31:12.331 --> 00:31:13.960
<v Speaker 3>ago and I said that after you watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing you said,</v>

690

<v Speaker 3>I'd like to thank paul mckenna for </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnotize me and I can believe him </v>

691
00:31:18.961 --> 00:31:19.360
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they apparently had a separation</v>

692
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.870
<v Speaker 3>of his wife and his girlfriend now fucks</v>
<v Speaker 3>people up,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so there's a,</v>

694
00:31:23.011 --> 00:31:24.510
<v Speaker 3>there's a grief attached to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that,</v>

695
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

696
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nigel and I mentioned that to nigel </v>

697
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:30.840
<v Speaker 3>banks have massive fan and I mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

698
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.800
<v Speaker 3>I said I got into mind coaching because </v>
<v Speaker 3>partly it's because of how,</v>

699
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.800
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me go out the ring.</v>

700
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:38.050
<v Speaker 3>He got knocked out of the ring the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

701
00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:42.310
<v Speaker 3>The mcclellan was just a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now was in his prime and to destroy your</v>

702
00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were,</v>

703
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.840
<v Speaker 3>everyone was talking about mcclellan </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually fighting Roy Jones jr.</v>

704
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.150
<v Speaker 3>It was the big super far that was on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>horizon,</v>

705
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.700
<v Speaker 3>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:55.710
<v Speaker 3>people are anticipating all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>different fights right now for golovkin </v>

707
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.820
<v Speaker 3>anticipating possibly kodo kodo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe one day I'm canelo canelo alvarez.</v>

708
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a possibility and that's how they</v>

709
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:09.361
<v Speaker 3>were looking at him until the nigel band</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and it looked like he was just </v>

710
00:32:09.361 --> 00:32:11.410
<v Speaker 3>going to kill nigel benn just just </v>
<v Speaker 3>beating the fuck out of him,</v>

711
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 3>but two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

712
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.480
<v Speaker 3>the weight cut issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a big issue because a general </v>

713
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.050
<v Speaker 3>mcclellan was huge and he was cutting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of weight to get down that week </v>

714
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 3>class and that was back when you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>people weren't doing it well.</v>

715
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:28.290
<v Speaker 3>They weren't rehydrating with ivs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in boxing that the weight </v>

716
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:33.131
<v Speaker 3>cutting mentality and wrestling is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally different mentality because you </v>

717
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 3>could wrestle dehydrated and although </v>
<v Speaker 3>your performance will probably suffer,</v>

718
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 3>you are not as concerned about head </v>
<v Speaker 3>trauma and the head trauma</v>

719
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 1>that these guys get when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dehydrated is very,</v>

720
00:32:43.011 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous because the bleeding on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain is just way more devastating.</v>

721
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Apparently all the deaths that have ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred or almost all the desks ever,</v>

722
00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:55.010
<v Speaker 1>ever occurred in boxing have occurred </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the heavyweight division.</v>

723
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:59.960
<v Speaker 1>And the reason being that those are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that are cutting the weight and the</v>

724
00:32:59.961 --> 00:33:02.570
<v Speaker 1>heavyweights aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's this one guy that got really</v>

725
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 1>fucked up on hbo like I want to say a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year or two ago.</v>

726
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fought that cuban kid.</v>

727
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it Eric Perez that he fought?</v>

728
00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Is that the guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought.</v>

729
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing a good job of remembering </v>

730
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.701
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a rare instance of a </v>

731
00:33:18.701 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight being like really badly </v>
<v Speaker 1>concussed in a fight and having bleeding</v>

732
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 1>on the brain and having to get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation.</v>

733
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 1>He was a russian guy anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point being,</v>

734
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.020
<v Speaker 1>but it was pretty crazy</v>

735
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.870
<v Speaker 2>when they did the documentary on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>general mcclellan was,</v>

736
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:34.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fun of gentleman.</v>

737
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Cloudinary was knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julian jackson,</v>

738
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.350
<v Speaker 2>not sealing chucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like seven rounds maybe </v>

739
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:46.080
<v Speaker 2>knocked him out in like one or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he sat on the second fight and the </v>

740
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:46.840
<v Speaker 2>interview afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I fall,</v>

741
00:33:46.841 --> 00:33:49.420
<v Speaker 2>either first time I had a headache for </v>
<v Speaker 2>three weeks.</v>

742
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I had a headache for three weeks after </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

743
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a good sign,</v>

744
00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't a good side.</v>

745
00:33:55.601 --> 00:34:00.601
<v Speaker 2>And all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the documentaries of mr out </v>

746
00:34:00.601 --> 00:34:02.410
<v Speaker 2>because I watched it and I thought I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember because I just,</v>

747
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something sticks in your head and his </v>

748
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.470
<v Speaker 2>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not mentioned.</v>

749
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.470
<v Speaker 2>They never mentioned that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently the,</v>

750
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.030
<v Speaker 2>the spot really hard and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boys from crunk.</v>

751
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

752
00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't cry jim.</v>

753
00:34:12.811 --> 00:34:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Not only do they not play these to crank</v>
<v Speaker 1>that temperature up.</v>

754
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was manual steward would crank it up </v>

755
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.470
<v Speaker 1>like 100 degrees in that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a sauna.</v>

756
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:22.300
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't have no rap music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any swearing as well.</v>

757
00:34:22.301 --> 00:34:26.110
<v Speaker 2>And even believed in light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When lennox lewis for oliver mccoll,</v>

758
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:31.530
<v Speaker 2>they made oliver mccoll were white box </v>
<v Speaker 2>in because he thought that it made him </v>

759
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:31.530
<v Speaker 2>move quicker.</v>

760
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strange.</v>

761
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.130
<v Speaker 1>it's strange stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

762
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Emmanuel steward is an interesting guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you so nice.</v>

763
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.770
<v Speaker 1>He's so personable as nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nice to know sadly,</v>

764
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:51.490
<v Speaker 1>but he was such a nice guy and when a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a trainer is such a nice guy like </v>

765
00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:56.291
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes it seems like the fighters </v>

766
00:34:56.291 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 1>want to fight harder for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they want to win more.</v>

767
00:34:56.931 --> 00:35:01.931
<v Speaker 1>Like they have this more of like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing worse than a fighter that has a </v>

768
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 1>contentious relationship with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>trainer.</v>

769
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And then there's like gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of animosity between </v>

770
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.630
<v Speaker 1>the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They leave,</v>

771
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.910
<v Speaker 1>they come back and you see a lot of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really trips a lot of fighters up</v>

772
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.610
<v Speaker 1>that those contentious relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have with their trainers.</v>

773
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.700
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of the times though with </v>

774
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.101
<v Speaker 2>fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it may take the position of a </v>

775
00:35:21.101 --> 00:35:21.101
<v Speaker 2>father figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

776
00:35:21.101 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or an elder brother or you know,</v>

777
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.130
<v Speaker 2>especially a father figure because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like have come from,</v>

778
00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the best start in life.</v>

779
00:35:27.981 --> 00:35:28.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a main site.</v>

780
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:32.730
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them come from a place with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>father in the percentage that date,</v>

781
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

782
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always outlie trainers.</v>

783
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I looked up to them and why it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

784
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:43.260
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's part and parcel of it </v>

785
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.981
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is and I think that's why I got like </v>

786
00:35:45.981 --> 00:35:48.321
<v Speaker 3>emmanuel steward was so successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just because of his deep knowledge </v>

787
00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 3>of boxing and his understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique,</v>

788
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:53.870
<v Speaker 3>which all were certainly there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also just because he was such a </v>

789
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:54.480
<v Speaker 3>great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was one when he fought thomas.</v>

790
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 3>When thomas [inaudible] sugar ray </v>
<v Speaker 3>leonard.</v>

791
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading a manual steward and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tommy hearns lot the cells away for two </v>

792
00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.690
<v Speaker 3>weeks and just cried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

793
00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.020
<v Speaker 3>It's passion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True passion house.</v>

794
00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

795
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
<v Speaker 3>Ring me and ring me and I was only 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were there any back then?</v>

796
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:19.671
<v Speaker 3>Were there any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did anybody use a mental coach back </v>

797
00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.671
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know of anything?</v>

798
00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Is that when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did it start in combat sports?</v>

799
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only one in the world and not </v>

800
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.120
<v Speaker 3>saying no.</v>

801
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just actually,</v>

802
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of anyone that does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know these scenes is seen sports </v>

803
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:38.970
<v Speaker 3>psychologists and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that steve collins,</v>

804
00:36:38.971 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 3>before he fought chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you started going about boxing.</v>

805
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 3>I love boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>KeeP going.</v>

806
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.600
<v Speaker 3>And when steve collins for chris eubank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came in with their phones in and now </v>

807
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:52.641
<v Speaker 3>in the ring and it played with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sad because nigel bennett used to </v>

808
00:36:52.641 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 3>hypnotherapists paul mckenna to go from </v>
<v Speaker 3>old to beat general mcclellan and then </v>

809

00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 3>when he's hurt because we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a state,</v>

813

<v Speaker 3>he won't know when he's beat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

814
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 3>He was worried that was going to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>too much punishment.</v>

815
00:37:11.191 --> 00:37:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or whatever the whatever the game was.</v>

816
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:14.880
<v Speaker 3>But eight worked for collins.</v>

817

<v Speaker 3>We might've beat him anyway.</v>

818
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be a voice shenanigans isn't,</v>

822
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.460

<v Speaker 3>It's like the,</v>

823
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:30.470
<v Speaker 3>the fragile psyche of a person that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>about to go into,</v>

824
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.640
<v Speaker 3>on armed combat like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting because most </v>

825
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.571
<v Speaker 3>people would think of them as fearless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who just the toughest motherfuckers on </v>

826
00:37:38.571 --> 00:37:39.720
<v Speaker 3>the planet about to step in between </v>

827
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.120
<v Speaker 3>duke it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile there's a press,</v>

828
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:44.490
<v Speaker 3>they're bouncing back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

829
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:49.850
<v Speaker 3>there's doubt and fear and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things that are playing on </v>

830
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:50.380
<v Speaker 3>their mind.</v>

<v Speaker 3>doubts until he got into the ring and </v>

836
00:38:06.291 --> 00:38:06.291
<v Speaker 3>then we'd gone into the ring.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

885
00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:26.690
<v Speaker 3>he didn'T train with her and he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have her in his corner and she was </v>

886
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 3>actually still managing them too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It waS just,</v>

887
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:30.760
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing was a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's unfortunate,</v>

888
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:35.761
<v Speaker 3>but you know what canelo might have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to him anyway because it was a </v>

889
00:40:35.761 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker I'm telling he's dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>and is all there is a whole lot,</v>

890
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:39.600
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

891
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.130
<v Speaker 3>think it's prince doesn't even.</v>

892
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.220
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing and it back in his day </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he left blend angle,</v>

893
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.360
<v Speaker 3>they had a really close relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>from seven and you know,</v>

894
00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.930
<v Speaker 3>old irish guy and he has got loads of </v>
<v Speaker 3>still racing,</v>

895
00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphors and blah blah blah.</v>

896
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.500
<v Speaker 3>And when he left wink a bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in sheffield,</v>

897
00:40:55.501 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 3>it's not far from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't the same.</v>

898
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.640
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't saying like tyson and kevin </v>
<v Speaker 3>rooney.</v>

899
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:06.210
<v Speaker 3>It just seems to have a gel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They seemed to know another system that </v>

900
00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:06.210
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look.</v>

901
00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Tyson was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like kevin.</v>

902
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Well kevin rooney was still a part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the custom model legacy.</v>

903
00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

904
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>he had trained under demato as well and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of carried over,</v>

905
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:22.140
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't have the same relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>with kevin rooney that he had with </v>

906
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.350
<v Speaker 3>custom model where it was he wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>custom happiness.</v>

907
00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.960
<v Speaker 3>You want a custom models?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love,</v>

908
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 3>he wanted a custom model to father </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure.</v>

909
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean really literally was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he took him in,</v>

910
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

911
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it comes back to what you do and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your focus is,</v>

912
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:41.981
<v Speaker 1>where it is really about mental states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mental state of wanting to please </v>

913
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Speaker 1>the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to please this mentor wanting to</v>

914
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.330
<v Speaker 1>this person that you love and care so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much about their opinion and their,</v>

915
00:41:50.331 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 1>their idea of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it becomes a significant motivating</v>

916
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 1>factor and that tapping into these </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>

917
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.790
<v Speaker 1>tapping into whatever it is that allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to achieve that amazing state of </v>

918
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:04.220
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

919
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I like to get my clients.</v>

<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

921
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:11.420
<v Speaker 2>in every way because then you get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best from them.</v>

922
00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Then there's a saying that's less than </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so if you're not getting 100 percent </v>

924
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.510
<v Speaker 2>with them and then giving you 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent but never going to get what you </v>

<v Speaker 2>what you can really achieve,</v>

926
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:27.551
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to really get to know them and </v>

927
00:42:27.551 --> 00:42:30.040
<v Speaker 2>understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you to client elo is going to be a </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also develop a project and you </v>

938
00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.340
<v Speaker 1>develop a relationship with this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person becomes a project.</v>

941
00:43:04.301 --> 00:43:07.420
<v Speaker 1>exact quality that you need in order to </v>

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.130

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:19.870
<v Speaker 1>has a real deep investment in the </v>

<v Speaker 2>I just love the way fi is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people achieving.</v>

957
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I like people getting out of darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

959
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.600
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's nothing more of a relief.</v>

960
00:43:54.601 --> 00:43:56.220
<v Speaker 2>The not being a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

961
00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Just put the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See people just glow and they think you </v>

962
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.120
<v Speaker 2>only get that eureka moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the light bulb moment where they've done</v>

963
00:44:03.121 --> 00:44:08.121
<v Speaker 2>something wicked or they've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>something they didn't think they could </v>

964
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:08.121
<v Speaker 2>do that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Priceless.</v>

965
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you get paid for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's a job,</v>

966
00:44:09.361 --> 00:44:11.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's priceless to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Priceless.</v>

967
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably why you're drawn to it.</v>

968
00:44:14.411 --> 00:44:15.880
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you're good at it.</v>

969
00:44:15.881 --> 00:44:18.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kinda have to be that right in order</v>

970
00:44:18.881 --> 00:44:23.881
<v Speaker 1>to be good at that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the worst thing you could ever be </v>

971
00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:26.560
<v Speaker 1>as a mentor is be jealous of the success</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your students.</v>

972
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

973
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Or to hope that your student doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

974
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Speaker 1>but we've all seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all seen that from coaches.</v>

975
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone's seen self sabotage </v>
<v Speaker 1>from coaches.</v>

976
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.590
<v Speaker 1>That's dark shit.</v>

977
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

978
00:44:38.591 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

979
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:44.690
<v Speaker 2>there is an element of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an element of jealousy and the </v>

980
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.490
<v Speaker 2>or whatever in some and sergeant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

981
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of times it's like former </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitors.</v>

982
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

983
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:50.620
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

984
00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you agree with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think when a,</v>

985
00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:57.420
<v Speaker 2>when a coach has been a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a transition from him being </v>

986
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.870
<v Speaker 2>still a fighter to a coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

987
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I've got a friend called frankie elders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a really good jimmy and women's</v>

988
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:04.480
<v Speaker 2>shelter in manchester and I see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him now.</v>

989
00:45:04.481 --> 00:45:05.830
<v Speaker 2>He was a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good one.</v>

990
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 2>And I can see the transition now of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>

991
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I've been a coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like all these kids that look up to</v>

992
00:45:11.231 --> 00:45:13.690
<v Speaker 2>him and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Jordan watson's coach,</v>

993
00:45:13.691 --> 00:45:18.691
<v Speaker 2>Richard Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the same and they got this sort </v>

994
00:45:18.691 --> 00:45:21.421
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the transition because they </v>

995
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:23.110
<v Speaker 2>were fighters and then they'd be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mentors and coaches that I like watching</v>

996
00:45:23.111 --> 00:45:24.070
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

997
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.790
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metamorphosis.</v>

998
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

999
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And it is an important metamorphosis too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you always identify with </v>

1000
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 1>being a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never going to be a great coach.</v>

1001
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to accept this new stage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and embrace it the same way </v>

1002
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:45.441
<v Speaker 1>you embrace being a fighter to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with 100 percent of your ability and </v>

1003
00:45:45.441 --> 00:45:46.660
<v Speaker 1>your focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for some people because at the</v>

1004
00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:51.661
<v Speaker 1>end it becomes not about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes about them helping other </v>

1005
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:53.160
<v Speaker 1>people and some personalities and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really suited for that.</v>

1006
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some well fires are about them.</v>

1007
00:45:55.470 --> 00:46:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's know certain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them but certain amounts of </v>

1008
00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:03.300
<v Speaker 2>it has to be about them because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones are taking the risk.</v>

1009
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.360
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones that to get in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beats aren't me go in the ring and take </v>

1010
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:08.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the shocks and take the,</v>

1011
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 2>take the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1012
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:11.310
<v Speaker 2>the main.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1013
00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.290
<v Speaker 2>it is difficult for a person to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition,</v>

1014
00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:16.860
<v Speaker 2>but that's with the change of values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you get older,</v>

1015
00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:20.280
<v Speaker 2>your values change in you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to shift from volume to value.</v>

1016
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you like it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have longterm goals as far as </v>

1017

00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:37.951
<v Speaker 2>regardless of if it's fighting and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that just want to achieve or at </v>

1040
00:47:37.951 --> 00:47:40.210
<v Speaker 2>least get something better a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>

1041
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:41.830
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really far.</v>

1042
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.360
<v Speaker 2>How many people do you work with it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not?</v>

1043
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Fighters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite a lot.</v>

1044
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot.</v>

1045
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 2>What's a common thing that they come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you with?</v>

1046
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is confidence.</v>

1047
00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 2>90 nine point nine percent of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's confidence and just,</v>

1048
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence and people.</v>

1049
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.850
<v Speaker 2>People come to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always the same thing.</v>

1050
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.240
<v Speaker 2>They come In because I work from home or</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work on scale,</v>

1051
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:07.670
<v Speaker 2>skype or face time and they always talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what they don't want that.</v>

1052
00:48:07.671 --> 00:48:12.671
<v Speaker 2>so first thing out of everyone's mouth </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about what they don't want and </v>

1053
00:48:12.671 --> 00:48:12.671
<v Speaker 2>we asked them what they do want.</v>

1054
00:48:12.671 --> 00:48:13.240
<v Speaker 2>They still talk about what they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

1055
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.150
<v Speaker 2>so you have to change the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thought pattern because they're just</v>

1056
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 2>so focused on sates up rock and roll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rock,</v>

1057
00:48:18.761 --> 00:48:19.390
<v Speaker 2>the rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rock,</v>

1058
00:48:19.391 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 2>and you have to just move them to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to go and then say,</v>

1059
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.040
<v Speaker 2>now what you want instead of focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that now where do you want to go now?</v>

1060
00:48:27.041 --> 00:48:28.610
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you okay,</v>

1061
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 2>and we deal with that and in in various </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

1062
00:48:31.271 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 2>timeline therapy or hypnosis or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1063
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:36.070
<v Speaker 2>and then we move them towards where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go to.</v>

1064
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:41.740
<v Speaker 2>So when you're dealing wiTh someone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their issue is confidence,</v>

1065
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.410
<v Speaker 2>what are the myths?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the factors?</v>

1066
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.920
<v Speaker 2>What are like the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding people back?</v>

1067
00:48:47.921 --> 00:48:52.921
<v Speaker 2>Are there common factors that you find </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again with people that </v>

1068
00:48:52.921 --> 00:48:54.040
<v Speaker 2>keep them from being confident?</v>

1069
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.100
<v Speaker 2>No shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sherlock syndrome,</v>

1070
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I call it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be like sherlock.</v>

1071
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.760
<v Speaker 2>I have to like thinking holmes english </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he has to think about things.</v>

1072
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 2>What really is going on in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that sweet.</v>

1073
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:13.291
<v Speaker 2>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so exciting because </v>

1074
00:49:13.291 --> 00:49:13.291
<v Speaker 2>everyone's different and out there sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1075
00:49:13.291 --> 00:49:17.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thing that keeps them back or </v>

1076
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:17.770
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is strange.</v>

1077
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:21.751
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's whether it'd be a past </v>

1078
00:49:21.751 --> 00:49:21.751
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be a,</v>

1079
00:49:21.751 --> 00:49:22.180
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullying,</v>

1080
00:49:22.181 --> 00:49:24.140
<v Speaker 2>whether it be parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1081
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.740
<v Speaker 2>or a current relationship or a current </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

1082
00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1083
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:32.280
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's toxIc and they shouldn't be in </v>

1084
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.901
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't tell them not to because It as </v>

1085
00:49:33.901 --> 00:49:35.500
<v Speaker 2>ecologically it's not right ecologically</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mulhall psychological,</v>

1086
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:38.350
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not right and good for the environment.</v>

1087
00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1088
00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:44.630
<v Speaker 2>by violent language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming and fighting with the message.</v>

1089
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:45.710
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1090
00:49:45.711 --> 00:49:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I just think that they have to figure it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1091
00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.150
<v Speaker 2>And you kind of know anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1092

<v Speaker 2>shouldn't fucking bananas or bananas or </v>

1093
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was young,</v>

1094
00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I used to try to talk to help those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are just to try it or tell them,</v>

1095
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.790
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be in that relationship.</v>

1096
00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.920
<v Speaker 2>You don't get no facts wIth to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit out for yourself.</v>

1097
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:08.400
<v Speaker 2>You don't get no thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's going to be mad at you.</v>

1098
00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1099
00:50:09.281 --> 00:50:10.690
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1101
00:50:12.381 --> 00:50:17.381
<v Speaker 2>so it's about the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment around them is </v>

1102
00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:19.060
<v Speaker 2>ecological sort of in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:50:19.061 --> 00:50:24.061
<v Speaker 2>And it's also many times whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding them back is also with led them </v>

1104
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:29.221
<v Speaker 2>to be in that relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that toxic relationship in the first </v>

1105
00:50:29.221 --> 00:50:29.221
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1106
00:50:29.221 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>

1107
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:35.651
<v Speaker 3>I've met people that their relationships</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really essentially like a carryover </v>

1109
00:50:35.651 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 3>of their mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's always so odd.</v>

1110
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:42.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like I have friends who can't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything and unless they check in with </v>

1111
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:46.721
<v Speaker 3>their wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to ask their wife for every </v>

1112
00:50:46.721 --> 00:50:46.721
<v Speaker 3>purchase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to ask her why before,</v>

1113
00:50:46.721 --> 00:50:47.960
<v Speaker 3>any decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything they want to do.</v>

1114
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:49.790
<v Speaker 3>They can't say hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1116
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:56.861

<v Speaker 3>You have to go and ask permission and </v>

1117
00:50:56.861 --> 00:50:58.140
<v Speaker 3>see if it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And would it be alright if.</v>

1125
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 3>It can't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had those before.</v>

1126
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 3>They're brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horrible.</v>

1127
00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible on both sides.</v>

1128
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brutal.</v>

1129
00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:28.841
<v Speaker 3>It's brutal for the man's brutal for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman and it's brutal for the woman </v>

1130
00:51:28.841 --> 00:51:29.900
<v Speaker 3>that's asking the man where you going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

1131
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.220
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible mindstate for her to be </v>

1132
00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:35.660
<v Speaker 3>into a smaller about them than it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1133
00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:41.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more about then what that company </v>

1134
00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:41.150
<v Speaker 3>through that insecure is that I've done </v>
<v Speaker 3>that myself.</v>

1135
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.510
<v Speaker 3>I have to not myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We feel that it's,</v>

1136
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.650
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to,</v>

1137
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:50.710
<v Speaker 3>to grow inside of a relationship because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you have to have your own </v>

1138
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:53.420
<v Speaker 3>shit together before you can attract </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone with their shit together.</v>

1139
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:58.750
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't have your shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you usually wound up with wind up with </v>

1140
00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.190
<v Speaker 3>someone who also doesn't have their shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and it's very difficult to,</v>

1141
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:03.590
<v Speaker 3>for the two of you together to work it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1142
00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:04.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like attracts like.</v>

1143
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So oftentimes people like they really do</v>

1144
00:52:07.371 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 3>have to break up in order to get on with</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own life.</v>

1145
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:14.810
<v Speaker 3>The potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was shit that they work.</v>

1146
00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Let's bring it to the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it becomes a cyclic behavior.</v>

1147
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the weirdest one.</v>

1148
00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:24.870
<v Speaker 3>When you get involved with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then somewhere early in the relationship</v>

1149
00:52:24.871 --> 00:52:26.420
<v Speaker 3>with her screaming at you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1150
00:52:26.421 --> 00:52:27.030
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

1151
00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.820
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is going on here?</v>

1152
00:52:28.821 --> 00:52:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this what you do?</v>

1153
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:31.730
<v Speaker 3>Let's boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1154
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 3>If you've not have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the on overstep the boundary </v>

1155
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:39.980
<v Speaker 3>and all this technical further back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you end up not being used.</v>

1156
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:45.220
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also patterns that people fall </v>

1157
00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.701
<v Speaker 3>into because life is very confusing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because life is very stressful and </v>

1158
00:52:48.771 --> 00:52:50.180
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going on.</v>

1159
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So they fall into these patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 3>making the same mistakes over and over </v>

1160
00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:59.381
<v Speaker 3>again from one relationship to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's comfort in those </v>

1161
00:52:59.381 --> 00:53:02.891
<v Speaker 3>patterns and you recognize it early on </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there aren't any real issues </v>

1162
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:05.330
<v Speaker 3>like we've only known each other for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>short amount of time.</v>

1163
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.370
<v Speaker 3>You already fucking screaming at me for </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1164
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Why are you screaming at me screaming at</v>
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>

1165
00:53:09.561 --> 00:53:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Because there's some other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the trapped dealt with it.</v>

1166
00:53:13.881 --> 00:53:18.881
<v Speaker 3>It's an unconscious behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an unconscious reaction to a </v>

1167
00:53:18.881 --> 00:53:20.090
<v Speaker 3>situation that's not been resolved and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they think it's normal.</v>

1168
00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:25.120
<v Speaker 3>It's normal to scream because maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up with people screaming at each </v>

1169
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:25.630
<v Speaker 3>other or hitting each other or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1170
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:27.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1171
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.990
<v Speaker 2>it was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you tolerate it.</v>

1172
00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Then that increasingly it gets worse.</v>

1173
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting how those sort of </v>

1174
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.740
<v Speaker 1>relationships can become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can drown in them.</v>

1175
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1176
00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:42.950
<v Speaker 1>both parties can drown because you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get out of them and you're.</v>

1177
00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:47.980
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly involved in conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the worst is conflict and resolution.</v>

1178
00:53:48.761 --> 00:53:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Conflict and resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conflict and resolution.</v>

1179
00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:55.961
<v Speaker 1>And they get trapped in thIs high of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making up and fighting and then </v>

1180
00:53:56.171 --> 00:53:57.730
<v Speaker 1>making up fighting and making it up.</v>

1181
00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.060
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're life's going.</v>

1182
00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're losing days is time.</v>

1183
00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Time is a time is something you just not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get back at the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they say it's an easy thing.</v>

1194
00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Still fun to do with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't name it that.</v>

1195
00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:32.531
<v Speaker 2>Don't play me some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she said that some of the things in the </v>

1196
00:54:32.531 --> 00:54:33.530
<v Speaker 2>seminar said very relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1197
00:54:33.531 --> 00:54:38.531
<v Speaker 2>she was talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so tell a story about time saying that </v>

1198
00:54:38.531 --> 00:54:38.531
<v Speaker 2>when she was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1199
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:44.230
<v Speaker 2>he lived in jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just south of england and they </v>

1200
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.800
<v Speaker 2>went in 1940 something or other.</v>

1201
00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:47.960
<v Speaker 2>The germans were coming to invade and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she had to evacuate.</v>

1202
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:49.670
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1203
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna,</v>

1204
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna buy anything for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>birthday.</v>

1205
00:54:52.671 --> 00:54:57.671
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna have to use all the money to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be evacuated because it's going to go </v>

1206
00:54:57.671 --> 00:54:57.671
<v Speaker 2>and live in has wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is near me and liverpool.</v>

1207
00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:58.490
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1208
00:54:58.491 --> 00:55:03.491
<v Speaker 2>what I'll do is I'll give you a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bulk with paper and I'll give you a </v>

1209
00:55:03.491 --> 00:55:06.521
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so every time you write a check he </v>

1210
00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:06.521
<v Speaker 2>writes that you want to be with me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

1211
00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:11.061
<v Speaker 2>And he honored that time all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it made me think about how important </v>

1212
00:55:11.061 --> 00:55:11.930
<v Speaker 2>time is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't get a lot of it.</v>

1213
00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 45 now,</v>

1214
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.530
<v Speaker 2>21 yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1215
00:55:15.531 --> 00:55:16.430
<v Speaker 2>in my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1216
00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.520
<v Speaker 2>my mom died in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when was it?</v>

1217
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.830
<v Speaker 2>February now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>august,</v>

1218
00:55:21.831 --> 00:55:23.090
<v Speaker 2>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bomb.</v>

1219
00:55:23.091 --> 00:55:23.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mom's there.</v>

1220
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:28.940
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they smarter in Poland and yet we get </v>

1221
00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:28.940
<v Speaker 2>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1222
00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1223
00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:29.140
<v Speaker 1>it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1224
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:30.430
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's every.</v>

1225
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.440
<v Speaker 1>It's also very difficult to stop and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take account of what's going on in your </v>

1226
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:41.211
<v Speaker 1>life and try to figure out whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not it's serving you to the best of its </v>

1227
00:55:41.211 --> 00:55:42.420
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was as If time is serving,</v>

1228
00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:44.670
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are serving your own life.</v>

1229
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:47.990
<v Speaker 1>If you're your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the your focus and what you're doing,</v>

1230
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.780
<v Speaker 1>your actions are serving your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence to the best of your ability or</v>

1231
00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:56.781
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum because that's often the case </v>

1232
00:55:56.781 --> 00:55:59.910
<v Speaker 1>of people being trapped in momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could rob you of your life and you won't</v>

1233
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:03.510
<v Speaker 1>even realize until it's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't any of that 60 year old guy on the</v>

1234
00:56:03.511 --> 00:56:05.460
<v Speaker 1>hill looking down at the guy's boeing</v>

1235
00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.140
<v Speaker 2>can out the window with the blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I going bust it.</v>

1236
00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Can I go again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1237
00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

1238
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.360
<v Speaker 2>There's no second floor with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>diocese,</v>

1239
00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:12.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1240
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the way it is,</v>

1241
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:20.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's also really hard to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trapped in an environment </v>

1242
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:23.851
<v Speaker 1>where the people around you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured it out and there are stuck in </v>

1243
00:56:23.851 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 1>some patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism</v>

1244
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.220
<v Speaker 3>and cigarettes and all the bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's involved with whatever they've </v>

1245
00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.091
<v Speaker 3>got going on in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crime or drama or whatever the fuck it </v>

1246
00:56:33.091 --> 00:56:33.091
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This environment,</v>

1247
00:56:33.091 --> 00:56:36.230
<v Speaker 3>this environment that you're not sure in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patterns that you develop,</v>

1248
00:56:36.231 --> 00:56:38.470
<v Speaker 3>that's really hard for people to break </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of.</v>

1249
00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:43.110
<v Speaker 3>The patterns that they grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is and it's.</v>

1250
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.120
<v Speaker 3>But it's part and parcel of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say any more part and parcels </v>

1251
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.570

1269
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.520
<v Speaker 3>the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That without a doubt.</v>

1270
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 3>The best that ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was indeed wasn't a.</v>

1271
00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.930
<v Speaker 3>It was the motherfucker right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want me saying?</v>

<v Speaker 3>biggie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggie.</v>

1274
00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Can't you see sometimes hypnotize me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just listened to classical music.</v>

1275
00:58:00.281 --> 00:58:05.281
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't kick in the door waving the full </v>

<v Speaker 3>No hitting.</v>

1277
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:07.950
<v Speaker 3>No more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

1278
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think I should have been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rapper?</v>

1279
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:13.120
<v Speaker 3>I think shield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you were shitty mind coach.</v>

1280
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.320
<v Speaker 3>If you really believe that maybe we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should swap.</v>

1281
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.660
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever told someone that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be doing something different?</v>

1282
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 3>If you ever told someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1283
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:25.330
<v Speaker 3>you need to fucking quit your job and </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a rock and roll star or anything.</v>

1284
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:26.620
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1285
00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:31.650
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've told people they shouldn't fight </v>

1286
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:33.070
<v Speaker 3>really because they're not good at it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they take too much damage.</v>

1287
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1288
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:39.460
<v Speaker 3>We know that you've seen say fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I.</v>

1289
00:58:39.461 --> 00:58:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about only had one fight.</v>

1290
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't fight mba class and b class in </v>
<v Speaker 3>england.</v>

1291
00:58:45.251 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 3>You can meet to the hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1292
00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.970
<v Speaker 3>fun bd class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like not the best idea ever.</v>

1293
00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>say it nicely.</v>

1294
00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:57.720
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you told them they shouldn't fight </v>

1295
00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:57.720
<v Speaker 3>because they're coaches were shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1296
00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.310
<v Speaker 3>not coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1297
00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.690
<v Speaker 3>just so risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an early,</v>

1298
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 3>early risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why would you tell them that instead</v>

1299
00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:08.270
<v Speaker 3>of telling them to get a better coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do invest in it.</v>

1300
00:59:08.271 --> 00:59:13.271
<v Speaker 3>Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just pushed him in the right </v>

1301
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:15.241
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then some people just know some </v>

1302
00:59:15.241 --> 00:59:17.440
<v Speaker 3>people shouldn't fight and never really </v>
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>

1303
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:22.441
<v Speaker 3>Put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you did what I do for the ufc for </v>

1304
00:59:22.441 --> 00:59:22.441
<v Speaker 3>it's showtime for</v>

1305
00:59:22.441 --> 00:59:25.970
<v Speaker 1>many other kickboxing fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>

1306
00:59:25.971 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you do see people that kind of don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a chance.</v>

1307
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

1308
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:34.880
<v Speaker 1>you see a bunch of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know whatever it is.</v>

1309
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.310
<v Speaker 1>They're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so far off.</v>

1310
00:59:37.311 --> 00:59:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Where they need to be like</v>

1311
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:42.130
<v Speaker 2>crushes an must.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tavi sometimes.</v>

1312
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nsa's contrast tv.</v>

1313
00:59:45.131 --> 00:59:48.280
<v Speaker 2>But like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says palm possibly.</v>

1314
00:59:48.281 --> 00:59:49.300
<v Speaker 2>What they did it again,</v>

1315
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:50.630
<v Speaker 1>you parked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did it again.</v>

1316
00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I'm like,</v>

1317
00:59:53.621 --> 00:59:56.320
<v Speaker 1>mismatches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trouble me more than almost anything.</v>

1318
00:59:56.321 --> 01:00:01.321
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that I really </v>

1319
01:00:01.321 --> 01:00:01.321
<v Speaker 1>like about mma as opposed to boxing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

1320
01:00:01.321 --> 01:00:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Guys would get tuned up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights start,</v>

1321
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.610
<v Speaker 1>catch weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>

1322
01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't get the cat's weight thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch weights for mma.</v>

1323
01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's usually because someone got a last </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute fight,</v>

1324
01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:14.620
<v Speaker 1>right and a short notice fight and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to cut all the weight.</v>

1325
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Like say if a guy fights at 1:55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a glace and bow.</v>

1326
01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>He fights at 1:55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he really walks around about 185 and</v>

1327
01:00:21.941 --> 01:00:26.941
<v Speaker 1>he cuts a lot of fucking weight and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a process to cut that weight and </v>

1328
01:00:26.941 --> 01:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>he has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty scientific.</v>

1329
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>They've got to kind of stay with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

1330
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:33.610
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't like benson henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fought brendan fache,</v>

1331
01:00:33.611 --> 01:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>princeton henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former ufc lightweight champion,</v>

1332
01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:38.770
<v Speaker 1>took a fight at one 70 because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short notice fight,</v>

1333
01:00:38.771 --> 01:00:43.771
<v Speaker 1>stepped in and fought at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I fight at one 70 is </v>

1334
01:00:43.771 --> 01:00:47.791
<v Speaker 1>because he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way you wouldn't have to cut the </v>

1335
01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>weight and he really wouldn't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a short notice fight at 1:55.</v>

1336
01:00:48.671 --> 01:00:53.671
<v Speaker 1>It's just too hard to lose the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they have to do it over a long </v>

1337
01:00:53.671 --> 01:00:57.001
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they're significantly </v>

1338
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:57.001
<v Speaker 1>weakened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1339
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>they get down to a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 pounds away and then they dehydrate</v>

1341
01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:01.530
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get why.</v>

1342
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when cattell fought daniel gale weeks </v>

1343
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.970
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they made daniel gale lay lie </v>

1344
01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:10.860
<v Speaker 2>ariette cattails got the middleweight </v>
<v Speaker 2>title of one 60.</v>

1345
01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they agreed to,</v>

1346
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.340
<v Speaker 2>they agreed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was 1:54,</v>

1347
01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

1348
01:01:18.391 --> 01:01:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thought I didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strategy.</v>

1349
01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that strategy.</v>

1350
01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>And stanley said business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when was the days when that's what </v>

1351
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.640
<v Speaker 2>your way he waits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the champion at that would've </v>

1352
01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.040
<v Speaker 2>gillware would see walking around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lighter weight middle bite.</v>

1353
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's a big middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1354
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:39.060
<v Speaker 2>maybe kudos thinking about fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>floyd.</v>

1355
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:43.620
<v Speaker 2>And so he's working on ms dot fay </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting lighter and lighter guys.</v>

1356
01:01:43.621 --> 01:01:48.621
<v Speaker 2>and it's payday right in dates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like one 60</v>

1357
01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>champ at one 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also there's the golovkin fight,</v>

1358
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:56.390
<v Speaker 1>which is one 60 that he might be next in</v>
<v Speaker 1>line for gfi.</v>

1359
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Have they decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it going to be code?</v>

1360
01:01:58.141 --> 01:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a canelo.</v>

1361
01:01:59.381 --> 01:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1362
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I think the big fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big fight because I do think that </v>

1363
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.640
<v Speaker 2>cuts out when mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll sell.</v>

1364
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1365
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.640
<v Speaker 2>but I think canelo and canelo cotto was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big,</v>

1366
01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Converse.</v>

1367
01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:14.850
<v Speaker 2>He's mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's big isn't it?</v>

1368
01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.760
<v Speaker 2>They don't lIke each other for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange reason.</v>

1369
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:18.890
<v Speaker 2>You don't so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be good.</v>

1370
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>So to speak the same language.</v>

1371
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't get an addy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it will all console?</v>

1372
01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1373
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.340
<v Speaker 1>cotto certainly has taken more beatings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1374
01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot more weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1375
01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>we hits a lot harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a scary fuck areas,</v>

1376
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1377
01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:42.880
<v Speaker 1>you know the margarito fight I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>took a lot out of kodo.</v>

1378
01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucked up fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you find out his history of,</v>

1379
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>of loading up as his raps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hot.</v>

1380
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fight wasn't easy.</v>

1381
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a real heartfelt yes,</v>

1382
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:59.750
<v Speaker 1>but the margarito fight was fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you find out that he most likely </v>

1383
01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:02.310
<v Speaker 1>loaded up his gloves with plaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this say?</v>

1384
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Cotto canelo winter to fight glove in </v>
<v Speaker 1>november.</v>

1385
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>RighT now they haven't officially booked</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1386
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see that.</v>

1387
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cotto.</v>

1388
01:03:11.071 --> 01:03:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Canelo will be a great fighter and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great fight.</v>

1389
01:03:13.141 --> 01:03:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Rather in the winter.</v>

1390
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Fighting golovkin would be giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to fight golovkin </v>

1391
01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:19.560
<v Speaker 1>because only boxing fans know who </v>
<v Speaker 1>golovkin is.</v>

1392
01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Every mexican on the planet knows what </v>
<v Speaker 1>canelo is.</v>

1393
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You know a lot of spanish fans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing fans know khan.</v>

1394
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Canelo is not ready to deal with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>left hook.</v>

1395
01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Some motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1396
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1397
01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:32.160
<v Speaker 1>he's a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hits very hard,</v>

1398
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:35.790
<v Speaker 1>but really for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it highlights my appreciation for me.</v>

1399
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:40.791
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe say what you want about him as a </v>

1400
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:40.791
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems to be,</v>

1401
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:42.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a less than favorable human being,</v>

1402
01:03:42.271 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But goddamn as a boxer,</v>

1403
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:45.780
<v Speaker 1>he's magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bull.</v>

1404
01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Admire his talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's magnificent animal.</v>

1405
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>He's a magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1406
01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the best ever in my opinion.</v>

1407
01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's the most exciting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

1408
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's the most fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite,</v>

1409
01:03:56.761 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's the art of hitting and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting hit.</v>

1410
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck is better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1411
01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:02.990
<v Speaker 1>like I had this conversation with max </v>
<v Speaker 1>kellerman about.</v>

1412
01:04:02.991 --> 01:04:04.950
<v Speaker 1>It was like sugar ray robinson is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much better than him.</v>

1413
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar ray robinson lost a jake lamata.</v>

1414
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me that floyd mayweather </v>
<v Speaker 1>would lose to jake lamata I'd tell you,</v>

1415
01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:16.041
<v Speaker 1>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think jake lamata would lay a </v>

1416
01:04:16.041 --> 01:04:18.651
<v Speaker 1>glove on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Florida be all over the fucking </v>

1417
01:04:18.651 --> 01:04:18.651
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be slipped into the lab and slipped</v>

1418
01:04:18.651 --> 01:04:22.380
<v Speaker 1>into the right and popping that jab and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead right hands and tying them up and I</v>

1419
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:27.381
<v Speaker 1>just can't see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always the way that wasn't at </v>

1420
01:04:27.381 --> 01:04:27.381
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hit me,</v>

1421
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

1422
01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 1>They always do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always do that,</v>

1423
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>but I just think sugar ray took a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1424
01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.300
<v Speaker 1>He was an amazing fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a different era,</v>

1425
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>different mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different style of fighting back then,</v>

1426
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:44.870
<v Speaker 1>different knowledge database.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People knew more about the effects of </v>

1427
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it always will and always will.</v>

1428
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1429
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:54.740
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most exciting things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about mma today is that you're seeing </v>

1430
01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:58.071
<v Speaker 1>these guys like these higher rodriguez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's young kids that are coming up 23 </v>

1431
01:04:58.071 --> 01:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>years of age and have so many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools.</v>

1432
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like you compare them to young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people coming up 10,</v>

1433
01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:07.440
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no comparison in mma.</v>

1434
01:05:07.441 --> 01:05:11.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a much larger jump than boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got uninfused your life.</v>

1435
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:16.970
<v Speaker 1>We've got a couple of kids called allied</v>
<v Speaker 1>mohamad your to too.</v>

1436
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Two moroccans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You train moroccans and they can fight </v>

1437

<v Speaker 3>that moroccan magic.</v>

1439
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.211
<v Speaker 3>loads and loads of science or I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>just stay out of jail and stopped </v>

1440
01:05:36.211 --> 01:05:36.460
<v Speaker 3>breaking people's legs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1441
01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:38.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just behaving.</v>

1442
01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Self stop being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why he's so good though is </v>

1443
01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.171
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the reason why he's so </v>

1444
01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:46.171
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's made.</v>

1445
01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna say anything derogatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it because no might find me.</v>

1446
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1447
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:54.420
<v Speaker 3>the derogatory things that I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>are all positive to psycho stuff is the </v>

1448
01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 3>reason why he's so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:05:55.211 --> 01:05:59.250
<v Speaker 3>It's the most exciting kick boxer in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world was so aggressive.</v>

1450
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:03.190

<v Speaker 3>asked belied yet they don't see them.</v>

1451
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.450
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxing is kickboxing at a higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>level now than it was 20 years ago.</v>

1452
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.330
<v Speaker 3>much higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:02.430
<v Speaker 3>It starts with you already have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>

1471
01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.850
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good kids.</v>

1472
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:08.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just so fast and sharp and </v>

1473
01:07:08.851 --> 01:07:11.190
<v Speaker 3>technique and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's one of the things that </v>

1474
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:13.500
<v Speaker 3>perturbs me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mondo that were disturbed me the </v>

1475
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:13.500
<v Speaker 3>most about about glory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I just,</v>

1476
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.890
<v Speaker 3>I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the level,</v>

1477
01:07:14.891 --> 01:07:17.110
<v Speaker 3>like the nikki holt skins and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1478
01:07:17.111 --> 01:07:17.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1479
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:22.510
<v Speaker 3>the high level of fighters got into </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing now I think is he's doing that </v>

1480
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:24.100
<v Speaker 3>every student as well or he's going into</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1481
01:07:24.101 --> 01:07:28.770
<v Speaker 3>But I know he's boxed a few times now so</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might become a boxer in state a.</v>

1482
01:07:28.771 --> 01:07:33.771
<v Speaker 3>And I know he's still in it though and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really common for a dutch </v>

1483
01:07:33.771 --> 01:07:36.460
<v Speaker 3>fighter to go into box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I will think tyrone's dabbling with </v>

1484
01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:36.460
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say so as well.</v>

1485
01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:41.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holland has not really got many boxes.</v>

1486
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:46.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tyron fought his last fight because it </v>

1487
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:46.500
<v Speaker 3>was recovering from his broken leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broken saki.</v>

1488
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which was devastating.</v>

1489
01:07:48.251 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 3>It's really rare to see a high level </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxer break his leg like that.</v>

1490
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.010
<v Speaker 3>That was unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1491
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.100
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1492
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:58.390
<v Speaker 3>I remember him saying to me years ago at</v>
<v Speaker 3>showtime in brussels,</v>

1493
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.630
<v Speaker 3>he said that he wanted to fight david.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey.</v>

1494
01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.400
<v Speaker 3>He said I want to fight david.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1495
01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.900
<v Speaker 3>I want to do boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will fight.</v>

1496
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 3>David haney said that to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David haye seems to me to be a really </v>

1497
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:10.720
<v Speaker 3>good fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a little too small.</v>

1498
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To beat a guy like,</v>

1499
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.660
<v Speaker 3>like vladimir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1500
01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 3>like the klitschkos just fucking these </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant guys.</v>

1501
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:18.830
<v Speaker 3>He can't really reach them now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1502
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 3>now he's in a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His next fight will be against tyron </v>

1503
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:25.040
<v Speaker 3>fiori fiori from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from england.</v>

1504
01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Who's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the funniest guy ever.</v>

1505
01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.600
<v Speaker 3>His tweets are funny and hilarious.</v>

1506
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Makes I have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he has a chance?</v>

1507
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.260
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

1508
01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1509
01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:42.730
<v Speaker 3>What I thought was interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 3>vladimir klitschkos last fight is with </v>

1510
01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:43.610
<v Speaker 3>the referee was admonishing him for </v>
<v Speaker 3>holding and he was taking,</v>

1511
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:48.630
<v Speaker 3>he was saying same was going to take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>point away from him for holding that </v>

1512
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640
<v Speaker 3>fucked this whole game up because whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>game was like,</v>

1513
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:53.650
<v Speaker 3>pop that jab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop that right hand tie you up roughly </v>

1514
01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:53.650
<v Speaker 3>povetkin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1515
01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:57.520
<v Speaker 3>And that was like bop bop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jump and grab and pushes it down and </v>

1516
01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 3>starts this whole game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as that goes away,</v>

1517
01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 3>then he's forced to stand with guys in </v>
<v Speaker 3>trade and exchange.</v>

1518
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been knocked out a few times.</v>

1519
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't really do that against fillery </v>
<v Speaker 3>because fuel is bigger than him is </v>

1520
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.530
<v Speaker 3>actually bigger than I am.</v>

1521
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I hope she stays for the same area as </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1522
01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:15.590
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1523
01:09:15.591 --> 01:09:20.591
<v Speaker 3>But that's just nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take away that objective </v>

1524
01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:21.410
<v Speaker 3>objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think you can beat him?</v>

1525
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not easY.</v>

1526
01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:24.140
<v Speaker 3>So that's a no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say,</v>

1527
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.530
<v Speaker 3>I'll say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he could also flooded basement.</v>

1528
01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the last person.</v>

1529
01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it corey sanders?</v>

1530
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.940
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone knocked him out after corey </v>

1531
01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:36.940
<v Speaker 3>sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1532
01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:36.940
<v Speaker 3>What was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1533
01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.710
<v Speaker 3>I remember at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning for no reason.</v>

1534
01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Like a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American.</v>

1535
01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Embrace.</v>

1536
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knocked him out after corey,</v>

1537
01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:48.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.750
<v Speaker 3>It seems like to knockout losses in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>row,</v>

1539
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:53.850
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he just on that.</v>

1540
01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Just consummate professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1541
01:09:55.731 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 3>that's another manual stewart success </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1542
01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Emanuel steward figured out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>him to box.</v>

1543
01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1544
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 3>probably engineered that whole style </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's developed to this.</v>

1545
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:07.550
<v Speaker 3>Just pop and grab style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1546
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:09.090
<v Speaker 3>none of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of manuals.</v>

1547
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Students with the left hook as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Haley.</v>

1548
01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.710
<v Speaker 3>It was all long job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1549
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:13.160
<v Speaker 3>Ons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1550
01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:16.080
<v Speaker 3>like hearns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't really like big left hook is.</v>

1551
01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.160
<v Speaker 3>And what about mccallum?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't mccallum fight under a manual?</v>

1552
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Mike mcconnell in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snatcher maybe famous left hook to </v>

1553
01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Donald Curry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Left to the body.</v>

1554
01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:28.671
<v Speaker 3>And the left upstairs was he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was he just do it that I believe he was </v>

1555
01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:32.400
<v Speaker 3>a drunk guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe mccowen because he's a video.</v>

1556
01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inspiring with mcclellan.</v>

1557
01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just the nice classic.</v>

1558
01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:41.510
<v Speaker 3>This live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

1559
01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.550
<v Speaker 3>so amazing to watch cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1560
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:50.770
<v Speaker 3>It really is an art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also an art with a very short </v>

1561
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:54.640
<v Speaker 3>amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could pursue it and the very limited</v>

1562
01:10:54.831 --> 01:10:56.790
<v Speaker 3>number of times you can get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1563
01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:00.080
<v Speaker 3>and I think I got to show as a shallow </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence.</v>

1564
01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing that used to disturb me</v>
<v Speaker 3>most about mma gyms maybe say 10,</v>

1565
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:08.200
<v Speaker 3>15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys really didn't have a.</v>

1566
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:13.310
<v Speaker 3>There was a shouldn't say these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some gems really didn't have the best,</v>

1567
01:11:13.741 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 3>most</v>

1568
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.040
<v Speaker 1>tactical striking coaches that had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep knowledge and understanding of </v>

1569
01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.071
<v Speaker 1>striking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these guys would be beating the fuck </v>

1570
01:11:22.071 --> 01:11:25.071
<v Speaker 1>out of each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the throwing bombs at each </v>

1571
01:11:25.071 --> 01:11:27.570
<v Speaker 1>other in the gym and you would watch it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they weren't working on technique.</v>

1572
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:32.810
<v Speaker 1>They weren't working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't sparring to get better at </v>

1573
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:34.470
<v Speaker 1>the art of hitting and not getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just wailing on each other.</v>

1574
01:11:34.471 --> 01:11:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1575
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>that was toughening them up in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air quotes,</v>

1576
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and then they would go into the gym or </v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the ring and fight and they were</v>

1577
01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:46.650
<v Speaker 1>carrying all the damage that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulating in the sparring sessions.</v>

1578
01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of these guys now are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking up like jamie varner,</v>

1579
01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:55.770
<v Speaker 1>who's a former wec champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a top lightweight contender in the ufc </v>

1580
01:11:55.770 --> 01:12:00.471
<v Speaker 1>just recently retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's talking about the amount of </v>

1581
01:12:00.471 --> 01:12:00.471
<v Speaker 1>sparring that he did and how fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1582
01:12:00.471 --> 01:12:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was sparring with much larger guys </v>

1583
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.450
<v Speaker 1>who was sparring with ryan bader have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights at two.</v>

1584
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's fighting at 55.</v>

1585
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:08.940
<v Speaker 1>And bRian baiters class at two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>

1586
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So he's fighting a guy 50 fucking pounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavier than him.</v>

1587
01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:13.590
<v Speaker 1>He sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in The gym is madness.</v>

1590
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.740

1591
01:12:20.741 --> 01:12:21.870
<v Speaker 1>was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>lives in Brazil.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1597
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.270
<v Speaker 1>this is an amazing time for mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is such a.</v>

1598
01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:44.490
<v Speaker 1>It's such a young and blossoming sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the level of striking is slowly </v>

1599
01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:49.110
<v Speaker 1>and steadily getting faster and faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>and better and better.</v>

1600
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really an amazing thing to watch.</v>

1601
01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:53.550
<v Speaker 1>The jujitsu is getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's getting better.</v>

1602
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no comparison whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1603
01:12:55.741 --> 01:12:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>1993 kickboxing was.</v>

1604
01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:03.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch like andy hook or mike </v>

1605
01:13:03.651 --> 01:13:04.530
<v Speaker 1>bernardo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were very good,</v>

1606
01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.470
<v Speaker 1>but they're probably not as good as badr</v>
<v Speaker 1>hari.</v>

1607
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the difference between say fighters </v>

1608
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:15.081
<v Speaker 1>from ufc one and fighters today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're talking about a massive </v>

1609
01:13:15.081 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 1>evolution like generations of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand years of growth,</v>

1610
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.970
<v Speaker 1>sort of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was no comparison whatsoever.</v>

1611
01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:25.270
<v Speaker 1>It's going to scan it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting very quickly from mistakes.</v>

1612
01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:30.271
<v Speaker 1>So what people have done Before learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly and also accumulating the </v>

1613
01:13:30.271 --> 01:13:34.701
<v Speaker 1>techniques from other disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the guys who started </v>

1614
01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:35.400
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really only good at one thing.</v>

1615
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Either they're really good at striking </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're really good at grappling.</v>

1616
01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:41.550
<v Speaker 1>That was basically it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're getting these guys today that</v>

1617
01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:46.551
<v Speaker 1>are great at everything and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a small complaint isn't a complete.</v>

1618
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It was fragmented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't an first ufc started.</v>

1619
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:54.890
<v Speaker 1>It was fragmented with people at a jiu </v>
<v Speaker 1>jitsu and male smith was it was he pat </v>

1620
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:59.130
<v Speaker 1>smith best ones and he was the one dutch</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1621
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Which guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blind alando v or whether it be books in</v>

1622
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.270
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twice.</v>

1623
01:14:06.271 --> 01:14:10.870
<v Speaker 1>He was just on all the dunks and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was dangerous.</v>

1624
01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Same traIners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramon decker called calamities with </v>

1625
01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.300
<v Speaker 1>glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's the matchmaker for glory.</v>

1626
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.720
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He trained him.</v>

1627
01:14:17.721 --> 01:14:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.120
<v Speaker 1>He was an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Early on in the beginning were very </v>

1629
01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:24.120
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thai boxer,</v>

1630
01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.011
<v Speaker 1>but a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who didn't know how to grapple </v>

1631
01:14:29.011 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>and he would get take down to the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just smashed he in.</v>

1632
01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:31.160
<v Speaker 1>They got beat by a dutch kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

1633
01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:33.400
<v Speaker 1>The elbow wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1634
01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:36.990
<v Speaker 1>goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rem co pardue.</v>

1635
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rem co got hIm in a headlock,</v>

1636
01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.400
<v Speaker 1>took him to the ground and just blasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>his brains out with elbows.</v>

1637
01:14:43.401 --> 01:14:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean he elbowed him like four or five </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1638
01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Guy got chills mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an important fight for people </v>

1639
01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:57.301
<v Speaker 1>to realize that ninjitsu is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people really believed they </v>

1640
01:14:57.301 --> 01:15:01.291
<v Speaker 1>were going to karate chops on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:04.860
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level in compare.</v>

1642
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also one of the reasons why </v>

1643
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:09.880
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalent in mma.</v>

1644
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 1>It's because there's so many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you have to work on.</v>

1645
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1646
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.120
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to do if you do your </v>
<v Speaker 1>road work and then you're gonna do your </v>

1647
01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:18.120
<v Speaker 1>boxing work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1648
01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you do your sparring or your pad work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1649
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:22.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spar x amounT of days per week.</v>

1650
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Speaker 1>The other days you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting pads,</v>

1651
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.660
<v Speaker 1>work in the bag and doing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>combinationS,</v>

1652
01:15:25.661 --> 01:15:28.570
<v Speaker 1>but you're only working on one skill an </v>
<v Speaker 1>mma.</v>

1653
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not even just working on boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to striking you gotta </v>

1654
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:34.180
<v Speaker 1>train elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta train kicks,</v>

1655
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:39.450
<v Speaker 1>you gotta train knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to train a different stance </v>

1656
01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:40.570
<v Speaker 1>because you're worried about being taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

1657
01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:42.670
<v Speaker 1>so you have to work on your sprawl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to work on.</v>

1658
01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:44.980
<v Speaker 1>You take down defenSe under hooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wizard,</v>

1659
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.200
<v Speaker 1>step away from the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to get back up.</v>

1660
01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to work on your jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work on sweeps,</v>

1661
01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:53.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to work on actual submissions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to figure out like what,</v>

1662
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:54.780
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much can I do like,</v>

1663
01:15:54.781 --> 01:15:56.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to get fat as well.</v>

1664
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a guy like cain velasquez,</v>

1665
01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you never see tHat guy attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>submission,</v>

1666
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:06.090
<v Speaker 1>never attempted to submission and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ufc fights because it's the only </v>

1667
01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:06.090
<v Speaker 1>so much shit you can do.</v>

1668
01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.170
<v Speaker 1>So he takes guys down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just beats him up,</v>

1669
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of trying to like,</v>

1670
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn all the chokes and all the.</v>

1671
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he probably knows them,</v>

1672
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.860
<v Speaker 1>but applying them in an actual fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

1673
01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:20.200
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like there's too much to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

1674
01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And so when I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when ncfc,</v>

1675
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:29.580
<v Speaker 1>when russ pearson fault columella at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I realized how dangerous these guys</v>

1676
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:31.900
<v Speaker 1>now I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1677
01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I can just kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can get you on the floor.</v>

1678
01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1679
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:39.370
<v Speaker 1>not topic now is don't kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1680
01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Basically don't break my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>

1681
01:16:41.561 --> 01:16:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My leg don't kill.</v>

1682
01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:48.330
<v Speaker 1>That's very um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>macy's reality isn't real.</v>

1683
01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:50.170
<v Speaker 1>It's real kumbaya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1684
01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.960
<v Speaker 1>It certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:57.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why mma is</v>
<v Speaker 1>become so popular is because it's so </v>

1686
01:16:57.030 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 1>difficult to go from that to like floyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather versus pack.</v>

1687
01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it's not much happened.</v>

1688
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It was like a lot of movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I loved.</v>

1689
01:17:04.121 --> 01:17:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I loved that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1690
01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the reality of the variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the different variables that exist </v>

1691
01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.030
<v Speaker 1>in mma where god can take you down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden,</v>

1692
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:14.730
<v Speaker 1>kick your legs so I can do so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things to you.</v>

1693
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Can't just stand in front of him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder roll and box and then clench.</v>

1694
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Just so much more going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clench is just the beginning.</v>

1695
01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to press the up against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage and the pull your ankles out from </v>

1696
01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:26.650
<v Speaker 1>andrea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to mount you,</v>

1697
01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:27.220
<v Speaker 1>elbow you the face going to cut you </v>
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

1698
01:17:27.221 --> 01:17:32.221
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not nearly as simple to defend </v>

1699
01:17:32.221 --> 01:17:32.570
<v Speaker 1>yourself as it is in a boxing ring.</v>

1700
01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:36.200
<v Speaker 2>hey straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I mean it's just like looking at</v>

1701
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:39.540
<v Speaker 2>the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They deserve the belt to get the belt,</v>

1702
01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:41.410
<v Speaker 2>the ufc belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must deserve it.</v>

1703
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to go for it to get that to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to get where they want to get together.</v>

1705
01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Once a gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>every fighter's camp in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think it should be okay?</v>

1715
01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be because you can </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>day and then if their ads are not right,</v>

1719
01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 2>the body didn't perform.</v>

1720
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Now what about applying that to kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about applying that to kids in </v>

1721
01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.130
<v Speaker 1>school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not fighters,</v>

1722
01:18:44.131 --> 01:18:45.750
<v Speaker 1>just people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in school.</v>

1723
01:18:45.751 --> 01:18:50.751
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in high school or in college </v>

1724
01:18:50.751 --> 01:18:53.571
<v Speaker 1>where you're about to go out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and so much of your success or </v>

1725
01:18:53.641 --> 01:18:57.420
<v Speaker 1>failure is predicated on your attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mindset,</v>

1726
01:18:57.421 --> 01:19:02.421
<v Speaker 1>and how your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how your brain is organized and </v>

1727
01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:02.421
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1729
01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really.</v>

1730
01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:11.820
<v Speaker 2>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much stuff that you can do </v>

1731
01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:15.951
<v Speaker 2>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can help people learn and take in </v>

1732
01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.100
<v Speaker 2>information differently than just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cliche.</v>

1733
01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you gotta do.</v>

1734
01:19:20.111 --> 01:19:20.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is.</v>

1735
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:25.930
<v Speaker 2>But it's that many phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's so interesting </v>

1736
01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:27.010
<v Speaker 2>because these people are so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different types of people,</v>

1737
01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:29.050
<v Speaker 2>siemens ways of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1738
01:19:29.051 --> 01:19:31.180
<v Speaker 2>like we did earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did the larger member.</v>

1739
01:19:31.210 --> 01:19:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to explain what that is.</v>

1740
01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:36.590
<v Speaker 2>How come I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a slight self-induced.</v>

1741
01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:41.830
<v Speaker 2>All hypnosis is self induced haka.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We say self-induced hypnosis thing where</v>

1742
01:19:41.831 --> 01:19:43.480
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically,</v>

1743
01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:46.070
<v Speaker 2>you find a spot on the wall that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than your eyeline.</v>

1744
01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:50.230
<v Speaker 2>So you'd imagine that you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>through your middle of your eyebrows and</v>

1745
01:19:50.231 --> 01:19:52.510
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you focus on a spot on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall,</v>

1746
01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just allow yourself to just </v>

1747
01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.530
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you can see all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left and all the way to the right.</v>

1748
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:05.010
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see really high above self and </v>

1749
01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:07.891
<v Speaker 2>below yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can imagine that you can </v>

1750
01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:07.891
<v Speaker 2>see 360 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it does,</v>

1751
01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:09.990
<v Speaker 2>it opens your periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opens your peripheral vision,</v>

1752
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Speaker 2>so it gives you a slight hypnotic state </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a slight,</v>

1753
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:17.680
<v Speaker 2>a more feeling of wellness in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1754
01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:19.530
<v Speaker 2>how relaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that feeling.</v>

1755
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:21.670
<v Speaker 3>And what we did was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>

1756
01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:27.300
<v Speaker 3>you were telling me to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that spot and then visualize magnet.</v>

1757
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1758
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:31.230
<v Speaker 2>that was different what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1759
01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:36.240
<v Speaker 2>what we did was we did hakalau first to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of lead you into a hypnotic </v>

1760
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:36.660
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1761
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:38.290
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get you to cause you know,</v>

1762
01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't go,</v>

1763
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.070
<v Speaker 2>you say these things on these rapid </v>
<v Speaker 2>inductions.</v>

1764
01:20:42.071 --> 01:20:44.290
<v Speaker 2>And I went on a course of rapid </v>
<v Speaker 2>inductions were,</v>

1765
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.380
<v Speaker 2>and what does that robert inductions as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a color snap induction.</v>

1766
01:20:47.381 --> 01:20:49.330
<v Speaker 2>So what they do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a slight,</v>

1767
01:20:49.331 --> 01:20:50.910
<v Speaker 2>you put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1768
01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:55.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like a shock shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system shock them and then they,</v>

1769
01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:58.780
<v Speaker 2>then you go sleep or whatever and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>puts them under very quickly.</v>

1770
01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.420
<v Speaker 2>You see it can see it on youtube and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of adult.</v>

1771
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I can do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very showy techniques as well.</v>

1772
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really dig them.</v>

1773
01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:11.240
<v Speaker 3>How does it work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like shocked induction,</v>

1774
01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:13.520
<v Speaker 3>your sleep because your mind needs </v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

1775
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:16.250
<v Speaker 3>your mind needs you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your unconscious needs information</v>

1776
01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:21.880
<v Speaker 2>so you can like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one way you shake hands with </v>

1777
01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.590
<v Speaker 2>someone so when they go to shake your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand that your hand,</v>

1778
01:21:24.591 --> 01:21:27.830
<v Speaker 2>you break the pattern and make them look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at their own hand and then you say,</v>

1779
01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:28.730
<v Speaker 2>look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1780
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Focus on that is a confusion technique </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you say just focus on your hand</v>

1781
01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:37.160
<v Speaker 2>or that government had sleep on nigga </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1804
01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:37.450
<v Speaker 3>So they make people forget their names </v>
<v Speaker 3>or removed the number four.</v>

1805
01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:38.320
<v Speaker 3>So they go one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1806
01:22:38.321 --> 01:22:39.670
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

1807
01:22:39.671 --> 01:22:40.330
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

1808
01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:42.130
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11.</v>

1809
01:22:42.131 --> 01:22:44.890
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to watch,</v>

1810
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:50.050
<v Speaker 3>but I know there wasn't an interest to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you because what you're trying to do is </v>

1811
01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:52.990
<v Speaker 3>improve people or help them live their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

1812
01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.100
<v Speaker 3>It looks stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know?</v>

1813
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>

1814
01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.900
<v Speaker 3>when I was first starting out doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>

1815
01:22:58.901 --> 01:23:03.901
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy in Rhode Island named </v>
<v Speaker 3>Frank Santos and he was an r rated </v>

1816
01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:04.450
<v Speaker 3>hypnotists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And up untIl that point,</v>

1817
01:23:04.451 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 3>I thought hypnosis is bullshit</v>

1818
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 1>until I saw this guy over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1819
01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:09.460
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1820
01:23:09.461 --> 01:23:09.970
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1821
01:23:09.971 --> 01:23:14.971
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a night once a week at stitches </v>

1822
01:23:14.971 --> 01:23:17.791
<v Speaker 1>comedy club in boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I saw him dozens and dozens of times </v>

1823
01:23:17.791 --> 01:23:21.930
<v Speaker 1>and he would hypnotize giant and he knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people were under and when they </v>

1824
01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:22.180
<v Speaker 1>were bullshitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would get guys who would look at them</v>

1825
01:23:22.181 --> 01:23:22.780
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1826
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 1>you're not mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not working.</v>

1827
01:23:24.251 --> 01:23:25.180
<v Speaker 1>You're faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1828
01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And he would take them off the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew when people are under a new,</v>

1829
01:23:28.661 --> 01:23:31.450
<v Speaker 1>when they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he could get a whole group of people</v>

1830
01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:36.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe like bring 10 people on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time he's done hypnotized them,</v>

1831
01:23:36.251 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 1>six or seven of them would be totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>

1832
01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And he'd have them doing all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous things.</v>

1833
01:23:40.991 --> 01:23:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Like they thought they were having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would come in their pants like,</v>

1834
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:49.350
<v Speaker 1>like really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know for you you're thinking </v>

1835
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.040
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't helping anyone.</v>

1836
01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:54.370
<v Speaker 1>What he wasn't trying to do that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to put on a show.</v>

1837
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:55.150
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1838
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:56.780
<v Speaker 1>people pay to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny</v>

1839
01:23:57.090 --> 01:23:59.930
<v Speaker 2>pay to see it and they want to go on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage freewill.</v>

1840
01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it before we part and parcel </v>

1841
01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:06.180
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

1842
01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:06.330
<v Speaker 1>part and parcel of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of itch.</v>

1843
01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

1844
01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.410
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

1845
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1846
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:14.800
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>

1847
01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that it just doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1848
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 2>but how are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1849
01:24:22.050 --> 01:24:23.610
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1850
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:29.500
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a hypnotherapist and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say you can hypnotize me brand fuck off,</v>

1851
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:34.080
<v Speaker 2>what did you come fall right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the point?</v>

1852
01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:36.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a piece or to buy a pizza,</v>

1853
01:24:36.101 --> 01:24:37.950
<v Speaker 2>you know what comes here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes,</v>

1854
01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.100
<v Speaker 2>get hypnotized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1855
01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.060
<v Speaker 2>half go along with it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1856
01:24:42.061 --> 01:24:42.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1857
01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.740
<v Speaker 2>and it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the client's got an issue they want </v>

1858
01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.121
<v Speaker 2>to change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the more likely to change if they </v>

1859
01:24:50.121 --> 01:24:50.121
<v Speaker 2>want to change with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1860
01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1861
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:54.300
<v Speaker 2>the people that do on the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

1862
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.510
<v Speaker 2>they want it to happen sooner than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't mind looking daft.</v>

1863
01:24:57.511 --> 01:25:02.511
<v Speaker 2>So that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why did with you is we did the </v>

1864
01:25:02.511 --> 01:25:06.291
<v Speaker 2>modern as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was just logistically stood way </v>

1865
01:25:07.261 --> 01:25:12.261
<v Speaker 2>because we did the peripheral vision and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we just imagined that there was a </v>

1866
01:25:12.261 --> 01:25:14.790
<v Speaker 2>magnet that could say negative energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your body and what that does is you</v>

1867
01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:17.280
<v Speaker 2>use your own imagination to take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative energy out.</v>

1868
01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:19.340
<v Speaker 2>You do move is because it a weird</v>

1869
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:21.600
<v Speaker 1>still for what is happening there </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1870
01:25:21.601 --> 01:25:26.601
<v Speaker 1>because obviously there's no magnet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind thinking that negative energy </v>

1871
01:25:26.601 --> 01:25:30.551
<v Speaker 1>is being pulled out of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that just an adjustment of your </v>

1872
01:25:30.551 --> 01:25:32.530
<v Speaker 1>attitude or an adjustment of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions knows?</v>

1873
01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1874
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will.</v>

1875
01:25:34.641 --> 01:25:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Alls I know is it works very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well on east relaxing and</v>

1876
01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.720
<v Speaker 1>is that related at all to what Frank </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santos used to do by getting an entire </v>

1877
01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>group of people think that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing wacky shit in front of an audience</v>

1878
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:47.210
<v Speaker 2>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1879
01:25:47.211 --> 01:25:51.630
<v Speaker 2>it's the installation of what is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>installation that's different.</v>

1880
01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:57.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no matter she sat and not </v>

1881
01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:57.440
<v Speaker 2>having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an installation and it's</v>

1882
01:25:57.930 --> 01:25:59.610
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't really think that there was</v>

1883
01:25:59.611 --> 01:26:00.390
<v Speaker 1>a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1884
01:26:00.391 --> 01:26:00.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1885
01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they don't,</v>

1886
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:06.370
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go on there for that experienced or</v>

1887
01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.680
<v Speaker 2>thankful for the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it sort of respected where they </v>

1888
01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.070
<v Speaker 2>believe there's is the end result if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel more relaxed.</v>

1889
01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a placebo effect.</v>

1890
01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So the placebo effect or the mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiving this change and then </v>

1892
01:26:23.071 --> 01:26:26.280
<v Speaker 1>adjusting your attitude accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1893
01:26:26.370 --> 01:26:27.690
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

1894
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:33.010
<v Speaker 2>He says just a redirection of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>redirection of focus.</v>

1895
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 1>But that was different than the hypnosis</v>
<v Speaker 1>part because the hypnosis part,</v>

1896
01:26:36.831 --> 01:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>when you hypnotized me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was definitely hypnotized.</v>

1897
01:26:39.051 --> 01:26:44.051
<v Speaker 1>Like I definitely could see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could listen to your voice and I knew </v>

1898
01:26:44.051 --> 01:26:47.561
<v Speaker 1>that I was hearing your voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was in this weird sort of dream </v>

1899
01:26:47.561 --> 01:26:47.561
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1900
01:26:47.561 --> 01:26:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I was aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not aware of it.</v>

1901
01:26:48.041 --> 01:26:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you took my pants off,</v>

1902
01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:51.050
<v Speaker 1>we'd have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be,</v>

1903
01:26:51.051 --> 01:26:56.051
<v Speaker 1>I would have woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what the fuck's this guy trying to </v>

1904
01:26:56.051 --> 01:26:56.051
<v Speaker 1>pull?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

1905
01:26:56.051 --> 01:26:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Like he's trying to pull you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't true,</v>

1906
01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1907
01:26:58.461 --> 01:27:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird state because you're not,</v>

1908
01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you're not totally there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're kind of there.</v>

1909
01:27:06.610 --> 01:27:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Is that a good way of describing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1910
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you still dry.</v>

1911
01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.680
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna do anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>against your values anyway.</v>

1912
01:27:12.681 --> 01:27:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're going to do anything.</v>

1913
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well like,</v>

1914
01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.820
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't anyway because I'm not like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1915
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like that as a hypnotherapist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a mind coach.</v>

1916
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:22.070
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we did with you is we,</v>

1917
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1918
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:28.750
<v Speaker 2>we got you to focus on your thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That film didn't say your thumb,</v>

1919
01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.920
<v Speaker 2>thumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He disassociate yourself.</v>

1920
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Instead of saying your thumb thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we focus on that film and then you just </v>

1921
01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:38.870
<v Speaker 2>get your focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a structure like a,</v>

1922
01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.510
<v Speaker 2>as you want to free yourself for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for,</v>

1923
01:27:41.511 --> 01:27:42.830
<v Speaker 2>it's called to do that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1924
01:27:42.831 --> 01:27:43.460
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

1925
01:27:44.110 --> 01:27:44.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1926
01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:47.340
<v Speaker 2>see it just like counting down as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1927
01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 2>do you account we know but using </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>

1928
01:27:49.911 --> 01:27:52.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bright say so cause assault of,</v>

1929
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:54.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on that.</v>

1930
01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.180
<v Speaker 2>If you're focusing on that then your </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious mind.</v>

1931
01:27:57.181 --> 01:28:02.181
<v Speaker 2>So you folks in that not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm talking to you with language </v>

<v Speaker 2>very intelligent guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>member of mensa herbal,</v>

1949
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:41.540
<v Speaker 2>super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

1950
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:44.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got this certain guy,</v>

1951
01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:45.730
<v Speaker 2>they did a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1952
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 2>elimination techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1953
01:28:47.241 --> 01:28:52.241
<v Speaker 2>to see what was most susceptible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they use a certain guy to go and shoot </v>

1954
01:28:52.241 --> 01:28:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Stephen Fry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1955
01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.010
<v Speaker 2>not with a real gun obviouSly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just whether,</v>

1956
01:28:55.011 --> 01:28:57.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1957
01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1958
01:28:58.950 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a case where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1959
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:07.130
<v Speaker 3>what he assassinated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who needs said definitely I was </v>

1960
01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:07.900
<v Speaker 3>under hypnosis and everybody's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that while he's in prison,</v>

1961
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:08.630
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1962
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think it's possible?</v>

1963
01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1964
01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.460
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would know,</v>

1965
01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably more than 99 percent of the </v>

1966
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.401
<v Speaker 3>people on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if it's against your deep level </v>

1967
01:29:22.401 --> 01:29:22.401
<v Speaker 3>of value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't do it.</v>

1968
01:29:22.401 --> 01:29:24.870
<v Speaker 3>But what if you're fairly shady but </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent?</v>

1969
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's darkness.</v>

1970
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:29.010
<v Speaker 3>That's very right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1971
01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:32.430
<v Speaker 3>if you find a guy who's not maybe never </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed anybody,</v>

1972
01:29:32.431 --> 01:29:37.431
<v Speaker 3>but maybe he's done a few fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and you can talk back guy and </v>

1973
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.660
<v Speaker 3>doing something like that through </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnosis.</v>

1974
01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe because you're essentially </v>

1975
01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.430
<v Speaker 3>steering someone towards a crime that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they ordinarily would have avoided.</v>

1976
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 3>What did you say the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's again on youtube,</v>

1977
01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>italian.</v>

1978
01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:56.820
<v Speaker 3>A hypnotist and took money off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cashier.</v>

1979
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.620
<v Speaker 3>She got just took money out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>register.</v>

1980
01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:03.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still not derren brown played on </v>

1981
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:03.680
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1982
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.970
<v Speaker 3>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was captured on cctv camera.</v>

1983
01:30:04.971 --> 01:30:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was a thief.</v>

1984
01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were,</v>

1985
01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:09.330
<v Speaker 3>there was one where devin brown paid </v>
<v Speaker 3>with paper,</v>

1986
01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:14.900
<v Speaker 3>so what it did is it got gets paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the same as like dollar bills </v>

1987
01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.430
<v Speaker 3>that's just blank paper and he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a confusion technique,</v>

1988
01:30:17.431 --> 01:30:19.830
<v Speaker 3>so he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't quote me on this,</v>

1989
01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:24.860
<v Speaker 3>on the script,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you sat down and I just moved into </v>

1990
01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.731
<v Speaker 3>the town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got off the train and I don't </v>

1991
01:30:27.731 --> 01:30:30.201
<v Speaker 3>know whether to go with that way or that</v>
<v Speaker 3>way because my friend said you have to </v>

1992
01:30:30.201 --> 01:30:30.780
<v Speaker 3>get the terrain but don't know where to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go that way or that way or that way.</v>

1993
01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:32.280
<v Speaker 3>But do you know where the station is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he said,</v>

1994
01:30:32.281 --> 01:30:33.180
<v Speaker 3>get the tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just take it,</v>

1995
01:30:33.181 --> 01:30:35.250
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when he's,</v>

1996
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:37.200
<v Speaker 3>when he's said said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just take it,</v>

1997
01:30:37.201 --> 01:30:37.560
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

1998
01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.200
<v Speaker 3>So confused as the people say that way </v>
<v Speaker 3>or that way.</v>

1999
01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:42.810
<v Speaker 3>So just mixed directing your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's moving his hands everywhere.</v>

2000
01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:44.400
<v Speaker 3>She thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's this guy on about?</v>

2001
01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Then he's saying take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

2002
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.960
<v Speaker 3>So when he's giving them money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2003
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:49.320
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sAid,</v>

2004
01:30:49.321 --> 01:30:50.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I buy that?</v>

2005
01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:53.190
<v Speaker 3>And he just gives them paper and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's still confused,</v>

2006
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.190
<v Speaker 3>not for long because they assume </v>
<v Speaker 3>comradery,</v>

2007
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 3>but it confuses them to st.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take it.</v>

2008
01:30:57.961 --> 01:30:58.780
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take it.</v>

2009
01:30:58.890 --> 01:30:59.670
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these.</v>

2010
01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I've worked at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2011
01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.760
<v Speaker 3>like an ice cream place when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>

2012
01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:08.910
<v Speaker 3>sort of ice cream and hamburgers was </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed called newport creamery.</v>

2013
01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:14.300
<v Speaker 3>And I remember they had someone came in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they called a flim flam artist or </v>

2014
01:31:15.331 --> 01:31:18.750
<v Speaker 3>someone would come in and they'll give </v>
<v Speaker 3>you $20 and they'd say,</v>

2015
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.860

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a five and five ones?</v>

2017
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:25.650
<v Speaker 3>And then they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2018
01:31:25.651 --> 01:31:27.300
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually can you give me a 10,</v>

2019
01:31:27.301 --> 01:31:29.310

<v Speaker 3>give me two tens.</v>

2022
01:31:32.281 --> 01:31:35.130
<v Speaker 3>And then they would start to tens of </v>
<v Speaker 3>five and four quarters now.</v>

2023
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:40.280
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have More than $20 that you'd be </v>

2024
01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.050
<v Speaker 3>giving them for their them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the manager closed the,</v>

01:31:43.051 --> 01:31:44.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the register.</v>

2027
01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.360
<v Speaker 3>what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they shut the register and they had </v>

2028
01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:53.581
<v Speaker 3>like this sort of weird eye to eye </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment with this guy who was trying to </v>

2029
01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:57.150
<v Speaker 3>hustle this kid that was working the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cash register.</v>

2030
01:31:57.151 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really fascinating.</v>

2031
01:31:58.990 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 3>It was like a guy</v>

2032
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:01.960
<v Speaker 1>who was a con man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I wasn't working on the cash register,</v>

2035

<v Speaker 1>but I was close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget what I was doing,</v>

2036
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:10.510
<v Speaker 1>but I remember watching this going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

2037

<v Speaker 1>What is something happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they had like a little meeting.</v>

2038

<v Speaker 1>They explained when you're working the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cash register,</v>

2039
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:21.271

<v Speaker 1>People that start asking you for weird </v>

2040
01:32:21.271 --> 01:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

<v Speaker 1>memorize what they're asking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before you know it,</v>

01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.370
<v Speaker 2>it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mesa,</v>

2064
01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.170
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he gave you like a shitty change?</v>

2065
01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just went over and gave him 20.</v>

2066
01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:21.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

2067
01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2068
01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:26.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird hustle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hustle of trying to confuse people,</v>

2069
01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:31.580
<v Speaker 1>but there must be patterns that they try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tap into and the way people recognize</v>

2070
01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:37.710
<v Speaker 1>money or the way people count things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to disrupt and cars</v>

2071
01:33:38.170 --> 01:33:39.780
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

2072
01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:44.960
<v Speaker 2>especially words that can confuse people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and send them off guard or we did a </v>

2073
01:33:45.391 --> 01:33:48.450
<v Speaker 2>thing when we did the masters were </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurolinguistic programming and we did a</v>

2074
01:33:48.451 --> 01:33:51.560
<v Speaker 2>thing called quantum linguistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting.</v>

2075
01:33:51.561 --> 01:33:56.561
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes you laugh because it's just makes </v>

2076
01:33:56.561 --> 01:33:58.200
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make no sense and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best language patterns I was saying.</v>

2077
01:33:58.201 --> 01:33:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was,</v>

2078
01:33:59.910 --> 01:34:02.140
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always self sabotaging.</v>

2079
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell,</v>

2080
01:34:02.521 --> 01:34:07.521
<v Speaker 2>we sell sabotage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a guy called chris mannix did my </v>

2081
01:34:07.521 --> 01:34:11.091
<v Speaker 2>masters with and I said as much and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a wasp nest and I've got a </v>

2082
01:34:11.091 --> 01:34:16.071
<v Speaker 2>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't go near it because you'll get </v>

2083
01:34:16.071 --> 01:34:16.071
<v Speaker 2>stung,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because it was your.</v>

2084
01:34:16.071 --> 01:34:16.110
<v Speaker 2>I always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2085
01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:21.150
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll get stoned and just see what </v>

2086
01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:21.150
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight.</v>

2087
01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:21.810
<v Speaker 2>He's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A young read after anya and he said,</v>

2088
01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.850
<v Speaker 2>what wouldn't happen if it pretended not</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it?</v>

2089
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:30.100
<v Speaker 2>So when you said what wouldn't happen if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pretended not to do it right?</v>

2090
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.970
<v Speaker 2>And I was like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just makes sense.</v>

2091
01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Nobody sends your mind in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you did not.</v>

2092
01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:40.890
<v Speaker 2>so that wouldn't happen if we pretended </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to do it.</v>

2093
01:34:40.921 --> 01:34:45.921
<v Speaker 2>So if you pretend not to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're pretending not to do what </v>

2094
01:34:45.921 --> 01:34:47.700
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what wouldn't happen?</v>

2095
01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Well you wouldn't get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen as you wouldn't get </v>

2096
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:53.020
<v Speaker 2>stung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2097
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.090
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what tended not to do it.</v>

2098
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:58.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the sort of stone thing in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like what would not need</v>

2099
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.120
<v Speaker 3>to learn how to talk better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker.</v>

2100
01:35:00.121 --> 01:35:03.320
<v Speaker 3>You're talking crazy in that situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you,</v>

2101
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:05.270
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's dropped on,</v>

2102
01:35:05.271 --> 01:35:10.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't knock on top on the shoulder and </v>

2103
01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:11.711
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we'll never be done in the cliche </v>

2104
01:35:11.711 --> 01:35:15.971
<v Speaker 3>therapy thing and the therapy situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's when it's put into its glided </v>

2105
01:35:15.971 --> 01:35:20.360
<v Speaker 3>and with language works so smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you pay attention at all to cults?</v>

2106
01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Do you pay attention to it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm fascinated by people's </v>

2107
01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.070
<v Speaker 3>ability to control people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people's minds,</v>

2108
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.280
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always wondered whether or not </v>

2109
01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:37.120
<v Speaker 3>like when you see like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've seen the scientology documentary </v>

2110
01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:37.120
<v Speaker 3>going clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've started watching it.</v>

2111
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I started watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking fascinating,</v>

2112
01:35:41.001 --> 01:35:41.560
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2113
01:35:41.561 --> 01:35:43.690
<v Speaker 3>I've watched it three times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't look away.</v>

2114
01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.670
<v Speaker 3>I might watch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch it.</v>

2115
01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:48.840
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to watch it.</v>

2116
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:49.360
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2117
01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I had experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2118
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I've known several people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientologists but one of them was one </v>

2119
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:56.990
<v Speaker 3>of my neighbors and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2120
01:35:56.991 --> 01:36:00.500
<v Speaker 3>he and I had some weird exchange about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife was going clear,</v>

2121
01:36:00.501 --> 01:36:01.950
<v Speaker 3>so I needed $50,000.</v>

2122
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:05.150
<v Speaker 3>I want 50 fucking grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whoa,</v>

2123
01:36:05.151 --> 01:36:06.200

<v Speaker 3>There was like,</v>

2124
01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:11.860
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna do some ceremony and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife will no longer be influenced by </v>

2125
01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.750
<v Speaker 3>outside pressure or outside thoughts or </v>
<v Speaker 3>any anybody's criticisms or negativity </v>

2126
01:36:18.441 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 3>should no longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're no longer affect her.</v>

2127
01:36:20.710 --> 01:36:24.770
<v Speaker 3>And they needed 50 grand for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also what the fight.</v>

2128
01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.920
<v Speaker 3>But he fucking look in his eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was telling me like oranges have </v>

2129
01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:29.920
<v Speaker 3>vitamin c in them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2130
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.020
<v Speaker 3>for him it was like pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>straightforward obviously.</v>

2131
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:38.110
<v Speaker 3>And I've always been fascinated like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on with my friend</v>

2132
01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:41.570
<v Speaker 3>named aiden perez?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was into scientology.</v>

2133
01:36:41.571 --> 01:36:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really still is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he is.</v>

2134
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:45.730
<v Speaker 3>But he went to pflag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whIch is the base,</v>

2135
01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:49.220
<v Speaker 3>the base where that at the scientologist</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the main place,</v>

2136
01:36:49.221 --> 01:36:53.240
<v Speaker 3>what they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And tom cruise's sister is named ada.</v>

2137
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tom cruise's sister's child is named </v>

2138
01:36:59.000 --> 01:36:59.000
<v Speaker 3>aiden after him.</v>

2139
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was into it.</v>

2140
01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I went to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to a couple of times years and </v>

2141
01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:10.330
<v Speaker 3>years ago and then I creep me out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know if whatever floats your</v>

2142
01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:12.620
<v Speaker 3>boat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's not causing you any,</v>

2143
01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:14.430
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't seen that government class</v>
<v Speaker 3>out welding.</v>

2144
01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:19.700
<v Speaker 3>So say I agree with that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's not hurting you and what do I </v>

2145
01:37:21.381 --> 01:37:23.630
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that as well.</v>

2146
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Until you start watching these </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries,</v>

2147
01:37:26.121 --> 01:37:27.890
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well clearly it's hurting some people.</v>

2148
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.020
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely hurting people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's breaking up families.</v>

2149
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:30.310
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2150
01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:32.810
<v Speaker 3>it's really fucked up the way they </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack some people that,</v>

2151
01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:35.660
<v Speaker 3>that dissent or that leave or do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2152
01:37:35.690 --> 01:37:40.690
<v Speaker 3>if the people that are on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the documentary that are telling if </v>

2153
01:37:40.690 --> 01:37:42.170
<v Speaker 3>they're telling the truth and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>debatable,</v>

2154
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>own the only thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2156
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:45.170
<v Speaker 3>and the people that they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2157
01:37:45.171 --> 01:37:50.171
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some mind control going on </v>

2158
01:37:50.171 --> 01:37:50.171
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>

2159
01:37:50.171 --> 01:37:51.350
<v Speaker 3>there's some absolute definite mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>control going on there.</v>

2160
01:37:51.351 --> 01:37:55.470
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that related in any way to hypnosis?</v>

2161
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

<v Speaker 2>manipulate these folks into the hitler </v>

2163

<v Speaker 2>be susceptible people.</v>

2176
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I won't say hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll say us to resonate with what </v>

2177
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.630
<v Speaker 2>they believe in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2178
01:38:42.370 --> 01:38:44.550
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take floats the boat of gas,</v>

2179
01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:46.050
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could again latch on.</v>

2180
01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:48.760
<v Speaker 2>So it's like cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>

2181
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.820
<v Speaker 2>cold reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold reading,</v>

<v Speaker 2>halting by no means a different script.</v>

2184

<v Speaker 2>talking about how it's different </v>

<v Speaker 2>clothes ones,</v>

2209
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:56.730
<v Speaker 2>so everyone resonates with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like horoscopes.</v>

2210
01:39:56.731 --> 01:39:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Everyone saw like clings onto that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2211
01:39:59.731 --> 01:40:02.550

<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2214
01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:10.220
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went to somebody.</v>

2215
01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:10.220
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2216
01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:10.580
<v Speaker 2>they told me all about my grandmother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2217
01:40:10.581 --> 01:40:15.581
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you know about your grandmother </v>

2218
01:40:15.581 --> 01:40:18.500
<v Speaker 2>telling you some shit you already know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of psychic is that it doesn't make </v>

2219
01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 2>any sense and I never understood it </v>
<v Speaker 2>until we had this guy.</v>

2220
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:24.630
<v Speaker 2>do you know who bannon check is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2221
01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:28.260
<v Speaker 2>A headband check on the scifi show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe rogan questions,</v>

2222
01:40:28.261 --> 01:40:31.690
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was brilliant and stunning and scary.</v>

2223
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:35.430
<v Speaker 2>It was scary how good he is at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also super honest.</v>

2224
01:40:35.431 --> 01:40:36.450
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll Tell you right now,</v>

2225
01:40:36.451 --> 01:40:37.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a psychic,</v>

2226
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any psychic ability at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all bullshit and I hate when </v>

2227
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:46.590
<v Speaker 2>people steal from people and rob them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm doing is entertainment and it's</v>

2228
01:40:46.591 --> 01:40:50.280
<v Speaker 2>a show and I have very specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques that I use to achieve this.</v>

2229
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I don't.</v>

2230
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:53.400
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I can't.</v>

2231
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't fuck</v>

2232
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.560
<v Speaker 3>around when hypnosis and do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2233
01:40:58.130 --> 01:40:59.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2234
01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was not the game is it?</v>

2235
01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:06.690
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't doing hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just pretending to be able to </v>

2236
01:41:06.690 --> 01:41:08.110
<v Speaker 3>read your mind and be able to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all,</v>

2237
01:41:08.111 --> 01:41:10.870
<v Speaker 3>but he was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really clear about it.</v>

2238
01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are just techniques.</v>

2239
01:41:12.731 --> 01:41:16.930
<v Speaker 3>I am not really seeing anything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people can't see.</v>

2240
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any special ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people that do claim that like,</v>

2241
01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.660
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it is in england,</v>

2242
01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:27.661
<v Speaker 3>but in California in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll drive down the street and you'll </v>

2243
01:41:27.661 --> 01:41:30.250
<v Speaker 3>see I'll say four or five of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking psychic readings kind of baptism</v>

2244
01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:32.530
<v Speaker 3>that there's loads of chiropractors as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as low.</v>

2245
01:41:32.531 --> 01:41:35.080
<v Speaker 3>It's an american chiropractic bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2246
01:41:35.081 --> 01:41:40.081
<v Speaker 3>Is the chiropractors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I see that tarot and driving on the </v>

2247
01:41:40.081 --> 01:41:41.220
<v Speaker 3>street and counterparts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't see that many in england.</v>

2248
01:41:41.290 --> 01:41:43.510
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people think chiropractors are </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit too.</v>

2249
01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of reputable people think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bullshit,</v>

2250
01:41:46.890 --> 01:41:50.320
<v Speaker 3>but just moving your neck around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like click and killed.</v>

2251
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>across a lot of money to go to 150 bucks</v>

2252
01:41:54.611 --> 01:41:57.040
<v Speaker 3>and then just getting twisted around pop</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your back.</v>

2253
01:41:57.430 --> 01:42:02.430
<v Speaker 3>But then some people say like there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things that chiropractors do </v>

2254
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:03.100
<v Speaker 3>that really are beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the fuck.</v>

2255
01:42:03.101 --> 01:42:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones I've.</v>

2256
01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I've been to a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have been here.</v>

2257
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.880
<v Speaker 3>They've been god's fellow right </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards where there's this one guy </v>

2258
01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:17.131
<v Speaker 3>that used to work with a lot of fighters</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was what they call a zone healer </v>

2259
01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:20.760
<v Speaker 3>and his idea was that he was like sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of tricking your body into healing </v>

2260
01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.780
<v Speaker 3>because he was sort of using the placebo</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect,</v>

2261
01:42:22.781 --> 01:42:27.040
<v Speaker 3>telling you that he was healing you by </v>
<v Speaker 3>popping your neck or moving your body in</v>

2262
01:42:27.041 --> 01:42:27.700
<v Speaker 3>a certain way.</v>

2263
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.790
<v Speaker 3>But he really wasn't doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>other than shit of normal chiropractor.</v>

2264
01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try not to pay attention to that shit.</v>

2265
01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:39.780
<v Speaker 3>That stuff drives me nuts because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>deception and whether or not it's </v>

2266
01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.410
<v Speaker 3>effective or not is debatable because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>deception can be effective.</v>

2267
01:42:41.411 --> 01:42:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And isn't that sort of part of what,</v>

2268
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:46.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the placebo effects,</v>

2269
01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:51.710
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm against in the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing really is the point was trying to </v>

2270
01:42:51.881 --> 01:42:54.760
<v Speaker 3>make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck around with people,</v>

2271
01:42:55.690 --> 01:42:57.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come here for help.</v>

2272
01:42:57.071 --> 01:43:02.071
<v Speaker 3>The genuinely want your help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You genuinely wants to get where they </v>

2273
01:43:02.071 --> 01:43:02.890
<v Speaker 3>want to get to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't fuck around with people.</v>

2274
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair.</v>

2275
01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:04.850
<v Speaker 3>They pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2276
01:43:05.190 --> 01:43:10.190
<v Speaker 3>They looking for you to help them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I both effect because then the chief </v>

2277
01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:10.540
<v Speaker 3>something together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:43:10.541 --> 01:43:15.541
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that there's a lot of these of </v>

2279
01:43:15.541 --> 01:43:19.250
<v Speaker 3>shit and everything that went through </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is more shocking shafts and good </v>

2280
01:43:19.631 --> 01:43:19.930
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>

2281
01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:21.310
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And isn't that.</v>

2282
01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.280
<v Speaker 3>It was also a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of manipulation and a lot </v>

2283
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.440
<v Speaker 3>of charlatans and so almost every line </v>
<v Speaker 3>of work.</v>

2284
01:43:29.690 --> 01:43:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But isn't that,</v>

2285
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:35.890
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of relative to what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

2286
01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:38.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like what is your focus like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you trying to achieve?</v>

2287
01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.480
<v Speaker 3>What are you trying to achieve as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach,</v>

2288
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:45.870
<v Speaker 3>as a coach,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's hypnosis.</v>

2454
01:51:23.681 --> 01:51:28.681
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that's similar to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said Frank Santos used to be able to </v>

2455
01:51:28.681 --> 01:51:28.681
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2458
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Devotion that they have towards their </v>

<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

2464
01:51:44.551 --> 01:51:49.551
<v Speaker 1>thinks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a guy who thought he was </v>

2465
01:51:49.551 --> 01:51:51.651

<v Speaker 1>his pants because Frank Santos put that </v>

2466
01:51:51.651 --> 01:51:54.300
<v Speaker 1>in his head and he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wAtched it and the guy was like,</v>

2467
01:51:54.301 --> 01:51:59.301
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came in and I mean this guy wasn't </v>

2468
01:51:59.301 --> 01:51:59.301
<v Speaker 1>that good of an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just wasn't.</v>

2469
01:51:59.301 --> 01:52:00.120
<v Speaker 1>He was embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what to do.</v>

2472
01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:06.540
<v Speaker 1>if he was a ham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have spent.</v>

2473
01:52:06.630 --> 01:52:10.310
<v Speaker 1>It just was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell this guy really bad it</v>

2474

<v Speaker 2>He did believe it.</v>

2476
01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:20.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen people with needles when </v>

<v Speaker 2>the pain you can do,</v>

2479
01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:29.730
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's an interesting one called </v>

<v Speaker 2>pain paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'll talk to you about another </v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm really fascinated by the,</v>

2494
01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:06.880
<v Speaker 3>the full spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better term of </v>

2495
01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:11.330
<v Speaker 3>possibilities of suggestion that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>go from,</v>

<v Speaker 3>fake psychics and fake healers.</v>

2497
01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:19.490
<v Speaker 3>And like my friend Brian and I were the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store last night.</v>

2498
01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:24.670

<v Speaker 3>us?</v>

2500
01:53:24.670 --> 01:53:29.020
<v Speaker 3>It was hilarious because I knew I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to talk to you today and I knew </v>

2501
01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:30.170
<v Speaker 3>she was full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably thinks it's real,</v>

2502
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.210
<v Speaker 3>but she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you feel the energy?</v>

2503
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:34.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm like raving.</v>

<v Speaker 3>put your left hand out.</v>

2505
01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:36.310
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

2506
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.960
<v Speaker 3>left hands are more sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more susceptible or.</v>

2507
01:53:38.970 --> 01:53:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had my hand out and she is like </v>

2508
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:45.240
<v Speaker 3>running her hand over the top and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom line.</v>

2509
01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Not touching my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but getting close to it like,</v>

2510
01:53:48.141 --> 01:53:49.610
<v Speaker 3>do you feel it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel anything?</v>

2511
01:53:49.611 --> 01:53:51.140
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2512
01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:53.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be open minded but I don't</v>

2513
01:53:53.301 --> 01:53:55.370
<v Speaker 3>feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some people would be like,</v>

2514
01:53:55.371 --> 01:53:56.600
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do feel it.</v>

2515
01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's what you want to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My believes like,</v>

2516
01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:03.320
<v Speaker 3>like people that say kicks nico to cds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tarot card readers,</v>

2517
01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:05.960
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they give people comfort,</v>

2518
01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I make some people feel better and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2519
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got more power to him.</v>

2520
01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:12.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More power to them.</v>

2521
01:54:12.151 --> 01:54:15.360
<v Speaker 3>They believe at the time if they believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's this reiki,</v>

2522
01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:21.520
<v Speaker 3>and then if they believe it and it works</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are happy doing it and we </v>

2523
01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:21.710
<v Speaker 3>might meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might go,</v>

2524
01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:23.320
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2525
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:24.800
<v Speaker 3>where's the line drawn?</v>

2526
01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:27.530
<v Speaker 3>Is the line drawn when you're taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>money from them?</v>

2527
01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:31.280
<v Speaker 3>There is pissed take isn't the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they piss take piss takers.</v>

2528
01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:33.070
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2529
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:34.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking the piss.</v>

2530
01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2531
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:38.840
<v Speaker 3>you guys are fucking with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking the piss.</v>

2532
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2533
01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:46.420
<v Speaker 3>but more so than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who is pretending to be healing,</v>

2534
01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 3>but they're stealing money from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not really healing you nice.</v>

2535
01:54:50.410 --> 01:54:55.410
<v Speaker 3>But it's like anyone that sells a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamin that have this snake oil,</v>

2536
01:54:56.130 --> 01:54:57.000
<v Speaker 3>snake oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2537
01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:59.990
<v Speaker 3>snake all take this and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely changed.</v>

2538
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:03.050
<v Speaker 3>But what about fucking the real placebo </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect?</v>

2539
01:55:03.051 --> 01:55:08.051
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets really weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>because like there are some placebos </v>

2540
01:55:08.051 --> 01:55:11.720
<v Speaker 3>they have introduced to people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've told them it's a placebo and </v>

2541
01:55:12.291 --> 01:55:15.410
<v Speaker 3>then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the act of doing something,</v>

2542
01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:20.740
<v Speaker 3>the act of taking something actually has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a more beneficial effect than not doing </v>

2543
01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is again,</v>

2544
01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:26.801
<v Speaker 3>the power of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the placebo effect is a real </v>

2545
01:55:26.801 --> 01:55:26.801
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give someone something,</v>

2546
01:55:26.801 --> 01:55:30.290
<v Speaker 3>you tell them this is medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to fix whatever ails you.</v>

2547
01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:33.650
<v Speaker 3>And it actually does work on a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>percentage,</v>

2548
01:55:33.651 --> 01:55:38.651
<v Speaker 3>a statistically significant percentage </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people that are like crystals and</v>

2549
01:55:39.230 --> 01:55:41.990
<v Speaker 3>shit was like a lot of people believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2550
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:44.120
<v Speaker 3>They pull up with around and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting good</v>

2551
01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.750
<v Speaker 2>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck coin.</v>

2552
01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my lucky quarter dumbo,</v>

2553
01:55:47.881 --> 01:55:48.400
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2554
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2555
01:55:48.930 --> 01:55:50.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a feather.</v>

2556
01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Lucky further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2557
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.810
<v Speaker 2>and he believes he can fly with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're lucky feather.</v>

2558
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:56.640
<v Speaker 2>It comes down to how the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2559
01:55:57.260 --> 01:55:57.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sold it,</v>

2560
01:55:57.781 --> 01:56:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I think sold down to your business all </v>
<v Speaker 2>down of what you put into your intention</v>

2561
01:56:00.781 --> 01:56:02.400
<v Speaker 2>and what you want to belief for </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

2562
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:03.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it</v>

2563
01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:07.500
<v Speaker 1>weird that we have these minds that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>such amazing potential,</v>

2564
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:12.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's no fucking real good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guidebook that anybody's handed and </v>

2565
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:17.181
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of supposed to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your own or based on if you're lucky.</v>

2566
01:56:17.371 --> 01:56:22.371
<v Speaker 1>You have parents that have their shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and they sort of give you a </v>

2567
01:56:22.371 --> 01:56:24.840
<v Speaker 1>rough outline of how you should live </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life or live by example,</v>

2568
01:56:24.841 --> 01:56:29.841
<v Speaker 1>but we're not talking about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>goldfish or swans or anything fucking </v>

2569
01:56:30.421 --> 01:56:35.421
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about human beings with </v>

2570
01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:37.191
<v Speaker 1>complex languages in mathematics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and society and laws and and,</v>

2571
01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:41.600
<v Speaker 1>and money and all of the weirdness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes with being a person in it.</v>

2572
01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though it is</v>

2573
01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.680
<v Speaker 2>select site in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that is six assignment from a </v>

2574
01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:49.980
<v Speaker 2>bloodline of merlin and sherlock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2575

<v Speaker 2>Real estate.</v>

2576
01:56:52.230 --> 01:56:54.120
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just liked that.</v>

2577
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2578
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the mystery.</v>

2579
01:56:56.850 --> 01:57:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I do too because you can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably saying,</v>

2580
01:57:00.821 --> 01:57:02.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

2581

<v Speaker 2>interesting and yet you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2584
01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:12.720
<v Speaker 2>it's always better to be interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested instead of interesting.</v>

2585
01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
