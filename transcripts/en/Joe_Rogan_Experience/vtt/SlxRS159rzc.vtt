00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.111
<v Speaker 1>Try My day,</v>

2
00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Well they a Khabib and Tony are going to fight again though,</v>

4
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:07.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Aren't they totally wants to do to the culture.</v>

6
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing that makes a bead might not be able to make that weight,</v>

7
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>that and,</v>

8
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

9
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>since Kelvin Ms,</v>

10
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.040
<v Speaker 1>wait a couple of times and Dana forced him to find it.</v>

11
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>One 85 and I mean,</v>

12
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense that Dana goes,</v>

13
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:21.811
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

14
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>you got to do one 70 at least once or twice,</v>

15
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>but miss,</v>

16
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>we'll go up in weight to fight him.</v>

17
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>he only missed weight once.</v>

19
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Twice,</v>

20
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.161
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

21
00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:30.521
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

22
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>

23
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Tonia huge against,</v>

24
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

25
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.281
<v Speaker 1>he's tall,</v>

26
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.114
<v Speaker 1>but he's not,</v>

27
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>how tall is he?</v>

28
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.221
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

29
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Tony is like five ten five 11 Tony's bill perfect for the division.</v>

30
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>He's torn.</v>

31
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.001
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

32
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>he's got a lot of muscle.</v>

33
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Even though he's long.</v>

34
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>He's very strong.</v>

35
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>He's excellent in the clinch.</v>

36
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I was looking forward to that fight so much.</v>

37
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.133
<v Speaker 1>My heart,</v>

38
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>how big it could be.</v>

39
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>It could be got a huge frame.</v>

40
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a tank.</v>

41
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.181
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

42
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have a nutritionist.</v>

43
00:00:58.531 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't talk.</v>

44
00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.551
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

45
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not being professionals.</v>

46
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 1>He's thick.</v>

47
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Could you hear what Tony Tony to get done when they're like doing media?</v>

49
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And it could be with saying something like why do you get your sunglasses on?</v>

50
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like 27 months.</v>

54
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>That interim title</v>

58
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>fight that has to be made in that division,</v>

59
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

60
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.690
<v Speaker 1>That's [inaudible] tone.</v>

61
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

62
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but if he can't make one 55 can,</v>

63
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>he needs to get real and get a fucking digression and we know what happened to</v>

64
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

65
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>We don't eat Tiramisu the week of,</v>

66
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I know that he did a corn on an bed and Tony even tweet out like for sure when</v>

67
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking eat Tiramisu,</v>

68
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>he really ate Tiramisu.</v>

69
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>That it was on the embedded video.</v>

70
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.623
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

71
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>That's how he smelled it.</v>

72
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

73
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>have fun making weight.</v>

74
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Why are you helping him toughen?</v>

75
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>You have to make that fight and could be,</v>

76
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:02.761
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

77
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

78
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>he's made it before killing himself.</v>

79
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know what happened when he had to go to the fucking hospital.</v>

80
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:12.861
<v Speaker 1>They said he was in massive pain like day Rockhold you're right.</v>

81
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>But Luke Rockhold said something.</v>

82
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>There was some quote that I had read.</v>

83
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

84
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 1>What did,</v>

85
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>see what,</v>

86
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>what they said about what,</v>

87
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:20.551
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>

88
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:21.384
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>bebes corner list as the official issue that was happening to him.</v>

91
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>He was six pounds overweight,</v>

92
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:28.974
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

94
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>When he went to the hospitals.</v>

95
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

96
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>that's huge.</v>

97
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>That's so heavy.</v>

98
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>You're so heavy when your body's your body shutting down,</v>

99
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>like you're six pounds away and your body's shutting down.</v>

100
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>You know that come in the week of the fight.</v>

101
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>But obviously fucked up with his,</v>

103
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>his discipline if he's eating Tiramisu.</v>

105
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.791
<v Speaker 1>If that's true,</v>

106
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>that's even more disappointing.</v>

107
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just had a bite,</v>

108
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>but either way you don't have a,</v>

109
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying it's the answer.</v>

110
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a mic dolce or one of these guys who are helping you with your</v>

111
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:56.911
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

112
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:57.744
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.811
<v Speaker 1>Tony's down.</v>

114
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>They go up and wait to find them.</v>

115
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't do the sense sense for Tony.</v>

116
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense for Tony mean that wants a fight,</v>

117
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:05.321
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

118
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>But for the division,</v>

119
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:07.091
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>

120
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:07.301
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

121
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:07.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>what is it sucks the division.</v>

123
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>What is this guys?</v>

124
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>He puts the entire fights bigger than what the division looks like.</v>

125
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>That fight,</v>

126
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>that fight needs to happen.</v>

127
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.543
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

128
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.001
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

129
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.834
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

130

<v Speaker 1>I have is all this other shit's going on.</v>

149
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>we maybe could have safe drinking.</v>

150
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>He gave him a beer.</v>

151
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.433
<v Speaker 1>This isn't beer.</v>

152
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.230
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

153
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a real bear</v>

154
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>fruit.</v>

155
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Someone gave the Gremlin water after men.</v>

156
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

157
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.330
<v Speaker 1>but Dana was saying was panic.</v>

158
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.593
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

159
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.913

<v Speaker 1>damn it.</v>

163
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I knew that the cow.</v>

164
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.783
<v Speaker 1>I got a coffee.</v>

165
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.171
<v Speaker 1>You can't leave.</v>

166
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>We guy drinking by himself.</v>

167
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>That was the moment the wheels fell off the podcast.</v>

168
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:15.461
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

169
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:15.881
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

170
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:16.714
<v Speaker 1>This is what I read.</v>

171
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Habib wasn't getting any blood to his liver.</v>

172
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

173
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 1>this is what Luke Rockhold says.</v>

174
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

175
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that is fucking real bad.</v>

176
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>So scroll down and let's,</v>

177
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>let's see what Luke Rockhold says.</v>

178
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>The weight cut wasn't going very well.</v>

179
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Khabib was complaining about a pain in his side and we had to cut short the</v>

180
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 1>weight cut and sure enough,</v>

181
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>it gets worse over night and had to go to the hospital.</v>

182
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately this is the fight was really fucking four Bababa.</v>

183
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>

184
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't getting any blood to his liver and something went wrong with his</v>

185
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 1>weight cut.</v>

186
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar to his last fight.</v>

187
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>What I understand and just something went wrong.</v>

188
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>You never know what these weight cuts,</v>

189
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:49.811
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

190
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.280
<v Speaker 1>But I think he's ready to go and we can rebook this.</v>

191
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 1>That what is,</v>

192
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.053
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

193
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

194
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>he's the training partner.</v>

195
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>He's a AK cause to a hundred pounds heavier training partner.</v>

196
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

197
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Well from the same gym.</v>

198
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

199
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean it obviously ain't a hundred pounds.</v>

200
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>He's a big deal to walk around.</v>

201
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 1>That could be,</v>

202
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

203
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.273
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

205
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna miss speak.</v>

206
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I'd assume high seventies yeah.</v>

207
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.621
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it,</v>

208
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

209
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

210
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And he ain't fat.</v>

211
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

212
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>They got to make that fight,</v>

213
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:21.510

<v Speaker 1>That's the fight.</v>

215
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I say that's the Madison ever been when a fight fell through,</v>

216
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>like when John and a jail thing.</v>

217
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I really wasn't that math.</v>

218
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>There's been other fights.</v>

219
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.780
