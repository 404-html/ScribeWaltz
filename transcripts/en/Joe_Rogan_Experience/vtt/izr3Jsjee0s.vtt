00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.873
Right Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.290
Bobcat Goldthwait and better known as Bob Bob's here and Barry Crimmins.

3
00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:06.190
Thank you very much for coming.

4
00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:06.491
I really,

5
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:07.324
really appreciate it.

6
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.261
It's great to be here.

7
00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:09.220
Where are the drugs?

8
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.420
We got a lot of stuff,

9
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.190
but I'm mostly a pot guy,

10
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.090
so if you want that,

11
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:13.691
we got that.

12
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:15.910
But we got plenty of alcohol.

13
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.930
I know you enjoy that,

14
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:17.500
sir.

15
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.251
When I was a kid,

16
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.770
my first started doing stand up,

17
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.501
I,

18
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:25.360
you would go on stage and you would pull a Budweiser out of your blazer that was

19
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:26.194
part of your,

20
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.320
<v 1>you're jazz open where I'd walk out smoking a cigarette and then pull a beer out</v>

21
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.290
and take a big chunk of it as a kind of a health nut.

22
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.533
That was the open,

23
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.410
<v 0>you know,</v>

24
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.540
uh,

25
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.831
it was,

26
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:37.250
uh,

27
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.260
a very fortuitous,

28
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.193
um,

29
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.210
just amazing situation to be starting out and stand up in 1988 in Boston who was

30
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:49.370
such an incredible spot to be in.

31
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.540
Just total dumb luck where I decided to do an open mic night.

32
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.010
Dumb luck got me there.

33
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.761
Yeah.

34
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:56.201
Dumb luck.

35
00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:56.931
Got You there.

36
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:58.880
But for folks who don't know,

37
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.630
you were one of the reasons why Boston became what it was and you and the,

38
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.220
the community that you sort of established at the Ding Ho was the legendary

39
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:10.671
community.

40
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.020
When I came along it was already gone.

41
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:12.231
Right.

42
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:12.770
When did it,

43
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.603
when did it end?

44
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.000
<v 1>Around 83 84 something like that.</v>

45
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.460
And then I went to stitches and try to maintain that.

46
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:21.294
But then,

47
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.691
you know,

48
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:21.930
I've,

49
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.320
I,

50
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.300
I mainly be became a comedy producer to get stage time and knew other comics

51
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:30.960
needed state and also new comics needed to be treated like someone when they

52
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:32.130
walked into a joint,

53
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.600
cause I'd been around the country and been treated like shit,

54
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:35.434
just stand in line.

55
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.160
You know,

56
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.210
you have 12 hours since you've got an align and you get on for three minutes and

57
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.430
then they tell you you can't come back for three weeks.

58
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:44.460
And it's like well I fucking hitchhiked here and you know,

59
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.470
just camping out to do comedy and now I can come back in three weeks.

60
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.310
Thanks.

61
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.460
And it's something gruff shit head with a clip board who was nasty.

62
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:54.950
So anybody that walked in the doing,

63
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:57.540
I tried to make sure they were treated well and given a fair chance.

64
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.060
And the thoughts that when we put our shows together,

65
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.210
people who feel like there's somebody,

66
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.280
you're going to act like there's somebody and they're going to do a good job.

67
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:05.701
And I,

68
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:06.061
you know,

69
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:06.894
I took it,

70
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.990
the proof is a remarkable amount of great talent that came out with her

71
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.320
phenomenal amount.

72
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:13.531
I mean,

73
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.364
it's bond.

74
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.110
<v 2>Oh,</v>

75
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.230
I,

76
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.400
oh,

77
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.233
is uh,

78
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.530
just naming the open Mike Comedians,

79
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.400
all the,

80
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.180
all the greats.

81
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.950
He's still remember Lenny to lose it.

82
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.813
Yeah.

83
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.290
Charlotte Gallo do.

84
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.790
I was like,

85
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:28.250
I always,

86
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.440
yeah,

87
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.130
Nicole.

88
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.760
Oh yeah.

89
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.510
And uh,

90
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.300
I remember up his arms when he taught what he did,

91
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.000
his act,

92
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.170
he didn't,

93
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.670
you know,

94
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.300
like it was like he's doing his act and um,

95
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.450
the crowd was kind of a really terrible thing where the crowd will be listening.

96
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.440
Well,

97
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.273
yeah,

98
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.153
I doubt it.

99
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.490
But,

100
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.970
so the crowd that,

101
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:50.130
this really evil thing,

102
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:51.780
when that Barry's hosting this open,

103
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:52.200
Mike,

104
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.100
I don't know if you remember this,

105
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:57.360
and then they start laughing at him instead of with him.

106
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:00.310
And he thinks he's killing in the crowd's going is very

107
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 3>evil and very data.</v>

108
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:05.290
So he's having the set of his life not knowing that they're making fun of them.

109
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.410
Barry,

110
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.670
it was upset by this and he's like down on the crane,

111
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.450
walks out on stage.

112
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.090
She goes,

113
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.050
I know what you're doing.

114
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.450
I would just stop if it's not nice.

115
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.623
And

116
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.920
Barry get off this page because it's the first time.

117
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.900
It gets to the point where Barry is,

118
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.040
he varies laying on the stage going,

119
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:27.731
all right John,

120
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.170
tell your last joke ever at the day,

121
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.500
how was your last job ever?

122
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.270
So yeah,

123
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.390
so there was a problem with those kinds of stresses when they get those lefts,

124
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.140
those guys are going to stay in the business like four extra years just based on

125
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.640
that one night because that one set,

126
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.070
yeah,

127
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.180
<v 0>there was a set at the comedy store with Joey Diaz went behind the stage.</v>

128
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.300
There was a curtain and the original room at the comedy store and there's this

129
00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:51.560
woman who was on stage who's just,

130
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.090
she's whatever.

131
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.110
She doesn't have the gene,

132
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.973
it's just doesn't exist.

133
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.290
But she kept trying.

134
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.700
She was always there and it was one of those things where she would go on stage

135
00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:01.580
like midnight or something like that and she would mostly clear the room.

136
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.510
Um,

137
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.040
but she's on stage and Julie goes backstage behind the curtain and when she hits

138
00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:07.874
her punchlines,

139
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.550
he would open the curtain up and his pants would be down.

140
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.433
So

141
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.000
they didn't know Joey's 300 pounds at this giant.

142
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:17.340
God,

143
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.173
it's hilarious.

144
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.880
So every time she hits her punchline,

145
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.870
he opens a curtain and she's smashing it as,

146
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:24.890
as the set goes on,

147
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.140
she gets more and more confident because she starts,

148
00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:28.610
she starts to Strut a little bit.

149
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.340
Finally an audience gets my humor and she's fucking killing.

150
00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:34.551
I mean,

151
00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:35.384
every car.

152
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.120
And the next time she went on stage,

153
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.780
she bombed and she chastised the audience,

154
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.200
right.

155
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.490
Telling them that this stuff killed blast.

156
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.281
And we were like,

157
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:46.761
fuck.

158
00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:47.720
She'll never know.

159
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.900
Ever catch on.

160
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.731
Did anyone every time?

161
00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:50.600
I believe so.

162
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.591
As far as I know,

163
00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:52.424
no.

164
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.340
And if you told us you would never believe you anyway,

165
00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:56.174
she'd just put it

166
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.420
<v 3>yeah.</v>

167
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.570
Folder in the back of her head.

168
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.011
The thing,

169
00:04:58.011 --> 00:04:58.311
you know,

170
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.680
that that same thing that keeps us going.

171
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.903
What is that?

172
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.421
You know,

173
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:04.690
and there's folks that never

174
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.350
<v 0>done well and they keep going.</v>

175
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.590
Well that was that open mic night thing where people get the phantom laughs

176
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.220
would hear Phantom Lounge.

177
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.493
I was pretty good.

178
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.330
<v 3>Well I'm not even to this day,</v>

179
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.680
I,

180
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.180
this is the thing that kills me at this kids,

181
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.241
you know,

182
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:20.074
they,

183
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.720
they find out about you and they want to and they,

184
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.250
oh thanks for what you did for comedy here.

185
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:29.020
I'm going to send you my latest set and it's them bombing in front of four

186
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:30.820
people in the fucking pizza shop.

187
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.511
And they say,

188
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:32.440
what do you think of this?

189
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:32.741
I said,

190
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:37.741
I think whatever money you have used to buy this up and destroy it,

191
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.820
are you fucking crazy?

192
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.320
Just sucks.

193
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.310
And you and you and you and you and you have a mortalized it w you know,

194
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.350
don't put shitty sets on.

195
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.681
You know,

196
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.341
and by the way,

197
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:48.880
kids,

198
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.370
when you walk on the stage and no one knows who the fuck yards,

199
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.230
how about opening with a joke instead of go,

200
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:53.621
hi,

201
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.560
how are you feeling?

202
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.040
Like that golden moment when you can fucking take the stage

203
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.210
<v 2>and get somewhere with them,</v>

204
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.360
go whoa.

205
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.251
Like wow.

206
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:02.570
How did you think of that opening?

207
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.020
How about saying something funny and that's maybe pertinent to where you are

208
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.940
that shows you on the same planet as the audience.

209
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:08.150
What?

210
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.170
You're the funny guy.

211
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.850
That's why you're walking on the stage.

212
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.713
Just a suggestion.

213
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.750
Well Boston has a very low tolerance for fucking meandering on steroids.

214
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:18.050
No.

215
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.351
Yeah,

216
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:18.740
it was.

217
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.220
You had,

218
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.780
he didn't have a grace period.

219
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:21.770
As soon as he came out.

220
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.260
I think this is the best place to develop because of that.

221
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:27.530
Because you had to come out guns blazing and he would learn everything else

222
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.131
afterwards.

223
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:30.520
But you had to get them and if you lost him,

224
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:33.350
like very few people would start bombing in Boston.

225
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.184
And recover,

226
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.990
like there was very little recovery.

227
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.763
It's like if you,

228
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.900
if you've got lit on fire moments,

229
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.530
I mean,

230
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.950
you could do,

231
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.420
I would do it for fun just to see like,

232
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:45.200
let's see,

233
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.650
feel it.

234
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.880
We can get out of today.

235
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.710
Cut Man in the corner.

236
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.870
I think I did that subconsciously,

237
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:52.310
but it was just shitty planning,

238
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.850
you know,

239
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.260
that's what it turned out to be.

240
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:54.981
But yeah,

241
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:55.581
it wasn't like that.

242
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.420
It was going poorly.

243
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:57.650
And then he really pulled it up.

244
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.110
It doesn't happen.

245
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:01.010
It never happens.

246
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.031
Not In Boston,

247
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.361
man.

248
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:04.040
Am I enjoying this interview after,

249
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:04.874
uh,

250
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.361
you know,

251
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:06.680
two straight weeks of like,

252
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:08.930
can we get up and talk about yourself all day?

253
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.233
We were talking,

254
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.611
it's,

255
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:10.791
you know,

256
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:11.700
the nature of the movie.

257
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.610
Oh,

258
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.151
I've done it.

259
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:16.430
I've led us into a fucking moron.

260
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.273
Don't worry about it.

261
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.243
We'll be fine.

262
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.910
Chip Monck I can give you an example.

263
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:23.810
So you know the movie it's called call me lucky.

264
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.523
Oh,

265
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.360
get them some paper towels,

266
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.580
Jim.

267
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.170
Sorry.

268
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.003
No worries.

269
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:31.760
Sorry.

270
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.521
So yeah,

271
00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:35.630
a little reminder of my visit Joe fresh beer.

272
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.521
It's what happens.

273
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:36.980
So,

274
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.813
um,

275
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.140
yeah,

276
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.870
so call me like he really doesn't want to talk about it and he's pouring beer

277
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:44.870
over duty now we can and we can get to it eventually.

278
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:47.390
I can tell you give examples of what went horribly wrong.

279
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:47.811
You know what I mean?

280
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:50.990
It's like we're doing those satellite things and it's like you're talking to

281
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:52.640
Tate and tea bag in El Paso

282
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.470
and so he's like,

283
00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.733
it says,

284
00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.470
you know,

285
00:07:59.470 --> 00:07:59.901
cause it's,

286
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:00.260
you know,

287
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.260
the movie deals with buried talking and dealing with and surviving childhood

288
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:07.020
rapes,

289
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.390
rapes.

290
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:07.611
You know,

291
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:10.090
when he was four and you could tell these guys,

292
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:10.360
they're like,

293
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.450
well we talking about rape,

294
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:12.141
but you know,

295
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:13.310
were never serious.

296
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:13.840
You know,

297
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.190
was really creepy.

298
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.100
Fucking idiots.

299
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.210
It was a word.

300
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:18.260
Some people are just not,

301
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.550
they just whatever,

302
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.190
they can't talk and make it funny in the morning.

303
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.120
Yeah.

304
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.590
They just can't navigate anything that's complicated or serious or nuanced or

305
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.200
really sensitive emotionally.

306
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:33.560
It's just some people just don't have the capacity that they shouldn't.

307
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:33.891
You know,

308
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:35.240
Ryan Seacrest cave,

309
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:36.830
you're doing a fucking interview with Ryan Seacrest

310
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.060
call,

311
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.700
are you like,

312
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.190
yeah.

313
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.470
What's your favorite color light?

314
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:42.730
Three this must really,

315
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.690
I is perfect for that.

316
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.460
I'm,

317
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.430
I'm just kind of in awe of someone like him with an empire because it,

318
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.383
I mean,

319
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.500
I don't know what he does.

320
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.930
I mean negative

321
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.760
<v 4>home,</v>

322
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.640
he found a home that secretaries tune into.

323
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:02.910
It's like a whistle that dogs can hear and he hit.

324
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:03.744
That

325
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.880
was like a drone.

326
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.010
It never goes too high and it never goes too low.

327
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.941
He never says,

328
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:10.320
fuck this world.

329
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:11.940
What are we doing without never.

330
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.261
Yeah.

331
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:17.220
He's not threatening to old ladies radio show in the law.

332
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:17.910
Yes.

333
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.481
Radio shows.

334
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:19.290
Amazing.

335
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.820
Really for all the wrong reasons.

336
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.350
I mean,

337
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.590
he's not a bad guy by the way.

338
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:23.424
I've met him,

339
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.510
did his old show.

340
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.440
He asked to be

341
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.750
nice to say that they'd be a Commie Pbi.

342
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.710
He's a nice guy.

343
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:32.821
Yeah.

344
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:33.654
He has to be.

345
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.770
I'm funny,

346
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:36.100
I can afford to be an ass,

347
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.820
but he's got that market covered.

348
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:45.540
That bland white guy always wears a suit market cornered,

349
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.523
you know,

350
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.953
nail it.

351
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.300
It doesn't bother me.

352
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:50.101
It doesn't cause,

353
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:50.240
you know,

354
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.140
did God bless American people think like I hate like the American idol and all

355
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:55.974
that stuff.

356
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.910
I didn't really,

357
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.110
I never really cared about it,

358
00:09:58.111 --> 00:09:58.610
you know,

359
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.610
cause God bless America.

360
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:00.721
You move.

361
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:01.710
It was fucking awesome.

362
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.341
Well thanks.

363
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:05.070
Thanks and ruthless and just ridiculous.

364
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:09.270
I watched it on a plane and there's one point in time I had a fucking like do

365
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:10.170
this with my earphones

366
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.440
earphones off to talk to you.

367
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.680
This one hits the planes.

368
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.890
I saw it,

369
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.750
I saw last night,

370
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.890
meaning someone leaning over and there's a baby getting shot with a shotgun.

371
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.180
So crazy fucking movie.

372
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.613
But you,

373
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.101
you know,

374
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:31.650
you've got a point and then you went for it.

375
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.710
I like to say it's a violent movie about kindness,

376
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.390
you know,

377
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.151
it really is.

378
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:39.060
I mean that's all that Joel's character wants his people to act.

379
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:39.390
Right,

380
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:39.810
right.

381
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.100
Yeah.

382
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.910
And it's not,

383
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.190
you know,

384
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.120
I don't even agree with,

385
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.550
I agree with about 90% of the things that he's mad about.

386
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.383
But you know,

387
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.270
because clearly wouldn't work.

388
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.590
It's not a good plan.

389
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.190
When I came up in Boston,

390
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.360
what I was going to say,

391
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:55.171
what I was talking about.

392
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:57.240
You get on stage with the beer bottles,

393
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:57.930
you will,

394
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.763
you,

395
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.310
you had this thing that you represented when you would go on stage.

396
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.320
This is a guy who stood for something,

397
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.221
you know,

398
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:06.690
and a lot of people didn't,

399
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:06.961
you know,

400
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:11.460
and I didn't know we were all just kids and finding your way on the stage first

401
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:13.140
that I was forced to.

402
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.711
I'm sure.

403
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:15.390
I mean no need to qualify it,

404
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:16.224
but it was,

405
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:16.980
it was,

406
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.610
there was a very distinctive feeling,

407
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.560
very distinct feeling when you got on stage.

408
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:24.660
Like this was a serious person.

409
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.870
This is a guy who was a standup comedian and a very funny person,

410
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:29.970
but it was a guy stands for shit.

411
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:30.410
The weights,

412
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.900
this is,

413
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.500
this is,

414
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.500
this is what's right and this is what's wrong and when Shit's wrong,

415
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.970
you pointed out and you know I followed your career through the time you did

416
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:39.630
that.

417
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.410
It was like a set at the problem I think with Randy credico and who else was on

418
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:43.980
it with you?

419
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.813
Which one?

420
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.391
There was a,

421
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:49.380
you guys had did the whole political parties.

422
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.383
Yeah.

423
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:50.671
Oh,

424
00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:52.120
critical tingle when tango,

425
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.010
was

426
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.843
<v 1>it just you three?</v>

427
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.150
No,

428
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.290
there were several other people.

429
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:58.810
Bev Mickens and I'm blanking

430
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.530
<v 2>because know like,</v>

431
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.100
yeah,

432
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:01.940
you've done so

433
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.850
I'm going to Nicaragua to do comedy.

434
00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:06.590
I'm like,

435
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.423
who books that?

436
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.540
Boston comedy [inaudible] the Sandinista Gig actually.

437
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.170
Billy Downs involved.

438
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.070
No.

439
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:16.420
Yeah,

440
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.253
we got paid,

441
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:21.601
<v 0>you know,</v>

442
00:12:21.601 --> 00:12:23.570
to me and I think know it was,

443
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.210
it was reflective of the way guys were speaking about you,

444
00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:27.540
uh,

445
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.310
in the documentary that's,

446
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.380
you were an important part of that comedy community because you were,

447
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.620
you know,

448
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.270
I think comedy communities are only as strong as the strongest link.

449
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:39.661
You know,

450
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:41.280
you could say they're only as weak as the weakest link,

451
00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:43.680
but not really in comedy because it's always going to be open.

452
00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:44.101
Miker is,

453
00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:45.030
and they essentially,

454
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.381
there's a,

455
00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:48.960
there's a weird thing like you're not a comic until you're getting paid,

456
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:50.640
but kind of they're all comics.

457
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.030
Yeah.

458
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.700
We all were open mackers and aspiring,

459
00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:54.260
whatever,

460
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:54.560
you know,

461
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.090
whatever distinction you want to put in the beginning of it.

462
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.480
But the strongest member of the community is really where the community lies.

463
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:03.870
And that's where,

464
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.130
that's where the standards are set.

465
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.080
And so you were very,

466
00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:09.450
very important guy to me when I was coming up

467
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.161
<v 1>Gel.</v>

468
00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:10.880
That means a lot.

469
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.350
It means a lot to me.

470
00:13:12.351 --> 00:13:14.450
I wasn't thinking,

471
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.540
I mean,

472
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:15.730
I,

473
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.590
I mean that,

474
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.350
those slots I didn't really crystallized.

475
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.380
It was just trying to do what was right and I was trying to do what I wanted to

476
00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:23.240
be in the situation that,

477
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.260
you know,

478
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:28.970
I wanted to provide the situation that I want it to be on myself and,

479
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.480
and I,

480
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.410
and I was immediately rewarded for that with who came in and the blossoming of

481
00:13:33.411 --> 00:13:34.221
all that talent.

482
00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:34.881
It worked.

483
00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:37.730
It was great and we hadn't really nice.

484
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.440
We had a really nice run sometimes,

485
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.221
like I don't want to,

486
00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:40.521
you know,

487
00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:42.030
we've done it enough thing whole reunion is,

488
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.630
it's like going to your little league Rian and well where we're really good

489
00:13:44.631 --> 00:13:44.871
team,

490
00:13:44.871 --> 00:13:46.550
but we didn't even win the fucking championship,

491
00:13:46.551 --> 00:13:46.851
you know?

492
00:13:46.851 --> 00:13:47.480
But,

493
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.170
but it's great seeing all those people now and then and whatever.

494
00:13:51.171 --> 00:13:52.160
But we really,

495
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.020
uh,

496
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.853
uh,

497
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.201
you know,

498
00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:54.770
we,

499
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.390
we really did it together.

500
00:13:56.391 --> 00:13:59.240
It was just a matter of just providing this sort of one opportunity.

501
00:13:59.241 --> 00:14:02.420
And then as far I did the same thing I want everybody else to do.

502
00:14:02.421 --> 00:14:06.650
I developed at what I was good at when I was good at was talking about what was

503
00:14:06.651 --> 00:14:07.430
going on.

504
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.750
<v 2>What was your first time meeting him?</v>

505
00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:09.740
Were you nervous?

506
00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:11.450
Was I never met him.

507
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:11.791
Did you,

508
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:13.450
did you see him or did you hear about them?

509
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.530
I got the fuck out of the way.

510
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.953
Maybe

511
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.600
you and I knew what you were doing.

512
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.860
I would like it never ends.

513
00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:28.694
I'm on your show

514
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.061
<v 1>either,</v>

515
00:14:29.061 --> 00:14:29.894
whether if like,

516
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:30.231
you know,

517
00:14:30.231 --> 00:14:31.580
and I know I get to tell the truth here,

518
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.030
I know what you were doing and I saw the spark there and then I heard what else

519
00:14:35.031 --> 00:14:35.621
you were doing along.

520
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:35.990
I'm like,

521
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.990
oh now Joe's found and you know exactly what I'm talking about cause you fucking

522
00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:42.111
do it brother.

523
00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:42.980
You do it.

524
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.380
You found what you're supposed to be talking about.

525
00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:48.500
You found what you're supposed to be illuminating people about and then you find

526
00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:50.110
a way to become true,

527
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.290
tremendous it.

528
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.153
And I couldn't be

529
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.860
<v 3>happier that I played a little role in providing,</v>

530
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:59.420
helping to create stage time in a scene somewhere where somebody like you came

531
00:14:59.421 --> 00:14:59.661
out of.

532
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:00.411
So thanks man.

533
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:01.244
You did great.

534
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:01.870
Thank you.

535
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.660
You definitely did.

536
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.680
But that fear you have,

537
00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:05.690
you're talking about never went away.

538
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.780
I would have an HBO special and the phone would be ringing and I go,

539
00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:10.640
that's fucking criminals.

540
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.580
And I know it's always you want,

541
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:14.570
but you might actually say,

542
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:15.351
you would like go,

543
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:15.621
hey,

544
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:17.210
you made a really good point here.

545
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:18.340
Why the fuck you pick it up?

546
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.000
Bruce Willis,

547
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.833
he's

548
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.360
just like,

549
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.630
go down the line.

550
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.081
And I go,

551
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:24.641
okay.

552
00:15:24.641 --> 00:15:25.920
I'd be like back and forth.

553
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:26.780
Well,

554
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.090
I felt that last night when he came up to me after my set,

555
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:29.421
I was like,

556
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:30.850
thank God I didn't know he was in the room.

557
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.500
He came on right when I got off stage of like,

558
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.250
Whoa,

559
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.180
I bridge that bullet.

560
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:39.110
Every movie I make too.

561
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:39.470
I'm like,

562
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.631
Oh,

563
00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:40.464
I hope he likes it.

564
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.541
Oh man,

565
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:43.040
I really liked the new one.

566
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:45.920
Now,

567
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.753
um,

568
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.740
when did you know,

569
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.220
when did you find out about what we're doing this live on the year.

570
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.110
Did you see the New Yorker piece today?

571
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.070
Uh,

572
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:55.430
no.

573
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.600
No fucking shit.

574
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:57.560
Is it a Valentine?

575
00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.960
The New Yorker and not that tiny piece.

576
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:02.150
I'm thinking if you get a little blurb and the New York,

577
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:03.200
are you doing it anyway?

578
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.850
So I'm pretty good mood.

579
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.940
I just wish I had my kettle drum with me so I could play it down.

580
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:08.610
Doing Dean Don,

581
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.360
Don,

582
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.710
Don,

583
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.101
Don,

584
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:10.491
Don,

585
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:10.701
Don,

586
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:10.851
Don,

587
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:11.031
Don,

588
00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:11.271
Don,

589
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:11.661
Don,

590
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:13.820
Don Know Yorker don't they don't done,

591
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.050
he went to kettle drum.

592
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:15.884
That's nice.

593
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.110
Like Henny Youngman.

594
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.500
Oh okay.

595
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.023
Good evening.

596
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.220
I'm just thinking like those Jamaican guys.

597
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.890
But that's like a dope kettle drums.

598
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:24.761
Yeah,

599
00:16:24.761 --> 00:16:27.650
that's been done in the dean dome.

600
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.010
Dawn.

601
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:28.843
Dawn.

602
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.680
That'd be nice surprise for me.

603
00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:32.000
Someone could surprise me with the,

604
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.013
you know,

605
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.390
starting to happen when he made it.

606
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.471
Maybe.

607
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:36.741
Maybe.

608
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:37.430
We never know,

609
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.870
depending if we do well in a word season doing [inaudible] saying.

610
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.150
When did you find out about the traumatic history?

611
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:45.810
When did you find out about the childhood rape,

612
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.870
which was a major part of it.

613
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.120
You didn't reveal it until about an hour into the film.

614
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.190
The idea isn't like a spoiler alert thing or anything.

615
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:55.610
It was,

616
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.000
I wanted people to and when we will be allowed under the theater at the 30

617
00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.933
minute,

618
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.110
cause tonally I give clues that somethings coming.

619
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.533
Uh,

620
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.301
and you know,

621
00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:07.760
he talks about some things so you can tell and other people do.

622
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:08.870
But I,

623
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:09.411
I,

624
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:09.860
uh,

625
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.220
I,

626
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.491
you know,

627
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:13.130
I get it a little weird if people think that I was trying to manipulate him,

628
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:14.300
I wanted people to meet him,

629
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:16.520
know who he was it so they can empathize.

630
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.870
I wouldn't say manipulate.

631
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.640
I would say you set it up beautifully.

632
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:20.510
Sounds great.

633
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.850
It was,

634
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:21.200
it was,

635
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.460
it was very compelling,

636
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:23.294
captivating.

637
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.231
But you know,

638
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:28.250
knowing Barry and knowing about the story because of,

639
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:29.180
you were telling me about,

640
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.300
I didn't had no idea.

641
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.340
No one had any idea.

642
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.600
He told me before he went to the judiciary,

643
00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:36.620
a Senate hearing.

644
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.473
Um,

645
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.720
well I told you before I,

646
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.170
yeah.

647
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.040
In public at all.

648
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.520
Yeah.

649
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:40.981
And,

650
00:17:40.981 --> 00:17:41.721
and yeah,

651
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:44.270
before you did it or talked about it on stage,

652
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:49.650
but he said that he found my reaction was,

653
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.160
what

654
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.993
<v 1>was it like?</v>

655
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.780
He was like,

656
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.420
alright cause I said like,

657
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.990
oh there's a reason you're such a dick.

658
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.893
I was like,

659
00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.760
<v 2>oh I've been betting on this all along cause he's going like everyone's going to</v>

660
00:18:01.761 --> 00:18:02.900
like criminals is an alcoholic.

661
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.180
And it was like he could tell,

662
00:18:05.181 --> 00:18:06.530
I would just use it as coolant,

663
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.393
you know,

664
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.723
turn up missing.

665
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.583
The guys was just like,

666
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.463
you know,

667
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.160
running hot.

668
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.660
I really did hot.

669
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.531
I was always like,

670
00:18:15.531 --> 00:18:16.311
I'm a no man,

671
00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:16.581
you know,

672
00:18:16.581 --> 00:18:17.840
he doesn't have the Werewolf,

673
00:18:17.841 --> 00:18:18.171
you know,

674
00:18:18.171 --> 00:18:20.960
he doesn't like his personality doesn't change.

675
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.910
He stops for long periods.

676
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.073
He just,

677
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.531
you know,

678
00:18:24.531 --> 00:18:25.260
so I knew

679
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.640
<v 1>Twain said when the others drink,</v>

680
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:27.510
I like to help.

681
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.021
And that's,

682
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:28.720
you know,

683
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.321
<v 2>so there was,</v>

684
00:18:29.321 --> 00:18:33.790
so there's this anger and pain and my friend that I knew for all these years and

685
00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:34.541
when he told me,

686
00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:35.980
it wasn't like,

687
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.000
I just was like,

688
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.960
oh I was kind of an awful relief I would say would be your response.

689
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.430
Yeah,

690
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.890
I was,

691
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:42.131
yeah.

692
00:18:42.131 --> 00:18:42.580
I was like,

693
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:42.851
Oh,

694
00:18:42.851 --> 00:18:43.100
you know,

695
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.600
inside.

696
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:43.991
I'm like,

697
00:18:43.991 --> 00:18:44.860
and then I went into panic.

698
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.381
<v 1>I'm going to go,</v>

699
00:18:45.381 --> 00:18:45.561
well,

700
00:18:45.561 --> 00:18:46.490
what do I do now?

701
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:47.990
And then I thought,

702
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.973
oh,

703
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.600
maybe I won't talk.

704
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.670
Let them talk.

705
00:18:52.671 --> 00:18:53.100
And that's,

706
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.530
and that's what a point is.

707
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.710
It comes out in the film and people,

708
00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.340
I would be telling friends about it and they would be saying to me,

709
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.500
what have you talked to anyone about this?

710
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.280
Yeah.

711
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.571
<v 2>Fuck,</v>

712
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:05.510
I thought I was talking to you,

713
00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:05.871
man.

714
00:19:05.871 --> 00:19:06.210
You know,

715
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.043
I guess not.

716
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.240
Oh,

717
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.040
I gotta go pay somebody $200 to be put up pharmaceutical dry ice.

718
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.830
So until I stopped talking about it,

719
00:19:12.831 --> 00:19:13.611
that's your plan,

720
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:14.030
right?

721
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.421
Well listen,

722
00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:14.841
shit head.

723
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:16.160
I'm going to keep talking about it and not to you.

724
00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:16.880
Goodbye.

725
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.211
You know?

726
00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:17.910
Thank you for help for helping

727
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.170
<v 1>me edit my friends list.</v>

728
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.341
This guy,

729
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:21.174
listen,

730
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.320
you've been living in upstate New York for how long now?

731
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.910
About the last 10 to a no fee for this millennium.

732
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.330
What,

733
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.220
what made you decide to go up there now?

734
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.150
What is the Internet and I can do anything.

735
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.170
I can do what I want.

736
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:37.411
I,

737
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:37.820
yeah,

738
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.130
yeah.

739
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.110
And if I have to go work or appear somewhere,

740
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:41.070
I've got to go to an airport.

741
00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:44.850
So I go to Rochester Ethica or you know Elmira or wherever.

742
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.500
But I get to sit there.

743
00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:47.480
It's so peaceful.

744
00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.750
So I hope you come visit me.

745
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:50.910
Joe loves this really fucking tremendous.

746
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:51.300
They're far away.

747
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.430
Is it from New York City or from four and a half.

748
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:54.001
Five hours.

749
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:55.050
So that's how you do it.

750
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:57.330
You'd fly in New York and you fly in a flyer or a drive.

751
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.910
I don't mind driving there sometimes cause it's sort of,

752
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.290
you kind of get in game mode and you get out of game mode on the way back.

753
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.730
So I like that.

754
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.260
But my house is like,

755
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.900
I finally have the ideal place to do some acids.

756
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.900
So Ah,

757
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.331
yeah,

758
00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:14.190
the parents are the parents come home,

759
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:15.024
they're me,

760
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.350
not la.

761
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.880
And then I gave it to get good at.

762
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.570
I said I here fucking terrible.

763
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.433
It's awful.

764
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.370
Goddamn government.

765
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.211
I mean,

766
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:24.660
you know,

767
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.800
for Christ's say it.

768
00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:26.690
Well you do that.

769
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.900
I think they figured out too many people got smart after that sort of came

770
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:31.290
through.

771
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:31.411
Oh,

772
00:20:31.411 --> 00:20:32.101
they certainly did.

773
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:34.110
I mean the 1970s this sweeping act,

774
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.531
the,

775
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:36.240
when they made all the psychedelics are illegal.

776
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:37.920
They made stuff that wasn't even psychoactive,

777
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:38.670
illegal.

778
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.030
They just tried to make everything illegal.

779
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.450
They just didn't want anybody experimenting with anything that's going to make

780
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:43.740
another 10 Timothy leary,

781
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.070
my,

782
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.330
my friend Tim Walco.

783
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:47.070
So about cocaine is how I feel.

784
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.093
It's like,

785
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.370
<v 2>you know,</v>

786
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.090
I don't like to do it.

787
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.930
I don't like to stay up.

788
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.651
I don't do coke.

789
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:53.110
I don't like to stay up late and complain about my little league coach.

790
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.063
So,

791
00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.080
and I was never a coke guy and you know,

792
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:57.040
in Boston was bad.

793
00:20:57.041 --> 00:20:58.120
I was in the coke guy.

794
00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:59.260
But I used to say to people,

795
00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:00.100
if you want to get high,

796
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:00.934
I get some acid.

797
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.511
You know,

798
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:04.150
and see if we're looking for the dealer at at midnight,

799
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.000
know little drug pocket in my jeans,

800
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.270
pull out another 10 hits if we need them,

801
00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:10.540
you know,

802
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.220
but we don't and you won't

803
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.980
get fucking high,

804
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.461
you know.

805
00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:16.294
And that's the thing,

806
00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.120
my only acid experience as well.

807
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:24.010
It was when I was a total mess and I take drinking and taking other drugs at the

808
00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:24.844
same time.

809
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.110
So then you wake up,

810
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:27.880
well I didn't wake up,

811
00:21:27.881 --> 00:21:31.240
I had just beat the alcohol and Coke wore off in jail.

812
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.830
In the Watertown jail.

813
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.693
Oh Man,

814
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.800
I'm still high water still true.

815
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:36.863
Yes.

816
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.433
And I remember,

817
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.840
I remember like this,

818
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.300
I thought it was the wall or I don't know,

819
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:44.700
I just saw this thing going,

820
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.853
you're going

821
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:47.803
PPP,

822
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.270
the three stooges or the next cell.

823
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.150
That's what it was like.

824
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:53.140
I figured it out later on.

825
00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:54.640
It was some dude was snoring,

826
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.320
but I was convinced it was cause you were tripping but,

827
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.580
but,

828
00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:58.770
but,

829
00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:58.960
but,

830
00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.370
but,

831
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.770
but it could have went on five minutes or an hour,

832
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:03.400
I'm not sure.

833
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.370
But I remember looking at this thing on the wall.

834
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:07.071
<v 0>Oh,</v>

835
00:22:07.071 --> 00:22:10.100
psychedelic drugs definitely make you interpret sounds in a strange way.

836
00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.090
That's why those,

837
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.420
uh,

838
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.350
South American showman and have those songs they sing while you take Iowasca.

839
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:15.830
Yeah.

840
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.820
The whole idea behind it.

841
00:22:16.821 --> 00:22:18.890
I've never taken Iowasca but I've done DMT.

842
00:22:18.891 --> 00:22:19.310
When you do,

843
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.600
which is the same thing.

844
00:22:20.601 --> 00:22:20.920
It's the,

845
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.710
uh,

846
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.700
the active ingredient.

847
00:22:22.701 --> 00:22:24.140
And when you do it with those,

848
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:25.040
those songs,

849
00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:26.750
like you see the songs dance like you.

850
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:27.500
Wow.

851
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:27.981
It's very,

852
00:22:27.981 --> 00:22:29.390
very bizarre and saying,

853
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.890
have you done that with this hunger?

854
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.230
Yeah,

855
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.421
yeah,

856
00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:31.701
yeah.

857
00:22:31.701 --> 00:22:31.871
The,

858
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:33.110
they're called ECO throws.

859
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.040
These South American equals one one experience.

860
00:22:37.041 --> 00:22:40.570
We tripped several times during the night because it's only like a 15 minute

861
00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.390
experience.

862
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.120
So we trip like four or five times during the night to these songs.

863
00:22:44.121 --> 00:22:44.990
But they're,

864
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.873
they're incredible.

865
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.341
And this,

866
00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:47.420
this songs,

867
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:47.731
<v 2>you know,</v>

868
00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:48.001
they're,

869
00:22:48.001 --> 00:22:49.410
they're recorded live

870
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.451
is the guy,

871
00:22:51.451 --> 00:22:52.920
he's been sober for 34 years.

872
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.240
I'm listening to this like,

873
00:22:54.241 --> 00:22:55.320
it's a vacation you took.

874
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.403
Oh,

875
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:00.120
nice.

876
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.130
I keep never going to go to Bora Bora.

877
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.900
Colquitt said to me last year,

878
00:23:03.901 --> 00:23:05.400
I've been sober for 33 years.

879
00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:07.200
I think I'm ready to start dating,

880
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.343
<v 5>I think was wrong.</v>

881
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:14.810
Oh,

882
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.610
just this is,

883
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.720
this is the songs.

884
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.540
This is all recorded in the John Goal.

885
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.070
While these people are deep in the trance of the mother,

886
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.400
and this guy will sing,

887
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.720
this is just him starting an often whistling does a bunch of them,

888
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.980
but they're,

889
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.910
they're beautiful.

890
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.360
I listen to them sometimes when I'm driving in my car and I can almost trip,

891
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.510
cause I remember this

892
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.700
<v 2>variance of being wrong.</v>

893
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:42.060
Hey,

894
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.630
I'll get you a copy over iTunes.

895
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.113
I don't think it,

896
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.951
I bet.

897
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:46.220
Isn't

898
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.053
<v 4>that</v>

899
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.073
<v 6>wow.</v>

900
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.690
I love that guy.

901
00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.310
<v 4>She's here when these geometric patterns are dancing to that sound.</v>

902
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:03.701
Very,

903
00:24:03.701 --> 00:24:04.570
very bizarre.

904
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.470
LSD was my other drug of choice of friends and my drug of choice.

905
00:24:08.471 --> 00:24:10.150
But LSD back in the day,

906
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.021
you know,

907
00:24:11.021 --> 00:24:11.651
let's do some more.

908
00:24:11.651 --> 00:24:13.360
I almost have something figured out.

909
00:24:13.361 --> 00:24:14.490
You almost get to hang,

910
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:14.661
you know,

911
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:15.281
I got to do with it.

912
00:24:15.281 --> 00:24:16.750
Like let's go in there one more time.

913
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:17.020
Yeah.

914
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.853
And I also,

915
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:18.521
and you know what,

916
00:24:18.521 --> 00:24:19.630
I never tell the story,

917
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.130
but I'm thrilled to tell to you,

918
00:24:21.131 --> 00:24:23.200
I was the red Adair of LSD.

919
00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:23.561
You know,

920
00:24:23.561 --> 00:24:25.580
you don't write a dare was he was the guy who jumped,

921
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.660
he'd like parachuted in to put out a oil,

922
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.490
oil Derrick fires.

923
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.361
I don't know who that was.

924
00:24:31.361 --> 00:24:32.280
If you've heard of that expression,

925
00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.160
not a dare.

926
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.030
Red Adair was parachuted in to put up.

927
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:35.480
Yeah,

928
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:35.770
yeah,

929
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:36.011
yeah,

930
00:24:36.011 --> 00:24:36.281
they would.

931
00:24:36.281 --> 00:24:38.380
And he would lead a team and they would go in and they will put out,

932
00:24:38.381 --> 00:24:38.561
yeah,

933
00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:39.131
it look it up,

934
00:24:39.131 --> 00:24:39.550
right it there.

935
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.900
I'm sure you could foil fire.

936
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.351
Yeah,

937
00:24:41.351 --> 00:24:42.540
like oil.

938
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.170
Well at bluff and you go in,

939
00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:46.600
it's like who the fuck is going to go in here and deal with it?

940
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.790
When someone would be bombing out on acid,

941
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.230
I would get the call.

942
00:24:50.231 --> 00:24:51.730
They're bombing out and it's in those days,

943
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:52.361
in the early,

944
00:24:52.361 --> 00:24:52.980
late,

945
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:57.530
early seventies if they bomb out then they could end up going to the doctor or

946
00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.940
hospital or whatever and then suddenly you there blathering.

947
00:25:00.941 --> 00:25:01.211
They don't,

948
00:25:01.211 --> 00:25:02.920
they'll turn in everybody and it's,

949
00:25:02.921 --> 00:25:04.030
nobody's doing anything.

950
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:05.500
We just all got some acid.

951
00:25:05.501 --> 00:25:09.280
One person got the acid but they weren't drug dealer.

952
00:25:09.281 --> 00:25:11.260
They were just the obtain or of the acid,

953
00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:11.471
you know,

954
00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:13.690
but the two gave it to me and that person would,

955
00:25:13.691 --> 00:25:15.550
it could end up in fucking Attica or something.

956
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.290
So I would get these calls from people like they're freaking out and they,

957
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.960
I got this reputation for being good at helping people who are freaking out

958
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.520
doing acid and then we're going to go like,

959
00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:24.761
okay,

960
00:25:24.761 --> 00:25:25.480
what'd they do?

961
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.313
They did these.

962
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.190
How many they do?

963
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.820
They split one.

964
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.331
Give me two.

965
00:25:28.331 --> 00:25:29.290
I gotta get in there quick

966
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.270
and I would get in there and then it would be like a hub.

967
00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:37.240
I'm laughing in a while and like I would do stuff like get me a temple orange,

968
00:25:37.241 --> 00:25:38.051
just get me one,

969
00:25:38.051 --> 00:25:38.321
you know,

970
00:25:38.321 --> 00:25:39.410
like I like to eat days.

971
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:39.881
Wow.

972
00:25:39.881 --> 00:25:40.660
Isn't that.

973
00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.493
See it's okay.

974
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.890
We are on a planet that these things grow from trees.

975
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.600
It's an amazing place.

976
00:25:46.601 --> 00:25:47.331
Put on an l,

977
00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:48.220
but what do you like?

978
00:25:48.221 --> 00:25:48.860
Come on,

979
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.330
loosen a little Joni Mitchell.

980
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:51.164
I see those things.

981
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.330
I know what's freaking you on.

982
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.820
Those hieroglyphics you think are almost words,

983
00:25:54.821 --> 00:25:57.400
but you can't quite read them and you're now you're getting frustrated.

984
00:25:57.401 --> 00:25:57.541
No,

985
00:25:57.541 --> 00:25:58.660
it's just a cool thing.

986
00:25:58.661 --> 00:26:02.740
It's like looking at a beautiful Egyptian crip carbon thing or something.

987
00:26:02.741 --> 00:26:03.040
You,

988
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.930
obviously you can't read Egyptian,

989
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.210
but you kind of get that point they were making.

990
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.200
Don't worry about it.

991
00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:09.310
He'll be out in an hour later.

992
00:26:09.311 --> 00:26:12.310
We're all laughing and the next morning we're at breakfast and it's cool.

993
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.020
But I,

994
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.800
that's when I was in the Red Adair Abella state.

995
00:26:14.801 --> 00:26:16.180
He's freaking out on acid,

996
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.500
like freaking out our mushrooms.

997
00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:17.610
We,

998
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.560
you just trying to control it and you get scared of the experience where it's

999
00:26:20.561 --> 00:26:21.394
taking you.

1000
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.710
I think it's probably maybe a little worse.

1001
00:26:25.711 --> 00:26:26.180
And plus,

1002
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:26.411
I mean,

1003
00:26:26.411 --> 00:26:26.591
you know,

1004
00:26:26.591 --> 00:26:29.380
there was shitty acid out there sometimes a little bit and that wasn't that

1005
00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:29.891
shitty.

1006
00:26:29.891 --> 00:26:30.724
I mean,

1007
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:31.743
uh,

1008
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.800
it's hard to make,

1009
00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:33.070
right?

1010
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.330
You got to get a bunch of stuff.

1011
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:37.320
And then they monitored very still for though is,

1012
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.900
you know,

1013
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.570
to me it was my favorite.

1014
00:26:40.571 --> 00:26:41.404
I,

1015
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.891
you know,

1016
00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:43.060
if I can never get ahold of,

1017
00:26:43.061 --> 00:26:43.471
but I'll do it.

1018
00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:45.600
But Bob calls me and then we'll be a lifelong illness.

1019
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:46.381
The enthusiasts,

1020
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:47.610
like I'm doing it all the time.

1021
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.710
Great credibility to my,

1022
00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.670
in this age of drug and McCarthyism,

1023
00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.220
I'm fucking how many people they ruined just by that day.

1024
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.600
I made you look bad.

1025
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.130
Oh fuck.

1026
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.233
Sorry

1027
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.160
to say it wasn't a lot of guys doing it.

1028
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.440
Shea in Boston,

1029
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.390
you were one of the primary acid enthusiasts.

1030
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:11.660
Well,

1031
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.870
but yeah,

1032
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:13.763
but I was wondering,

1033
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.260
but I mean like by then it was hard to find,

1034
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:17.120
but I would do,

1035
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.380
it was from the 60s it was a big deal.

1036
00:27:19.381 --> 00:27:19.480
Right.

1037
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.313
So it was around,

1038
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:21.880
I was at the,

1039
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.530
in Miami we literally had an oil drum full of yellow sunshine.

1040
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.640
Oh my God.

1041
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:30.960
It was unbelievable how much is dead and the oil's however many a drop.

1042
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:31.740
Right?

1043
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.430
Yeah.

1044
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.450
There was a lot of them.

1045
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:34.600
I mean we just kind of,

1046
00:27:34.601 --> 00:27:35.011
it kind of,

1047
00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:38.310
someone was in some sort of trouble and he needed somewhere to put it and then

1048
00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:39.110
they disappeared.

1049
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.360
I just,

1050
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.430
we sort of inherited it and it was like,

1051
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.493
it's like,

1052
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:43.800
you know,

1053
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.940
I don't know why everybody.

1054
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:48.540
And then everybody just left with like baggies full that aren't even bag he's

1055
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:48.721
done.

1056
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:50.750
But just like fill up your pockets last and,

1057
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.613
and go,

1058
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.351
go home and go.

1059
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:53.940
That was true breakdown.

1060
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:55.560
Does it only lasts for a certain amount of time?

1061
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.861
Well,

1062
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:56.581
I had enough play up,

1063
00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:57.510
plenty of friends,

1064
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.450
Jesus Christ,

1065
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:01.410
you know,

1066
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.680
and it was things like grateful dead concerts where they needed a lot of help.

1067
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:05.514
So it was all right.

1068
00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.050
So you 10 years ago,

1069
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:07.710
he just decided,

1070
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.220
fuck it,

1071
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.630
I'm going back to where I grew up.

1072
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:10.470
Is that what the deal was?

1073
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:10.980
Basically.

1074
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.371
I mean,

1075
00:28:11.371 --> 00:28:11.891
you know,

1076
00:28:11.891 --> 00:28:12.170
uh,

1077
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.200
15 years ago now.

1078
00:28:13.201 --> 00:28:13.921
But yeah,

1079
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:14.191
I mean,

1080
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:15.330
I love the country,

1081
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.131
you know what I mean?

1082
00:28:16.131 --> 00:28:18.510
In really soothes me and,

1083
00:28:18.511 --> 00:28:18.611
and,

1084
00:28:18.611 --> 00:28:19.444
and I,

1085
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.050
and I finally just sort of noticed to cut myself a break.

1086
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:22.261
You know,

1087
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:23.001
I've taken enough of,

1088
00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:23.730
uh,

1089
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:24.090
you know,

1090
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:28.210
they haven't been through enough shit and it just soothes me to be there with,

1091
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.380
you know,

1092
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.380
with a dog and it just loved the terrain and it's so Verdun there.

1093
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:33.841
I mean,

1094
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:34.674
I know a little bit out here.

1095
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.120
It's so great to come here,

1096
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.790
especially to see my friends like you to doing so great and having succeeded.

1097
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:44.610
It's a completely different thing to come to la now than it was when I first

1098
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:47.460
came to La and we were all trying to get our foot in the door.

1099
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.200
But it's,

1100
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.000
it's really nice.

1101
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.890
It's serene and I can,

1102
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:53.191
you know,

1103
00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:56.980
and it's a really nice place to sort of rake my self into a pile and,

1104
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.990
and my thoughts into a pile and then this distributed to them and,

1105
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.550
and uh,

1106
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.570
reflect a in,

1107
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:03.751
in,

1108
00:29:03.751 --> 00:29:04.581
in in comment,

1109
00:29:04.581 --> 00:29:06.120
want to have something to say but you know,

1110
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.570
be perfectly fine for being missing for a week or two at a time.

1111
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.570
Well this is not,

1112
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.510
this is not forced input up there.

1113
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:12.781
No,

1114
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:13.080
no,

1115
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.350
that's,

1116
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.320
that's the beautiful thing about being anywhere where there's very few people

1117
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.400
just less input.

1118
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.540
When people come to my house,

1119
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:19.111
like a car,

1120
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:21.420
we'll drive by when they first get there in six hours later,

1121
00:29:21.421 --> 00:29:22.800
another car will drive by and go,

1122
00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:24.960
I don't know where other spoken traffic's coming from today.

1123
00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.613
Sorry.

1124
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.550
But it's actually two dirt roads to get to his house.

1125
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:30.643
It must be fun.

1126
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:31.620
Go Past.

1127
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.340
There's a,

1128
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:36.180
there's a young girl with a giant sow on a chain,

1129
00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.360
a chain.

1130
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.770
There's a woman walking it pig.

1131
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:41.431
It was like it,

1132
00:29:41.431 --> 00:29:43.180
it probably weighs 500 pounds.

1133
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.970
You know what I'm talking about?

1134
00:29:44.971 --> 00:29:46.720
That Jake was killed in a horrible accident.

1135
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.060
Car Accident,

1136
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:48.420
Barry.

1137
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:48.770
Yeah.

1138
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:49.130
Yeah.

1139
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.530
The Dryer was basically total Jesus Christ.

1140
00:29:52.531 --> 00:29:54.730
We have a joke about how Barry can ruin anything.

1141
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:56.860
I saw a pig,

1142
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.920
it's dead and moving on.

1143
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.560
So when 2000 rolled around,

1144
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:04.120
I guess you just decided to just do it.

1145
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:05.560
Once the Internet started kicking in,

1146
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:07.630
you made a conscious choice to try to go some more.

1147
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:08.860
That's a little bit more peaceful.

1148
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.280
Yeah,

1149
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.100
absolutely.

1150
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.570
And I heard you talk a little bit about,

1151
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.180
but have you,

1152
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.810
have you thought about doing a podcast?

1153
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.470
I mean if you know it just

1154
00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:17.410
because,

1155
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.200
and I are going to [inaudible] and I are going to do it and he was going to be

1156
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:21.820
called over to the podcast,

1157
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:24.540
which is the upstate and they defeated tall.

1158
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.680
Josh moved back.

1159
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:27.880
He just come back.

1160
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:28.900
Jesus Christ.

1161
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.051
Yeah.

1162
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:30.820
I'll speak to you and I'll speak to you.

1163
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:34.790
And the upstate home for is like 193 inches of snow.

1164
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:39.340
Last year I just sat in my house and I worked out my alcoholism till I could get

1165
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:41.140
the door open again.

1166
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.423
That's where I,

1167
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.600
what is Paul doing these days?

1168
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.000
A lot of art people buy as art and um,

1169
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.780
and then we're,

1170
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.081
you know,

1171
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:51.360
we're trying to get the uh,

1172
00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.450
the podcast going,

1173
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:55.870
but he's been pretty busy cause he's been swamped with art orders and I'll be

1174
00:30:55.871 --> 00:30:57.730
pretty busy after he hit that pig.

1175
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.660
It was a performance piece.

1176
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.673
Does you go

1177
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.020
performance piece?

1178
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.411
Well,

1179
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:05.621
yeah,

1180
00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:07.980
I mean you could easily do a podcast up there and if you ever do it,

1181
00:31:07.981 --> 00:31:11.650
please do let me know and I'd be happy to promote it and I would listen to it

1182
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:12.100
every week.

1183
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:12.551
Thank you man.

1184
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:14.290
And I listened to you all the time and you,

1185
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:14.861
I mean,

1186
00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:15.281
you killed,

1187
00:31:15.281 --> 00:31:17.320
maybe you just really,

1188
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.010
again,

1189
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:23.010
to have even helped like rake the dirt that you grew out of it.

1190
00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.090
This is terrific.

1191
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:25.720
Thank you very much.

1192
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.450
That's an honor.

1193
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.430
You certainly did.

1194
00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:28.001
You were you,

1195
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:28.541
like I said,

1196
00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:30.910
you were the strongest part of that.

1197
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.690
You and I have had like some little Twitter conversations back and forth over

1198
00:31:34.691 --> 00:31:37.390
the years about the community and what it's like now.

1199
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.020
His Boston is so make it a little bit of a resurgence.

1200
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.680
I keep hearing that and Rick Jenkins is trying to do something in that Chinese

1201
00:31:44.681 --> 00:31:45.101
restaurant.

1202
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:48.410
It's kind of ironic that it all started out with the Ding that goes back.

1203
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.900
It's definitely,

1204
00:31:49.901 --> 00:31:52.900
there's some sort of connection between comedy and Msg.

1205
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.300
You can't deny it,

1206
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.830
but back in those days,

1207
00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:58.720
the MSG would make you pay the comics.

1208
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.063
Ooh.

1209
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.413
Uh,

1210
00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:04.603
made it the thing.

1211
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.420
Oh,

1212
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.110
I get it.

1213
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.220
Oh,

1214
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.053
Rick doesn't pay.

1215
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:08.320
No,

1216
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.700
I don't think he makes enough money to,

1217
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.660
and I understand that,

1218
00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:12.310
but I don't really advertise.

1219
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:12.551
Right.

1220
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:14.200
Isn't that like part of his fun thing?

1221
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.080
I doesn't let people know that this is the sugar going.

1222
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.653
Let them figure it out.

1223
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.051
Yeah.

1224
00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:20.771
If you're invited,

1225
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:21.604
it's okay.

1226
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.450
But no,

1227
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:23.980
a great job.

1228
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:24.930
He's been there longer than I,

1229
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.070
he,

1230
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:30.070
he's probably the longest running comedy Club in Boston history movie there.

1231
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:30.820
Yeah.

1232
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.930
I saw this stuff with,

1233
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:32.380
uh,

1234
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.730
with bearing now,

1235
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:34.331
cause you know,

1236
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:35.680
I didn't want to do that.

1237
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.873
I didn't want to do that,

1238
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.581
that thing in,

1239
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:40.340
in documentaries where they have the triumphant

1240
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.001
<v 3>return,</v>

1241
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:43.220
cause that's always feels very cooked.

1242
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.470
But I just wanted to show that Barry was alive and still relevant and that's

1243
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:48.771
why,

1244
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:48.961
and,

1245
00:32:48.961 --> 00:32:50.150
and it ended up being great.

1246
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:51.200
It was Bradley Stonecipher,

1247
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:52.460
the DP who suggested it.

1248
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.940
And then a really good because of Barry ended up narrating a good portion of the

1249
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:57.140
movie from the stage.

1250
00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:57.770
You know,

1251
00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:58.521
like when he says,

1252
00:32:58.521 --> 00:32:58.671
you know,

1253
00:32:58.671 --> 00:32:59.450
we went back,

1254
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.720
we went to that basement were while I was raped as a kid,

1255
00:33:02.721 --> 00:33:02.961
you know,

1256
00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:03.320
that,

1257
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.680
that,

1258
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.513
um,

1259
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:05.300
that was,

1260
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.100
that was not something that I,

1261
00:33:07.101 --> 00:33:08.090
that was cooked.

1262
00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:09.230
It was something that,

1263
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:09.530
uh,

1264
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.330
I was going to film the,

1265
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:15.080
the space where these things happened because I thought that would be powerful

1266
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.600
and I didn't want to do reenactments.

1267
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.793
Yeah.

1268
00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:19.210
Yeah.

1269
00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:20.043
Neither do die.

1270
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.480
I would have been testifying in front of another committee.

1271
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:27.260
What's the fuck?

1272
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.350
Oh my gosh.

1273
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.220
So,

1274
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.053
uh,

1275
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.113
so,

1276
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.323
so,

1277
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.180
so when we got there next,

1278
00:33:34.181 --> 00:33:34.460
ma'am,

1279
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.600
Barry and I,

1280
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.890
well before we got there,

1281
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:38.180
we had a big argument and he says,

1282
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:38.361
look,

1283
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:42.500
I'm going down there and because I would just kind of wanted him to put it in

1284
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:43.011
perspective,

1285
00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:44.740
but I didn't want him to go down the basement and,

1286
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.143
and uh,

1287
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:48.020
cause I also was afraid,

1288
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.550
I was worried for my friend.

1289
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:50.750
I've seen them go in this shock.

1290
00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:51.381
I've seen it.

1291
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:53.720
I saw it coming on when we were even there.

1292
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:54.740
I mean it came on.

1293
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.131
Yeah.

1294
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:55.431
I mean,

1295
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:57.470
but even before you got out of the car,

1296
00:33:57.471 --> 00:33:58.190
you know,

1297
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:59.210
before he got out of the car.

1298
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.640
But I know how to operate in a state of shock.

1299
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:02.121
That's all I did.

1300
00:34:02.121 --> 00:34:03.830
The child pornography investigation,

1301
00:34:03.831 --> 00:34:05.510
then that's how I,

1302
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.170
you know,

1303
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.250
they make their own worst enemy.

1304
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.370
The child pornography investigation was a huge part of that movie.

1305
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.270
And the,

1306
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:12.890
the fact that you,

1307
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.990
I mean I think too,

1308
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.730
if it was going on today,

1309
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.540
I think AOL would've gotten a lot more fucking trouble.

1310
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.750
Yeah.

1311
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:21.650
I think it would be a much,

1312
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.251
much,

1313
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:23.300
much bigger story.

1314
00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:24.140
But it was also,

1315
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.180
um,

1316
00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.060
well let's explain what happened.

1317
00:34:26.061 --> 00:34:26.161
So,

1318
00:34:26.161 --> 00:34:26.590
so yeah,

1319
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:26.930
so,

1320
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:29.980
so Barry Discloses,

1321
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:30.890
um,

1322
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:35.890
that he was raped as a kid on stage during a benefit for children,

1323
00:34:36.291 --> 00:34:38.810
basically what was for the southern poverty law center,

1324
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.813
but it,

1325
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.230
speaking up about what happened in Los Angeles,

1326
00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:45.440
number one was knocking was the after Rodney King and everyone was knocking

1327
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:46.274
these kids,

1328
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.800
I'm trying to get rid of this show.

1329
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:49.310
I'm not looking at all.

1330
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:49.940
So then,

1331
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.773
um,

1332
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:52.210
and so I,

1333
00:34:52.211 --> 00:34:57.140
I at that point I just sort of put my whole life together and I just wanted to

1334
00:34:57.141 --> 00:34:57.321
say,

1335
00:34:57.321 --> 00:34:57.531
you know,

1336
00:34:57.531 --> 00:34:58.670
kids come from somewhere,

1337
00:34:58.671 --> 00:34:59.270
man,

1338
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.820
these kids do ride that they come from somewhere that they,

1339
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:06.700
these guys come from a place we're up right up the street from their horror

1340
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.670
squalid condition or some of the richest people in the fucking world.

1341
00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:12.980
And they see it and they don't know what to do and guess,

1342
00:35:12.981 --> 00:35:13.281
well,

1343
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:13.521
Gee,

1344
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:16.490
they want some stuff when things about what a surprise.

1345
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.750
So I was speaking up for them and it was this long rap.

1346
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:23.630
And then at the end of it I said the w everybody comes from somewhere.

1347
00:35:23.631 --> 00:35:24.210
I come,

1348
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.090
I came from someone,

1349
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.330
then I told my store.

1350
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:27.260
Yeah.

1351
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.093
And then about it,

1352
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.150
he had,

1353
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.680
he had planned on that.

1354
00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:32.120
That's how the set was going to go.

1355
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.540
Cause Sweeney wanting to close and berries like I don't think you should close.

1356
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.680
<v 2>He insisted on it.</v>

1357
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:40.921
I'm like,

1358
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:42.640
well all right so Barry talk,

1359
00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:44.430
see how many cars,

1360
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.350
I've never said that to anybody,

1361
00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:53.280
but in so many words that night while he was a

1362
00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:57.763
good loan,

1363
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:01.303
let's go.

1364
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.163
Yeah.

1365
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.410
So as a Jack Hammer,

1366
00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:05.041
an ambulance,

1367
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:06.110
it's mass ave.

1368
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.590
Yeah.

1369
00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.423
So,

1370
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.380
so when Barry's looking for other survivors,

1371
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:15.381
he became aware that AOL was allowing pedophiles to exchange child pornography

1372
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.320
openly in their chat rooms.

1373
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:20.490
Not just exchange it,

1374
00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:23.790
but back then the more you use,

1375
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:24.870
the more you paid.

1376
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.100
So they were profiting.

1377
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:29.190
It wasn't like today you can get online all day long and you're making that

1378
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:29.341
point.

1379
00:36:29.341 --> 00:36:30.360
So it was a big deal.

1380
00:36:30.361 --> 00:36:31.710
So it's a lot of money,

1381
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:32.544
millions,

1382
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:37.860
millions then playing dumb with me because one night is bothering them and they

1383
00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:38.550
just,

1384
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.360
well thank you,

1385
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.720
you're being a good citizen of the Alo community,

1386
00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:45.360
but we have to balance in his Bob notice,

1387
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.540
you know our corporate growth along with First Amendment rights.

1388
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:48.871
I was like,

1389
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:50.010
what are you fucking kidding me?

1390
00:36:50.011 --> 00:36:52.470
These people are exchanging pictures of children being raped.

1391
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:53.610
There's no first amendment right.

1392
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:55.470
I don't give a fuck about your corporate growth.

1393
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.210
Fuck you keep it up.

1394
00:36:57.211 --> 00:37:00.910
And then right before they asked me to testify or when I was already invited,

1395
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.400
has to testify two days before,

1396
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.230
they are well contexts me and says,

1397
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.861
you know what?

1398
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:05.970
You like to get together and meet.

1399
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:06.430
And they were,

1400
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.510
they were going to come up with the bribe and I went,

1401
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.121
you know what,

1402
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:09.251
I,

1403
00:37:09.251 --> 00:37:09.391
I,

1404
00:37:09.391 --> 00:37:09.810
you know what?

1405
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.330
I'm going to see you Tuesday at the hearing or whatever,

1406
00:37:12.331 --> 00:37:12.680
Dale.

1407
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.410
So what do you think?

1408
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.980
I would have loved to have meet with them or here you meet with them just to see

1409
00:37:16.981 --> 00:37:18.150
what their plan was.

1410
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.770
I wanted to talk to that guy now,

1411
00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:21.750
but he wouldn't be in the movie.

1412
00:37:21.751 --> 00:37:23.190
The attorney for AOL.

1413
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.613
What's he up to now?

1414
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.000
I can say it and stick somewhere.

1415
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.870
Yeah,

1416
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.370
it's busy.

1417
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:32.701
Okay.

1418
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:33.160
Listen,

1419
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:33.993
he's,

1420
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.640
he's not an attorney anymore.

1421
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:36.090
Oh,

1422
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.070
well maybe stop stops.

1423
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.410
He's a running paramount.

1424
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.830
So you guys keep talking.

1425
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:47.700
I'm going to the man's room.

1426
00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.360
So,

1427
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:48.601
yeah.

1428
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:49.170
So,

1429
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.100
so Barry,

1430
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:50.550
uh,

1431
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.210
after,

1432
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.010
after Barry testified,

1433
00:37:53.011 --> 00:37:55.710
he wrote an article in the Boston Phoenix that I thought,

1434
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.820
and this was in [inaudible] 95 and I thought it read like a frank capra movie.

1435
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:00.101
You know,

1436
00:38:00.101 --> 00:38:00.420
this,

1437
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:00.850
you know,

1438
00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:01.230
apart,

1439
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.800
we should,

1440
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.530
I'll fill in more of the holes of the story because Frank Capra,

1441
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:05.401
frank capra,

1442
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:06.330
it's a wonderful life,

1443
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.201
Mr. Deeds,

1444
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:08.130
all those kind of,

1445
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:08.790
you know,

1446
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.330
so,

1447
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.163
so he,

1448
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.093
so Barry,

1449
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.690
uh,

1450
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.580
basically you didn't even pose his kids.

1451
00:38:14.581 --> 00:38:17.280
He just signed on his kids and that's all it took.

1452
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:22.281
And he got all this evidence against these guys and he basically embarrassed AOL

1453
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:23.400
on the floor of the Senate.

1454
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.060
Um,

1455
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:24.561
but he,

1456
00:38:24.561 --> 00:38:28.560
he pretended to be a child to get to lure these child guys.

1457
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.790
But it wasn't even that much.

1458
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.750
It wasn't even that much.

1459
00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:31.530
Um,

1460
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:31.800
you know,

1461
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.510
it wasn't really that much of a bait,

1462
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:33.720
you know,

1463
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.391
it was pretty easy.

1464
00:38:34.391 --> 00:38:34.520
Yeah.

1465
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:34.811
Just say,

1466
00:38:34.811 --> 00:38:35.260
Hey,

1467
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.000
two kids

1468
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.080
<v 3>when we're on and our parents don't cause he played,</v>

1469
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:38.500
uh,

1470
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.070
as he,

1471
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.950
as if he was a girl and a boy and all,

1472
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:42.491
it just,

1473
00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:43.740
just came pouring in.

1474
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.730
It wasn't like he was in trapping these guys.

1475
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:48.490
They were just pouring in and he spent,

1476
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:50.383
you know,

1477
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.580
almost a year,

1478
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:52.410
you know,

1479
00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.120
and downloading all these things.

1480
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:54.940
He gave it ours.

1481
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.940
It's an hundred pounds.

1482
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.350
Yeah.

1483
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:57.250
It's not in the movie,

1484
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:57.980
but he,

1485
00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.480
because he had given the evidence over to the feds.

1486
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.720
And the reason it's not in the movie is that there was a rest that were made

1487
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:07.870
directly because of the stuff that Barry and handed over.

1488
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:09.070
But the FEDS,

1489
00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:10.870
Warren interested in being in the movie,

1490
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:11.231
I think,

1491
00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:15.300
because Barry kind of did their job and you know,

1492
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:15.461
and,

1493
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:15.711
and,

1494
00:39:15.711 --> 00:39:16.090
and,

1495
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:16.451
and,

1496
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:17.284
um,

1497
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.220
so,

1498
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.881
so,

1499
00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:19.714
uh,

1500
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:21.450
where is he?

1501
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:22.030
Oh,

1502
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.863
so he,

1503
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.820
he begged me to make the movie.

1504
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.713
No.

1505
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:26.580
So,

1506
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.020
no,

1507
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.400
so,

1508
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.400
so this reads like a frank capra movie and I asked Barry to write a screen play,

1509
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:33.910
but this is right what you just said.

1510
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:36.480
He had lost a hundred pounds and I was like going Barry,

1511
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.230
this article you wrote for the Phoenix is tremendous.

1512
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.130
I think it's a picture,

1513
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:39.701
you know,

1514
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:40.360
and uh,

1515
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:40.470
can

1516
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.101
<v 4>make money.</v>

1517
00:39:41.101 --> 00:39:41.700
Yeah.

1518
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.211
By the way,

1519
00:39:42.211 --> 00:39:44.130
you have no idea how to write a screenplay.

1520
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:44.941
And so Barry,

1521
00:39:44.941 --> 00:39:45.230
what,

1522
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.160
what was your motivation like when you,

1523
00:39:47.161 --> 00:39:49.530
when you knew that they were trained,

1524
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.360
they were trading pornography,

1525
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.351
child pornography,

1526
00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:53.220
child pornography,

1527
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:53.880
excuse me,

1528
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.713
I don't care about it.

1529
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.500
They,

1530
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.333
you,

1531
00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.390
you decided the way to catch them or the way to gather evidence on him was to

1532
00:40:00.391 --> 00:40:01.690
pose as a child?

1533
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:01.981
No,

1534
00:40:01.981 --> 00:40:02.531
what I did,

1535
00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:04.320
what I needed a reason to be in the room.

1536
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:04.800
Okay.

1537
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.330
If I was in the room as an adult,

1538
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:06.810
right.

1539
00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:07.643
They would,

1540
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.170
they spacious.

1541
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:09.520
Right.

1542
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.700
If I wasn't sending child pornography back to them,

1543
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:13.590
so I needed to be a child.

1544
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.100
Right.

1545
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.480
So then they're going like,

1546
00:40:15.481 --> 00:40:16.171
look at the fund.

1547
00:40:16.171 --> 00:40:16.980
You could have.

1548
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.200
That's what they're literally doing and approaching me with.

1549
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.630
Doug Stanhope wrote a whole book about it,

1550
00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:23.220
baiting.

1551
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.480
He used to do it all the time,

1552
00:40:24.481 --> 00:40:25.470
like back in the old days.

1553
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.810
He used to call it baiting and he used to put it,

1554
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:28.980
publish it on his website,

1555
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.390
baiting child porn,

1556
00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:32.340
people baiting pedophiles.

1557
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.151
I got to meet Doug.

1558
00:40:33.151 --> 00:40:34.560
I've never met him the best.

1559
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:35.940
I hope they love the fuck out,

1560
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.360
dude.

1561
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.620
Maybe you could fuck.

1562
00:40:37.621 --> 00:40:38.310
Yeah,

1563
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:39.990
I'll fly him in to tell me where you're going to be.

1564
00:40:39.991 --> 00:40:40.530
Let's do it.

1565
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:40.741
Okay,

1566
00:40:40.741 --> 00:40:41.130
great.

1567
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:41.963
Great.

1568
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:43.291
It's,

1569
00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:46.530
it's a crazy thing that when you were doing this,

1570
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.940
it's sort of analogous to how people got away with pedophilia and how they got

1571
00:40:50.941 --> 00:40:55.620
away with child molesting back in the day because it was something that was

1572
00:40:55.621 --> 00:40:56.161
almost,

1573
00:40:56.161 --> 00:40:56.580
it was,

1574
00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.910
it was just to solve taboo.

1575
00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.590
It's in the favor of the perpetrator.

1576
00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:03.870
That's why we have to break silence.

1577
00:41:03.871 --> 00:41:07.540
That's why we have to be like kind of specific about differences.

1578
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:08.371
It's like people say to me,

1579
00:41:08.371 --> 00:41:08.581
wow,

1580
00:41:08.581 --> 00:41:09.780
you admitted you were raped.

1581
00:41:09.781 --> 00:41:11.400
I didn't fucking admit anything.

1582
00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:12.240
I was raped.

1583
00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:12.691
I,

1584
00:41:12.691 --> 00:41:12.960
you know,

1585
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.850
guilty people rape.

1586
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:15.111
Yeah.

1587
00:41:15.111 --> 00:41:15.401
You know,

1588
00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:15.820
I mean,

1589
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.670
I didn't admit anything.

1590
00:41:17.671 --> 00:41:20.310
I guess like that you admitted you what they hell they robbed your home,

1591
00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:20.551
you know,

1592
00:41:20.551 --> 00:41:21.120
you wouldn't mind.

1593
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.810
You were held up at gunpoint while I had disclosed,

1594
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.140
I chose to disclose.

1595
00:41:25.141 --> 00:41:29.400
Not everyone sort of has the wherewithal to do that or the makeup to do that.

1596
00:41:29.401 --> 00:41:30.450
But fortunately I did.

1597
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.010
So I disclosed but I didn't miss anything and they turned the

1598
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.311
<v 3>deep,</v>

1599
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:35.510
dark secret he had no,

1600
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:36.920
I dealt with it when I could.

1601
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.251
And I,

1602
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:41.450
and I talked about it when I could in a fashion that I tried to make it as

1603
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:43.580
accessible as possible to other people.

1604
00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:44.510
So people would know like,

1605
00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:45.111
look at this guy,

1606
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:46.160
this guy is sensible,

1607
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:47.840
this guy's got something to say.

1608
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:51.500
This guy seems to be lucid and now he's saying this but,

1609
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:52.250
but the,

1610
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.660
the,

1611
00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:52.840
it,

1612
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.350
it took a toll on him.

1613
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:59.030
And so it was a hard time for me because you know,

1614
00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:00.410
he was Barry and,

1615
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.390
and I saw how ill he got and I was making police academy for,

1616
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.220
it was really taking away from my time on the south and lost.

1617
00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.490
He was lost a hundred pounds while you're doing that.

1618
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.130
Well,

1619
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.020
it also became a vegetarian and stuff done.

1620
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:19.160
So there's a variety of people draw whatever conclusions and there's some stuff

1621
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:19.640
in the movie.

1622
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:19.941
I mean,

1623
00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:22.220
I just hooked people up to be in the movie.

1624
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:23.120
I'm going to,

1625
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.953
I didn't say,

1626
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:24.591
Hey,

1627
00:42:24.591 --> 00:42:29.330
remember to say this or remember I just backed off and I didn't loom while Bob

1628
00:42:29.331 --> 00:42:30.021
was making the movie,

1629
00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:31.580
I thought it was enough of a task.

1630
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:32.450
So I tried.

1631
00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:34.580
The one thing I could do is I just kept saying to people,

1632
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:35.060
it's Bob's,

1633
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:35.131
it,

1634
00:42:35.131 --> 00:42:35.871
it's about my life.

1635
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:39.800
It's Bob's movie and Bob's movie about my life is something I'm very,

1636
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:40.070
I,

1637
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.750
I put my money on the right,

1638
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.120
the right spot on the table,

1639
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:44.390
you know,

1640
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:45.420
so I,

1641
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.120
and I knew that coming in,

1642
00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:48.470
I knew he would do me right,

1643
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:48.830
but,

1644
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:49.780
but is like,

1645
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:54.770
there's parts in the movie that my daughter has a problem with because the,

1646
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.260
the one is the basement because it looks like I,

1647
00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.850
I asked him to are kind of manipulated.

1648
00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.520
It went the other way.

1649
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:02.271
The fight was,

1650
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:02.691
he's on,

1651
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:04.510
I'm going down there and you go through a problem,

1652
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.373
not around it.

1653
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.100
You can film this or not.

1654
00:43:07.101 --> 00:43:10.100
I'm going down and your daughter a problem with them because she didn't like me

1655
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:10.960
looking like a,

1656
00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:15.230
a manipulative guy and she didn't like the scene with your sister,

1657
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.130
be cool again.

1658
00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:16.964
And my sister,

1659
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:18.740
I don't tell anybody,

1660
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:20.741
I just said,

1661
00:43:20.741 --> 00:43:22.630
Bob's making a movie about my life and,

1662
00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.050
and then she,

1663
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:24.441
I want,

1664
00:43:24.441 --> 00:43:25.580
at one point in the movie she says,

1665
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:27.163
well,

1666
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.220
you know,

1667
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.600
I knew you were going to interview me,

1668
00:43:29.601 --> 00:43:30.980
but I didn't know there'd be cameras here.

1669
00:43:30.981 --> 00:43:31.970
It's a fucking movie,

1670
00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:32.804
Mary Jo.

1671
00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.640
But she's my sister and she literally saved my life is very well,

1672
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:38.780
may have saved my life.

1673
00:43:38.781 --> 00:43:43.340
It was close because the degree of violence and that's just the physicality of

1674
00:43:43.341 --> 00:43:44.210
things and whatever.

1675
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.340
So important to the movie because people want to discredit victims of abuse and

1676
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:52.970
to have a witness as much time as we should give those people,

1677
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:53.893
you know?

1678
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.500
Yeah.

1679
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:54.710
Yeah.

1680
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.510
But I would just,

1681
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.560
I'm just wanting to show him that we're iron clad.

1682
00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:58.521
Oh yeah.

1683
00:43:58.521 --> 00:43:59.091
That's why.

1684
00:43:59.091 --> 00:44:00.200
That's why it was key.

1685
00:44:00.201 --> 00:44:00.411
I mean,

1686
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:01.720
she did me a big salad,

1687
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:02.391
not just you.

1688
00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:03.224
So,

1689
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:07.590
so Barry went into the original big salad is what I'm talking about.

1690
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:09.440
You know,

1691
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.370
when she walked in,

1692
00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:11.204
if she hadn't,

1693
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:12.861
who knows?

1694
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:13.671
Maybe that day,

1695
00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:16.590
maybe if that guy wasn't stuff that might be able to,

1696
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.130
because the girl that was involved as well,

1697
00:44:19.131 --> 00:44:24.131
the girl that the babies lured you in and brought the guy over and then the girl

1698
00:44:25.011 --> 00:44:27.410
was trying to stop your sister from getting away.

1699
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:28.610
I mean,

1700
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:28.881
it was,

1701
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:32.760
her heart was when I was watching that,

1702
00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:33.030
it was,

1703
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.410
my hands were sweating.

1704
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:35.040
It's,

1705
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.670
it's just,

1706
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.990
uh,

1707
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.320
your sister's crying.

1708
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:37.840
It's like,

1709
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.680
<v 1>Whoa,</v>

1710
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:39.620
yeah,

1711
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.453
whoa.

1712
00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.493
It's uh,

1713
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.770
<v 3>and then cut to get evening.</v>

1714
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:46.260
And there's a very bright young comic from upstate New York.

1715
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.453
It's like when,

1716
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.110
when Barry was in the basement,

1717
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:49.531
you know,

1718
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:49.740
and,

1719
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:50.040
and,

1720
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.110
and to me what he says there is very,

1721
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:54.090
you know,

1722
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:54.270
it,

1723
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.130
it proves that he's not living in it,

1724
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.830
that he's bringing the message back to the tribe,

1725
00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.130
you know,

1726
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.050
very Joseph Campbell kind of stuff.

1727
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.441
You know,

1728
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:02.070
that's the,

1729
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:02.460
you know,

1730
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:02.940
the end.

1731
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.260
It's a great fourth act.

1732
00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:05.094
And so he says,

1733
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.841
he says to me,

1734
00:45:07.841 --> 00:45:08.650
he goes,

1735
00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:10.200
I totally blacked out.

1736
00:45:10.201 --> 00:45:13.020
I don't know what I said is any of it thinking about the movie,

1737
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.980
which was very sweet.

1738
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:14.221
He goes,

1739
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:16.020
it was any of that usable.

1740
00:45:16.021 --> 00:45:16.854
And I said,

1741
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:17.911
I don't know.

1742
00:45:17.911 --> 00:45:22.911
I'm playing Yakety sax the whole time you down in that basement India.

1743
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:25.801
He goes,

1744
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:25.981
yeah,

1745
00:45:25.981 --> 00:45:27.420
you could animate it and stuff.

1746
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.373
So,

1747
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.641
but you know,

1748
00:45:29.641 --> 00:45:31.350
people get weirded out by that.

1749
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.220
But how else,

1750
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:35.040
how about the two guys that genuinely love each other?

1751
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:35.970
We had to make plenty of,

1752
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.110
we had to keep making plenty of jokes as I went along through some of the,

1753
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:40.381
yeah,

1754
00:45:40.381 --> 00:45:40.671
of course,

1755
00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:45.671
one of the jokes that only he can make and then I can get away with a little bit

1756
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:47.060
because,

1757
00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.190
because I'm Clyde fully licensed Bob to use my jokes.

1758
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:51.810
But in any,

1759
00:45:51.811 --> 00:45:52.800
in any case,

1760
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.611
<v 1>you know,</v>

1761
00:45:53.611 --> 00:45:54.444
uh,

1762
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.390
I'm glad I went into that basement for a few reasons.

1763
00:45:57.391 --> 00:45:59.520
Number one was cause other kids go in that basement.

1764
00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.930
I didn't want to imply that it was imbued with some sort of supernatural power

1765
00:46:03.931 --> 00:46:05.520
cause this rapist had been there.

1766
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:06.230
You know what?

1767
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:10.170
It turns out Rapiscan not imbue stonewalls with their evil.

1768
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:12.840
It just something that happened within those stone walls.

1769
00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.180
And then I went down and said,

1770
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:18.450
hopefully it was a good spirit to say any kid who's ever been in here or any kid

1771
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:19.380
who will ever be in here,

1772
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:23.370
I hope you have fun and you play with your friends and everything's okay and no

1773
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:25.770
one else ever gets hurt here ever.

1774
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.660
And that was really important to me.

1775
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:28.381
And the other thing was,

1776
00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:29.020
I kind of,

1777
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.020
as silly as it sounds,

1778
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:34.530
it's sort of crunchy granolas it sounds in a way,

1779
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:34.920
well,

1780
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.251
I mean,

1781
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:35.550
I had,

1782
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.800
I thought about that place for so long,

1783
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.430
I wasn't gonna walk up to the door and give it the kind of power that I couldn't

1784
00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:42.060
walk in there.

1785
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.560
I had every right to walk in there.

1786
00:46:43.561 --> 00:46:43.880
And,

1787
00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.060
and so I did.

1788
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.510
And in a way I walked in there and I,

1789
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:52.080
and I collected myself as a small child and we all walked back up the stairs and

1790
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:54.960
they did a beautiful thing in the movie where they talk about it.

1791
00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:57.250
I'm walking up the stairs and then,

1792
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.630
then this u s uh,

1793
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:03.650
I mean this a district county prosecutor from Cuyahoga County in Ohio says

1794
00:47:05.221 --> 00:47:05.491
Barry,

1795
00:47:05.491 --> 00:47:05.821
you know,

1796
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:10.821
like we've arrested over a thousand people for trading child pornography in,

1797
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.420
in Cuyahoga County.

1798
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:17.421
And a lot of what he did is the basis of what's being done nationally about this

1799
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.173
heinous crime.

1800
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.400
So it's,

1801
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:24.181
you know,

1802
00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:24.990
I mean,

1803
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.150
it's a fucking beautiful bow on.

1804
00:47:27.151 --> 00:47:28.770
It was like a ridiculous package.

1805
00:47:28.771 --> 00:47:30.380
And I'm in Cra and

1806
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.940
<v 4>man,</v>

1807
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.380
did we name the movie the right thing?

1808
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:32.861
You know,

1809
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:33.850
I'm so fortunate.

1810
00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.150
What year was this that you were doing this with the,

1811
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:37.301
uh,

1812
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:38.890
AOL 95 95.

1813
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:40.690
So this was the beginning of the Internet.

1814
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:41.320
Yeah.

1815
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:41.681
Yeah.

1816
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:41.871
And,

1817
00:47:41.871 --> 00:47:46.480
and like in the movie where the senators so proudly talk about how literate they

1818
00:47:46.481 --> 00:47:47.590
are with computers.

1819
00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.473
Yeah.

1820
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.450
I don't know who they're trying to appeal to their,

1821
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:52.570
I suppose to make 'em folks see or something.

1822
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.433
Yeah.

1823
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:53.920
Yeah.

1824
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:54.753
It's,

1825
00:47:55.270 --> 00:48:00.160
it's just incredible that 20 years ago it was that easy to trade child

1826
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:01.540
pornography that it was just,

1827
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:02.310
they were,

1828
00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:03.530
were less about it.

1829
00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:03.810
They,

1830
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:04.690
and they actually,

1831
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:08.290
they would attack someone who challenged them rather than like someone coming in

1832
00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:08.651
and going like,

1833
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:09.251
Holy Shit,

1834
00:48:09.251 --> 00:48:10.510
someone sues what we're doing.

1835
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.533
Scatter,

1836
00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:12.221
you know,

1837
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:13.330
at least that what happened.

1838
00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:14.860
Now at least,

1839
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:16.900
at least they know they're in a little,

1840
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.130
there's some sort of danger.

1841
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.210
Back then it was like,

1842
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:19.601
well,

1843
00:48:19.601 --> 00:48:21.340
this is a natural progression of thing.

1844
00:48:21.341 --> 00:48:21.510
And,

1845
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.720
and,

1846
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.190
and plus I'm just reading these guys and you know,

1847
00:48:24.191 --> 00:48:24.411
I,

1848
00:48:24.411 --> 00:48:25.244
I,

1849
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:26.710
I will read what my enemy,

1850
00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:26.981
right.

1851
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:27.461
So I like,

1852
00:48:27.461 --> 00:48:30.040
I studied nambla and what they had to say.

1853
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:31.120
And these fucking people,

1854
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.730
if you're not familiar with Nan up,

1855
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:35.440
watch the movie powder,

1856
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.573
uh,

1857
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
it basically puts the entire philosophy of nambla into a film that Disney paid

1858
00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:47.610
for that was directed by a convicted child molester annually.

1859
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.010
Yeah.

1860
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.600
APPS Fuckin lutely.

1861
00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:49.771
Well,

1862
00:48:49.771 --> 00:48:50.530
I didn't know that.

1863
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:50.711
Oh,

1864
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:55.030
the boy had all the power and he looks like Michael Jackson.

1865
00:48:55.031 --> 00:48:55.570
It's like,

1866
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.570
so I thought it was about like a magic kit or something [inaudible] or

1867
00:48:59.571 --> 00:48:59.781
something,

1868
00:48:59.781 --> 00:49:03.260
but it's not a magic kid has this power all the,

1869
00:49:03.261 --> 00:49:03.670
yeah.

1870
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:04.780
It's fucking fit.

1871
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:05.000
A,

1872
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.450
a missing [inaudible] of the millennium.

1873
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:07.991
Yeah.

1874
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:08.681
It was the movie,

1875
00:49:08.681 --> 00:49:09.580
I think Clown House.

1876
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.720
And he had caught actually actively abusing children,

1877
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.580
a child and that child actor,

1878
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:17.640
he was caught and went to jail with it for it.

1879
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.710
And then Disney makes it fucking film with this guy and I wanted to get,

1880
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:23.090
well yeah.

1881
00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.960
Here was the film made mid nineties to the Internet.

1882
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:27.820
This is Sean Patrick Flannery,

1883
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:28.723
right?

1884
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:30.370
Yeah.

1885
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:30.551
Yeah.

1886
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:31.360
I guess.

1887
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.110
Wow.

1888
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:32.650
Yeah.

1889
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.210
So fuck that guy.

1890
00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:35.171
Fuck him.

1891
00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:36.040
I know about him.

1892
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:37.990
I know what it is fucking movies about.

1893
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:43.170
It's the fucking nambla philosophy put into a movie like this kid has a power

1894
00:49:43.451 --> 00:49:44.560
over everyone.

1895
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.450
It's everything's the kid's choice.

1896
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:47.171
Fuck you.

1897
00:49:47.171 --> 00:49:48.580
Everything isn't the kid's choice.

1898
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:53.650
You're allying fucking sack of Shit Creek fucking child rapist that Disney hired

1899
00:49:53.651 --> 00:49:57.130
and when you look at Disney and they let that guy direct a movie,

1900
00:49:57.131 --> 00:49:58.570
just consider who might behind it.

1901
00:49:58.571 --> 00:50:00.580
Be behind the fucking goofy mascot,

1902
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:01.420
their theme park.

1903
00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:02.380
Thank you.

1904
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.910
Wow,

1905
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.650
that is crazy.

1906
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:06.873
This is the guy.

1907
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.301
That's right.

1908
00:50:07.301 --> 00:50:08.360
Victor Salva look at that.

1909
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:10.690
Must have ran fucking relentless sec.

1910
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.080
Yeah.

1911
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.780
I actually friends with a number of what?

1912
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.550
I didn't know who got them in the right corner.

1913
00:50:14.551 --> 00:50:14.951
A picture,

1914
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:16.620
but I like American film director,

1915
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.430
best known for directing films,

1916
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:19.930
powder and jeepers creepers.

1917
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.651
Jeepers creepers.

1918
00:50:20.651 --> 00:50:21.580
That was a horror movie.

1919
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:22.900
That was a good movie.

1920
00:50:22.901 --> 00:50:23.734
Fuck.

1921
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.840
But I'm attracted to controversy.

1922
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:26.950
Were being a convicted.

1923
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.820
Where is he now?

1924
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:30.531
I don't know,

1925
00:50:30.531 --> 00:50:31.920
but he better not be too close to him.

1926
00:50:31.921 --> 00:50:32.571
How is that?

1927
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:34.430
He's directing the full house reunion,

1928
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:38.180
really for four house.

1929
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.330
Oh my God.

1930
00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:42.140
Yeah.

1931
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:42.973
There you go.

1932
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:43.461
Hey Victor.

1933
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:44.750
A little press for you today,

1934
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:46.390
Vic Victor Back.

1935
00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:49.340
You fucking NAM bluff fucking proponent.

1936
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:50.450
Fuck you.

1937
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:51.560
Piece of shit.

1938
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.610
Fuck Disney.

1939
00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:54.003
Yeah,

1940
00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:54.873
to.

1941
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:56.563
Yeah.

1942
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.740
So when he directed them,

1943
00:50:57.741 --> 00:51:02.741
I get mad when I see 37 he was only 37 convicted sex offender.

1944
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.190
Wow.

1945
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:08.900
What else did he direct you directed children and did harm.

1946
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:09.350
Look at that.

1947
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:09.751
Hold on.

1948
00:51:09.751 --> 00:51:11.690
Oh look at that vice piece.

1949
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:13.730
He loves convicting.

1950
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.060
Loves terrorizing.

1951
00:51:15.061 --> 00:51:16.550
Semi naked youths.

1952
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:20.870
What this is from 2012 what is this?

1953
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.490
Oh my God,

1954
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:24.680
Jesus Larian.

1955
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.880
Oh my God.

1956
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.580
Did people think of a pet rest or sexually DV to film director?

1957
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:31.540
They are likely to imagine Roland plants giving sex with a 13 year old or what

1958
00:51:31.541 --> 00:51:32.790
are y'all and marrying it up to done.

1959
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.950
But those stories were a bit tired and cliched now.

1960
00:51:34.951 --> 00:51:38.780
So for those of you with a thirst for horrible stories about film and abusing

1961
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:39.060
their power,

1962
00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:43.340
we present mid budget journeymen director of Victor Sal journeymen.

1963
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:44.330
He's on a boxer.

1964
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.313
You know,

1965
00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.161
what does that mean?

1966
00:51:46.161 --> 00:51:47.810
Mid Budget journeymen.

1967
00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:49.071
What a weird,

1968
00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:49.491
distinct,

1969
00:51:49.491 --> 00:51:49.800
shy.

1970
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:54.800
Now was just a riot in 1989 salvo was jailed for last minute journeyman.

1971
00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:58.390
No bobcat.

1972
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.660
Glad.

1973
00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:58.971
Thanks.

1974
00:51:58.971 --> 00:52:00.530
Clapton should sue these guys.

1975
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.200
Um,

1976
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.300
I have my own house.

1977
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.670
He so he was jailed after Melissa.

1978
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.930
Don't real star.

1979
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.560
You know what don't so don't rent his smoke.

1980
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:11.690
We don't pay for his next defense.

1981
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.733
And by the way,

1982
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:14.150
the Gary Glitter's shit,

1983
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:18.260
they play in every and every ballpark that that's his fucking defense one.

1984
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:18.690
Duh,

1985
00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:19.370
Duh Duh.

1986
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:20.240
And I won't finish it.

1987
00:52:20.241 --> 00:52:21.074
But Hey,

1988
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.240
you know that song he makes money on that.

1989
00:52:23.241 --> 00:52:25.640
Every time a ball games going on the plots,

1990
00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:30.641
victims of clown house or three prepubescent brothers led by the deputy.

1991
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.550
Have you taught Sam Rockwell who spent their time running sterically around the

1992
00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:38.870
enormous sub sobriety alley as three pre pubescent kids in that film too?

1993
00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.093
What funny.

1994
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.330
What a piece of shit.

1995
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:42.610
I came and look at the smell.

1996
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:43.760
It's just kinda not in jail.

1997
00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.930
I thought when you go to jail,

1998
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.150
you go to jail for a long time.

1999
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:48.770
Now you'd be surprised.

2000
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:49.813
Well that's,

2001
00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:52.970
I'm surprised right now because he came out and Disney and let a minute,

2002
00:52:52.971 --> 00:52:56.980
God Damn Millennium Make a God damn movie that was the Nam Bluff movie of,

2003
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.823
it's like,

2004
00:52:58.210 --> 00:52:59.030
you know,

2005
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.960
the nambla film festival outside of God knows what they would show.

2006
00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:04.820
So what does nambla his philosophy?

2007
00:53:04.821 --> 00:53:05.180
That's the,

2008
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.530
basically it's the kid's choice.

2009
00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:08.120
That's their run.

2010
00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:08.540
Yeah.

2011
00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:08.840
Yeah,

2012
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.450
that's true.

2013
00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:10.110
It's the kids.

2014
00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:10.331
Oh,

2015
00:53:10.331 --> 00:53:13.490
my kid lead the kids make all the decisions.

2016
00:53:13.491 --> 00:53:13.671
You know,

2017
00:53:13.671 --> 00:53:16.430
I used to think that an Ambo was something that they joked around about,

2018
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:18.560
like I thought it was a real thing.

2019
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.433
No,

2020
00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:20.813
I mean,

2021
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:26.160
we see here Howard stern talk about it and [inaudible] real and,

2022
00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.840
and it's not a joke.

2023
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:28.710
So look at,

2024
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:29.251
the thing is,

2025
00:53:29.251 --> 00:53:31.650
it's like the Communist Party nowadays,

2026
00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:32.670
you go to a meeting,

2027
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.180
you know,

2028
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.710
it's like 80%,

2029
00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:35.011
uh,

2030
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:35.910
FBI agents.

2031
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:36.720
So enjoy yourself.

2032
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.720
Namel guys remember the hilarious thing when they had a nambla meeting at the

2033
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.940
San Francisco Library and I film crew came in and everybody walked out,

2034
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:46.320
like crouching there.

2035
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:48.420
They're all like walking like you're Groucho Marx.

2036
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:49.883
No,

2037
00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.780
they wouldn't stand up.

2038
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:52.120
Uh,

2039
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:52.441
you know,

2040
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:53.550
I bet we could find it.

2041
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:56.850
Nambla and VA Nambla San Francisco Library.

2042
00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.050
It's,

2043
00:53:58.050 --> 00:53:59.070
it's hilarious.

2044
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:01.280
I just,

2045
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.800
I thought for sure if something like that happens,

2046
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:06.270
you go to jail for a hundred years.

2047
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:06.511
I mean,

2048
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:09.750
I don't understand how this guy could have been out at four.

2049
00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:10.140
I mean,

2050
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:10.330
yeah,

2051
00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:14.640
that means that 37 so if he was convicted and then he was out at 37,

2052
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:17.280
he couldn't possibly have done more than,

2053
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:18.060
you know,

2054
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:18.900
17,

2055
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.310
19 years.

2056
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.671
Right.

2057
00:54:20.671 --> 00:54:22.110
If he was 18 he didn't,

2058
00:54:22.111 --> 00:54:23.340
he didn't do anything close to the,

2059
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.510
and then we did a little bit,

2060
00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:25.411
he did a little bit.

2061
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:26.970
And then when they made the movie though,

2062
00:54:26.971 --> 00:54:27.691
here's the thing,

2063
00:54:27.691 --> 00:54:29.670
if he wasn't directing that film at 17,

2064
00:54:29.671 --> 00:54:30.031
18,

2065
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:30.864
you know,

2066
00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:31.830
I mean,

2067
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:32.080
he,

2068
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:32.380
he,

2069
00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.140
he only did it a bit of time.

2070
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:35.790
Mother Fucker,

2071
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:37.950
you know the movie that Green Lit,

2072
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:39.540
that's the only thing that's weird.

2073
00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:41.460
They knew his past and then the green that,

2074
00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:45.570
that movie and he was released on parole and 90 to 15 months into his sentence

2075
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.340
will,

2076
00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.173
yeah,

2077
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.530
he laid low for a while,

2078
00:54:49.531 --> 00:54:50.880
planning his next move.

2079
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:52.680
What the fuck does that mean?

2080
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:53.610
I don't know.

2081
00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:55.110
Oh my God,

2082
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.630
let me man,

2083
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:58.050
he the registered sex offender who had recently been drove and then,

2084
00:54:58.051 --> 00:54:58.490
cause I like,

2085
00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:00.990
I was hired to make a film for Disney.

2086
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.620
So it was Disney film pillar was a straight potter,

2087
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:07.710
a freakishly intelligent albino boy with telepathic and telekinetic powers.

2088
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.310
The film was marketed as a modern day female tail,

2089
00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:14.370
which started such as household names is Jeff Goldbloom and was at the time to

2090
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:14.611
create,

2091
00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:18.240
to be asleep or hit after across $30 million worldwide out stripping.

2092
00:55:18.241 --> 00:55:18.901
It's modest.

2093
00:55:18.901 --> 00:55:20.160
$10 million budget.

2094
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:20.790
Yeah.

2095
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:22.530
All I remembered was that,

2096
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.330
oh my God,

2097
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:24.540
you touched me and I've had better.

2098
00:55:24.541 --> 00:55:25.374
So what does that say?

2099
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.070
Um,

2100
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.490
give Jeff Golban comes across powder and empty cafeteria and says to him,

2101
00:55:29.491 --> 00:55:33.720
you touched me and I've had better sex than I've had in 10 years.

2102
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.480
I want to be a friend that's not creepy.

2103
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.661
And,

2104
00:55:36.661 --> 00:55:36.821
and,

2105
00:55:36.821 --> 00:55:37.190
and it,

2106
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:38.670
this thing get good reviews.

2107
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.440
You touched me and I had better sex.

2108
00:55:41.441 --> 00:55:41.670
Yeah,

2109
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:42.081
I have.

2110
00:55:42.081 --> 00:55:42.301
Man,

2111
00:55:42.301 --> 00:55:43.134
we hit.

2112
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.160
That's why I love,

2113
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:47.790
I was looking forward to doing this cause I know we would hit some stripe,

2114
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:48.571
you know,

2115
00:55:48.571 --> 00:55:51.300
some vein that you would completely dig,

2116
00:55:51.301 --> 00:55:52.710
man and you and you get it.

2117
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:52.981
See,

2118
00:55:52.981 --> 00:55:53.910
this is my work.

2119
00:55:53.911 --> 00:55:55.290
This is what I'm fine.

2120
00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:56.430
Oh fuck yeah.

2121
00:55:56.431 --> 00:56:01.431
Takes powders hand as his hair supposedly due to an electric current begins to

2122
00:56:01.771 --> 00:56:02.820
stand on the end.

2123
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.850
So the idea is that the polling and the power of this child makes his hair stand

2124
00:56:07.851 --> 00:56:08.230
out.

2125
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.481
Yeah,

2126
00:56:08.481 --> 00:56:08.700
yeah,

2127
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.330
yeah.

2128
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:14.330
Then Goldson tenant movie and it's a rest is powders face and bald head for

2129
00:56:15.091 --> 00:56:16.200
around 20 seconds.

2130
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.150
What the fuck is wrong with Jeff Goldblum?

2131
00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:18.721
I don't know.

2132
00:56:18.721 --> 00:56:19.081
Jeff.

2133
00:56:19.081 --> 00:56:20.160
What is the wrong with you?

2134
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:21.181
The fuck.

2135
00:56:21.181 --> 00:56:21.751
I don't care.

2136
00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:23.100
I don't need to meet movie stars.

2137
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:23.690
Fucking,

2138
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:24.070
you know,

2139
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.500
come on.

2140
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:24.820
Gee,

2141
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:29.350
I'm glad you're on the fucking rent.com horror ads now apartment let it's

2142
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:30.190
falling apart.

2143
00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.190
Well not good luck to you both.

2144
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.010
What the fuck?

2145
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:34.300
He was really good and Jurassic Park.

2146
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.250
I didn't see that.

2147
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.150
I missed that.

2148
00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:37.990
Can you imagine?

2149
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:39.070
I didn't have to see that.

2150
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:41.410
He said he really liked Coney lucky duty.

2151
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.863
Not really.

2152
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.131
No,

2153
00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:45.964
you're kidding.

2154
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.450
Kidding,

2155
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.890
kidding.

2156
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:48.491
Totally kidding.

2157
00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:49.260
I know that.

2158
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:49.630
Sorry.

2159
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.940
I meant,

2160
00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:50.130
I mean,

2161
00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:50.320
you know,

2162
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.490
maybe he wasn't thinking that much.

2163
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.980
Maybe the movie was made incrementally and whatever.

2164
00:56:53.981 --> 00:56:55.030
So I'll give him a break.

2165
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.880
But Disney should have fucking done Disney.

2166
00:56:58.090 --> 00:56:59.950
It's whole business is based on kids,

2167
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:00.370
right?

2168
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:02.950
So this is what the big kid studio,

2169
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.050
the fucking theme park people,

2170
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:10.200
they put this piece of shit out and it's still sort of like honored is this Po a

2171
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.120
critically acclaimed thing and I,

2172
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.280
I'm know guy who can put critics,

2173
00:57:15.281 --> 00:57:19.060
figure out shit that I'm not smart enough or I don't care enough to figure out.

2174
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:20.510
They can follow up on Garcetti.

2175
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:20.980
And also,

2176
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.480
I don't know what the fuck they're talking about,

2177
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:23.523
but this movie,

2178
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.570
I know the message better than anybody.

2179
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:29.280
I know what it's about and I know who they're appealing to and they're in there.

2180
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:33.040
They're putting their fucking horseshit in our face and asking us to like,

2181
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:33.311
well,

2182
00:57:33.311 --> 00:57:33.970
you know what?

2183
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:34.751
I don't like it.

2184
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:35.111
Disney,

2185
00:57:35.111 --> 00:57:36.040
I don't like itself.

2186
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:37.330
I'll go fuck yourself.

2187
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.290
I vaguely recollect that this was an issue that someone had brought up to me

2188
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:41.681
before,

2189
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:43.210
but I never investigated it.

2190
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:46.750
Or maybe it was in conversation at the comedy store or something like that and I

2191
00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:47.710
never looked into it,

2192
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.190
but God damn it.

2193
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:51.030
This is fucking crazy.

2194
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:51.670
There's,

2195
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:53.590
there's fucking jelly in this beer.

2196
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:58.440
What do you mean what's blackberry?

2197
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.720
This is going to done a drink.

2198
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:03.340
It fucking Knott's Berry Park.

2199
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:04.683
Can I see what it says?

2200
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:05.943
What is it?

2201
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.930
It's really sweet.

2202
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.490
It tasted okay.

2203
00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.473
All right.

2204
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:12.970
Moving on.

2205
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:13.710
These new wave.

2206
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:14.500
It was a really good,

2207
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:14.651
oh,

2208
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:15.431
I got to try in a way,

2209
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:16.151
but it was great.

2210
00:58:16.151 --> 00:58:17.710
It's from New Mexico local beer.

2211
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:18.573
All right.

2212
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:19.583
Um,

2213
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:21.440
thank you man.

2214
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.340
That's a great thing about doing your show and I've listened to you go off on

2215
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:26.080
these rips for so long.

2216
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:27.071
I got to watch it.

2217
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:29.560
No o'clock in the morning because my don Gavin,

2218
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.120
but I got to watch it.

2219
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:31.954
No o'clock shit.

2220
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.381
Big Guy.

2221
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:32.830
Yeah.

2222
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:33.663
I gotta Watch.

2223
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.361
I gotta watch it.

2224
00:58:34.361 --> 00:58:37.690
No o'clock in the morning because I'm on a dish in a,

2225
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:40.540
in a and it uses up too much bandwidth to keep watching.

2226
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:42.280
But if I'm up at nine o'clock in the morning,

2227
00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:42.730
I'm,

2228
00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:45.820
I'm checking out what you've been doing and you fucking kill me man.

2229
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:46.750
And it's great.

2230
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.030
And that's why I was so,

2231
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:50.170
I mean I didn't,

2232
00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:50.791
I didn't approach it.

2233
00:58:50.791 --> 00:58:51.230
One,

2234
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:53.670
I don't think I might have approached a couple of,

2235
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.050
like a very few people I approached to,

2236
00:58:56.051 --> 00:58:57.520
can we come on and do your thing?

2237
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:58.743
Do your show.

2238
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:00.220
You're one of the only ones,

2239
00:59:00.221 --> 00:59:00.550
man.

2240
00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:02.860
And then I'm so glad send you in the last one.

2241
00:59:02.861 --> 00:59:03.350
We're doing it.

2242
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:04.061
This is it.

2243
00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:04.894
I'm done.

2244
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.033
Thank you very much.

2245
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:07.090
It's an honor for me.

2246
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:10.810
I knew I could trust you for me arriving as test pattern boy at the end of

2247
00:59:10.811 --> 00:59:12.880
fucking a hundred interviews like,

2248
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:15.580
well let's go back and now what you'd like to call it,

2249
00:59:15.581 --> 00:59:17.080
a rape Barry deal as that.

2250
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.630
What good is it a sexual assault or rape?

2251
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:21.620
Can we go,

2252
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.820
I'm going to go ahead and use that word.

2253
00:59:22.821 --> 00:59:23.031
Great,

2254
00:59:23.031 --> 00:59:23.864
but it's not all right.

2255
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:27.610
One thing that really sort of kind of defines you and how,

2256
00:59:27.611 --> 00:59:28.160
how,

2257
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.270
how you approach things.

2258
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:30.020
Very good beer.

2259
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:30.570
It's very good,

2260
00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:31.020
right?

2261
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:31.300
Yes.

2262
00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.070
The waiver,

2263
00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:32.630
um,

2264
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:33.463
that you,

2265
00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.280
you,

2266
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:39.200
you said that if that guy was alive that you would want to show him that he

2267
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:39.650
didn't,

2268
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:40.760
he didn't strike you.

2269
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:41.683
That's right.

2270
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:42.290
I,

2271
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:43.123
you know,

2272
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:47.810
I would show him that my personal revenge would be to behave decently towards

2273
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:51.620
him and he'd been advocate for him to be in a situation confined in,

2274
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:55.820
segregated from any possibility of being near children where he was treated in a

2275
00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:57.290
humane fashion.

2276
00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.131
And if,

2277
00:59:58.131 --> 00:59:58.911
and if he weren't,

2278
00:59:58.911 --> 00:59:59.391
I would tell him,

2279
00:59:59.391 --> 01:00:02.030
you could tell me and I would do something about it because I did not,

2280
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.550
I became a human rights activist and not a rapist,

2281
01:00:04.551 --> 01:00:05.340
not a,

2282
01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:05.620
not,

2283
01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:06.980
not a human rights defender.

2284
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.570
And so you didn't win you,

2285
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:13.850
the light that was extinguished in new was never extinguished in me.

2286
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:14.840
It's survived.

2287
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.270
And I'm so fortunate that it did.

2288
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:20.990
I would have probably said that and then killed them for sure.

2289
01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:21.710
Oh,

2290
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:22.730
I stopped spiders.

2291
01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.430
I'm not a big fan of poisonous things.

2292
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.091
Yeah.

2293
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:26.271
Well,

2294
01:00:26.271 --> 01:00:26.930
I understand,

2295
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:31.040
I understand well that I didn't experience what you experienced and you have

2296
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.060
obviously your,

2297
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:35.530
your anything wouldn't be consumed by the consumer.

2298
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.450
You are very strong person to,

2299
01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:41.570
to go that path and to go that route and that's indicative of who you,

2300
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.351
who you became.

2301
01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:46.430
And that's one of the reasons I think ironically like why you became such a

2302
01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:51.140
strong leader in this powerful person as because you overcame something

2303
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:55.700
unfucking bearably traumatic very early in your life and you developed this

2304
01:00:55.701 --> 01:00:57.650
intense sense of right and wrong.

2305
01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.550
I think this is a bit of a great time to tell people they should follow me on

2306
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:05.270
Twitter at Cremins CSI mmis.

2307
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:06.830
Let's see the record.

2308
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:09.720
We can send forth followers right now at this moment at Cremins.

2309
01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:10.011
I was,

2310
01:01:10.011 --> 01:01:12.170
when he was talking about me,

2311
01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:12.800
Barry.

2312
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.633
Oh

2313
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.280
I see is the moment.

2314
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:21.020
This has been the weirdest,

2315
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:26.050
hardest movie I can the Mammo big movie cause big foot.

2316
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.140
It's scary and it was fun.

2317
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.851
Oh,

2318
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.080
I got to hear you guys talk.

2319
01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:32.290
I got to show a picture that I think he's going to dig.

2320
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:32.571
Oh,

2321
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:34.880
is it the lizard guy that lives here?

2322
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:37.580
Hey,

2323
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:37.971
hello.

2324
01:01:37.971 --> 01:01:39.710
All of Joe Rogan's followers.

2325
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:40.880
All you crazy.

2326
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:41.773
God Damn.

2327
01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:42.613
Uh,

2328
01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.060
what,

2329
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.560
what would you describe your politics?

2330
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:46.640
Let's try not to.

2331
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:47.061
Okay,

2332
01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:47.450
good.

2333
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.951
I think it's,

2334
01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:49.100
I'm trying not to define

2335
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.070
my politics are wait for the aliens to land my politics.

2336
01:01:54.071 --> 01:01:57.830
I like my politics are never trust anyone who wants to be in charge.

2337
01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.090
That's perfect.

2338
01:01:59.091 --> 01:01:59.481
Yeah.

2339
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:00.830
And nobody wants to be presidents.

2340
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:01.820
Shouldn't be president.

2341
01:02:01.821 --> 01:02:02.480
I was fucked.

2342
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.080
I have a,

2343
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.430
I have an idea that people,

2344
01:02:04.431 --> 01:02:07.430
it should be like jury duty and that she can be absolutely.

2345
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:07.790
Yeah,

2346
01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:08.601
absolutely.

2347
01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:08.841
And then,

2348
01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:09.081
you know,

2349
01:02:09.081 --> 01:02:09.321
hey,

2350
01:02:09.321 --> 01:02:11.390
I'm going to go try and do us proud for a week.

2351
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.661
I mean,

2352
01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:12.051
I like,

2353
01:02:12.051 --> 01:02:13.520
I ran the Ding Ho I did that shit.

2354
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.500
I could have parlayed that into something,

2355
01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:17.480
but I just knew we needed something.

2356
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:19.440
I didn't want to be fucking and charge.

2357
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:19.951
Fuck that.

2358
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:21.270
I want to do my shit.

2359
01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:23.880
I think they have to approve of it by height.

2360
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:24.743
Yeah.

2361
01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.470
How did the Dang,

2362
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:26.280
well I'm out.

2363
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:26.551
Did,

2364
01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:27.384
how did,

2365
01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.330
how did the thing wind up closing?

2366
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.540
Lee lost the,

2367
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:33.900
uh,

2368
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.900
the tax money in a Marshawn game for real.

2369
01:02:36.901 --> 01:02:38.610
I sold out four shows on Saturday.

2370
01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.050
I went over to pick up my notebook.

2371
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:40.481
I'm Monday,

2372
01:02:40.481 --> 01:02:42.060
there's fucking plywood on the door.

2373
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:45.130
And the ultimate thing home not here cause it,

2374
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.871
the joke is,

2375
01:02:45.871 --> 01:02:46.500
you know,

2376
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.550
I used to call the club,

2377
01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:50.220
I'd be out on the road and I would call in on Saturday and had to see it and

2378
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:50.851
just got old guy.

2379
01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:54.660
Henry is like an 82 year old Chinese guy who took the takeout or it's on the

2380
01:02:54.661 --> 01:02:54.940
phone.

2381
01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.790
I would call up and I would say,

2382
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:57.841
Hey Henry,

2383
01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:00.210
it's Barry Barry not here to hang out.

2384
01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:01.231
And he got to get,

2385
01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:02.160
and this is back in the day,

2386
01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:04.410
you got to get another $2 and 85 cents and change.

2387
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:04.561
Couldn't,

2388
01:03:04.561 --> 01:03:04.711
couldn't,

2389
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:05.790
couldn't go Henry.

2390
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.260
You know,

2391
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.520
I want to order,

2392
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.470
Shun Lee on the phone,

2393
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:10.711
you know,

2394
01:03:10.711 --> 01:03:13.930
like I would have to figure some way to break through his belly and not here.

2395
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:16.050
So it turned into my friend,

2396
01:03:16.051 --> 01:03:17.340
the late great John Brown.

2397
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.510
Uh,

2398
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.931
you know,

2399
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:21.890
the man who wants the man who won the man.

2400
01:03:21.891 --> 01:03:25.260
How you fuck the man who wants puked in a wishing well?

2401
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:26.363
Um,

2402
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:30.870
the Patterson Kremlin for it's berry one with you.

2403
01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:31.360
Just it.

2404
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:31.770
Okay.

2405
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:32.603
How about yours?

2406
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:35.370
I was watching the movie editing and I was like,

2407
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:36.420
holy crap.

2408
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:41.130
Well this is a lot of bigfoot sightings in upstate New York.

2409
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:41.970
Well that's my thing.

2410
01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:43.500
I just do movies about it.

2411
01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:44.860
Harry mysterious man that

2412
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.610
I was awesome point.

2413
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:50.670
But it doesn't matter.

2414
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.260
It's because Bob had to mark,

2415
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.640
you were talking about calling up the Ding Ho and then

2416
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:56.880
came to dinner.

2417
01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.631
Hung out here.

2418
01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:58.760
I don't remember the rest of it.

2419
01:03:58.830 --> 01:03:59.663
It was

2420
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.310
still,

2421
01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:03.330
it wasn't enough of a prompt til it's gone.

2422
01:04:03.331 --> 01:04:04.920
I have a compartmentalized memory.

2423
01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:08.770
I've had a lot and plus I've had a lot of concussions because I played a little

2424
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:09.740
ball and my day.

2425
01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:13.110
Oh Mac in the day when spearing was legal.

2426
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:13.741
Yeah.

2427
01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:14.940
And widely practiced.

2428
01:04:14.941 --> 01:04:15.774
The Gallup man.

2429
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.010
Did you enjoy France?

2430
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:18.980
Alameda's a documentary or friend?

2431
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.120
Great job fan was a big help.

2432
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:21.811
And our movie,

2433
01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:24.990
He gave us a footage that wasn't used in that,

2434
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:26.850
so that was a big help.

2435
01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:31.920
It was the first real chance for me to go on record about a lot of stuff and

2436
01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:32.551
then us.

2437
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:36.450
And then some of that was stuff Bob ended up using it in our film.

2438
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:36.901
So yeah,

2439
01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:37.740
I enjoyed it a lot.

2440
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.290
You are in this,

2441
01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:40.770
uh,

2442
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:45.300
this is positioned now with this film coming out to help a lot of people.

2443
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.011
I think this,

2444
01:04:46.011 --> 01:04:47.690
this film is not just going to,

2445
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.833
you know,

2446
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.630
tell your story and,

2447
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:50.940
and,

2448
01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:51.241
and,

2449
01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:51.730
you know,

2450
01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:54.630
open up a lot of people's eyes as to I hope so.

2451
01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:54.880
Oh,

2452
01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.340
the AOL situation on it.

2453
01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.930
But I think a lot of people,

2454
01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.141
you know,

2455
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:00.260
you're such a powerful guy that I'm hearing from them,

2456
01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:00.660
Joe,

2457
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.411
I'm sure you are.

2458
01:05:01.411 --> 01:05:01.690
And,

2459
01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:02.160
and,

2460
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:02.461
and,

2461
01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:02.731
you know,

2462
01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:03.150
and they,

2463
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:08.150
they know how to find me or they will find me and I'll do what I can.

2464
01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.753
Um,

2465
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:14.460
some I give everybody as much of a chance as I can.

2466
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:15.383
Um,

2467
01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.020
there's a line of what sold

2468
01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.590
<v 3>to abuse survivors and I think it's horse shit.</v>

2469
01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:24.370
And that's basically they get quote unquote empowered,

2470
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:27.580
and I hate that word because it takes the strength out of the word power.

2471
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:28.121
What's,

2472
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:33.121
what sounds you like more like power power or empowered empowers like sandy

2473
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.190
making a wear Birkenstocks or something.

2474
01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:37.960
So I'm not that big on mpowered,

2475
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:40.810
but they like I did,

2476
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:41.380
uh,

2477
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:42.220
my friends Sam seed,

2478
01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:45.340
there's a podcast a couple of weeks back and,

2479
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:46.900
and he said,

2480
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:48.340
I don't want to give away with the movies.

2481
01:05:48.341 --> 01:05:48.641
I said,

2482
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:49.271
listen man,

2483
01:05:49.271 --> 01:05:50.440
it's not that kind of movie.

2484
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:53.890
And it hinges largely on the fact that I survived raped as a child.

2485
01:05:53.891 --> 01:05:55.870
Well I heard from several people said,

2486
01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:56.651
you know,

2487
01:05:56.651 --> 01:05:58.750
you really should have had a trigger warning on there.

2488
01:05:58.751 --> 01:05:59.440
And it's like,

2489
01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.640
what the fuck do you shake?

2490
01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:01.474
I was doing,

2491
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:06.010
what the fuck do you think I was doing when I said it hinges largely I was

2492
01:06:06.011 --> 01:06:08.560
warning you that what it was about right there.

2493
01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.100
But someone has empowered you to,

2494
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:15.270
to have a way to take issue with me because I'm not completely basing,

2495
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.490
I like the whole world isn't based around me.

2496
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:20.590
Even though I got raped when I was four years old,

2497
01:06:20.591 --> 01:06:23.650
everybody shouldn't be thinking in terms of that all the time because they'd

2498
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:26.050
been through their own shit and they're dealing with their own shit and they're

2499
01:06:26.051 --> 01:06:27.010
trying to survive.

2500
01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.290
So if I can make them more sensitive to this issue,

2501
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:31.300
if I can show them that it matters to them,

2502
01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:35.080
is that they deal with other people who have been through this kind of trauma

2503
01:06:35.081 --> 01:06:38.680
and we want to reduce it as much as absolutely possible.

2504
01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.813
That's good.

2505
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.780
But after that,

2506
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.070
if I'm going to find a way to set up a situation where I'm always the injured

2507
01:06:45.071 --> 01:06:49.990
party and that prove again and again that I'm persecuted and no one's thinking

2508
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:51.010
in terms of me,

2509
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:53.110
then I'm never going to get fucking healed.

2510
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:54.970
I'm never going to get fucking healed.

2511
01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:58.540
So one I did was I went out and I tried to help other people.

2512
01:06:58.550 --> 01:06:59.950
When I help other people,

2513
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.600
I realize how far along I've come and I realized there's really something in it

2514
01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:06.040
for me to do that.

2515
01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:08.110
And it's not like I'm this altruistic guy.

2516
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.880
It's like I'm saving my own life.

2517
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:12.970
And you know like that AOL investigation that took such courage to do it.

2518
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:13.690
No.

2519
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:17.560
What would have taken courage was turning my back on those kids and walking away

2520
01:07:17.561 --> 01:07:17.830
going like,

2521
01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:18.071
Ooh,

2522
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:20.590
I don't want to know what's going on in there.

2523
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:21.060
I,

2524
01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.450
how would I live with that guy?

2525
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.070
How would I live with myself then?

2526
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:24.611
But they,

2527
01:07:24.611 --> 01:07:24.821
you know,

2528
01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:25.571
like I is nice.

2529
01:07:25.571 --> 01:07:26.170
Everyone said,

2530
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:26.741
Oh gee,

2531
01:07:26.741 --> 01:07:29.080
that what he went through when he was doing that investigation.

2532
01:07:29.081 --> 01:07:31.090
What about the kids in the fucking pictures?

2533
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:33.010
That's what I want everyone to know about.

2534
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:34.510
Thanks for caring about me,

2535
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:36.940
but it's the kids in the pictures I give a shit about.

2536
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:40.630
It's the kids that are suffering right now somewhere within the sound of my

2537
01:07:40.631 --> 01:07:41.320
voice.

2538
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.700
Someone you know,

2539
01:07:42.701 --> 01:07:47.701
I mean in this broadcast like where this is on someone in the next apartment or

2540
01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:51.940
wherever some kid is going through this shit,

2541
01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.860
have the courage to know about it.

2542
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:54.723
That's all I asked.

2543
01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:59.500
You have the courage to know about it and save the contemporary children so you

2544
01:07:59.501 --> 01:08:01.810
don't have to deal with a much a fucking maniac.

2545
01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:04.150
Abuse survivors went up.

2546
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.230
That's all.

2547
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:08.980
And if anybody can diffuse the turn arounds Cape guys coming in now,

2548
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:13.900
if anybody can diffuse the term trigger warning,

2549
01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:15.010
you're the fucking guy.

2550
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.070
Well thanks Jesus.

2551
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:17.540
<v 4>God Damn Christ stop.</v>

2552
01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:18.110
We're going to,

2553
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:20.720
we're going to develop a nation of permanent children.

2554
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.080
Like if anybody can tell their story and doesn't need a fucking trigger warning,

2555
01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:27.950
it's you and this,

2556
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:28.611
this idea.

2557
01:08:28.611 --> 01:08:28.941
I don't,

2558
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:30.020
I don't need trigger warnings.

2559
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:31.280
If you're going to show me something,

2560
01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:32.150
show me something I,

2561
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:33.380
and if I don't want to see it,

2562
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.450
let me know what it is before you show me a little,

2563
01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:36.230
tell me what the,

2564
01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:37.020
the,

2565
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.950
we all knew that the documentary was about no need a goddamn trigger.

2566
01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.960
This fucking term is disgusting.

2567
01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.750
It's disgusting term does damage.

2568
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:47.480
It just sets people up to sit,

2569
01:08:47.481 --> 01:08:48.314
stay in the pit,

2570
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:48.860
you know,

2571
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:49.693
to wallow.

2572
01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:51.590
It's empowering them to wallow like,

2573
01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:54.070
well I've got hurting again cause the whole set,

2574
01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:56.120
it's like [inaudible] shit man.

2575
01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.440
But I'm telling you what,

2576
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.570
I know you're in a pit of your own shit.

2577
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.270
I know you're used to the temperature and the smell of it doesn't mean you're

2578
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:02.811
used to that.

2579
01:09:02.811 --> 01:09:04.310
And it doesn't bother you that much any more.

2580
01:09:04.311 --> 01:09:07.850
But when you stand up and they fucking hose you off and then you go in the house

2581
01:09:07.851 --> 01:09:10.220
and take a real shower and put on some clean clothes,

2582
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:13.820
you're not going to believe how much better you feel.

2583
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:18.940
So stop letting other people tell you that you have to expect the world to do

2584
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:20.061
the impossible.

2585
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:23.330
And that's be there like telepathic about what the fuck you been through.

2586
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:27.200
Get to the point where you can stand up and tell them the story yourself when

2587
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:31.370
it's appropriate and don't put up with anybody who was truly being insensitive

2588
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:33.140
or snickering about any of this shit.

2589
01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.670
Fuck people who tell me,

2590
01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.650
people walk up to me all the time and tell me like,

2591
01:09:36.651 --> 01:09:36.921
well,

2592
01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:38.930
you know liquid thing is those guys get arrested.

2593
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:40.770
You know I and booboo took a,

2594
01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.190
it's like you're endorsing rape to me.

2595
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:45.110
You're fucking endorsing Rick to me,

2596
01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:45.770
motherfucker.

2597
01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:47.240
I don't want anyone raped ever.

2598
01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:48.380
Not even rapist.

2599
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:49.520
Rape is illegal.

2600
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:51.860
How about making jails lawful places?

2601
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:52.970
How about that for an idea?

2602
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:57.370
How about from someone going to jail and realizing the law protects me sometime

2603
01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:58.310
I'm not going to be raped.

2604
01:09:58.311 --> 01:09:59.570
I'm not going to be managed here.

2605
01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.510
I'm going to,

2606
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:03.320
and maybe Dale will start thinking about getting reformed.

2607
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:04.400
But Jesus Christ,

2608
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:06.080
don't joke to me about rec.

2609
01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:09.770
Don't tell me you want them all killed and sweep them under that rug because I

2610
01:10:09.771 --> 01:10:11.150
was born without blood on my hands.

2611
01:10:11.151 --> 01:10:13.340
I don't want to fucking blood on my hands now man.

2612
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:18.460
So don't guess the stupid ass fucking lightweight things and presume I'm going

2613
01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:22.550
to sign off on them cause I don't I ever want anyone else ever raped.

2614
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:23.540
And if it happens,

2615
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.040
even if it's of a rapist,

2616
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.460
I'm opposed to it and I don't want them fucking kill either.

2617
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.580
Now they don't want them to live with what they did.

2618
01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:32.200
Now this is a difficult,

2619
01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:37.090
this is difficult thought and is it a difficult subject?

2620
01:10:37.091 --> 01:10:38.980
But did you,

2621
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.380
after this is all said and done,

2622
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.260
are horrendous moment in your life,

2623
01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:45.640
many moments in your life,

2624
01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:50.880
did you try to figure out what would create a person like the guy who did that

2625
01:10:51.191 --> 01:10:51.780
to you?

2626
01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.530
Did you try it?

2627
01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:52.900
I did.

2628
01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.800
How much time?

2629
01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:54.660
Yeah.

2630
01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.870
I can tell you what created him.

2631
01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.060
He was taken out of an abusive home.

2632
01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:04.050
He was put into foster care and abused many more times and he was gone and he

2633
01:11:05.021 --> 01:11:10.021
was gone and he was good and he was succumbed by the agony I was put through by

2634
01:11:10.781 --> 01:11:11.470
him.

2635
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:12.430
I survived.

2636
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:15.240
Somehow I made it so call me lucky.

2637
01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:15.991
I'm not,

2638
01:11:15.991 --> 01:11:16.950
I didn't become him.

2639
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:18.510
I didn't become what I resisted.

2640
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:19.344
I didn't,

2641
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.180
I didn't pass along the poison.

2642
01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.840
Maybe I didn't some ways when I was difficult or whatever,

2643
01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.190
but mostly I didn't.

2644
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:27.630
Mostly when I'm mad,

2645
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:29.780
I'm mad because it's like Hendrix,

2646
01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:30.960
a cry of love.

2647
01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:32.970
It's a cry of love that I make.

2648
01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:33.900
It's a cry of love.

2649
01:11:33.901 --> 01:11:35.150
My Act has been a cry of love.

2650
01:11:35.151 --> 01:11:38.370
It's like I don't want the innocent hurt anymore.

2651
01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:43.371
I don't want people victimized because of greed and cower to some bullshit,

2652
01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:44.041
you know?

2653
01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:47.820
I don't want that and so I do what I can to stand up to it.

2654
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:48.510
Did,

2655
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.880
were there moments where you wanted to talk to him?

2656
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:52.770
What do you want to talk to him?

2657
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:56.190
I would love to talk to him to show him that I been didn't become a monster like

2658
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:56.880
he was.

2659
01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.080
I W I would have.

2660
01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:01.740
I would have almost become an advocate for him in the sense that like,

2661
01:12:01.741 --> 01:12:02.400
well mate,

2662
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.170
let me know if they're mistreating you in here,

2663
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.700
but he died in prison.

2664
01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:08.430
No one claimed his body and I don't know where his grave is.

2665
01:12:08.431 --> 01:12:09.570
If I knew her as grave as I go,

2666
01:12:09.571 --> 01:12:10.740
put fucking flowers on it.

2667
01:12:10.741 --> 01:12:11.460
Not for him.

2668
01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.293
For me,

2669
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.470
the idea that someone could do that after someone did that,

2670
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:17.281
to them scenes,

2671
01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:18.750
insanely counterintuitive.

2672
01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:22.680
It's like if someone is the only thing that saves you but really saves you,

2673
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:27.060
really is redemptive in really saves you to me,

2674
01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:29.640
how well this,

2675
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:34.650
one of the things that you covered in the film that I thought was really a very

2676
01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:38.940
powerful moment where you talked about this thing that you didn't become him,

2677
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.020
that you may be if your sister didn't come down there and Kevin Dead,

2678
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:44.250
you could have been dead.

2679
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.250
It was close,

2680
01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:45.570
man.

2681
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:46.350
It was close.

2682
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:48.450
But do you also that you could have been one of them?

2683
01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:51.030
You could have been someone who that would have Peterson death.

2684
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:52.570
Yeah.

2685
01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:56.820
How I'd rather be a victim of thousand times in the perpetrator wants and that's

2686
01:12:56.821 --> 01:12:57.880
not any bullshit.

2687
01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.820
You contemplate the mechanism.

2688
01:12:59.821 --> 01:13:00.570
Did you try it?

2689
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:04.140
Have you tried to understand the mechanism that turns an abused person into an

2690
01:13:04.141 --> 01:13:04.770
abuser?

2691
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:05.290
What?

2692
01:13:05.290 --> 01:13:05.961
What is the,

2693
01:13:05.961 --> 01:13:06.421
I don't,

2694
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:09.630
I don't think I'm as nuts and bolts is zero because I listened to you and I know

2695
01:13:09.631 --> 01:13:10.350
how much,

2696
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:11.183
I mean like how,

2697
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:16.170
what detail you go into so I understand how how and what you're asking,

2698
01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:18.300
but I can't be,

2699
01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.990
there's enough of me that's been through enough that I can't be quite as

2700
01:13:21.991 --> 01:13:24.780
thorough as you're asking me to be to answer that.

2701
01:13:24.781 --> 01:13:29.370
I get as close as I can and I understand what happened,

2702
01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.630
but then after that point I,

2703
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.823
I can't,

2704
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:36.960
I'm not one of them and I can't go far enough to say,

2705
01:13:36.961 --> 01:13:40.350
well then of course if you get past this point right here,

2706
01:13:40.351 --> 01:13:41.860
then obviously this is that.

2707
01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:43.080
I can't do that.

2708
01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:46.200
It's that that is what is too much for me.

2709
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.640
I just,

2710
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.473
you know,

2711
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.780
<v 7>one of the reasons I was interested in making the movie was when,</v>

2712
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:53.450
when buried,

2713
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.750
you know,

2714
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.690
told me that the guy had died in prison.

2715
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.001
I said,

2716
01:13:57.001 --> 01:13:57.990
how'd that make you feel?

2717
01:13:57.991 --> 01:13:58.824
And he,

2718
01:13:59.000 --> 01:13:59.251
he said,

2719
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:00.390
it made me sad.

2720
01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:01.320
And I said,

2721
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.790
because you didn't get any closure,

2722
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:03.301
you know,

2723
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:04.260
you didn't get to confront him.

2724
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:04.771
And he said,

2725
01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:05.011
no,

2726
01:14:05.011 --> 01:14:05.880
he died alone.

2727
01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.191
<v 4>And,</v>

2728
01:14:07.191 --> 01:14:08.024
um,

2729
01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.460
I was really blown away by that and I thought

2730
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.510
<v 1>I should really make a movie about it.</v>

2731
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:15.800
<v 2>No,</v>

2732
01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.633
I thought,

2733
01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.080
<v 3>well,</v>

2734
01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:18.740
this is like,

2735
01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:19.130
you know,

2736
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:20.240
this is Jesus stuff,

2737
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:20.540
you know,

2738
01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.410
and that's what this is.

2739
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.190
And so,

2740
01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:25.790
so,

2741
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:26.001
you know,

2742
01:14:26.001 --> 01:14:29.090
that was what that really did motivate me to make the movie,

2743
01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:29.500
you know.

2744
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.500
And so the movie was going to be a narrative with someone else playing Barry.

2745
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.010
And I thought about that for years.

2746
01:14:37.011 --> 01:14:38.780
He tried to establish a script.

2747
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:40.700
I tried and it wasn't till,

2748
01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:41.001
you know,

2749
01:14:41.001 --> 01:14:45.710
Robin Williams was my pal and he suggested I make it as a dock.

2750
01:14:45.711 --> 01:14:47.960
This was just February,

2751
01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:48.410
2014.

2752
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:49.131
And,

2753
01:14:49.131 --> 01:14:49.221
uh,

2754
01:14:49.221 --> 01:14:49.611
I said,

2755
01:14:49.611 --> 01:14:50.331
I don't have any money.

2756
01:14:50.331 --> 01:14:50.571
He says,

2757
01:14:50.571 --> 01:14:51.261
I'll give you some money.

2758
01:14:51.261 --> 01:14:51.891
You can start it.

2759
01:14:51.891 --> 01:14:55.160
Cause he was a fan of berries and he knew Barry's story.

2760
01:14:55.161 --> 01:14:57.080
So that's really how the movie came together.

2761
01:14:57.081 --> 01:14:58.340
It came together really fast.

2762
01:14:58.341 --> 01:14:58.970
I didn't realize,

2763
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:59.630
uh,

2764
01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:01.370
how long it takes to make a doc.

2765
01:15:01.371 --> 01:15:02.150
You know,

2766
01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:03.200
cause when I was at Sundance,

2767
01:15:03.201 --> 01:15:04.430
other directors are going,

2768
01:15:04.431 --> 01:15:04.521
yeah,

2769
01:15:04.521 --> 01:15:05.900
we started seven years ago.

2770
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.113
It's seriously,

2771
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:09.080
I started four years ago and I was like,

2772
01:15:09.081 --> 01:15:11.360
I started February and they didn't go,

2773
01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:11.931
hey,

2774
01:15:11.931 --> 01:15:12.411
all right.

2775
01:15:12.411 --> 01:15:12.890
They're like,

2776
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:13.723
hmm.

2777
01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.713
Okay.

2778
01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.820
Well good luck with that Bob.

2779
01:15:16.821 --> 01:15:17.654
Scratch.

2780
01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:20.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2781
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:25.450
<v 0>How difficult was it to even attempt to tell the story for you as a person who</v>

2782
01:15:26.631 --> 01:15:28.880
loves this guy and as we know?

2783
01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:29.151
No,

2784
01:15:29.151 --> 01:15:30.140
he's out of the room right now.

2785
01:15:30.141 --> 01:15:30.500
He's so,

2786
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.820
it was so instrumental.

2787
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:32.803
He was such a,

2788
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:35.060
he was the foundation of that whole community,

2789
01:15:35.061 --> 01:15:37.250
which I think and how important to you and me

2790
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.671
<v 3>and,</v>

2791
01:15:37.671 --> 01:15:38.790
and help mold me,

2792
01:15:38.791 --> 01:15:39.390
you know,

2793
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.930
as it,

2794
01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:41.220
cause I met him when I was 16.

2795
01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.090
Right.

2796
01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:43.250
So it's,

2797
01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:43.921
you know,

2798
01:15:43.921 --> 01:15:48.420
making it a movie that's not a work of fiction with someone you love that you

2799
01:15:48.421 --> 01:15:53.421
want them to like when it's done and you want people to like the movie and him

2800
01:15:54.361 --> 01:15:56.010
for the same reason you like him.

2801
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.481
It was hard.

2802
01:15:57.481 --> 01:15:57.930
It was,

2803
01:15:57.930 --> 01:15:58.740
it wasn't,

2804
01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:59.161
you know,

2805
01:15:59.161 --> 01:16:01.140
like people will talk about making a move in,

2806
01:16:01.141 --> 01:16:02.790
let's say that was hard no matter what.

2807
01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:03.571
I never think,

2808
01:16:03.571 --> 01:16:03.960
you know.

2809
01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.200
But,

2810
01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.850
but seeing that this is real people,

2811
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.260
I don't want to embarrass anyone.

2812
01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:08.094
I don't want to,

2813
01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.300
I don't want to,

2814
01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:10.051
<v 2>no,</v>

2815
01:16:10.051 --> 01:16:10.590
I don't want it.

2816
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.801
No,

2817
01:16:10.801 --> 01:16:11.101
I know.

2818
01:16:11.101 --> 01:16:11.210
Yeah.

2819
01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:12.010
I had no idea.

2820
01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:14.880
I was thinking about how hard I made your work

2821
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:17.610
cause it's like,

2822
01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:18.443
yeah,

2823
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:19.441
there's footage,

2824
01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:19.771
you know,

2825
01:16:19.771 --> 01:16:21.320
what the fuck am I going to do it like that.

2826
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:22.201
<v 0>Did you,</v>

2827
01:16:22.201 --> 01:16:24.160
before this film came out,

2828
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.220
was there a time where you were trying to figure out how to tell your story?

2829
01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:29.501
<v 1>No.</v>

2830
01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:33.460
I mean I felt like I had told it a lot and I felt like the trail was there and

2831
01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:34.271
people could find it.

2832
01:16:34.271 --> 01:16:38.380
That this is like the dream that it gets told this way.

2833
01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:40.600
But I didn't expect it.

2834
01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:41.800
I didn't presume it.

2835
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:46.600
And I was completely honored and flattered that it was done and then it was done

2836
01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:47.440
so well.

2837
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.903
Um,

2838
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.160
but you know what I mean?

2839
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:51.311
Like,

2840
01:16:51.311 --> 01:16:53.260
part of me doesn't give a fuck about my story.

2841
01:16:53.261 --> 01:16:53.530
I mean,

2842
01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:53.951
I just,

2843
01:16:53.951 --> 01:16:54.131
like,

2844
01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:54.550
I,

2845
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:55.383
like,

2846
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:57.790
I've learned as I've grown up,

2847
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.520
I've learned not to take life personally.

2848
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:01.250
You know,

2849
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.680
I just,

2850
01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:02.513
I'm just part of it.

2851
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.080
And so unexpected to stop for me and do,

2852
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:08.890
but it has in this sense,

2853
01:17:08.891 --> 01:17:10.130
because Bob stopped it,

2854
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.450
got the footage and sequenced it and put it together and thought he's brilliant

2855
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:18.080
ways to approach it and then made this beautiful picture.

2856
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:18.321
I mean,

2857
01:17:18.321 --> 01:17:20.750
really I should say it wasn't about me.

2858
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:21.584
If I'm worried about where I'm going,

2859
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.831
I mean,

2860
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:22.160
I would,

2861
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.990
I would be out crusading to get people to watch this.

2862
01:17:24.991 --> 01:17:27.350
It just seems a modest at this point,

2863
01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:27.651
you know,

2864
01:17:27.651 --> 01:17:29.240
because it's about me.

2865
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.190
He made such a tremendous move.

2866
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:32.024
I mean like,

2867
01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:32.720
you know,

2868
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.553
there's a lot of folks,

2869
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.420
I mean Jeff's drank of the course,

2870
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:37.360
but our producer,

2871
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:39.890
your people that you put together,

2872
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.580
you know,

2873
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:41.390
uh,

2874
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.150
Bradley Stonecipher who I got to see you while I'm in town,

2875
01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:45.080
when always always see around.

2876
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:46.720
I don't know.

2877
01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.300
Yeah,

2878
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.200
we should figure that out.

2879
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:49.220
How do you follow this?

2880
01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:50.483
Uh,

2881
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.280
well we're going to do an a sequel.

2882
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.481
I'm going to,

2883
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:53.720
yeah,

2884
01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.553
call me greedy.

2885
01:17:56.730 --> 01:17:57.563
Um,

2886
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:58.011
I'm going to,

2887
01:17:58.011 --> 01:17:58.311
you know,

2888
01:17:58.311 --> 01:18:00.590
I got a book coming in and um,

2889
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.113
uh,

2890
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.990
talk about a lot of essays and,

2891
01:18:04.991 --> 01:18:05.321
and,

2892
01:18:05.321 --> 01:18:06.410
and then a lot of quips.

2893
01:18:06.411 --> 01:18:09.020
It's sort of dedicated to generation text.

2894
01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:09.921
You know,

2895
01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:13.020
the people there like I am so,

2896
01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:13.400
I mean,

2897
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.450
I'm trying to hang in there,

2898
01:18:14.451 --> 01:18:16.530
but it's like a read this shit on Pdt.

2899
01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:18.650
G O t r s h.

2900
01:18:18.651 --> 01:18:20.780
U half hour later I'm going to like

2901
01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:22.320
<v 2>pudding on other shoe.</v>

2902
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.550
What the fuck?

2903
01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:26.880
And you've got time to tell me you're putting on your other shoe,

2904
01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:27.830
but you've got to,

2905
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:29.160
what years in such a hurry,

2906
01:18:29.161 --> 01:18:30.420
you've got to abbreviate it.

2907
01:18:30.421 --> 01:18:32.100
So I can't figure out what the fuck you say.

2908
01:18:32.101 --> 01:18:32.281
So,

2909
01:18:32.281 --> 01:18:34.830
and then I have to be calm enough to try to convey this.

2910
01:18:34.831 --> 01:18:35.371
Okay.

2911
01:18:35.371 --> 01:18:35.850
Kids?

2912
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:36.250
Yes.

2913
01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:39.180
M H is my least favorite one is shake my head.

2914
01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:40.840
Oh

2915
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.961
yeah,

2916
01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:43.201
no,

2917
01:18:43.201 --> 01:18:45.390
I and the whole and the whole Emoji thing.

2918
01:18:45.391 --> 01:18:46.350
I'm a grown man.

2919
01:18:46.351 --> 01:18:46.890
It's like,

2920
01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:47.491
come on,

2921
01:18:47.491 --> 01:18:48.390
I make smiley faces.

2922
01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:49.224
I'm so sorry.

2923
01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:50.200
I never did.

2924
01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.730
I needed to get him here to,

2925
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.130
why are they all send them to me?

2926
01:18:53.131 --> 01:18:53.964
The whole customer.

2927
01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:57.180
I sent one to my friend Paul and he's like,

2928
01:18:57.181 --> 01:18:58.740
did you fucking send me a smiley face?

2929
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:01.030
I actually,

2930
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:03.010
I actually texted enough women that I,

2931
01:19:03.011 --> 01:19:05.010
I put smiley face emoticon on it.

2932
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.590
I don't have any emojis,

2933
01:19:07.591 --> 01:19:08.790
but I do look the dot.

2934
01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:09.170
Dot.

2935
01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:10.003
Smiling.

2936
01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:10.681
I,

2937
01:19:10.681 --> 01:19:12.000
every time I upgrade my phone,

2938
01:19:12.001 --> 01:19:14.520
they put like a million more of these things on there and then I hit it by

2939
01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:14.881
mistake.

2940
01:19:14.881 --> 01:19:15.690
I'm trying to,

2941
01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:17.970
I sent me a Christmas tree that's puking.

2942
01:19:17.971 --> 01:19:18.680
I don't know.

2943
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.730
I don't know if he's happy or mad drunk.

2944
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:22.583
Christmas tree.

2945
01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.581
My low,

2946
01:19:23.581 --> 01:19:23.971
low,

2947
01:19:23.971 --> 01:19:24.211
low,

2948
01:19:24.211 --> 01:19:24.391
low,

2949
01:19:24.391 --> 01:19:24.790
low.

2950
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:26.670
Like we're regressing.

2951
01:19:26.671 --> 01:19:26.911
Yeah,

2952
01:19:26.911 --> 01:19:27.744
yeah,

2953
01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:28.370
yeah.

2954
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:33.370
With hieroglyphs to 100% and then I got a deer with an Arrow pointing at it and

2955
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:35.760
said,

2956
01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.890
what the fuck does that mean?

2957
01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:39.060
Very depressed guys wearing skins.

2958
01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.430
Know Suicidal Emoji.

2959
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:42.340
It's like how are they?

2960
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:43.470
Are they are?

2961
01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:43.910
They are.

2962
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:44.190
They are.

2963
01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:47.160
So many people will communicate with God and we need the ones we need.

2964
01:19:47.161 --> 01:19:50.970
You know the fart pile of dog shit.

2965
01:19:50.971 --> 01:19:51.750
That's another one,

2966
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:52.130

2969
01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:55.320

2971

2974
01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:04.640

2975
01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.260
That's mine.

2976
01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.860
That's my old Hercules movie bitch.

2977
01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.231
Oh,

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:10.440
but everybody,

2981
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.180

2982
01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:11.630
Ah,

2983
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:12.463

2984
01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:14.430
But now is that at first I asked Gil.

2985
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.313

<v 4>that's I'm bombing.</v>

2988
01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.480

2989
01:20:20.481 --> 01:20:21.200

2990

2992
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.651
Oh,

2993
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.040

2994
01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.010
I mean pre that was Hercules movies.

2995
01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.090
I told me that stuff on boulder.

2996
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:29.810

01:20:34.581 --> 01:20:35.414
my friend,

3003
01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.220
you will come around and you know,

3004
01:20:37.221 --> 01:20:39.410
I understand this is not a bottling joke.

3005
01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.880
Well on audio,

3006
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.760
vast majority of our listeners are just that.

3007
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:49.970
Listeners should I maybe like less than 10% probably watch this.

3008
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:52.243
Perfect.

3009
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:53.481
It's better.

3010

you've got an Instagram.

3137
01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.960
I don't use it much but I,

3138
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.970
Twitter is kind of perfect for me cause I'm pithy joke guy.

3139
01:23:49.210 --> 01:23:49.541
Right,

3140
01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:49.781

Mitch Hedberg and Steven.

3145
01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.320
Steven did when he,

3146
01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:00.010
when,

3147
01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:01.450
when he was using Twitter a lot.

3148
01:24:01.730 --> 01:24:02.380
He,

3149
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.100
he wrote a book.

3150
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:03.371

3151
01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:03.740

3152
01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:03.960

3154
01:24:04.151 --> 01:24:04.690
He was,

3155
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:05.730
he was riding a bike.

3156
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:06.031
What?

3157
01:24:06.031 --> 01:24:07.300
I've read a book or on Twitter,

3158
01:24:07.301 --> 01:24:09.230
funny for 140 characters at a time.

3159
01:24:09.231 --> 01:24:11.410
I imagine getting to know him for all these years.

3160
01:24:11.411 --> 01:24:11.651
I mean,

3161
01:24:11.651 --> 01:24:12.071
he's like,

3162
01:24:12.071 --> 01:24:12.940
one of my dear says,

3163
01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.530
Eh,

any,

3165

we don't see each other that often when we do.

3166
01:24:16.061 --> 01:24:20.200
It's just like talk about just picking right up from where you were the last

3167
01:24:20.201 --> 01:24:21.034
time.

3168
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:23.830
And he came up and saw me out of nowhere.

3169
01:24:23.831 --> 01:24:25.300
That's why he knew in the movie,

3170
01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:29.170
we know when he says in the movie it's like throw had a computer.

3171
01:24:29.710 --> 01:24:30.543
Uh,

3172
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:30.851
he,

3173
01:24:30.851 --> 01:24:35.620
cause he was there [inaudible] he drove out to see me from Massachusetts just

3174
01:24:35.621 --> 01:24:38.550
cause he kind of went on to get some context and then,

3175
01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:39.170
and you know,

3176
01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:39.610

he's so honest and he's,

3178
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.191
Oh,

3179
01:24:42.191 --> 01:24:44.650
I'm so glad now I in my head,

3180
01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.370
I know where you,

3181
01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:45.641
you know,

3182
01:24:45.641 --> 01:24:46.720
it's just so great.

3183
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.170
You know.

3184
01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:48.280
So he's back in Boston.

3185
01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.060
Steven Wright is,

3186
01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:49.310
well,

3187
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:50.260
he lives there,

3188
01:24:50.261 --> 01:24:50.711
but you know,

3189
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:51.780
I mean he goes out and does,

3190
01:24:52.210 --> 01:24:52.750
you know,

3191
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:55.420
as many dates as he wants to live in Massachusetts.

3192
01:24:55.421 --> 01:24:56.260
I'm not sure what,

3193
01:24:56.261 --> 01:24:56.680
hey look,

3194
01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.920
he lives kind of on one.

3195
01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:58.841
You know,

3196
01:24:58.841 --> 01:24:59.190
I,

3197
01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:00.700
I don't want to say exactly where he lives.

3198
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:04.870
It's up near the debt for if you went to one of the,

3199
01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.550
cause he pissed off the Juggalos.

3200
01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:08.670
No,

3201
01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.620
see I keep hearing about the Jones.

3202
01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:12.550
I did the gathering.

3203
01:25:12.551 --> 01:25:15.850
How was it horrible as you'd imagine.

3204
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:16.330
Yeah,

3205
01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:18.220
I would imagine it would be it the same.

3206
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:19.140
It was in the same,

3207
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:20.530
there's no security,

3208
01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:21.940
there's no lights,

3209
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:26.970
there's no just people selling bath salts and fighting and,

3210
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.690
and there's a video of a girl just pulling down her pants and a bunch of guys

3211
01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:33.340
just fucking hair at the,

3212
01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:34.151
I've seen that one.

3213
01:25:34.151 --> 01:25:36.950
Well it's probably just one video of many.

3214
01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.890
<v 3>The Tila Tequila footage where they ran out of Phaco to throw at her,</v>

3215
01:25:43.530 --> 01:25:43.870
cause they,

3216
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:45.650
they've sprayed Taylor with Phaco Cola.

3217
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:47.060
So they,

3218
01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:52.060
they just knocked over the outhouses and just started throwing shit at it.

3219
01:25:52.081 --> 01:25:52.750
Yeah.

3220
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:56.730
I stress human because like if you and I were walking down the street and you

3221
01:25:56.731 --> 01:25:58.610
picked up some dog poo and hit me with it,

3222
01:25:58.611 --> 01:25:59.331
I'd be mad.

3223
01:25:59.331 --> 01:26:00.770
But later on we'd be pals.

3224
01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:02.750
We laugh it off.

3225
01:26:02.751 --> 01:26:03.100
I got,

3226
01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:03.751
what the fuck you,

3227
01:26:03.751 --> 01:26:04.190
we were dog

3228
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:04.401
<v 2>shit.</v>

3229
01:26:04.401 --> 01:26:05.230
But you know,

3230
01:26:05.230 --> 01:26:06.470
if it was like Hobo Duke,

3231
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:07.430
that'd be it.

3232
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:08.570
That'd be a deal breaker.

3233
01:26:08.571 --> 01:26:09.890
We wouldn't be pails anymore.

3234
01:26:10.450 --> 01:26:11.283
Oh Shit.

3235
01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:14.900
Oh whoa dude.

3236
01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:18.580
So whole new bad politics tonight with Hitler's Judaism.

3237
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:23.660
So I had let my opening act was up,

3238
01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:28.661
check the clown and he's driving me around the grounds in a golf cart and people

3239
01:26:29.281 --> 01:26:30.200
are in the jugglers.

3240
01:26:30.210 --> 01:26:32.150
I getting out of the way like who are the millionaires?

3241
01:26:32.151 --> 01:26:32.440
You know,

3242
01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.100
so this Juggalos runs up,

3243
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:41.500
runs alongside the golf cart and then just start punching the fuck out of oak

3244
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:42.020
check.

3245
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.380
That's why you're talking about pod.

3246
01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.530
It drive by beating.

3247
01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:46.130
He just started wailing on him and he's like,

3248
01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:48.460
fuck you.

3249
01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:49.293
You don't know.

3250
01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:50.200
You don't really frosted.

3251
01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.550
My cake in this whole exchange was,

3252
01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:53.570
I remember he was saying,

3253
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:55.430
you've got nothing to worry about.

3254
01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:59.090
This is like a Dave Matthews concert and then he gets punched

3255
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:03.980
Jimmy Walker and Ron Jeremy.

3256
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:07.143
That's Joel.

3257
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:08.323
And um,

3258
01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:08.901
no,

3259
01:27:08.901 --> 01:27:09.940
but like the idea that like,

3260
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.660
I'll talk to bobcat and the language,

3261
01:27:11.661 --> 01:27:12.494
you can understand,

3262
01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.940
it's like a Dave Matthews concert.

3263
01:27:13.941 --> 01:27:14.480
I'm like,

3264
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.880
I wouldn't go see Dave Matthews.

3265
01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:19.400
I think he's trying to say it's six chill.

3266
01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:19.970
Yeah.

3267
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:20.960
Dave Matthews conscious.

3268
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.580
You know what I gotta say this crowd,

3269
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:23.391
they were really nice,

3270
01:27:23.391 --> 01:27:27.980
but then a object got hit in the hand with a guy hit in the head with a can of

3271
01:27:27.981 --> 01:27:32.981
Phaco and it and he kind of slumped over the steering wheel unconscious and he's

3272
01:27:33.051 --> 01:27:34.350
like steer

3273
01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.940
steering with a semi conscious clone.

3274
01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:43.340
God can get you to repeat the,

3275
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:46.340
I don't think I remember that game show story from Australia,

3276
01:27:46.341 --> 01:27:47.900
but I can't remember that story.

3277
01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.793
But

3278
01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.220
adding this woman's Buzzer,

3279
01:27:52.221 --> 01:27:53.180
I was on a game show,

3280
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:56.803
Sophie,

3281
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:57.643
that was her day

3282
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:00.590
hitting my budget.

3283
01:28:00.591 --> 01:28:00.801
I go,

3284
01:28:00.801 --> 01:28:01.221
Hey lady,

3285
01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:01.881
if you're going to lose,

3286
01:28:01.881 --> 01:28:02.714
just lose.

3287
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.260
Don't drag me into this.

3288
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:09.410
Oh Man.

3289
01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:09.821
<v 4>Wow,</v>

3290
01:28:09.821 --> 01:28:10.780
that's great for a Friday.

3291
01:28:10.781 --> 01:28:11.171
Nigeria.

3292
01:28:11.171 --> 01:28:12.220
Unfortunately it's Thursday,

3293
01:28:12.221 --> 01:28:12.830
right?

3294
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:13.663
This,

3295
01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:14.950
I love that.

3296
01:28:14.951 --> 01:28:15.810
You don't know what day?

3297
01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.640
Thursday,

3298
01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:18.760
Thursday.

3299
01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.211
I never know.

3300
01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:20.044
Unless I have gigs.

3301
01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:22.210
I have two gates tonight.

3302
01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:23.650
And you got to,

3303
01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.910
we'd be wrapping this up.

3304
01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:25.330
Yeah,

3305
01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:27.760
I got one at the w and I got one of the comedy store.

3306
01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:28.091
But,

3307
01:28:28.091 --> 01:28:28.720
um,

3308
01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.280
there were a ton of fun at the comedy store.

3309
01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.290
10 45.

3310
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:32.970
Okay.

3311
01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:33.250
Yeah.

3312
01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:34.120
Can you get me in man?

3313
01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:34.671
Yeah,

3314
01:28:34.671 --> 01:28:35.504
Bro.

3315
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:36.423
Don't worry about it.

3316
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:37.061
Come on down.

3317
01:28:37.061 --> 01:28:37.894
Keep drinking.

3318
01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:41.180
<v 2>No.</v>

3319
01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:41.601
You know what,

3320
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:43.820
this is the end of the tour and downs.

3321
01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.030
I've been,

3322
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.240
I,

3323
01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.890
this is like the hundredth interview in 10 days or something and it's like,

3324
01:28:48.891 --> 01:28:50.390
I can only mention about your rate,

3325
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.233
bury those.

3326
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.930
<v 4>That's unfortunate.</v>

3327
01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:54.260
You have to do press for these things,

3328
01:28:54.261 --> 01:28:56.810
but it's kind of throwing around weights important.

3329
01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:57.801
Thrilled.

3330
01:28:57.801 --> 01:28:59.990
And I'm so again,

3331
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:01.920
I how much,

3332
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:02.971
<v 3>I mean,</v>

3333
01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:06.000
we just named the movie the right thing because just to look at what this

3334
01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:08.550
fucking guy has done for me and he's had to,

3335
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:10.080
and he's also had a sort of,

3336
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.980
and I,

3337
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.900
there's times when I've milked the fact that the,

3338
01:29:12.901 --> 01:29:15.120
I'm watching him treatment with kid gloves and I'm going like,

3339
01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:15.391
Hey,

3340
01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:15.811
you know what I mean?

3341
01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:16.650
Let this go on.

3342
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.260
So August 7th is a,

3343
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:22.230
it's going to be rolls out this Friday and that'll be,

3344
01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.550

3347
01:29:25.081 --> 01:29:25.291

3348
01:29:25.291 --> 01:29:25.490

3349
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:26.490
It'll be in New York.

3350
01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:27.573

Papa Vegas.

3360
01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:42.650
Okay.

3363
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:48.180

3364

but it's your show.

3365
01:29:48.631 --> 01:29:50.160
I'm bitchy ass shit.

3366
01:29:50.161 --> 01:29:50.431
You,

3367
01:29:50.431 --> 01:29:50.861
yeah,

3368
01:29:50.861 --> 01:29:53.070
I shading that we dropped parties and upstate New York.

3369
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:56.570
I should understanding that it's going to be available up there to look at that

3370
01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:57.390
stitches.

3371
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:58.290
Powerful stitches.

3372
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:59.183
Oh yeah.

3373
01:29:59.230 --> 01:30:00.610
That's where I did my first open mind.

3374
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:02.490
Who hosted?

3375
01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.323
Um,

3376
01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:04.163
Jonathan Katz.

3377
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.940
Oh Wow.

3378
01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:05.580
Yeah,

3379
01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:06.301
that was pretty cool.

3380
01:30:06.301 --> 01:30:06.780
John.

3381
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:07.500
Love that guy.

3382
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.190
He's in the movie.

3383
01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:08.640
Yep.

3384
01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:08.881
Yes,

3385
01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:09.560
he is.

3386
01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.190
Um,

3387
01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:11.250
when's it going to be available?

3388
01:30:11.251 --> 01:30:13.720
Like an iTunes and all that stuff will become like,

3389
01:30:13.721 --> 01:30:15.000
it'll be on Netflix,

3390
01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:15.840
I think Netflix.

3391
01:30:15.841 --> 01:30:16.240
Yeah.

3392
01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.010
You know,

3393
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:17.950
most of my,

3394
01:30:18.130 --> 01:30:20.430
I actually all my movies end up on digital platforms,

3395
01:30:20.431 --> 01:30:23.970
so I'm unlike those movies though.

3396
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:26.400
MPI The folks putting it out,

3397
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.791
you know,

3398
01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:30.120
believe in giving this one a little bit broader of a theatrical run.

3399
01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:30.960
Nice.

3400
01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.530
Yeah,

3401
01:30:31.530 --> 01:30:32.130
that's great.

3402
01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:32.470
Yeah.

3403
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:33.360
Willow Creek road as good,

3404
01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:34.650
whatever happened with that.

3405
01:30:35.230 --> 01:30:35.860
Uh,

3406
01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:36.270
do well,

3407
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:37.230
did well for me.

3408
01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:38.300
It actually helped,

3409
01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.110
um,

3410
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:42.150
the same company that put that out said when I said,

3411
01:30:42.151 --> 01:30:42.391
hey,

3412
01:30:42.391 --> 01:30:46.980
I want to make a movie about this guy and it's about his child abuse.

3413
01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:48.510
They were going fine.

3414
01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:49.500
It was really cool.

3415
01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:50.030
Wow.

3416
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:54.840
So Robin and given us the money to start the beginning of it and then an NPI

3417
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:55.703
didn't,

3418
01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:56.520
they were cool man.

3419
01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.570
They weren't really,

3420
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:58.010
they,

3421
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:59.460
they're very supportive of what I do.

3422
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.593
That's awesome.

3423
01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:02.250
Barry Crimmins has been an honor.

3424

First interview,

3431
01:31:10.651 --> 01:31:12.510

3432
01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:16.230

3433
01:31:16.231 --> 01:31:17.640
But I was going to do with somewhere.

3434
01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:19.710
I thought I was gonna say Bob,

3435
01:31:19.711 --> 01:31:20.190

3436
01:31:20.190 --> 01:31:21.023
I've done it.

3437
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:22.800
No more movies.

3438
01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.080
No amyl

3439
01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:28.320

3440
01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:29.940
but they're a little bit,

3441
01:31:29.941 --> 01:31:30.870
I love you man.

3442
01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.233

you know,

3450
01:31:40.891 --> 01:31:42.750
act of friendship is one thing.

3451
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.570
A documentary of it is quite another.

3452
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:46.830
Thank you very much.

3453
01:31:46.831 --> 01:31:50.280
