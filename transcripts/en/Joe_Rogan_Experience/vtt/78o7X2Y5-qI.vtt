1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches outfit.</v>

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've worn costumes like that.</v>

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Just sound like sketches and shit.</v>

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.303
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here in this picture?</v>

6
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>This is so strange.</v>

7
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>They're courting each other.</v>

8
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>They're holding hands and steering and juices eyes like,</v>

9
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you know what this says?</v>

10
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like you saw cartoons and you're a little kid and they just fucked your</v>

11
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:19.591
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

12
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:19.981
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

13
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>well this is what I'm looking forward to when I get out of this house.</v>

14
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.401
<v Speaker 1>And he got out of the house.</v>

15
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>You hear car accidents,</v>

16
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>gunshots,</v>

17
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>rape.</v>

18
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>But do they fuck each other while they're both wearing a costume or do they fuck</v>

19
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't wearing a costume?</v>

20
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.783
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

21
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And this is I f I'm sorry if you are a member of the furry community and I</v>

22
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:37.774
<v Speaker 1>misrepresent you,</v>

23
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>but some of them have hatches where their asshole is sort of like those old</v>

24
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>school pajamas and those a wild west cartoons and we're the wild west pajamas</v>

25
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>where they had like a like pop.</v>

26
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I always had those Dukie flap and you got two buttons that cover your Shitter,</v>

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>like the shit trap and you open up the trap door and drop a bomb in there and</v>

28
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>then button that fucker back up.</v>

29
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have,</v>

30
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>they probably had drawstrings.</v>

31
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>He probably didn't even have like rubber waistbands back then.</v>

32
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

33
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Like how different they like those big buttons on either side.</v>

34
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>How do they tighten down your uh,</v>

35
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.851
<v Speaker 1>underwear?</v>

36
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Back then it was buttons.</v>

37
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.063
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

38
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>They probably had buttons in the front,</v>

39
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>buttons in the Shitter.</v>

40
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>He did buttons on everything back then.</v>

41
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>So these kids,</v>

42
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>they thought that was the future.</v>

43
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>And then they went out there and they got punched in the face the moment they</v>

44
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:22.554
<v Speaker 1>left their house.</v>

45
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And then probably somebody did terrible things to them and they went to school</v>

46
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>and they got picked on.</v>

47
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>And then here they are just wishing they were a squirrel.</v>

48
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.751
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is the,</v>

49
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:31.070
<v Speaker 1>the squirrel just look in the courtroom.</v>

50
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>And it was my favorite toy when I was young.</v>

51
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Then watch this girl cartoon and be like,</v>

52
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.801
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

53
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in a squirrel.</v>

54
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to go to school and want to do the same.</v>

55
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>We just want to be a squirrel.</v>

56
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Well the hotel where we were at,</v>

57
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>they got to request it was,</v>

58
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>they're filled up with furries except me and a few of the other UFC staff.</v>

59
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

60
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lying.</v>

61
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a fill.</v>

62
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Dazing and they got a request and the request was the ferries asked if they</v>

63
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>could put a litter box in the lobby.</v>

64
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

65
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

66
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to pay for her litter box.</v>

67
00:01:58.491 --> 00:01:59.311
<v Speaker 1>We brought into the lobby.</v>

68
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>They like this whole convention is all us,</v>

69
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.431
<v Speaker 1>so can we do that?</v>

70
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:02.881
<v Speaker 1>And like I was like,</v>

71
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

72
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>They took my idea for cats.</v>

73
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>They tried to get a litter box and put it in the front lobby of like the Westin</v>

74
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>in Pittsburgh to make smelly in apparently.</v>

75
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could have all just been just they get to be like,</v>

76
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

77
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Well they definitely were asking for food to be delivered in bowls on the</v>

78
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:24.324
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

79
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.951
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they ordered.</v>

80
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to put a bowl like a dog food bowl and eat it on the ground.</v>

81
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.311
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

82
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It was several different rooms that were requesting this that I can see though,</v>

83
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go that distance,</v>

84
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're not taking a shit in the fucking lobby.</v>

85
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

86
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.413
<v Speaker 1>You want to know?</v>

87
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't know until you ask.</v>

88
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Think it's all us.</v>

89
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.313
<v Speaker 1>It's all us here.</v>

90
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just all us.</v>

91
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>We're amongst friends.</v>

92
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.853
<v Speaker 1>We'll pay,</v>

93
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>we'll pay him.</v>

94
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.421
<v Speaker 1>Let me just ask.</v>

95
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's just ask like they're so crazy.</v>

96
00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>They just probably asked.</v>

97
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

98
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get,</v>

99
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:52.801
<v Speaker 1>it's like have,</v>

100
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>they'll just have a litter box in your room and the lobby.</v>

101
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

103
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I bet a lot of them had them in their</v>

104
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 2>going up that fucking flight of stairs with a duffle bag fill.</v>

105
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.344
<v Speaker 2>What litter</v>

106
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.891
<v Speaker 2>is there?</v>

107
00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the sport.</v>

108
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>And when I came into bodybuilding,</v>

109
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I invented steroids with already there,</v>

110
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>my first semester and in Paris in 1965,</v>

112
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Larry Scott and was the Mr of MP or 90 65.</v>

113
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 2>And he said he was using steroids and that was 1965.</v>

114
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 2>So when did this start being used?</v>

115
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.521
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

116
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 2>but for sure in the early sixties,</v>

117
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>1965 they had steroids.</v>

118
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>When did they invent steroids?</v>

119
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.501
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

120
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

121
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 2>well you had testosterone.</v>

122
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean testosterone was used in the Second World War.</v>

123
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 2>The Germans were using that with the SS soldiers.</v>

124
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.303
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

125
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>so injectable testosterone was available then steroids,</v>

126
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 2>which there were more refined version of testosterone.</v>

127
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

128
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I think late fifties.</v>

129
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>How has it more refined in what way?</v>

130
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 2>So he got testosterone is a male hormone,</v>

131
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 2>so it's basically 50% androgenic that's male,</v>

132
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 2>like characteristics,</v>

133
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>50% anabolic repair bill.</v>

134
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>So they want it to take this and they want to this pot,</v>

135
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 2>the anabolic and minimize the androgenic cause that's what gives you side</v>

136
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:10.670
<v Speaker 2>effects,</v>

137
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 2>prostate growth and all that stuff.</v>

138
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 2>So they try,</v>

139
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 2>they refined it so that those effects are minimized and more of the anabolic</v>

140
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:18.941
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

141
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:19.774
<v Speaker 2>That was the idea.</v>

142
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 2>And there's a guy called John Siegler I think.</v>

143
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 2>And because they found out the eastern bloc,</v>

144
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.543
<v Speaker 2>they had their own,</v>

145
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.580
<v Speaker 2>had their own stuff called [inaudible].</v>

146
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.003
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

147
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

148
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Siegler invented Dinah Ball,</v>

149
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

150
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 2>don't quote me if I could be wrong,</v>

151
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was about 58 or something like that.</v>

152
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 2>He developed that the u s weightlifting team,</v>

153
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 2>1958,</v>

154
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 58.</v>

155
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 2>But before that you had testosterone.</v>

156
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 2>So they were known as what,</v>

157
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 2>when people started using it,</v>

159
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>but for sure from the early sixties,</v>

160
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 2>it's been a part of bodybuilding and then other sports.</v>

161
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 2>And they used to be a disclaimer inside the steroid thing saying anabolic</v>

162
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 2>steroids do not increase athletic performance.</v>

163
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.000
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

164
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

165
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 2>So they stated this and they also told guys,</v>

166
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.401
<v Speaker 2>if you take this,</v>

167
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 2>you fucking balls are going to drop off,</v>

168
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fucking die,</v>

169
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get liver cancer.</v>

170
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 2>So guys started using them and seeing that that's all bullshit.</v>

171
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

172
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.500
<v Speaker 2>So then they don't want to listen to anything that he's medical guys,</v>

173
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:19.901
<v Speaker 2>I've got to say,</v>

174
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>cause you aligned to us then.</v>

175
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

176
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to be aligned to us all the time.</v>

177
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.551
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily.</v>

178
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:25.080
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

179
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 2>because you do have the chances of side effects,</v>

180
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.300
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

181
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you could say it's been greatly exaggerated and certain that's the problem was a</v>

182
00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 2>propaganda and deception,</v>

183
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:35.044
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

184
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

185
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>the fucking truth man.</v>

186
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 2>And let them deal with it.</v>

187
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:38.644
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

188
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.603
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do.</v>

189
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.743
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

190
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.960
<v Speaker 2>because I saw all this stuff on the Internet about what I'm supposedly doing and</v>

191
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I thought young guys are going to read this and maybe they're going to do it.</v>

192
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 2>So I did an article in a magazine,</v>

193
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:50.921
<v Speaker 2>muscular development,</v>

194
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.221
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

195
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:51.461
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

196
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:52.294
<v Speaker 2>this is what I did.</v>

197
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.510
<v Speaker 2>This is what I did in Austin.</v>

198
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 2>This is what I did for a contest and these are my opinions.</v>

199
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

200
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>my honest opinion is like,</v>

201
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's worth it unless you,</v>

202
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 2>you're competing and so on.</v>

204
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately it's up to you.</v>

205
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you the information.</v>

206
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 2>What you do with is up to you.</v>

207
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.470
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know for 70% of the people like this is bullshit.</v>

208
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.010
<v Speaker 2>He didn't really,</v>

209
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 2>he must have talked much more than this because I'm taking this,</v>

210
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.940
<v Speaker 2>actually I'm taking more than this</v>

211
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.873
<v Speaker 3>and I don't look like him.</v>

212
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Well tough shit man.</v>

213
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.703
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>

214
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I always tell kids who want to be in this business to please wait like even with</v>

215
00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 3>my kids is it just wait,</v>

216
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 3>wait til you're like wait to get an understanding.</v>

217
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Like I was able to be grown and and have some grown shit happened to me and just</v>

218
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:33.670
<v Speaker 3>regular life shit happens.</v>

219
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 3>So then when this happened,</v>

220
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 3>I still have a point of reference to get back to because you know like I know</v>

221
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 3>you've interviewed everybody.</v>

222
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 3>This business affects you in such a way where you'll see one person one day,</v>

223
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I won't say the comedian's name,</v>

224
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 3>but I remember a comedian back in the day did like half of an HBO or whatever.</v>

225
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 3>And then the next week I saw him,</v>

226
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 3>he had 12 body guards and they were pushing me back.</v>

227
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck man?</v>

228
00:06:59.631 --> 00:06:59.961
<v Speaker 3>Yo Man,</v>

229
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Yo know now.</v>

230
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Right now it just got crazy.</v>

231
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:02.534
<v Speaker 3>It got crazy,</v>

232
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.520
<v Speaker 3>crazy good,</v>

233
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.353
<v Speaker 3>crazy cause.</v>

234
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.530
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen,</v>

235
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

236
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 3>I won't say the names would have been a couple of guys,</v>

237
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I never get this one dude hit.</v>

238
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.250
<v Speaker 3>And I went up to try to say something to him and,</v>

239
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 3>and for some reason he had a white suit on.</v>

240
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 3>We were in a club.</v>

241
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:18.570
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

242
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.670
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck does he have this white suit on and these big shapes.</v>

243
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 3>And I went to talk to him and he said,</v>

244
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 3>not right now man,</v>

245
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm rich.</v>

246
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.353
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

247
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 3>He said that</v>

248
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.803
<v Speaker 3>they got rich,</v>

249
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.640
<v Speaker 3>let me be rich and famous right now.</v>

250
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:35.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear your pitch.</v>

251
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.051
<v Speaker 3>And some I said,</v>

252
00:07:37.051 --> 00:07:37.231
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

253
00:07:37.231 --> 00:07:38.640
<v Speaker 3>you think you can get away.</v>

254
00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:39.474
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

255
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.010
<v Speaker 3>and as he said it,</v>

256
00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:41.850
<v Speaker 3>I had to sort of like,</v>

257
00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:42.390
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

258
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.223
<v Speaker 3>I had to get up.</v>

259
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.130
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

260
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

261
00:07:44.371 --> 00:07:46.380
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens when you gotta be careful.</v>

262
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.850
<v Speaker 3>That tide goes in and it goes out and people come up and they remember,</v>

263
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 3>they remember and we remember when you fucked with them.</v>

264
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And we've seen and we've seen him,</v>

265
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:55.861
<v Speaker 3>we've seen him.</v>

266
00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

267
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 3>but being a comedian,</v>

268
00:07:56.971 --> 00:07:57.804
<v Speaker 3>we get,</v>

269
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 3>we get a chance to sit in a different seat because we sort of are our jobs or</v>

270
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.370
<v Speaker 3>our observational,</v>

271
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

272
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

273
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.830
<v Speaker 3>and we still all have our own demons,</v>

274
00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:08.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

275
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.340
<v Speaker 3>it's just different when you also get humbled a lot as a comedian.</v>

276
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

277
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.870
<v Speaker 3>You gotta get those jokes.</v>

278
00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:14.760
<v Speaker 3>You're performing in front of a live audience.</v>

279
00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:15.840
<v Speaker 3>It's all live.</v>

280
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.700
<v Speaker 3>It's got to work and it doesn't work.</v>

281
00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:18.231
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

282
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.640
<v Speaker 3>You gotta go back to the drawing board and it's got to assess,</v>

283
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 3>actors don't get a lot of that.</v>

284
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:24.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons why the kind of shaky,</v>

285
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.843
<v Speaker 3>more shaky.</v>

286
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

287
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

288
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Don't get a lot of like testing it live in front of people,</v>

289
00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:31.470
<v Speaker 3>that humility that comes with that you don't.</v>

290
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:31.710
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

291
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.041
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

292
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:32.521
<v Speaker 3>and it's tough.</v>

293
00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to her act,</v>

294
00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:34.284
<v Speaker 3>another actor,</v>

295
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.371
<v Speaker 3>and it's tough cause see,</v>

296
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:37.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm a comic who became an actor,</v>

297
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.370
<v Speaker 3>so I'm cheating.</v>

298
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.481
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

299
00:08:39.481 --> 00:08:40.800
<v Speaker 3>I can go do this and I can go,</v>

300
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:41.391
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be,</v>

301
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:42.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be in Saint Louis tomorrow.</v>

302
00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:43.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

303
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:43.531
<v Speaker 3>some jokes.</v>

304
00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:43.861
<v Speaker 3>So I can,</v>

305
00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:44.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306

<v Speaker 3>I gotta get,</v>

307
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I can get my thing off.</v>

308
00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:46.710
<v Speaker 3>But just actors,</v>

309
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.900
<v Speaker 3>it's tough when you're thinking about a way to bounce three careers you can sing</v>

310
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:52.710
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

311
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

312
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:53.730
<v Speaker 3>you could do anything.</v>

313
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 3>You're a weird guy.</v>

314
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.531
<v Speaker 3>That way.</v>

315
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:56.990
<v Speaker 3>You've got a lot of weird talent yourself.</v>

316
00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.970
<v Speaker 3>And it's talking about Justin Bieber and yeah,</v>

317
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.331
<v Speaker 3>Chris Brown,</v>

318
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you've got some weird ability to shift to.</v>

319
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not only,</v>

320
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 3>but I've been fortunate in the fact that now things have opened up.</v>

321
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.001
