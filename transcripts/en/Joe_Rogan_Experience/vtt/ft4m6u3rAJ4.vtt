1
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get heavy,</v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about life and death.</v>

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>You talking about life</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>That is what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're living in.</v>

5
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Some people were dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's life and death.</v>

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>We're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really interesting is that we're</v>

7
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>all going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that everybody pushes away and I</v>

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>guess that's normal to push away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>thoughts of your death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real enlightened,</v>

11
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>like the Buddhist Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern eastern and stuff,</v>

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>they say the way to get enlightened is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to die if you can check this out,</v>

13
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 1>is to die before you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning lately kind of go into the fear</v>

14
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>and they claim that the fear is</v>
<v Speaker 1>releasing ego,</v>

15
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.520
<v Speaker 1>which what they mean by ego is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have this beautiful studio and</v>

16
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>you have a career and a wife and a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids I guess.</v>

17
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

18
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can't be attached to it.</v>

19
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>You have to die to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in other words,</v>

20
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't own your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't own</v>

21
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>anything really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're just,</v>

22
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line of it is,</v>

23
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>is we are temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes and impermanent.</v>

24
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't mean you can't enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>like you're in the prime of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So why think about your fucking death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

27
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>But I think for guys like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little older and like for some</v>

28
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>reason we're on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some reason I experienced panic</v>

30
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>and I had a full blown one coming up</v>
<v Speaker 1>here while you're driving.</v>

32
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was driving.</v>

33
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I now will feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

34
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>this is what it feels like is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling kind of tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing a lot.</v>

36
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's not to brag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

37
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been</v>

38
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>in show business.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm in show business.</v>

40
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in show business,</v>

41
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two dogs,</v>

42
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I have three cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

43
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like to manage the dogs are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

44
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are intense,</v>

45
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>

46
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I love your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to have three.</v>

47
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.563
<v Speaker 1>You have three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

49
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

50
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I think one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

51
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know why I'm a panic attack,</v>

52
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>suffer occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Dad,</v>

53
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I get into these dogs like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm a sign of someone who has</v>

54
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:58.641
<v Speaker 1>panic attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is someone who cares too much about care</v>

55
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>of things instead of trusting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's gonna be alright.</v>

56
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I to get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to feed the dogs.</v>

57
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>The dogs will be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like doing stuff like,</v>

58
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dog's name is Charlotte and Basil</v>

59
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte.</v>

60
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Does she have something in the Charlotte</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something in a right?</v>

61
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And I blow it up a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

62
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Instead of chilling and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

63
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>she'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just,</v>

64
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>let me just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>wipe the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see her like scratching at the</v>

66
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.350
<v Speaker 1>aisle and it can set me off into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry and I think that's kind of um,</v>

67
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>the symptom of panic attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm coming up here,</v>

68
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>so I get on the one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who don't know the one on one.</v>

69
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Well you should just kill yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the one on one is a main artery</v>

70
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.050
<v Speaker 1>and you should know about it or what if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't drive cars,</v>

71
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other things to worry about.</v>

72
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I think they're brilliant if they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive a.</v>

73
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.050
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

74
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>it was packed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

75
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Google maps was like accidents up</v>

76
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:06.451
<v Speaker 1>ahead and I started to feel this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling trapped.</v>

77
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever felt trapped on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highway where,</v>

78
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

79
00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>and for some reason I think because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>overtired and I wanted to get here,</v>

80
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>this is first time I've done your</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

81
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I just started feeling an anxiety about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

82
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happened.</v>

83
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it physically feeling I'm</v>

84
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>going to be late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have the walls are closing</v>

85
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes man,</v>

86
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

87
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>The real scary thing is the breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

88
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm this,</v>

89
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

90
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I hate about La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about you,</v>

91
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:49.351
<v Speaker 1>but like here we are in December 28th</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hot.</v>

92
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty warm.</v>

93
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like 75 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80.</v>

94
00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Is it 80 to 80 and the sun is blaring</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

95
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:02.611
<v Speaker 1>through by side window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm feeling a little fuck.</v>

96
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>There's nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

97
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>where I can't get off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

98
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.760
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

99
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.673
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

100
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>so it's a buildup of anxiety instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>just going,</v>

101
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

102
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>like your shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let that shit go.</v>

103
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Let that shit go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

104
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

105
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I get entangled in it,</v>

106
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>when it reaches a tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

107
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

108
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>when the anxiety reaches a tipping point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

109
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

110
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I am like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

111
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here's the voice in my head that I</v>

112
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>have to always battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

113
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't going to work out instead of,</v>

114
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>for some reason I have the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

116
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you intellectualize it,</v>

117
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:46.601
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

118
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>like now like we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now now it's after it's over,</v>

119
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

120
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I should just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

121
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>let that shit go like you without any</v>
<v Speaker 1>stake in the game.</v>

122
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You removed.</v>

123
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>If you were</v>

124
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>giving yourself advice in that car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like to come on.</v>

125
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 2>I really think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're living in America.</v>

126
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Here is few extra people on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them bumped into each other.</v>

127
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get through this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

128
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you texted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no problem.</v>

129
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Come a little later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deal.</v>

130
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Start a little later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's casual.</v>

131
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no reason to get anxious about that.</v>

132
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Where I don't smoke pot too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I would understand more because</v>

133
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 2>people that eat edibles and then get on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one on one and get stuck in traffic</v>

134
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 2>and then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's your whole world starts closing</v>

135
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:31.470
<v Speaker 2>in on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You started without the adipose.</v>

136
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same kind of thing.</v>

137
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that I've</v>

138
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 2>noticed a lot is a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have anxiety and a lot of people that</v>

139
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 2>they're generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're intelligent people and the</v>

140
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 2>problem is with intelligent people is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're overwhelmed with</v>

141
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>

142
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 2>You're thinking about all the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>variables that are in play.</v>

143
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Whereas dumb people just fucking stumble</v>
<v Speaker 2>into walls where they're talking on</v>

144
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 2>their phone and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like texting and walking out</v>

145
00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 2>into traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not thinking,</v>

146
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow they get things work out for</v>

147
00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't snow illusion.</v>

148
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>You're not living in their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were inside the nine volt battery</v>

149
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

150
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking nothing to think about</v>

151
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like was it Jamie?</v>

152
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Will you with me or is it with Tony when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at the airport and there's this</v>

153
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat next to her just to listen to our</v>

154
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Tony and she was just</v>

155
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:28.991
<v Speaker 2>talking about amazing race and I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>this team to win and I can't wait until</v>

156
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 2>this happens and when I get paid on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday I'm going to buy this phone and</v>

157
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 2>then there's this is this food I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to eat and it was just this</v>

158
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 2>droning.</v>

159
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this might.</v>

160
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 2>You might as well be a robot that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent here to consume.</v>

161
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:48.971
<v Speaker 2>There's no like there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no curiosity or creativity.</v>

162
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:54.311
<v Speaker 2>It was just consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just food and buy this and watch</v>

163
00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:59.331
<v Speaker 2>that and and drone on and on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who knows if it's genetics,</v>

164
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 2>if it's nature or nurture or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

165
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:06.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of really dull folks out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and we're not supposed to do just</v>

166
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 2>a lot of really told folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the culture is also geared to</v>

167
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.930
<v Speaker 2>consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of it is sure,</v>

168
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like you turn on the</v>

169
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 2>fucking TV and that is the message</v>
<v Speaker 2>center that our culture,</v>

170
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 2>that is our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a part of our culture,</v>

171
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:26.380
<v Speaker 2>but our culture is pretty vast now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that one,</v>

172
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.310
<v Speaker 2>much more of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet much more than than</v>

173
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media now and that's one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why they're grasping at</v>

174
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 2>straws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to stay relevant.</v>

175
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 2>What the mainstream media like</v>
<v Speaker 2>television shows there.</v>

176
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:42.521
<v Speaker 2>They're down record numbers like news is</v>
<v Speaker 2>down record number to be about that.</v>

177
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it the idea that these.</v>

178
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.400
<v Speaker 2>It's great if someone is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 2>New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine,</v>

180
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:54.560
<v Speaker 2>respected journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who you can go to when you</v>

181
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>really want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck</v>

182
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.910
<v Speaker 3>is happening in Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to know,</v>

183
00:08:57.911 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to know from someone who's going</v>

184
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 3>to give me an objective informed</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

185
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's huge.</v>

186
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 3>And it's very critical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you get past that you're</v>

187
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:08.030
<v Speaker 3>dealing a lot of the shows you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with,</v>

188
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 3>whether it's CNN or Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with opinions and your</v>

189
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 3>opinion is just as valid as Shepard</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smith's.</v>

190
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is Shepard Smith?</v>

191
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Because he has makeup on and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing a tie and they have ready,</v>

192
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 3>set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and they press the green light and</v>

193
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

194
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how?</v>

195
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:31.581
<v Speaker 3>Because it's just on TV because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanction sanction to sanction by the</v>

196
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 3>powers that be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's really about ownership.</v>

197
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't even know who owned CNN</v>

198
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So was it Ted Turner?</v>

199
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.520
<v Speaker 3>He probably still owns it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's Hashtag Ball.</v>

200
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 3>He was right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

201
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:52.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's like one of the biggest land</v>
<v Speaker 3>owners in the United States.</v>

202
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 3>He has millions of acres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

203
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 3>he owns buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Restaurants were served buffalo.</v>

204
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag ball.</v>

205
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Is that Montana?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think it's called Montana.</v>

206
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in Montana,</v>

207
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have them in Colorado.</v>

208
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.590
<v Speaker 3>They might've been Montana as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's actually a chain.</v>

209
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's supposed to be very good</v>

210
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 3>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what my point was is that the</v>

211
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 3>structure at CNN says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

212
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 3>we're going to talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to talk about that.</v>

213
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to put it on TV and people</v>

214
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 3>watch the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

215
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 3>you have to break it down to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>essential is like there is a screen,</v>

216
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 3>it's being transmitted into your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your home.</v>

217
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 3>It's been and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very much,</v>

218
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.080
<v Speaker 3>it's very much with people not realizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it a complete fucking mind control thing</v>

219
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.070
<v Speaker 3>or it really influences you and it takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot to kind of disconnect and,</v>

220
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 3>and for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have said to myself,</v>

221
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 3>I am going to disconnect from the grid</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a while.</v>

222
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 3>You ever tried to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

223
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to go online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to watch TV.</v>

224
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>

225
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really kind of very difficult.</v>

226
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 3>Might go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go hunting.</v>

227
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the woods for like a week and I</v>

228
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 3>have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't get cell phone signal.</v>

229
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Can just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no Internet connection.</v>

230
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel rejuvenated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

231
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels good.</v>

232
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 3>It feels good to take breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

233
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed the Internet.</v>

234
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy the information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's overwhelming and one of the</v>

235
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:29.700
<v Speaker 3>reasons why it's overwhelming is we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

236
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.040
<v Speaker 3>we're not really accustomed to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

237
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 3>This is a very new experience for human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

238
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Like over the last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 3>20 years we've options to a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

240
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Twenty four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 94 ish really came up.</v>

241
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 3>Ninety four is when I got online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you sink and I really want to</v>

242
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:48.680
<v Speaker 3>relate to this again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like cut to the panic attack.</v>

243
00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 3>I drove it up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because this is,</v>

244
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.410
<v Speaker 3>it's another form of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the anxiety</v>

245
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 1>that it's information overload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overload.</v>

246
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Because my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brain,</v>

248
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I think your brain is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my brain,</v>

249
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel my brain just digging into shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

250
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:13.170
<v Speaker 1>like I'll read a paragraph on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know.</v>

252
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Hunting and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll mention something about guns and</v>

253
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:20.610
<v Speaker 1>then I go to guns and then I go to gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

254
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Like go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go and then I go to the scumbags who</v>

255
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:27.730
<v Speaker 1>don't want gun control and then I go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a school shooting,</v>

256
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 1>like one thing leads to another on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet,</v>

257
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:34.420

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 1>They want to say everything that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly tuned and,</v>

298
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.880
<v Speaker 1>and just gotten to this point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection where they were great.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Great too.</v>

301
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

302
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I loved watching your thing about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is now a whore and we're driving</v>

<v Speaker 1>with trump like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did that thing with up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

305
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing is that you get</v>

306
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:51.720
<v Speaker 1>sucked in because the way the guy on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

307
00:14:51.721 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and this is what</v>

308
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 3>happens on the Internet a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they guy who said Improv socks,</v>

309
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 3>that's how we framed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This sucks,</v>

310
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 3>this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's a thing that then your,</v>

311
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.580
<v Speaker 3>then your ego gets involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think I even know I didn't engage</v>

312
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 3>in that one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really good.</v>

313
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's right to him.</v>

314
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.011
<v Speaker 3>For him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

315
00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he phrased it wrong.</v>

316
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.330
<v Speaker 3>If you said the what I like is standup</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm like a polished product.</v>

317
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't like Improv because it feels</v>
<v Speaker 3>amateurish to me and people could say I</v>

318
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:25.400
<v Speaker 3>disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Improv because it's wild.</v>

319
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 3>I like that feeling of being in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>audience where someone yells out,</v>

320
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genre,</v>

321
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:31.480
<v Speaker 3>World War Two films and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're,</v>

322
00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 3>they're scrambling and they fucking try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pretend they're into the,</v>

323
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.420
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that called?</v>

324
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 3>The tunnels for trenches trenches.</v>

325
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

326
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I build trenches and I have mustard gas</v>

327
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 3>at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's grey.</v>

328
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Poupon mustard gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grey poupon,</v>

329
00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 3>mustard gas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

330
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with having</v>

331
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 3>opinions on things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people don't like that.</v>

332
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Your opinions are different than theirs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get mad at you.</v>

333
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Like some people get mad at you if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a certain kind of music.</v>

334
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.880
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they'll get mad.</v>

335
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your tastes sucks.</v>

336
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 3>You're tasting music sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing.</v>

337
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:11.770
<v Speaker 3>What we're talking about is that that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on a lot on the internet.</v>

338
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you suck,</v>

339
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 3>you suck,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're wrong,</v>

341
00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:17.990

<v Speaker 3>Definitely wrong.</v>

342
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.370
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's really reached a fuck</v>

343
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:26.371
<v Speaker 3>in a heightened state because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics in the country.</v>

344
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Like another words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

345
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:33.130
<v Speaker 3>it filters down to where the president</v>
<v Speaker 3>stands up with the president insults</v>

346
00:16:33.381 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 3>people constantly.</v>

347
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 3>That's all he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's a divisive.</v>

348
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.620
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not new,</v>

349
00:16:39.621 --> 00:16:42.170
<v Speaker 3>but that's how he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he operates.</v>

350
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.770
<v Speaker 3>He's very manipulative in the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he usually,</v>

351
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.130
<v Speaker 3>he's very praising of some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

352
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 3>like doing an amazing job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful job.</v>

353
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Speaker 3>The other day he was talking about these</v>
<v Speaker 3>firefighters and he had all these</v>

354
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 3>firefighters behind him and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about what a great job they're</v>

355
00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:00.470
<v Speaker 3>doing as firefighters and it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird speech and now going to go</v>

356
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 3>see each other on tv and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

357
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:03.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they get enough credit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he'll,</v>

358
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 3>he'll like bestow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting method course is</v>

359
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 3>going to bestow preys on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>firefighters.</v>

360
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 3>You would say that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But only if it's convenient for him.</v>

361
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.300
<v Speaker 3>Like about John Mccain who was a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>war hero.</v>

362
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like people that don't get captured</v>

363
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.050
<v Speaker 3>like Jesus Christ.</v>

364
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Like he had like six deferments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

365
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a hangnail,</v>

366
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.800
<v Speaker 3>like I can't go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a gang of deferments and</v>

367
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.720
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile he's saying something about</v>
<v Speaker 3>John fucking mccain who a legitimate war</v>

368
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:37.721
<v Speaker 3>hero who was captured and tortured by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Viet Cong and he had the balls to</v>

369
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like people that have been.</v>

370
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's effecting the military at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

371
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

372
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 3>but here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has He get away with that?</v>

373
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Shit just does because this just who he</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

374
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know someone's a scumbag,</v>

375
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 3>like then the scumbag behavior is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

376
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.430
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Mike.</v>

377
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 3>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

378
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.140
<v Speaker 3>But if Mike is a priest and it turns out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what Mike really likes doing is</v>

379
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 3>smoking crack and below and guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

380
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:06.720
<v Speaker 3>you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

381
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

382
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were this other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if Mike is Andy Dick and you found</v>

383
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:14.520
<v Speaker 3>out how many dicks out there smoking</v>
<v Speaker 3>crack and blowing guys like,</v>

384
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 3>oh andy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's trump is Andy Dick.</v>

385
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.910
<v Speaker 3>He's</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he is.</v>

386
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's his thing is you come after him,</v>

387
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Speaker 3>he comes after you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just sort of assumed that once he</v>

388
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:30.540
<v Speaker 3>became president he would stop doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and he would act hashtag</v>

389
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 3>presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not at all.</v>

390
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't help himself making it all</v>

391
00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 3>about himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's interesting.</v>

392
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Back to the Internet Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is going on?</v>

393
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.321
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

394
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 3>just for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking that example of Improv,</v>

395
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.510
<v Speaker 3>stand up is the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

396
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.290
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy who wrote Improv sucks.</v>

397
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:53.124
<v Speaker 3>The Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

398
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 3>the guy who started the thread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

399
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.520
<v Speaker 3>it's like what they're doing and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is doing.</v>

400
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit is all about what I think and I</v>

401
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 3>know you're gonna come at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I want.</v>

402
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.830
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

403
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:12.120
<v Speaker 3>the attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

404
00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 3>I really think it comes down to I want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fight.</v>

405
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 3>I wanna fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

406
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I want an ego fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanna fight and I want the attention.</v>

407
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.810
<v Speaker 3>There's certainly a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also think she wants repercussions</v>

408
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:30.510
<v Speaker 3>for challenging him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants people to feel he wants to</v>

409
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 3>punish him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants people to feel very</v>

410
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:35.640
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable if they challenge him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a big part of his game.</v>

411
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.280
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he wants everyone to know that he's</v>

412
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:40.500
<v Speaker 3>going to come after you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as the president,</v>

413
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:41.760
<v Speaker 3>he's going to come after you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if he does,</v>

414
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.040
<v Speaker 3>all the trumpkins are gonna come after</v>
<v Speaker 3>you too.</v>

415
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Because if he comes after you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all of these,</v>

416
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.050
<v Speaker 3>these puppets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that follow him that</v>

417
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:52.230
<v Speaker 3>literally are on there all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you really have to realize that</v>

418
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.340
<v Speaker 3>some of the people that are online that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are tweeting for trump or treating about</v>

419
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.100
<v Speaker 3>certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's on there all day,</v>

420
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll follow people just to see how crazy</v>

421
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:05.430
<v Speaker 3>they are just to get it in my head like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

422
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

423
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.590
<v Speaker 3>I see what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do this all day.</v>

424
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.310
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

425
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.640
<v Speaker 3>you start tweeting at 7:30 in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning with your first cup of coffee.</v>

426
00:20:11.641 --> 00:20:15.450
<v Speaker 3>You're hurling insults and you do it til</v>
<v Speaker 3>1:00 in the morning and then you start</v>

427
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:17.310
<v Speaker 3>all over again in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did they do that?</v>

428
00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Because their credit go insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find,</v>

429
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I spend an hour on that kind of</v>

430
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:29.631
<v Speaker 3>rabbit hole with twitter or facebook at</v>
<v Speaker 3>my limit,</v>

431
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I think is about an hour before I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

432
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 3>It just something says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to,</v>

433
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.940
<v Speaker 3>I need to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to walk,</v>

434
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 3>I need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do something.</v>

435
00:20:41.161 --> 00:20:43.500
<v Speaker 3>I need to get away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I think is happening in</v>

436
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:44.880
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about this a lot over</v>

437
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:49.881
<v Speaker 3>the last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think humanity is in the process of an</v>

438
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.630
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming transformation that</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like giving birth.</v>

439
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.720
<v Speaker 3>I agree and I think that like if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever watched someone give birth,</v>

440
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 3>like the crazy thing is how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much pain the women are in.</v>

441
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Like when I watched my daughter come out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my wife,</v>

442
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

443
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's fucking painful and it's crazy</v>

444
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.144
<v Speaker 3>and they're talking about</v>

445
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 2>blood in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

446
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not even the president at birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this.</v>

447
00:21:15.601 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

448
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.050
<v Speaker 2>but then boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you film it most unbelievable love</v>

449
00:21:22.051 --> 00:21:23.250
<v Speaker 2>comes out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes I did.</v>

450
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.620
<v Speaker 2>But the most unbelievable love comes out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

451
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

452
00:21:27.191 --> 00:21:28.890
<v Speaker 2>and the way you feel is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

453
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go through hell to figure out</v>

454
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.700
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to handle this better.</v>

455
00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:39.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think culturally we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a weird kind of hell in this</v>

456
00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.610
<v Speaker 2>kind of health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Avoidable look,</v>

457
00:21:41.611 --> 00:21:45.390
<v Speaker 2>you could just put that phone down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just go hiking,</v>

458
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.370
<v Speaker 2>go with a good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring your dog,</v>

459
00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.860
<v Speaker 2>go have a nice day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sit Up there,</v>

460
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crack open a cold glass of water and</v>

461
00:21:52.471 --> 00:21:54.540
<v Speaker 2>look over at the landscape and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

462
00:21:54.541 --> 00:21:57.180
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking beautiful and it does</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to you when you look at</v>

463
00:21:57.181 --> 00:21:58.110
<v Speaker 2>beautiful things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

464
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.840
<v Speaker 2>You can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might want to just check your</v>

465
00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:02.850
<v Speaker 2>twitter real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if anybody respond to that real</v>

466
00:22:02.851 --> 00:22:04.230
<v Speaker 2>witty posts that you left there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

467
00:22:04.231 --> 00:22:05.820
<v Speaker 2>they get any likes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck you.</v>

468
00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I meant.</v>

469
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.860
<v Speaker 2>And then he and then he start the wheels</v>
<v Speaker 2>start turning.</v>

470
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

471
00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:13.730
<v Speaker 3>they did a study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're heard about this</v>

472
00:22:13.731 --> 00:22:17.600
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just turning off the phone.</v>

473
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.030
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have the phone in the room</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you and you turn it off,</v>

474
00:22:23.031 --> 00:22:23.930
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

475
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.370
<v Speaker 3>the phone's turned off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool.</v>

476
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.580
<v Speaker 3>What the scientists said it was a study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure where the study was,</v>

477
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:30.890
<v Speaker 3>but they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

478
00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:31.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

479
00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.450
<v Speaker 3>You have to put the fucking phone out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>into another room.</v>

480
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.730
<v Speaker 3>They said something about someone's call</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

481
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 3>What if you get a text or if someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>sends you off,</v>

482
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.590
<v Speaker 3>but what if there's a cool instagram</v>
<v Speaker 3>posts that you'd miss?</v>

483
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.993
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

484
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's worried about,</v>

485
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.810
<v Speaker 3>I think does all the chaos that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the world now.</v>

486
00:22:51.811 --> 00:22:56.811
<v Speaker 3>A really thing that we're in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably tumultuous time in human</v>

487
00:22:57.511 --> 00:23:01.380
<v Speaker 3>history at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not designed to have access to</v>

488
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:04.620
<v Speaker 3>information 24 slash seven like we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about information.</v>

489
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.810
<v Speaker 3>It's connection and information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those two things,</v>

490
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.130
<v Speaker 3>those two things are critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about information,</v>

491
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.400
<v Speaker 3>but I think even more like insidious is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the information is given.</v>

492
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:23.881
<v Speaker 3>Like here you got our president just</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically like a prick the way he</v>

493
00:23:26.761 --> 00:23:30.390
<v Speaker 3>fucking hates this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he takes pride in it,</v>

494
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of who he is.</v>

495
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 3>Said say it's regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See what if you're a regular guy and</v>

496
00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:41.430
<v Speaker 3>you're a media figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a some fucking.</v>

497
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.460
<v Speaker 3>Who's the guy from American idol was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's that mean Guy Simon,</v>

498
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 3>that guy like he's a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

499
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows he's a Dick.</v>

500
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the brand that was trump's</v>
<v Speaker 3>brande.</v>

501
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 3>You're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his brand.</v>

502
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 3>So it's reinforced with public</v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptance.</v>

503
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.370
<v Speaker 3>It was reinforced with the tension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was reinforced with like,</v>

504
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 3>he knew that that is what got him the</v>
<v Speaker 3>credit,</v>

505
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 3>that he is so gravely desired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then that allowed him to run for</v>

506
00:24:10.071 --> 00:24:10.850
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

507
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:11.980
<v Speaker 3>He runs for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

508
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Coming off of a reality show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they canceled his fucking reality show</v>

509
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:18.230
<v Speaker 3>while he was running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember I taught Schwartzenegger took</v>

510
00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:19.064
<v Speaker 3>it over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

511
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:23.210
<v Speaker 3>they canceled it because he was the pr</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was running for president.</v>

512
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:25.940
<v Speaker 3>He was saying things about Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then Swartz,</v>

513
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 3>nigger took it over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his.</v>

514
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.410
<v Speaker 3>They fired him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say and can't say,</v>

515
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.580
<v Speaker 3>but they fired him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>NBC fired him from the show because the</v>

516
00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 3>things that he was saying about Mexicans</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's really where it all came</v>

517
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

518
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.120
<v Speaker 3>So he was a fucking literally an on TV</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality star on a,</v>

519
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 3>on a shitty game show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then from there it goes on to be</v>

520
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:45.930
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that style of car,</v>

521
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.190
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to like have this moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>of reflection.</v>

522
00:24:48.191 --> 00:24:50.810
<v Speaker 3>At seven years old we realized this has</v>
<v Speaker 3>all been a terrible.</v>

523
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Like I have this amazing responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm in charge of the greatest</v>

524
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.150
<v Speaker 3>nuclear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

525
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.920
<v Speaker 3>you think you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why would he?</v>

526
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Because he's just a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we have these narratives in our</v>

527
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:05.210
<v Speaker 3>head that these people become heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That a president is something different</v>

528
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:06.710
<v Speaker 3>than a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

529
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Well I would just think to that if that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

530
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Speaker 3>I get who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like God damn it.</v>

531
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Don't you get also influenced and formed</v>
<v Speaker 3>by that,</v>

532
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.280
<v Speaker 3>by that way of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like yes,</v>

533
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.570
<v Speaker 3>you do have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the scary point.</v>

534
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 3>You do have a nuclear arsenal at your</v>
<v Speaker 3>disposal.</v>

535
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Edit his fucking dangerous because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know you're dealing with another fucking</v>

536
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 3>lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

537
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

538
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean they found each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

539
00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a love story.</v>

540
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

541
00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:50.900
<v Speaker 3>in a way there's an argument and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the argument that a guy like trump is</v>

542
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:55.901
<v Speaker 3>actually good in this situation because</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy who is too diplomatic and it would</v>

543
00:25:57.111 --> 00:26:02.111
<v Speaker 3>allow this guy to develop real long</v>
<v Speaker 3>range nuclear capabilities that it'd be</v>

544
00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:08.561
<v Speaker 3>extremely dangerous and that with a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was harassing him and fucking with</v>

545
00:26:08.631 --> 00:26:12.500
<v Speaker 3>him like the way trump does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you allow the military to do</v>

546
00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:17.000
<v Speaker 3>something to stop this guy from</v>
<v Speaker 3>developing these long range nuclear</v>

547
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:22.001
<v Speaker 3>capabilities that this would be better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than having some very wishy washy</v>

548
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:24.540
<v Speaker 3>president who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

549
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 3>put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put severe restrictions in the military</v>

550
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 3>and didn't allow them to stop this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would all like to think that the</v>

551
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:36.671
<v Speaker 3>world is like we are here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are here in the United States for the</v>

552
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:38.660
<v Speaker 3>most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty safe.</v>

553
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.000
<v Speaker 3>Not a bad place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

554
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 3>most neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in bad neighborhoods,</v>

555
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.130
<v Speaker 2>most of the time it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally bad shit happens regularly.</v>

556
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Bad Shit happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not like it happens in the Congo,</v>

557
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like it happens in Syria right now.</v>

558
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Not like Aleppo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like all these other other parts of</v>

559
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 2>the world that are in constant turmoil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Libya,</v>

560
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.310
<v Speaker 2>go to Libya right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking Kate.</v>

561
00:27:01.311 --> 00:27:03.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a failed state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an isis hotbed,</v>

562
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's parts of the world that are just</v>

563
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:10.401
<v Speaker 2>fucked and if you're not the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>person that is willing to do something</v>

564
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.300
<v Speaker 2>to protect the rest of the people from</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting involved in the kind of chaos.</v>

565
00:27:18.181 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 2>It's in those parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff can leak over.</v>

566
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Bad people can come in to your neck of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods and start treating where you</v>

567
00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:30.630
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly how they treat Syria.</v>

568
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Exactly how they treat the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible.</v>

569
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm a believer that if this bad</v>

570
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:40.770
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is what you're talking about,</v>

571
00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:45.771
<v Speaker 1>what you you mentioned is horrific</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

572
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Aleppo,</v>

573
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen pictures of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

574
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.170
<v Speaker 1>It literally is a wasteland and now it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been a lot of palm doubt.</v>

575
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

576
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.900
<v Speaker 1>and the suffering that those people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>endured and the amount of refugees in</v>

577
00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 1>the world has gone up and up and up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

578
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can isolate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

579
00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that has to come back to roost</v>

580
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.060
<v Speaker 1>in some ways and it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

581
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of random incidents of</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism.</v>

582
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.320
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is that we have to have</v>

583
00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like unified worldview light,</v>

584
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.990
<v Speaker 1>like seriously have a compassion for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

585
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I know this guy but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for everybody,</v>

586
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:37.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

587
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

588
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>

589
00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>

590
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bad.</v>

591
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if the world is kind of a small</v>

592
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:50.370
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with technology these days,</v>

593
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

594
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:58.090
<v Speaker 1>if there are thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>refugees because of bombings,</v>

595
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

596
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 1>they seek revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

597
00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:04.371
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

598
00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:06.230
<v Speaker 1>they grow up and hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

599
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.940
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grow up of course.</v>

600
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:13.941
<v Speaker 1>But what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that I'm saying that that</v>

601
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 1>does affect us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you originally said,</v>

602
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 1>well we live in a nice place where it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of basically.</v>

603
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say that I don't know how long</v>

604
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.800
<v Speaker 1>that can exist without</v>

605
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.050
<v Speaker 2>all of the turmoil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is if you're living in</v>

606
00:29:32.051 --> 00:29:34.900
<v Speaker 2>the United States and you're living in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly peaceful place,</v>

607
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.160
<v Speaker 2>you have to take into consideration that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people out there like Kim Jong</v>

608
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Aoun who do regularly killed their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who regularly kills people who are</v>

609
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.160
<v Speaker 2>insubordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who regularly kills anyone who thinks,</v>

610
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:51.700
<v Speaker 2>who would challenge him in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he has nuclear powers and he is</v>

611
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:55.570
<v Speaker 2>going to do something and it's entirely</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible that he could launch a missile.</v>

612
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.490
<v Speaker 2>It's entire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucking crazy.</v>

613
00:29:57.491 --> 00:30:01.170
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that he could do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in some sort of a suicide mission and</v>

614
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 2>then he could launch a nuclear strike on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States in a suicide mission.</v>

615
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:07.390
<v Speaker 2>If he gets the capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

616
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.370
<v Speaker 2>it really depends entirely on how that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>managed,</v>

617
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 2>but there are people that would manage</v>
<v Speaker 2>that incorrectly and he could get to the</v>

618
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 2>point where he has those nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>capabilities and he could launch and he</v>

619
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 2>could do something that has to be taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>into consideration.</v>

620
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.940
<v Speaker 2>We've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did it to Hiroshima,</v>

621
00:30:24.941 --> 00:30:26.410
<v Speaker 2>we did it to Nagasaki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We lose.</v>

622
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 2>We literally dropped indiscriminant</v>
<v Speaker 2>bombs on entire cities,</v>

623
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.740
<v Speaker 2>so that's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy and it just happened.</v>

624
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Just happened on 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even right.</v>

625
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it interesting how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how most people don't have a sense of</v>

626
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.580
<v Speaker 2>time and history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eighty fucking years is nothing.</v>

627
00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing that's nothing,</v>

628
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.440
<v Speaker 2>but the modern day person is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

629
00:30:48.441 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 2>a long time is 45 minutes ago on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter feed.</v>

630
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Like that's 45 minutes ago that someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you a,</v>

631
00:30:54.381 --> 00:30:56.770
<v Speaker 2>an article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they send you an article but growth from</v>

632
00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:59.950
<v Speaker 2>2013 just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

633
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 2>that's four years ago is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get caught up in that shit.</v>

634
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.223
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

635
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 2>you know what I love watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentaries is because it reminds me,</v>

636
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:10.840
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

637
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the same shit went down in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1960.</v>

638
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

639
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like demonstrations,</v>

640
00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:19.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nixon was in power.</v>

641
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:22.060
<v Speaker 2>We had Vietnam going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

642
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.620
<v Speaker 2>I think there's always been a problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people feeling like they're</v>

643
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.970
<v Speaker 2>represented and communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

644
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:31.990
<v Speaker 2>those two problems have always existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just exists today in a different way</v>

645
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.240
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We almost have too much communication.</v>

646
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean,</v>

647
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:36.910
<v Speaker 2>too much information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

648
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

649
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And I think you're definitely right that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to think of the whole world as</v>

650
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:46.951
<v Speaker 2>being a like one thing instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>walling things off and.</v>

651
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.660
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is when you pull over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

652
00:31:49.661 --> 00:31:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you get a little scared.</v>

653
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have someone who's a military</v>

654
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:58.210
<v Speaker 2>dictator like Kim John Loon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a totally different situation.</v>

655
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Like he won't let the people live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shoots them when they try to leave</v>

656
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.380
<v Speaker 2>like this is.</v>

657
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 2>This is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad thing to be seeing in 2017.</v>

658
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.280
<v Speaker 2>That's entirely different than someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is a Syrian refugee who those people</v>

659
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 2>are fleeing for their lives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously they're in incredibly hostile</v>

660
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:18.280
<v Speaker 2>environments and situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are substantial parts of the</v>

661
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 2>world that welcome those people and want</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people to have an opportunity to</v>

662
00:32:22.361 --> 00:32:24.640
<v Speaker 2>get away from what they're experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

663
00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:27.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>that argue for bringing them over here</v>

664
00:32:27.611 --> 00:32:31.420
<v Speaker 2>and helping those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think our compassion is still</v>

665
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:33.550
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people don't want to be unsafe</v>

666
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

667
00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we will eventually these</v>

668
00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 2>boundaries will become more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>

669
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:45.170
<v Speaker 2>These lines in the ground that we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>drawn where we've decide like this is,</v>

670
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are Canada and we are against you</v>

671
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 2>America and you're connected to us by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same dirt like we were tribes and</v>

672
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:54.260
<v Speaker 2>the tribes that were tribe earth.</v>

673
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

674
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.980
<v Speaker 2>and I think once we realized that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a lot better off,</v>

675
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:02.210
<v Speaker 2>but then we're going to have to really</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the allocation of resources.</v>

676
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

677
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about also distribution</v>
<v Speaker 2>of wealth,</v>

678
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of another way to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>allocation of resources?</v>

679
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about fixing places where</v>

680
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>there's no hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

681
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that it's allocation of</v>

682
00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:21.890
<v Speaker 2>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things you think about,</v>

683
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:25.760
<v Speaker 2>like when like Halliburton got these no</v>
<v Speaker 2>bid deals to go into Iraq and build</v>

684
00:33:25.761 --> 00:33:30.761
<v Speaker 2>these things and why can't someone get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same sort of contracts to go in and</v>

685
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:38.170
<v Speaker 2>established established places</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the United States?</v>

686
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Like established community centers in</v>
<v Speaker 2>impoverished neighborhoods do the same</v>

687
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:46.480
<v Speaker 2>thing to Guadalajara,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into Tiawana and try to like set it.</v>

688
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Here's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

689
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is my trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not trip,</v>

690
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:54.550
<v Speaker 2>but like my bent is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

691
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 2>there is just like what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

692
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:01.210
<v Speaker 2>community building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

693
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 2>going into places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>setting up education centers,</v>

694
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to be a priority when it</v>

695
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 2>was not profitable.</v>

696
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

697
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:15.641
<v Speaker 2>But war war is a huge profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rebuilding is profitable.</v>

698
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Halliburton is rebuilding and rebuilding</v>

699
00:34:19.971 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 2>his problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you need to rebuild?</v>

700
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 2>You need to fucking knock it down first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

701
00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:25.520
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weird,</v>

702
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:27.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because things are already knocked down,</v>

703
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 2>but rebuilding them is now profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

704
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world are already fucked.</v>

705
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.690
<v Speaker 2>But going in them and in rebuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

706
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:40.691
<v Speaker 2>going to impoverished parts of Ecuador</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rebuilding that and try to,</v>

707
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it so that these people have</v>

708
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:47.680
<v Speaker 2>opportunities to advance their lives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of their families and there's</v>

709
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 2>no money in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't their money of that?</v>

710
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's weird that we know that</v>

711
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.670
<v Speaker 2>everything is about where there's money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

712
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 2>and that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at how much the,</v>

713
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.650
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at China,</v>

714
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

715
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Look at how much their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

716
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:04.790
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

717
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.880
<v Speaker 2>their way of life has improved since</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism sort of been installed.</v>

718
00:35:08.881 --> 00:35:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Like the amount of people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty in China.</v>

719
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I was just reading this like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the staggering change since what's close</v>

720
00:35:16.431 --> 00:35:20.570
<v Speaker 2>to capitalism capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have a lot more restrictions on</v>

721
00:35:20.571 --> 00:35:22.600
<v Speaker 2>what they're allowed to do and not do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

722
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.650
<v Speaker 2>in China they still can't research</v>
<v Speaker 2>tenement,</v>

723
00:35:24.651 --> 00:35:27.580
<v Speaker 2>square research it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

724
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't find out about it.</v>

725
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

726
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like when you do that to</v>

727
00:35:32.991 --> 00:35:36.590
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say to people,</v>

728
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

729
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:43.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't there immediately like,</v>

730
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

731
00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 2>like it's immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dictatorship.</v>

732
00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

733
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.550
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the crazy thing about Kim Jong</v>

734
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.170
<v Speaker 2>wound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the crazy thing about China.</v>

735
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you're in a situation where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a dictatorship,</v>

736
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 2>you have a group or a person who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling the inflammation that gets</v>

737
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 2>distributed to the people and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are under the thumb of this</v>

738
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when this person says</v>

739
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:05.850
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing is the law.</v>

740
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 2>That is one of the scariest things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is that what essentially trump is</v>

741
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:14.721
<v Speaker 2>doing is treating his word as law and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that everyone else is fake news</v>

742
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:19.560
<v Speaker 2>and they're all liars and everyone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>poses him,</v>

743
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 2>they cannot have a reasonable opposition</v>
<v Speaker 2>of him.</v>

744
00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any opposition must be chastised.</v>

745
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.320
<v Speaker 2>If he wasn't within our system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be a fucking Dick.</v>

746
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:30.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is that personality.</v>

747
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

748
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

749
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.620
<v Speaker 2>he's in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing with the FBI,</v>

750
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.030
<v Speaker 2>you know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

751
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Where they're investigating</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unnatural where it's at.</v>

752
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:42.500
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about fire read fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Miller.</v>

753
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As he's talking about,</v>

754
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:49.701
<v Speaker 2>I'm still not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he knows and the people around</v>

755
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 2>him know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

756
00:36:50.851 --> 00:36:54.750
<v Speaker 2>you cannot do that because I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

757
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to fuck with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong people.</v>

758
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:58.470
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still could fuck with the world.</v>

759
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.380
<v Speaker 2>People within this country already</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked with the wrong people is fuck</v>

760
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:04.560
<v Speaker 2>with the intelligence community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means fuck with the CIA and the FBI</v>

761
00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 2>and they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

762
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:07.680
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing.</v>

763
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.420
<v Speaker 2>At the FDA for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly not as dangerous.</v>

764
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's harder to kill a president today,</v>

765
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.730
<v Speaker 2>but the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just stopped a terrorist attack in</v>

766
00:37:17.731 --> 00:37:18.730
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

767
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't hear about it because the</v>

768
00:37:20.641 --> 00:37:23.630
<v Speaker 2>president hasn't talked about it in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>news that talked about it a little more</v>

769
00:37:23.631 --> 00:37:26.790
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a planned isis terror attack</v>

770
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:31.080
<v Speaker 2>at one of the peers in San Francisco and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy who was a former soldier was</v>

771
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:35.420
<v Speaker 2>planning it and reached out to isis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>was trying to do in the US soldiers.</v>

772
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.720
<v Speaker 2>You're a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

773
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

774
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get crazy on all sides,</v>

775
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.570
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I mean about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

776
00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 2>when there is bad conditions all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

777
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 2>it filters and that's one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

778
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is a guy who was an American</v>

779
00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:54.750
<v Speaker 2>citizen that wants to attack random</v>
<v Speaker 2>American civilians.</v>

780
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a crazy person who was the</v>

781
00:37:56.551 --> 00:38:00.000
<v Speaker 2>person who have blown a fuse and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to do this for Isis and was</v>

782
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.900
<v Speaker 2>doing it publicly on facebook was it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaching out to these people.</v>

783
00:38:03.901 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 2>So he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a blown fuse for sure.</v>

784
00:38:06.121 --> 00:38:09.600
<v Speaker 2>He didn't understand what he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>or understand that obviously people are</v>

785
00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Speaker 2>going to be paying attention to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking isis pages.</v>

786
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it wild that people publicly put</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit out on facebook?</v>

787
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 2>It's wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not wild.</v>

788
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of doll mines out there.</v>

789
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.340
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is that the FBI thwarted this</v>

790
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>President hasn't said a Goddamn word</v>

791
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:29.610
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's praising these firefighters doing</v>

792
00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 2>an amazing job mazing job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's not saying anything.</v>

793
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wonder if it's because wants</v>

794
00:38:35.561 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>everybody</v>

795
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 3>to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

796
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 3>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no terrorists or activity going</v>

797
00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Speaker 3>on and just want to praise the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's.</v>

798
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Speaker 3>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's exactly what it is.</v>

799
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 3>I think he's against getting groceries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting investigated.</v>

800
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he has a vendetta against the</v>

801
00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:52.060
<v Speaker 3>FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's at war with the FBI.</v>

802
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

803
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:59.010
<v Speaker 3>This is a crazy situation where someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this mindset is running the country</v>

804
00:38:59.141 --> 00:39:01.810
<v Speaker 3>and some people love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love it mag.</v>

805
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get things done.</v>

806
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Look at the job list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snus rate is down,</v>

807
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:11.320
<v Speaker 3>unemployment is down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all this good stuff is</v>

808
00:39:11.321 --> 00:39:14.530

809
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious about when they talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the stock market.</v>

810
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm hitting record highs first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a fact that 50 percent of</v>

811
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 3>America is in poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five.</v>

812
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you agree with that stat?</v>

813
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:29.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>

814
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could look it up,</v>

815
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:36.151
<v Speaker 3>but it's poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a certain level of income and I've</v>

816
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 3>forgotten what it means.</v>

817
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.620
<v Speaker 3>What is the number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it like I'm not $20,000 or.</v>

818
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's around 30,000.</v>

819
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's around there and I find out.</v>

820
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 3>I think also it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it also talks about benefits and</v>

821
00:39:54.701 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 3>that was just an article man at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post,</v>

822
00:39:57.191 --> 00:40:00.850
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About how people in their seventies are</v>

823
00:40:00.851 --> 00:40:05.530
<v Speaker 3>having to take full time jobs because</v>
<v Speaker 3>their pensions have been taking away.</v>

824
00:40:05.531 --> 00:40:10.531
<v Speaker 3>I'm in corporate America is taking away</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

825
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Well Jamie was just talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday about how uh,</v>

826
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:19.020
<v Speaker 3>like companies are selling you the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>product but now it has like a half an</v>

827
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:24.210
<v Speaker 3>ounce less than it used to before and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boxes are slightly smaller and I</v>

828
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.100
<v Speaker 3>just bought two boxes of cereal</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday and they both say they're 12</v>

829
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 3>ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one's 12 ounces and one's 12 point one</v>

830
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:31.480
<v Speaker 3>ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the boxes are not even close to the</v>

831
00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 3>same size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same cereal to rights checks.</v>

832
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.010
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cereal and everything.</v>

833
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.550
<v Speaker 3>You told her that they're lying or do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that they've figured out a way</v>

834
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:42.070
<v Speaker 3>to get 12 ounces in a smaller box</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know how you would open up</v>

835
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:44.980
<v Speaker 3>cereal and then there would be like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little air space and then you'd get to</v>

836
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:47.890
<v Speaker 3>the package and then there's a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>air that package.</v>

837
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Cereal might be a bad example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but gatorade for example was a 20.</v>

838
00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:55.390
<v Speaker 3>It's 28 ounces now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be a 32 ounces for three years</v>

839
00:40:55.391 --> 00:41:00.391
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A perfect example of like taking you pay</v>

840
00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:04.710
<v Speaker 3>more and get less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

841
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.730
<v Speaker 3>they just this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fact.</v>

842
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Infinite growth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That paradigm that corporations operate</v>

843
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:13.450
<v Speaker 3>under where you constantly have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>improve every quarter you have to make</v>

844
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:15.370
<v Speaker 3>more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have an obligation to the same.</v>

845
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

846
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.710
<v Speaker 3>how come you can't make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen if you make $100,000,000 in your</v>

847
00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 3>corporation this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't you make $100 million next</v>

848
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.423
<v Speaker 3>year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's happy.</v>

849
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

850
00:41:26.081 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean isn't that the isn't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

851
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.760
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the textbook definition of</v>
<v Speaker 3>greed?</v>

852
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.550
<v Speaker 3>See this three different size cups</v>
<v Speaker 3>appear to hold the same amount of soda,</v>

853
00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 4>might be a sponge and the bottom of one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of them you can't really tell,</v>

854
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:39.560
<v Speaker 4>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

855
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:42.500
<v Speaker 4>this guy did this four or five times to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of prove that there wasn't.</v>

856
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 4>This is a small medium and like super</v>
<v Speaker 4>large sized cup and they all hold the</v>

857
00:41:48.241 --> 00:41:50.280
<v Speaker 4>same amount of liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

858
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:53.170
<v Speaker 4>Super Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was explained to you yesterday that</v>

859
00:41:53.171 --> 00:41:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Bra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

860
00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.790
<v Speaker 3>See this a daily mail's super sketchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just where they sat in</v>

861
00:42:00.791 --> 00:42:01.630
<v Speaker 3>England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

862
00:42:01.631 --> 00:42:03.610
<v Speaker 3>the Daily Mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

863
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.091
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

864
00:42:04.091 --> 00:42:06.850
<v Speaker 3>they're super sketchy with staff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're super sketchy.</v>

865
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

866
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely a problem with that.</v>

867
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:16.631
<v Speaker 3>We have with the system that's in place</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like how corporations get</v>

868
00:42:17.051 --> 00:42:18.790
<v Speaker 3>treated as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

869
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.670
<v Speaker 3>They're allowed to donate enormous sums</v>
<v Speaker 3>of money now,</v>

870
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.960
<v Speaker 3>and this is a fairly recent within the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last decade,</v>

871
00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:31.830
<v Speaker 3>the way that the structure has changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's also the diffusion of</v>

872
00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:36.190
<v Speaker 3>responsibility inside the corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you work for a big evil corporation,</v>

873
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.530
<v Speaker 3>but you're a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ready pepitone,</v>

874
00:42:38.531 --> 00:42:40.450
<v Speaker 3>you're a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You waived your neighbor,</v>

875
00:42:40.451 --> 00:42:41.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give money to charity,</v>

876
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.700
<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile you're making toxic sludge</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's killing people in the Philippines</v>

877
00:42:45.701 --> 00:42:46.910
<v Speaker 3>or wherever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

878
00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:48.990
<v Speaker 3>you know how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

879
00:42:48.991 --> 00:42:50.980
<v Speaker 3>it is how it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's how it goes.</v>

880
00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Also to justify this infinite growth</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

881
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.400
<v Speaker 3>This corporation keeps growing and keeps</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing,</v>

882
00:42:57.401 --> 00:43:01.150
<v Speaker 3>keeps growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why trump is opening up these</v>

883
00:43:01.151 --> 00:43:04.330
<v Speaker 3>national monuments for drilling wells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really fucked.</v>

884
00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:06.370
<v Speaker 3>I knew an outdoors guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scary,</v>

885
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.560
<v Speaker 3>scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really scary shit.</v>

886
00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:09.900
<v Speaker 3>But Natalie is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

887
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.793
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

888
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.640
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an affront.</v>

889
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:13.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

890
00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.590
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't take away our fucking land</v>

891
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:20.280
<v Speaker 3>because to me I get talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

892
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.270
<v Speaker 3>circling back to the panic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

893
00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.180
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these motherfuckers,</v>

894
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.760
<v Speaker 3>these core corporate greed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's call it.</v>

895
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where patients and it's,</v>

896
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:34.990
<v Speaker 3>it's endless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're taking away our places where we</v>

897
00:43:34.991 --> 00:43:39.991
<v Speaker 3>get some serenity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where were we fucking connect to nature,</v>

898
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:42.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

899
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.790
<v Speaker 3>the lifeblood of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

900
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.150
<v Speaker 3>They want to me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

901
00:43:49.151 --> 00:43:51.550
<v Speaker 3>they're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want everything fucked up about it.</v>

902
00:43:51.551 --> 00:43:52.120
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

903
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.160

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

904
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Is the public's land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if they're going to go to these</v>

905
00:43:56.801 --> 00:44:00.790
<v Speaker 3>areas and extract resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should they have those resources?</v>

906
00:44:00.791 --> 00:44:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we allowing them to take the oil</v>

907
00:44:03.461 --> 00:44:05.620
<v Speaker 3>out of these spots?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we allowing them to take the</v>

908
00:44:05.621 --> 00:44:08.440
<v Speaker 3>minerals out of these spots like these?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>

909
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:12.220
<v Speaker 3>these are not there for your disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is American land,</v>

910
00:44:12.221 --> 00:44:15.910
<v Speaker 3>this is the public's land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These corporations that want to come in</v>

911
00:44:15.911 --> 00:44:18.970
<v Speaker 3>and start drilling and mining in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>

912
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.090
<v Speaker 3>it's sanctioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing and then,</v>

913
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.570
<v Speaker 3>and then to like jump to an issue one</v>
<v Speaker 3>step further.</v>

914
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.990
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the only country who pulled out</v>

915
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 1>of the climate accord right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you with me that it isn't climate</v>

916
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 1>change is climate breakdown that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and,</v>

917
00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anybody you've had scientists on if</v>

918
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:47.210
<v Speaker 1>they talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you had an environmentalist on</v>

919
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.870
<v Speaker 1>talking about this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like three days in a row.</v>

923
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 1>And then I was starting 2016 year one</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

924
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I remember telling my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey honey,</v>

925
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it's only one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were beating me down to like,</v>

926
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:15.570
<v Speaker 1>sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of Nice.</v>

927
00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:18.510
<v Speaker 1>It's only 103 today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

928
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.920
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is,</v>

929
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:24.950
<v Speaker 1>is that they're taking land to do more</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil drilling,</v>

930
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.950
<v Speaker 1>to do fucking fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that kind of stuff.</v>

931
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't we going completely toward</v>

932
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.900
<v Speaker 1>solar wind phase II?</v>

933
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 1>That shit out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in California,</v>

934
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:44.310
<v Speaker 1>if you fly over California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see very few clouds and all the</v>

935
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:47.130
<v Speaker 1>rooftops like these rooftops should all</v>
<v Speaker 1>be solar panels.</v>

936
00:45:47.131 --> 00:45:50.760
<v Speaker 1>If they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have almost no need for</v>

937
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:53.670
<v Speaker 1>external power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sunny 24 slash seven here and and</v>

938
00:45:53.671 --> 00:45:56.610
<v Speaker 1>if it's not today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within five years or 10 years,</v>

939
00:45:56.611 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 1>as the technology improves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be a way to extract all of</v>

940
00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:02.770
<v Speaker 1>our needs from solar power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

941
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying we should do</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of fucking opening up laminate</v>

942
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:10.620
<v Speaker 1>problem is like there's so much money in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that oil and we still rely on it so</v>

943
00:46:10.621 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 1>heavily right now and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not thinking about the future.</v>

944
00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:16.200
<v Speaker 1>They're thinking about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now we can get that the thing.</v>

945
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not thinking about the future</v>

946
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.530
<v Speaker 1>dude not be a future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that's really like,</v>

947
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:26.580
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

948
00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:31.780
<v Speaker 1>but scientists really well known</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists are saying,</v>

949
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these hurricanes are the beginning,</v>

950
00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the massive ones we had that buried use.</v>

951
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Then you know that Barry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a couple that really fucked</v>

952
00:46:43.201 --> 00:46:48.201
<v Speaker 1>up and they're going to be the norm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also the constant heat out here in la.</v>

953
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what really freaked me out for</v>

954
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:52.140
<v Speaker 1>wildfires in December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

955
00:46:52.141 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 1>The big one that's still going on right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

956
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.400
<v Speaker 1>They haven't even put it out in Ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

957
00:46:56.401 --> 00:46:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was saying yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not totally contained,</v>

958
00:46:58.501 --> 00:47:01.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still 90 percent.</v>

959
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like that fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been going on for weeks at Thomas</v>

960
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gigantic fire.</v>

961
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an enormous fire.</v>

962
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of thousands of acres and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

963
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.410
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the firefighters out here,</v>

964
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I cannot believe what they do animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

965
00:47:18.931 --> 00:47:22.470
<v Speaker 1>apparently they have a lot of prisoners</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they make fight the fires for like</v>

966
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:25.640
<v Speaker 1>a dollar an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

967
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:27.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like part of the Gig that's fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

968
00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to fake your own.</v>

969
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>You've got to just run into</v>

970
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.660
<v Speaker 3>that fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get three.</v>

971
00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.430
<v Speaker 3>But I think a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have chicken shit,</v>

972
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.440
<v Speaker 3>it's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fucked up.</v>

973
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 3>My car can get a fucking dollar an hour</v>
<v Speaker 3>for work.</v>

974
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Like why is it okay to like that slavery</v>
<v Speaker 3>is slavery.</v>

975
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Like if their work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I used to think that about license</v>

976
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 3>plates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that was always the big thing.</v>

977
00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Massachusetts that was always a joke</v>

978
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:58.330
<v Speaker 3>that like every two years a new comedian</v>
<v Speaker 3>would come up with the same show because</v>

979
00:47:58.331 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 3>it was so obvious is that a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hampshire,</v>

980
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:04.960
<v Speaker 3>the license plates say live free or die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

981
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those plates are made by prisoners.</v>

982
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.040
<v Speaker 3>And that was what was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

983
00:48:09.041 --> 00:48:13.030
<v Speaker 3>that was always the thing that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>always the thing about license plates.</v>

984
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.290
<v Speaker 3>They were made by prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

985
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:16.630
<v Speaker 3>That was always the reference that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>would talk about how you're going to go</v>

986
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:18.880
<v Speaker 3>sent upstate and you gotta make license</v>
<v Speaker 3>plates.</v>

987
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what people did.</v>

988
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:24.070
<v Speaker 3>But when you make those license plates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making like thirty cents a day or</v>

989
00:48:24.071 --> 00:48:26.380
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you're making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well again,</v>

990
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:30.160
<v Speaker 3>that gets back to corporate greed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was reading about that stuff like</v>

991
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:32.140
<v Speaker 3>verizon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

992
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:37.590
<v Speaker 3>there's so many big corporations using</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison labor to make stuff for them and</v>

993
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:43.030
<v Speaker 3>prisoners also get charged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get charged,</v>

994
00:48:43.031 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where the fuck they come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the money,</v>

995
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 3>but they get charged all these shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to make calls,</v>

996
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 3>if you have to buy your own fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>uniforms,</v>

997
00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:53.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

998
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.150
<v Speaker 3>well they're being punished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

999
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.720
<v Speaker 3>I get the idea behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't punishment.</v>

1000
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:03.610
<v Speaker 3>You have to be fucking confined space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1001
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I guess now you have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the idea is that someone's</v>

1002
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 3>profiting from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets super squirrely.</v>

1003
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.341
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

1004
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the fact they're being punished,</v>

1005
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:13.690
<v Speaker 3>but who's making the money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the money going to the victims of</v>

1006
00:49:13.691 --> 00:49:14.524
<v Speaker 3>these crimes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1007
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's one thing if you made a guy</v>

1008
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.180
<v Speaker 3>like say if a guy robbed your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1009
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.660
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes to jail and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes a thirty cents an hour.</v>

1010
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.880
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state should pay him.</v>

1011
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.710
<v Speaker 3>Like what a normal working wage would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 25 bucks an hour,</v>

1012
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is for this job this guy is</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1013
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:36.160
<v Speaker 3>And then you get all the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely dickheads working for you</v>

1014
00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:38.830
<v Speaker 3>while he's in the pokey and he's making</v>
<v Speaker 3>thirty cents an hour because he broke in</v>

1015
00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:39.300
<v Speaker 3>your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1016
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.020
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's working for verizon.</v>

1017
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's weird.</v>

1018
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.430
<v Speaker 3>He's working for some company that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to pay for those services at an</v>

1019
00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:48.340
<v Speaker 3>exorbitantly discounted rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:49.520
<v Speaker 3>Now it's not.</v>

1021
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.190
<v Speaker 3>It's all not good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing.</v>

1022
00:49:51.191 --> 00:49:54.790
<v Speaker 3>You can't keep an eye on all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't keep an eye on what's</v>

1023
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:58.630
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the private prison structure</v>

1024
00:49:58.631 --> 00:50:00.460
<v Speaker 3>and then we know what happened with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders.</v>

1025
00:50:00.461 --> 00:50:04.270
<v Speaker 3>His wife is involved in what the college</v>
<v Speaker 3>went under because of how is he legit?</v>

1026
00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 3>How many vacation homes is he happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at Hillary Clinton.</v>

1027
00:50:07.451 --> 00:50:07.961
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1028
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:08.441
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

1029
00:50:08.441 --> 00:50:09.580
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton Foundation?</v>

1030
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.040
<v Speaker 3>How much money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know what she was opposed to</v>

1031
00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:15.130
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage until 2030 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be overwhelmed.</v>

1032
00:50:15.131 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 3>You'll be overwhelmed with all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>different people and all the different</v>

1033
00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:21.550
<v Speaker 3>scandals and all the different</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities and you're in your car and</v>

1034
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:23.610
<v Speaker 3>you're on the one on one and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>freaking the fuck out.</v>

1035
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Eddie pepitone.</v>

1036
00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you have to go into nature,</v>

1037
00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go into nature,</v>

1038
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of disconnect a magnet.</v>

1039
00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.780
<v Speaker 2>The native American Indians knew how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1040
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew how to do it,</v>

1041
00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.560
<v Speaker 2>but that's all they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have cell phones.</v>

1042
00:50:44.561 --> 00:50:46.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they made a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.230
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting how you taking that</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit away from them by saying that,</v>

1044
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:52.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had sebastian younger,</v>

1045
00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:54.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the podcast.</v>

1046
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.750
<v Speaker 2>He's an author,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a brilliant guy,</v>

1047
00:50:55.751 --> 00:50:57.400
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that,</v>

1048
00:50:57.430 --> 00:51:00.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the revolutionary war,</v>

1049
00:51:00.311 --> 00:51:04.600
<v Speaker 2>or I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the time of colonization where</v>

1050
00:51:04.601 --> 00:51:09.460
<v Speaker 2>the Europeans are moving across America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them were kidnapped by these</v>

1051
00:51:09.461 --> 00:51:12.250
<v Speaker 2>native American tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when they were rescued by the</v>

1052
00:51:12.251 --> 00:51:13.480
<v Speaker 2>soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they resisted.</v>

1053
00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:18.780
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them wanted to stay the native</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans and some of them moved in with</v>

1054
00:51:19.361 --> 00:51:20.770
<v Speaker 2>the tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some people,</v>

1055
00:51:20.771 --> 00:51:24.310
<v Speaker 2>like voluntarily moved into tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that tell you?</v>

1056
00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:25.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what he said.</v>

1057
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:29.110
<v Speaker 2>No one did it the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The native Americans did not join the</v>

1058
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1059
00:51:30.401 --> 00:51:35.401
<v Speaker 2>they didn't like the only force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they join the cities and move into</v>

1060
00:51:35.561 --> 00:51:40.561
<v Speaker 2>these towns?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to be with native Americans.</v>

1061
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to live the natural way,</v>

1062
00:51:42.551 --> 00:51:46.060
<v Speaker 2>the way they've been living forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their system is attuned to.</v>

1063
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel it?</v>

1064
00:51:47.741 --> 00:51:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Because I originally started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started this off with talking about</v>

1065
00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:56.520
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and and as we've been talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the one of the biggest causes of</v>

1066
00:51:58.121 --> 00:52:02.680
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is disconnection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disconnection from mother earth</v>

1067
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:06.850
<v Speaker 1>disconnection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disconnection from the heart of life,</v>

1068
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.690
<v Speaker 1>like disconnection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>

1069
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:11.410
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1070
00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:12.243
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1071
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:16.870
<v Speaker 1>but on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of that than what's fueling that</v>

1072
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.880
<v Speaker 1>disconnection is this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology where you're bombarded with</v>

1073
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
<v Speaker 1>information about everything and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make some fucking sense of it</v>

1074
00:52:30.861 --> 00:52:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and your brain overloads and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the bigger picture almost is</v>

1075
00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:39.730
<v Speaker 1>that there are people in power and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people in power.</v>

1076
00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these people own everything they</v>

1077
00:52:47.561 --> 00:52:50.470
<v Speaker 1>fucking own just about everything.</v>

1078
00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Owning more where we're talking about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different issues here.</v>

1079
00:52:53.651 --> 00:52:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Then if you put in all these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

1080
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.540
<v Speaker 2>trying to put them together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you're saying about people</v>

1081
00:52:58.541 --> 00:53:01.230
<v Speaker 2>being disconnected and being overwhelmed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by that,</v>

1082
00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.660
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff to think about that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>real because you're supposed to be</v>

1083
00:53:04.661 --> 00:53:07.890
<v Speaker 2>thinking about your immediate area and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the threats are and your immediate</v>

1084
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.510
<v Speaker 2>environment and where your friends are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the community?</v>

1085
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Where's their communities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they.</v>

1086
00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:16.430
<v Speaker 2>They talk about this community is</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking down like,</v>

1087
00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:19.810
<v Speaker 2>like we have a comedy community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that's a big thing like</v>

1088
00:53:19.811 --> 00:53:21.700
<v Speaker 2>our community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like especially the comedy store.</v>

1089
00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.730
<v Speaker 2>There's one of the cool things about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store is we all go there and we</v>

1090
00:53:24.731 --> 00:53:27.480
<v Speaker 2>see other and it's like very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very friendly and supportive.</v>

1091
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge,</v>

1092
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:29.990
<v Speaker 2>so rare.</v>

1093
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1094
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that dad is what we're</v>

1095
00:53:34.581 --> 00:53:37.140
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you need you,</v>

1096
00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:40.400
<v Speaker 1>you ever have a fucking thing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like flipping out about something</v>

1097
00:53:40.401 --> 00:53:45.140
<v Speaker 1>and then you make one phone call or see</v>
<v Speaker 1>one friend and the problem goes away.</v>

1098
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you and a friend are in some sort</v>

1100
00:53:48.651 --> 00:53:52.430
<v Speaker 2>of a disagreement and you thought that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought this thing and they thought</v>

1101
00:53:52.431 --> 00:53:55.100
<v Speaker 2>that you thought that thing and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk and especially if you meet each</v>

1102
00:53:55.101 --> 00:53:56.990
<v Speaker 2>other and your friends like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1103
00:53:56.991 --> 00:53:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I thought this and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1104
00:53:58.231 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I thought you thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1105
00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.160
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then everybody's happy.</v>

1106
00:54:01.161 --> 00:54:05.450
<v Speaker 2>So you were stressed out and freaked out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nervous and feeling weird about</v>

1107
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:07.910
<v Speaker 2>talking to that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then once you talk to them,</v>

1108
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:09.820
<v Speaker 2>everything's smoothed away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1109
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:10.763
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1110
00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're doing that online</v>

1111
00:54:14.481 --> 00:54:19.481
<v Speaker 2>thing and you're spending your day</v>
<v Speaker 2>online or even texting,</v>

1112
00:54:19.941 --> 00:54:23.500
<v Speaker 2>like I have to text friends and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:25.580
<v Speaker 2>but I see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are weird.</v>

1114
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:29.190
<v Speaker 2>I have a few of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of east coast buddies still.</v>

1115
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I just texted them every couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>months we text back and forth.</v>

1116
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Isn't to say it's like there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>

1117
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they call I won't answer the</v>

1118
00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.500
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at that time for a conversation</v>

1119
00:54:40.501 --> 00:54:41.940
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send me a text.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bit and I wrote a fucking go somewhere</v>

<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1125
00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:57.110
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1126
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and we're all busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that too.</v>

1128
00:54:59.411 --> 00:55:00.610
<v Speaker 1>But it's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1129
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.670
<v Speaker 1>we have to find time for the kids</v>

1130
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:04.371
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1131
00:55:04.371 --> 00:55:08.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm find time for being a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual human and are a huge part of</v>

1132
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:10.020
<v Speaker 2>being human is interacting with other</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

1133
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:12.540
<v Speaker 2>We need each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing they can do to you in</v>

1134
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:15.810
<v Speaker 2>prison has put you in solitary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of that.</v>

1135
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing they can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1136
00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:22.620
<v Speaker 2>you're locked up in a cement cage filled</v>
<v Speaker 2>with murderers and rapists and criminals</v>

1137
00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:25.470
<v Speaker 2>in the worst they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do is to leave you alone.</v>

1138
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't,</v>

1139
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:32.040
<v Speaker 2>that is the big punishment is not like</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting you go out and hang out with all</v>

1140
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:33.860
<v Speaker 2>the guys in the cafeteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1141
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punishment is putting you in a room,</v>

1142
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.560
<v Speaker 2>taking away your clothes.</v>

1143
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.790
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just getting back to the technology,</v>

1144
00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I think voyeurism is fucking killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1145
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:49.010
<v Speaker 1>We've become like this nation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>

1146
00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:53.700
<v Speaker 1>like just like what I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a little birthday party</v>

1147
00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:57.990
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and a bar and it's not to brag</v>
<v Speaker 1>and silver lake like bragging about</v>

1148
00:55:57.991 --> 00:56:01.680
<v Speaker 1>silver lake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like silver lake anyway.</v>

1149
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I do.</v>

1150
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also the guy who likes who makes</v>

1151
00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:11.670
<v Speaker 1>immediate judgments places without</v>
<v Speaker 1>really knowing them.</v>

1152
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a comic thing to do for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1153
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Absolute bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oranges suck or</v>

1154
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:27.410
<v Speaker 1>fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with overlay?</v>

1155
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>

1156
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I just want to talk about voyeurism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

1157
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.340
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was trying to do the thing.</v>

1158
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:38.341
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about fucking hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people around us in this bar.</v>

1159
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:43.540
<v Speaker 1>We're five fucking television screens</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1160
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and I'm the type of guy and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my anxiety,</v>

1161
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.670
<v Speaker 1>like my tension in me.</v>

1162
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you please.</v>

1163
00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:54.430
<v Speaker 1>And this is how I would say it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I never get anything done.</v>

1164
00:56:54.431 --> 00:56:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you please turn off the fucking</v>

1165
00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.190
<v Speaker 1>televisions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way?</v>

1166
00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:04.080
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even have a fight on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even have a good game on it</v>

1167
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:09.330
<v Speaker 1>because the games were over something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just showing random dumb</v>

1168
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1169
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one was a reality show where people</v>

1170
00:57:13.481 --> 00:57:15.250
<v Speaker 1>doing weird things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1171
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And it's so loud and my vision was drawn</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this shit constantly and it was like,</v>

1172
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the problem.</v>

1173
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:28.780
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was right there instead.</v>

1174
00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.110
<v Speaker 1>But if you own a bar and you want people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come in and spend a lot of money,</v>

1175
00:57:32.111 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 1>you gotta give them something to stare</v>
<v Speaker 1>at</v>

1176
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have acute community bar,</v>

1177
00:57:38.771 --> 00:57:40.910
<v Speaker 1>like when them little pubs in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1178
00:57:40.911 --> 00:57:41.930
<v Speaker 1>it's been around for a thousand.</v>

1179
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:43.870
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the TV's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>

1180
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to one,</v>

1181
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:47.800
<v Speaker 1>but I would assume if they're a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

1182
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:50.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't fucking stick giant flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>screens everywhere.</v>

1183
00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about if we give it a shot</v>

1184
00:57:52.481 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 1>where if I owned a bar in silver lake</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking someone said it would be funny</v>

1185
00:57:56.381 --> 00:58:01.381
<v Speaker 1>if I just had one black and white and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just showing old Joe Louis fights on</v>

1186
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:03.130
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like really small.</v>

1187
00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:03.973
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1188
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Joe Louis versus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is the guy that he had these great</v>

1189
00:58:08.981 --> 00:58:10.080
<v Speaker 1>fights with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Max?</v>

1190
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Max Schmeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1191
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:11.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maximum.</v>

1192
00:58:11.991 --> 00:58:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Ellen was unfairly thought of as a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really just a German.</v>

1193
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.630
<v Speaker 1>You just a German guy who was a boxer</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really didn't want to represent</v>

1194
00:58:19.631 --> 00:58:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Hitler apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I've read.</v>

1195
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big rival of Louis where they</v>

1196
00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:27.670
<v Speaker 1>had these incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stopped Lewis and the first fight and</v>

1197
00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 1>then Louis destroyed him in the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1198
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And the big thing about him beating</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis was that he beat Louis and Louis</v>

1199
00:58:33.911 --> 00:58:36.040
<v Speaker 1>was that he stopped Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1200
00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he.</v>

1201
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Did he think he did an in Louis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardly ever.</v>

1202
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he lose one?</v>

1203
00:58:40.961 --> 00:58:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Two fights was at he lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost quite a few when he got older</v>

1204
00:58:43.811 --> 00:58:47.860
<v Speaker 1>and his career lost to rocky Marciano by</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal knockout and um,</v>

1205
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was quite a bit older.</v>

1206
00:58:49.361 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I think he was in his forties at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1207
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he had the rematch,</v>

1208
00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Max schmeling might have killed</v>

1209
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.490
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he had the rematch he</v>

1210
00:58:57.491 --> 00:59:00.970
<v Speaker 1>destroyed Max schmeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is a loss by K.</v>

1211
00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it say what round 12 out of 36.</v>

1212
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he came back.</v>

1213
00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:14.380
<v Speaker 1>There was another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came back and he was a giant hero</v>

1214
00:59:14.381 --> 00:59:16.270
<v Speaker 1>when he knocked out smelling in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first round.</v>

1215
00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Scroll up all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many years later was that?</v>

1216
00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Eight 38?</v>

1217
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you remembered first round?</v>

1218
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:24.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1219
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:25.810
<v Speaker 3>he smashed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was when Joe Lewis was Joe</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lewis.</v>

1221
00:59:28.701 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was when he had really come</v>
<v Speaker 3>into his own.</v>

1222
00:59:30.531 --> 00:59:32.360
<v Speaker 3>And then he went on this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 3>tear.</v>

1223
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.300
<v Speaker 3>They used to call it the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>month club because he was just locked,</v>

1224
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 3>knocking out anybody who's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in there with him.</v>

1225
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1226
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:42.830
<v Speaker 3>he thought some legit guys and billy</v>
<v Speaker 3>conn found them a couple of times who</v>

1227
00:59:42.831 --> 00:59:47.360
<v Speaker 3>was actually a light heavyweight buddy</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>

1228
00:59:47.361 --> 00:59:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Was that Max Baer's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says disqualified.</v>

1229
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.600
<v Speaker 3>You see that 49 and one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened there.</v>

1230
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's a relation to Max</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baer.</v>

1231
00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Probably the 19 thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Must have been.</v>

1232
01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:02.600
<v Speaker 3>He imagined going back to the thirties</v>
<v Speaker 3>and forties.</v>

1233
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 3>So look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the champ all the way up to</v>

1234
01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Ezzard Charles in 1950.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of that.</v>

1235
01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 3>And he started in [inaudible] 36.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the fight with the first fight with</v>

1236
01:00:11.871 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 3>Max Baer was 36 with Max schmeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather was a 30.</v>

1237
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Hold on right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

1238
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he rematched them in 38.</v>

1239
01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.040
<v Speaker 3>The first fight was in 36 and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was all the way the fuck scroll all the</v>

1240
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:28.670
<v Speaker 3>way up to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time he lost he lost the Jersey.</v>

1241
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:32.240
<v Speaker 3>Joe Walcott a unanimous decision in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1950.</v>

1242
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.330
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 14 years later.</v>

1243
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy.</v>

1244
01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:39.090
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his first loss was to Ezra.</v>

1245
01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.130
<v Speaker 3>Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1246
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he Kao Jersey.</v>

1247
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Joe Walcott,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1248
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:47.350
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yankee stadium was the venue for less</v>

1249
01:00:47.351 --> 01:00:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Chicago Stadium and these were huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>

1250
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:55.880
<v Speaker 3>He won a bunch of fights after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lost the unanimous decision,</v>

1251
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:59.480
<v Speaker 3>scroll all the way up and then lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>again to rocky Marciano.</v>

1252
01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:04.370
<v Speaker 3>So you really only lost three times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a believable three big</v>

1253
01:01:04.371 --> 01:01:06.200
<v Speaker 3>ones in the later stages of his career.</v>

1254
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Unless he lost earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his overall record?</v>

1255
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.020
<v Speaker 3>It was 66 and three according to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So three losses.</v>

1256
01:01:12.021 --> 01:01:15.440
<v Speaker 3>So one max mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brutal one to rocky Marciano,</v>

1257
01:01:15.441 --> 01:01:17.930
<v Speaker 3>which ended his career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that Charles?</v>

1258
01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:19.090
<v Speaker 3>The brutal one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1259
01:01:19.091 --> 01:01:20.550
<v Speaker 3>You want to watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1260
01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

1261
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.120
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up watching boxing.</v>

1262
01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Did Ya?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1263
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't paperview it was ABC 59.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1264
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:34.640
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like network back then.</v>

1265
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:39.290
<v Speaker 3>There was something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't paper view and they were free</v>

1266
01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:43.190
<v Speaker 3>tv and I really got into the sport like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1267
01:01:43.191 --> 01:01:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I would be like so psyched to see this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1268
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.340
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would watch you remember a guy named</v>

1269
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Oscar Bona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bona point of view.</v>

1270
01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.060
<v Speaker 3>He was like a bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just like this kind of wild</v>

1271
01:01:56.061 --> 01:01:59.810
<v Speaker 3>brawler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a big guy and he'd fight guys</v>

1272
01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1273
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he changed his name yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cassius clay.</v>

1274
01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:04.064
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's this?</v>

1275
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.200
<v Speaker 3>This is jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

1276
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.170
<v Speaker 3>as a Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1277
01:02:07.171 --> 01:02:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Is that as a charles the loss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the one we want to see.</v>

1278
01:02:10.611 --> 01:02:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Want to see the rocky Marciano one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was the one where as a Charles the</v>

1279
01:02:14.721 --> 01:02:17.060
<v Speaker 3>first guy to beat him and he beat him by</v>
<v Speaker 3>unanimous decision,</v>

1280
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 3>but we look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1281
01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.860
<v Speaker 3>look how much smaller were back then,</v>

1282
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.060
<v Speaker 2>like rocky Marciano when he won,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heavyweight title was 15 pounds</v>

1283
01:02:24.061 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 2>lighter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

1284
01:02:26.251 --> 01:02:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of that.</v>

1285
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 2>And I think he was only five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 and that might've been bullshit.</v>

1286
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people were a little sketchy about</v>

1287
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:35.680
<v Speaker 2>how tall they were back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1288
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.000
<v Speaker 2>try to find that rocky Marciano one</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1289
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1290
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe at the time,</v>

1291
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I think when he was the champ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was 185 pounds,</v>

1292
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe one 90 and Seattle was known like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Marcy Ghana was known for like just</v>

1293
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.760
<v Speaker 2>having unbelievable strength and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>punches.</v>

1294
01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Like she fucking is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1295
01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:01.410
<v Speaker 2>that's what he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1296
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:03.000
<v Speaker 2>this is this hitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1297
01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:05.580
<v Speaker 2>This would think of an immigrant brock</v>
<v Speaker 2>town brawl.</v>

1298
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Like he was from Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brockton mass.</v>

1299
01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.460
<v Speaker 2>He looked small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1300
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 15 pounds lighter than me.</v>

1301
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis Louis isn't even that big.</v>

1302
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Louis is probably 200 pounds back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a heavyweight back then.</v>

1303
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People didn't have that kind of food.</v>

1304
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.310
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have enough to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the nutrition</v>

1305
01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:28.020
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have steroids.</v>

1306
01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:30.570
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have weight lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they had weightlifting,</v>

1307
01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 2>but boxers really didn't engage in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very rare.</v>

1308
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:36.240
<v Speaker 2>They thought it stiffened you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand that the</v>

1309
01:03:36.241 --> 01:03:39.000
<v Speaker 2>stiffening you up is just as your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1310
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 2>getting sore and that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recover from that and that's how you get</v>

1311
01:03:42.121 --> 01:03:44.130
<v Speaker 2>bigger and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like boxers today,</v>

1312
01:03:44.131 --> 01:03:47.250
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like Anthony Joshua,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the heavyweight champion,</v>

1313
01:03:47.251 --> 01:03:49.110
<v Speaker 2>the world now as you look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1314
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.650
<v Speaker 2>he's an English fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a tank.</v>

1315
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a busy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at Anthony,</v>

1316
01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Joshua,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks like like a superhero.</v>

1317
01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those guys have as much stamina as</v>

1318
01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:00.894
<v Speaker 2>these guys do?</v>

1319
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.670
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1320
01:04:02.671 --> 01:04:06.120
<v Speaker 2>because this conditioning methods that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have today are just so superior.</v>

1321
01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:10.580
<v Speaker 2>They understand rest and recovery and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they monitor your heart rate and you</v>

1322
01:04:10.581 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 2>know they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're monitoring lactic acid build up</v>

1323
01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:17.160
<v Speaker 2>and creatine in your blood and so the</v>
<v Speaker 2>science is really,</v>

1324
01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>it's such a scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they engage in that at,</v>

1325
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1326
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.050
<v Speaker 2>some people still take it old school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just think they know more about</v>

1327
01:04:25.051 --> 01:04:30.051
<v Speaker 2>what gets you in condition and high</v>
<v Speaker 2>intensity conditioning drills.</v>

1328
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 2>High Rocky Marciano had something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't teach people,</v>

1329
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:37.800
<v Speaker 2>which is just brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal power.</v>

1330
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:42.950
<v Speaker 2>He just had the ability to land these</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone crushing shots and he also was</v>

1331
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:46.680
<v Speaker 2>insanely tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with a just a different</v>

1332
01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:48.720
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was having this conversation with</v>

1333
01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:51.780
<v Speaker 2>my wife this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about old school.</v>

1334
01:04:51.781 --> 01:04:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Keep that going on and see the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>

1335
01:04:55.340 --> 01:05:00.340
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about old school</v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoons and about Pinocchio and they</v>

1336
01:05:01.461 --> 01:05:04.440
<v Speaker 2>were so mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were so mean and even old school</v>

1337
01:05:04.441 --> 01:05:07.290
<v Speaker 2>cartoons about Santa and Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 2>elves.</v>

1338
01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:09.530
<v Speaker 2>The ells are all shitty to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1339
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:14.190
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck I fuck you guys work for</v>
<v Speaker 2>pc thou they totally pct out.</v>

1340
01:05:14.191 --> 01:05:17.680
<v Speaker 2>But back then in the 19 forties and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties and these cartoons were</v>

1341
01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:20.960
<v Speaker 2>originally made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world was a hard place mat.</v>

1342
01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>It was hard from World War Two was World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War II just over or.</v>

1343
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's something that I didn't</v>

1344
01:05:28.571 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Speaker 2>realize until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Steve Rinella was actually</v>

1345
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:35.290
<v Speaker 2>talking about this on a podcast when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about factory farming and large</v>

1346
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:37.570
<v Speaker 2>scale agriculture when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1347
01:05:37.571 --> 01:05:39.460
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about that,</v>

1348
01:05:39.461 --> 01:05:43.720
<v Speaker 2>the reason why that all got instituted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why we have those programs</v>

1349
01:05:43.721 --> 01:05:47.620
<v Speaker 2>set in place in America was because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>famine because people were worried about</v>

1350
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:50.050
<v Speaker 2>what happened to the Europeans during</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War Two,</v>

1351
01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:54.580
<v Speaker 2>during World War One and World War Two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's estimated that millions of people</v>

1352
01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 2>starve to death in the world and in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

1353
01:05:57.881 --> 01:06:01.930
<v Speaker 2>After the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to do something to make sure</v>

1354
01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:04.930
<v Speaker 2>that that didn't happen over here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they did was they</v>

1355
01:06:04.931 --> 01:06:07.790
<v Speaker 2>started instituting subsidies for</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers to make sure,</v>

1356
01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:08.920
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not making enough money,</v>

1357
01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:12.700
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to give you money just</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we have all this food on reserve</v>

1358
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.590
<v Speaker 2>so that everyone thinks about it as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1359
01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 2>this is evil thing that the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>has done to keep us fat and stupid,</v>

1360
01:06:18.311 --> 01:06:21.670
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was originally put in place to</v>

1361
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:25.840
<v Speaker 2>prepare for the worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're at war again and we're short</v>

1362
01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:26.380
<v Speaker 2>on food.</v>

1363
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the genesis of it,</v>

1364
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:31.930
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>

1365
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.180
<v Speaker 1>now it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

1366
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst part is the animals.</v>

1367
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.061
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1368
01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:41.860
<v Speaker 1>that's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch a fucking.</v>

1369
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1370
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have gone to veganism and I grew up</v>

1371
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Italian and we ate everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1372
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I love sauce and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't admit it.</v>

1373
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:56.050
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that I have gone this way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did it because my wife got me into</v>

1374
01:06:58.751 --> 01:07:02.590
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big animal rights activists and just</v>

1375
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:07.540
<v Speaker 1>watching some fucking slaughterhouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and seeing the fear.</v>

1376
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean to me animals and the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerless because they don't have any</v>

1377
01:07:12.641 --> 01:07:14.230
<v Speaker 1>choice in this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1378
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:19.231
<v Speaker 1>human beings who have fucking horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>life since at least some fucking element</v>

<v Speaker 1>and this could just be fucking</v>

1390
01:07:52.481 --> 01:07:53.470
<v Speaker 1>willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1398
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:12.340
<v Speaker 1>He was in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Marciano was 30 or something</v>

1399
01:08:12.341 --> 01:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>like he is a lot smaller than um.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1401
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:19.933
<v Speaker 2>He was older.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He got knocked out by Marsianno.</v>

1404
01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:26.360
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1405
01:08:26.361 --> 01:08:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I love Bradick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved that Cinderella Story.</v>

1406
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:32.200
<v Speaker 2>You that Russell Crowe is fucking great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1407
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:34.970
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you eat too much carbs.</v>

1408
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do carbs and terrible for you,</v>

1409
01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll do 10 more than anything.</v>

1410
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.560
<v Speaker 2>What about eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dude.</v>

1411
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:46.551
<v Speaker 2>Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1412
01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>But why go vegan when eggs don't harm</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1413
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:52.010
<v Speaker 2>If you get like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have chickens if free range chicken.</v>

1414
01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:52.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1415
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:54.500
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just run around.</v>

1416
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:56.030
<v Speaker 2>You feed them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a good old time,</v>

1417
01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.220
<v Speaker 2>and then you eat their eggs like no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets hurt.</v>

1418
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 2>The eggs are not viable because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no rooster.</v>

1419
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not taking away a life.</v>

1420
01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 2>This is just something that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chicken's almost like,</v>

1421
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:08.460
<v Speaker 2>you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1422
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.270
<v Speaker 2>they're just ags now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're only an embryo if it's on,</v>

1423
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.940
<v Speaker 2>if it's pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has to get fucked by a rooster.</v>

1424
01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:15.860
<v Speaker 2>If there's no rooster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just lay eggs.</v>

1425
01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:17.853
<v Speaker 5>Oh</v>

1426
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.720
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny that most people didn't know that.</v>

1427
01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that until I got chickens.</v>

1428
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:24.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of intellectualized it,</v>

1429
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.870
<v Speaker 2>but then I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1430
01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:26.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no rooster.</v>

1431
01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.180
<v Speaker 2>How could they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1432
01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:31.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the chickens can lay eggs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those eggs can become new chickens.</v>

1433
01:09:31.991 --> 01:09:34.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that only happens if a rooster gets in</v>

1434
01:09:34.511 --> 01:09:37.900
<v Speaker 2>the hen house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess I guess the answer to that,</v>

1435
01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I guess the answer to that would be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way they housed the fucking chickens to</v>

1436
01:09:42.701 --> 01:09:44.290
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to get them that way.</v>

1437
01:09:44.291 --> 01:09:45.850
<v Speaker 2>You can get free range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1438
01:09:45.851 --> 01:09:47.590
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's places that you can get</v>

1439
01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:51.070
<v Speaker 2>legitimate gentlemen free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might actually even visit the farms,</v>

1440
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy that we had on the</v>

1441
01:09:52.931 --> 01:09:55.600
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that gentleman's name that</v>

1442
01:09:55.601 --> 01:09:58.340
<v Speaker 2>runs polyface farms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joel Salatin,</v>

1443
01:09:58.620 --> 01:09:59.341
<v Speaker 2>Joel Saltz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1444
01:09:59.341 --> 01:10:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of that name.</v>

1445
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:02.370
<v Speaker 2>He's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You main?</v>

1446
01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

1447
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.920
<v Speaker 2>you've heard of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in a movie called forks</v>

1448
01:10:05.921 --> 01:10:07.060
<v Speaker 2>over knives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1449
01:10:07.061 --> 01:10:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that movie is very deceptive that</v>

1450
01:10:09.921 --> 01:10:12.100
<v Speaker 2>that movie is filled with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit that works overnight.</v>

1451
01:10:12.101 --> 01:10:12.761
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1452
01:10:12.761 --> 01:10:13.510
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1453
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Vegan propaganda movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're the same guys that did the</v>

1454
01:10:16.031 --> 01:10:17.680
<v Speaker 2>most recent one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1455
01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:21.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the health widely torn apart by</v>

1456
01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:23.500
<v Speaker 2>actual scientists to understand human</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition.</v>

1457
01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1458
01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real problems like meat does not cause</v>

1459
01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:30.730
<v Speaker 2>diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's zero evidence that does when</v>

1460
01:10:30.731 --> 01:10:33.910
<v Speaker 2>diabetes is caused by sugar and by</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex carbohydrates,</v>

1461
01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.340
<v Speaker 2>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by refined carbohydrates,</v>

1462
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:38.860
<v Speaker 2>this not processed all diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1463
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's genetic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the connection between meat</v>

1464
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:46.930
<v Speaker 2>and heart disease use?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a connection.</v>

1465
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.100
<v Speaker 2>When you say people who eat meat are</v>
<v Speaker 2>more likely to have heart attacks,</v>

1466
01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:51.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1467
01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.140
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying what they eat the meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1468
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Are they eating a piece of grass fed</v>
<v Speaker 2>steak or the eating of Shitty</v>

1469
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.390
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburger that's on a bond that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled with sugar,</v>

1470
01:10:58.391 --> 01:11:01.270
<v Speaker 2>with fries and that they have a syrupy</v>
<v Speaker 2>soda with it.</v>

1471
01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Just talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had Dr Rhonda Patrick was on this</v>

1472
01:11:06.191 --> 01:11:09.220
<v Speaker 2>recently and what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the zero is a direct correlation between</v>

1473
01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:13.350
<v Speaker 2>consumption of saturated fats along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>refined sugar.</v>

1474
01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:16.440
<v Speaker 2>When you have refined sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fats,</v>

1475
01:11:16.441 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 2>it produces a lot of bad cholesterol and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things that's been</v>

1476
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:25.791
<v Speaker 2>proven clinically to lead to heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks clinically to lead to strokes</v>

1477
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Speaker 2>and hardening of the arteries and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the big thing is sugar.</v>

1478
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:33.780
<v Speaker 2>The big thing is sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates.</v>

1479
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Those are the big things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And carbs turn into sugar.</v>

1480
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1481
01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very little carbs.</v>

1482
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very little.</v>

1483
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:44.110
<v Speaker 2>They'll crave them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

1484
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:45.750
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get out of it,</v>

1485
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of is your gut health.</v>

1486
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is what's going on inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stomach.</v>

1487
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What your stomach is used to eating.</v>

1488
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 2>If you feed your stomach sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>processed,</v>

1489
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:59.880
<v Speaker 2>refined carbohydrates all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you've got in your gut.</v>

1490
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of gut flora your.</v>

1491
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 2>You're cultivating and it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what leaks.</v>

1492
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 2>Delete leads to leaky gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leads to inflammation,</v>

1493
01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.560
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1494
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:10.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to pick on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a little overweight.</v>

1495
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:10.741
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1496
01:12:10.741 --> 01:12:11.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1497
01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:14.430
<v Speaker 2>And this is a lot of innovative problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>with carbs.</v>

1498
01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my trip has been.</v>

1499
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 2>My trip has been that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1500
01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:22.560
<v Speaker 2>about the animal rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1501
01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't,</v>

1502
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate the way they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine,</v>

1503
01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:29.190
<v Speaker 2>but end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

1504
01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.530
<v Speaker 2>But you can do better for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1505
01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:34.140
<v Speaker 2>you can live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can live an ethical,</v>

1506
01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:39.141
<v Speaker 2>humane life with no animal products</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than like free range eggs and be</v>

1507
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:43.260
<v Speaker 2>okay and just cut all the dairy out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut all the things that you are.</v>

1508
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just what I'm saying to anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>even listening to this.</v>

1509
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.900
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have eggs and you can get plenty</v>

1510
01:12:48.901 --> 01:12:50.320
<v Speaker 2>of it from A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1511
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of plant based protein</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like very rich and powerful for</v>

1512
01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 2>you and excellent for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hemp based protein is really good.</v>

1513
01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Spirulina is fantastic for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of really good sources of</v>

1514
01:13:02.071 --> 01:13:03.750
<v Speaker 2>nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to really pay attention to</v>

1515
01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:06.570
<v Speaker 2>what you're putting in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just eat vegan pizza and vegan</v>

1516
01:13:06.571 --> 01:13:07.680
<v Speaker 2>cookies all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get.</v>

1517
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's going to fight it out.</v>

1518
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1519
01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.810
<v Speaker 2>And I do find myself craving like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe that's because I put it in,</v>

1520
01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.240
<v Speaker 2>you know the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1521
01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be before I came here I had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

1522
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blueberry Bagel.</v>

1523
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

1524
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.393
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1525
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:32.120
<v Speaker 2>You feel good when they're going in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really do.</v>

1526
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:34.560
<v Speaker 2>You what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's what gave you the</v>

1527
01:13:34.561 --> 01:13:35.840
<v Speaker 2>panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1528
01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:36.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not specifically,</v>

1529
01:13:36.961 --> 01:13:38.130
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

1530
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:40.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're feeling kind of shitty and</v>

1531
01:13:40.201 --> 01:13:42.180
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more susceptible to think you're</v>

1532
01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:43.014
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1533
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could just cut out carbs.</v>

1534
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:48.300
<v Speaker 2>It's harder on a Vegan diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's positive.</v>

1535
01:13:48.301 --> 01:13:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you got to get a good book on it.</v>

1536
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:54.570
<v Speaker 2>You got to find out like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really good vegan health books</v>

1537
01:13:54.571 --> 01:13:58.410
<v Speaker 2>that can show you how to eat in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right way to go that way at all.</v>

1538
01:13:58.411 --> 01:14:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Or you reject it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1539
01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:03.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I reject it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1540
01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat wild game almost exclusively.</v>

1541
01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:08.630
<v Speaker 2>The wild animals that I hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1542
01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.680
<v Speaker 2>So I hunt the wild animals and if I an</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk,</v>

1543
01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I get hundreds of pounds of meat and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat that all year.</v>

1544
01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.140
<v Speaker 2>I have commercial freezers in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you after the show.</v>

1545
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I keep meat here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have meat at home.</v>

1546
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I give me to my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my meat that I get is a wild</v>

1547
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:24.970
<v Speaker 2>animal that was going to get eaten by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf.</v>

1548
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't get it,</v>

1549
01:14:26.501 --> 01:14:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean this isn't a factory farmed</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoner that gets to slaughter.</v>

1550
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this year I got an elk in Utah,</v>

1551
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.220
<v Speaker 2>a shot in Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also shot one in California in a</v>

1552
01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:43.780
<v Speaker 2>place called to hone ranch is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>270,000 acre ranch in the middle of the</v>

1553
01:14:43.781 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 2>country or middle of the state rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1554
01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.030
<v Speaker 2>But I'm getting it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it feels.</v>

1555
01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.560
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I started hunting,</v>

1556
01:14:50.561 --> 01:14:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I had decided I was either going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan or I was going to be a hunter.</v>

1557
01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:54.243
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to figure it out.</v>

1558
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 2>What I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to eat.</v>

1559
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to take part in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

1560
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:01.440
<v Speaker 2>when you killed the elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1561
01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.820
<v Speaker 2>When you shoot it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have like,</v>

1562
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.730
<v Speaker 2>like what's the feeling there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must be intense.</v>

1563
01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:08.380
<v Speaker 2>It's very intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a moment,</v>

1564
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a moment of loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you feel like,</v>

1565
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this animal is,</v>

1566
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:13.870
<v Speaker 2>is gone now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1567
01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:15.910
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a moment of reverence</v>

1568
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.090
<v Speaker 2>and awe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to do it sustainably.</v>

1569
01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Like when I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it in places that have</v>

1570
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:25.480
<v Speaker 2>extremely healthy populations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get an animal that's past its</v>

1571
01:15:25.481 --> 01:15:27.010
<v Speaker 2>breeding prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1572
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:29.500
<v Speaker 2>You get an animal that's seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

1573
01:15:29.501 --> 01:15:32.290
<v Speaker 2>nine years old where they really don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have much time left you.</v>

1574
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what you target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people think when you target a</v>

1575
01:15:34.811 --> 01:15:37.380
<v Speaker 2>trophy animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you again barry,</v>

1576
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:42.490
<v Speaker 2>you're very specific about you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing very specific and I'm</v>

1577
01:15:43.241 --> 01:15:47.020
<v Speaker 2>also specific about making a difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I do it with a bow and</v>

1578
01:15:47.021 --> 01:15:47.730
<v Speaker 2>arrow.</v>

1579
01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1580
01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've hunted animals with rifles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

1581
01:15:51.611 --> 01:15:55.690
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me I feel like if I really want</v>

1582
01:15:55.691 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 2>to make this a more even arrangement and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it more difficult and make it more</v>

1583
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:01.870
<v Speaker 2>ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use a bow and arrow.</v>

1584
01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is that high.</v>

1585
01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1586
01:16:05.401 --> 01:16:09.220
<v Speaker 2>you've killed it and then you feel a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of loss.</v>

1587
01:16:09.221 --> 01:16:11.200
<v Speaker 2>There is a sense of loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's c,</v>

1588
01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:15.100
<v Speaker 2>that's what we've run across a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that once you</v>

1589
01:16:15.101 --> 01:16:17.950
<v Speaker 2>get into the natural world and really</v>
<v Speaker 2>started understanding what's going on</v>

1590
01:16:17.951 --> 01:16:20.200
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize like this is this.</v>

1591
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:22.990
<v Speaker 2>No one gets out of this ride alive with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1592
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.490
<v Speaker 2>This like the ALC that I killed hae had</v>
<v Speaker 2>holes all over his body,</v>

1593
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>all over his body when we were taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>them apart.</v>

1594
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Holes everywhere from other elk stabbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1595
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you look up there.</v>

1596
01:16:35.561 --> 01:16:36.660
<v Speaker 2>All that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1597
01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.110
<v Speaker 2>those elk antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those real,</v>

1598
01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.390
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one that I shot in September,</v>

1599
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.900
<v Speaker 2>that those things are designed to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>other elk.</v>

1600
01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:48.370
<v Speaker 2>They slash each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They clash and smash those horns</v>

1601
01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.170
<v Speaker 2>together and it's all to fight over</v>
<v Speaker 2>breeding.</v>

1602
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:54.820
<v Speaker 2>And the most powerful ones with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest antlers are the ones that get to</v>

1603
01:16:54.821 --> 01:16:57.730
<v Speaker 2>breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the best ways to ensure the</v>

1604
01:16:57.731 --> 01:17:00.040
<v Speaker 2>health of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1605
01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:03.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group of animals is once this</v>

1606
01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:06.670
<v Speaker 2>animal has reached its breeding prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one you take out.</v>

1607
01:17:06.671 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 2>You take out the herd bull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It allows the younger bowls to have an</v>

1608
01:17:10.161 --> 01:17:13.730
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can spray genetic wisdom to see the</v>

1609
01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:14.600
<v Speaker 2>big dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1610
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:15.890
<v Speaker 2>You see the herd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call him the herd.</v>

1611
01:17:15.891 --> 01:17:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Bull had you learned that?</v>

1612
01:17:18.690 --> 01:17:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I got obsessed about five and a half</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and got crazy with it.</v>

1613
01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Food and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I got obsessed before actually one</v>

1615
01:17:28.051 --> 01:17:31.070
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I went hunting in 2012 was the first</v>

1616
01:17:31.071 --> 01:17:35.150
<v Speaker 2>time I went and then once I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I did that and I was like,</v>

1617
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:36.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm doing now.</v>

1618
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Like this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

1619
01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:40.700
<v Speaker 2>And it's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a pursuit.</v>

1620
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:43.670
<v Speaker 2>So my food now isn't just food that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got.</v>

1621
01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this like this intense</v>

1622
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:49.820
<v Speaker 2>connection with that food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's got a fucking connection with</v>

1623
01:17:49.821 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 2>their food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't.</v>

1624
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.190
<v Speaker 2>But the weird thing is everyone did</v>
<v Speaker 2>until about 100 years ago.</v>

1625
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:57.890
<v Speaker 2>That's what really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so new.</v>

1626
01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.050
<v Speaker 2>So new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:01.370
<v Speaker 2>You got a 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17.</v>

1628
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had probably seen an animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>get killed on a farm on farms.</v>

1629
01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were around it.</v>

1630
01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go with 18 slash 17,</v>

1631
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:11.910
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to a marketplace,</v>

1632
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:13.580
<v Speaker 2>you'd go to a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to.</v>

1633
01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody and then also there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>no pesticides.</v>

1634
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.550
<v Speaker 2>The genetic manipulation of the food was</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonexistent.</v>

1635
01:18:19.551 --> 01:18:22.250
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was everything was as it is in a</v>

1636
01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:25.940
<v Speaker 2>natural state or in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a cultivated state where you know</v>

1637
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you're splicing things and doing normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that people do gone like,</v>

1638
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.200
<v Speaker 2>like my favorite target topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't we got just the wrong way?</v>

1639
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've definitely gone away,</v>

1640
01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that way that we've gone in in the</v>

1641
01:18:40.681 --> 01:18:44.090
<v Speaker 2>negative ways is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the positive ways of things like</v>

1642
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:48.170
<v Speaker 2>golden rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's allowed thousands if not millions</v>

1643
01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 2>of people to not starve to death because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rice that was infused with protein.</v>

1644
01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done to ensure the shelf life of</v>

1645
01:18:55.941 --> 01:18:56.240
<v Speaker 2>foods.</v>

1646
01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.890
<v Speaker 2>So get the food to the hungry people</v>
<v Speaker 2>because these foods can last longer.</v>

1647
01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Like tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look kind of fucked up now because</v>

1648
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:08.360
<v Speaker 2>they're hard and you know that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>also can stay on the shelves for a lot</v>

1649
01:19:08.361 --> 01:19:08.991
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1650
01:19:08.991 --> 01:19:10.610
<v Speaker 2>and this goes back to what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1651
01:19:10.611 --> 01:19:14.570
<v Speaker 2>like post World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were terrified of scarcity.</v>

1652
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:18.680
<v Speaker 2>There were terrified of famine and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were terrified of the idea of going back</v>

1653
01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:22.910
<v Speaker 2>to war again and not having a stockpile</v>
<v Speaker 2>of food and resources.</v>

1654
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.290
<v Speaker 2>So this is it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all bad now.</v>

1655
01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 2>It's all bad when you go down the food</v>
<v Speaker 2>aisle and most of this shit has sugar in</v>

1656
01:19:29.301 --> 01:19:33.900
<v Speaker 2>it and simple refined carbohydrates and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's killing people and giving people</v>

1657
01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:37.230
<v Speaker 2>just organic markets are mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I try to get organic farmers markets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers.</v>

1659
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I liked the feeling I got was growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tomatoes.</v>

1660
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk it fucking supermarkets and the</v>

1661
01:19:48.681 --> 01:19:53.600
<v Speaker 2>bright lights all the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like you've walked into that</v>

1662
01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:55.130
<v Speaker 2>corporate death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1663
01:19:55.131 --> 01:19:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and they call sugar white death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1664
01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1665
01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.053
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1666
01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to have a sweet</v>
<v Speaker 2>tooth too.</v>

1667
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of things to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fun.</v>

1668
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:06.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get overwhelmed by that shit.</v>

1669
01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I get like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God</v>

1670
01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 1>damn it.</v>

1673

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1704
01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1705
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta write it down.</v>

1706
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Write down what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write down what you're allowed to eat.</v>

1707
01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of the people told me the</v>

1708
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:47.190
<v Speaker 1>write down thing helps writing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing down things helps with</v>

1709
01:21:47.191 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 1>everything I wrote down on that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you now you have to,</v>

1710
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:53.320
<v Speaker 1>you have an obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the things that uh,</v>

1711
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:55.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thompson,</v>

1712
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Bert Kreischer and Arusha fear and I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober October.</v>

1713
01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went through all that.</v>

1714
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.660
<v Speaker 1>No booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pod.</v>

1715
01:22:02.661 --> 01:22:05.130
<v Speaker 1>You liked that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was educational.</v>

1716
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good to do.</v>

1717
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I think I liked pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan and I like the occasional</v>

1718
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a glass of wine with dinner.</v>

1719
01:22:13.231 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also good to abstain.</v>

1720
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Just having an addictive personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1721
01:22:19.171 --> 01:22:20.670
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>

1735
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1736
01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.860
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was that I felt like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't</v>

1737
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:10.480
<v Speaker 2>doing my creative work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened was the weed was</v>

1738
01:23:10.481 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 2>taking me totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1739
01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm a child like taking me totally into</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1740
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I just want to pleasure myself the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and I couldn't buckle down and do</v>

1741
01:23:18.731 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 2>work with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real problem with comics that a</v>

1742
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:26.950
<v Speaker 2>lot of us struggle with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having the kind of discipline that's</v>

1743
01:23:26.951 --> 01:23:29.710
<v Speaker 2>required to get work done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1744
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:33.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't produce any new stuff</v>

1745
01:23:33.281 --> 01:23:38.270
<v Speaker 2>because you're impulsive because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of silly.</v>

1746
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 2>I think writing things down helps a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having rules that was going to say about</v>

1747
01:23:42.191 --> 01:23:45.670
<v Speaker 2>this sober October thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I couldn't do any of this</v>

1748
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:49.840
<v Speaker 2>thing and I knew that I had to do 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 minute yoga sessions in this month.</v>

1749
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.500
<v Speaker 2>We had a rule and we were also</v>
<v Speaker 2>accountable to each other,</v>

1750
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:55.150
<v Speaker 2>so we all knew that we had to get this</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1751
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Community and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1753
01:23:58.570 --> 01:24:00.940
<v Speaker 2>talking shit to each other on text</v>
<v Speaker 2>messages all the time,</v>

1754
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:03.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were constantly fucking with</v>

1755
01:24:03.251 --> 01:24:04.690
<v Speaker 2>each other and having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1756
01:24:04.691 --> 01:24:06.430
<v Speaker 2>it was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really fun,</v>

1757
01:24:06.431 --> 01:24:09.550
<v Speaker 2>but it was also very educational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But knowing that I have these</v>

1758
01:24:09.551 --> 01:24:11.860
<v Speaker 2>requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I give myself requirements.</v>

1759
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I write down things every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every month,</v>

1760
01:24:14.411 --> 01:24:16.000
<v Speaker 2>every week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week or every.</v>

1761
01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally it's daily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1762
01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:19.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a big list of Shit I have</v>

1763
01:24:19.361 --> 01:24:22.870
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I have to write five days a</v>

1764
01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to write for one hour,</v>

1765
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:26.800
<v Speaker 2>five days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

1766
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:29.980
<v Speaker 2>That's where the stuff comes from and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write more hours,</v>

1767
01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.690
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1768
01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:35.470
<v Speaker 2>But at least five hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I miss a day?</v>

1769
01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:38.290
<v Speaker 2>If something happens the next day I</v>
<v Speaker 2>require two hours.</v>

1770
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1771
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:42.670
<v Speaker 2>So you know around to a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have two other ones.</v>

1772
01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Do that with food and you do it with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:48.760
<v Speaker 2>See that's what I do also for food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do intermittent fasting.</v>

1774
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:51.760
<v Speaker 2>This is my rule where I only eat for 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a day.</v>

1775
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:54.100
<v Speaker 2>So for 14 hours a day I don't eat at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1776
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:58.300
<v Speaker 2>So whatever that cutoff is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say if I eat my last meal,</v>

1777
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:02.080
<v Speaker 2>my last bite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat until 10:00 in the morning</v>

1778
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:04.510
<v Speaker 2>the next day period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I get up at seven,</v>

1779
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:06.580
<v Speaker 2>that means for three hours I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating shit.</v>

1780
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll maybe have some coffee.</v>

1781
01:25:09.701 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of workouts with no food.</v>

1782
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:14.230
<v Speaker 2>That's cool to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think,</v>

1783
01:25:14.231 --> 01:25:15.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get low blood sugar in</v>

1784
01:25:15.551 --> 01:25:16.930
<v Speaker 2>paths out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1785
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.710
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1786
01:25:17.710 --> 01:25:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fine.</v>

1787
01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:19.810
<v Speaker 2>It'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just harder.</v>

1788
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:22.570
<v Speaker 2>It's just you don't feel good while</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it.</v>

1789
01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1790
01:25:23.261 --> 01:25:24.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're used to doing it,</v>

1791
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.320
<v Speaker 2>you can't have coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1793
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.550
<v Speaker 2>That helps suppress your appetite and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you a little,</v>

1794
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.150
<v Speaker 2>a little pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:33.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a psychological boost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1796
01:25:33.911 --> 01:25:34.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a nice cup of coffee,</v>

1797
01:25:34.961 --> 01:25:36.520
<v Speaker 2>then I'll go hit the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1798
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 2>But I definitely feel better if I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to eat first.</v>

1799
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:42.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how I resist structure.</v>

1800
01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a funny man.</v>

1801
01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:44.980

<v Speaker 2>funny friends.</v>

1803
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:50.140
<v Speaker 2>It is crazy impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

1804
01:25:50.141 --> 01:25:54.940
<v Speaker 2>but you're also the guy where if there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a group of people sitting around and</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're all a bunch of fucking suits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all boring people,</v>

1806

<v Speaker 2>to say some fucked up shit that I'm</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's like you.</v>

1836
01:27:29.461 --> 01:27:32.960
<v Speaker 2>You don't want people to get fucked over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you rightly realized that a lot of</v>

1837
01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:37.160
<v Speaker 2>this materialism and this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate bullshit is pointless.</v>

1838
01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.900
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said at the beginning of this</v>

1839
01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:41.570
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to die and we need to</v>

1840
01:27:41.571 --> 01:27:46.571
<v Speaker 2>face that and stopped just collecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and instead work on having a great</v>

1841
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 2>experience in the moment because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment that you have right now,</v>

1842
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:54.530
<v Speaker 2>this is all you'll ever have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the moment you can plan to make that</v>

1843
01:27:54.531 --> 01:27:58.970
<v Speaker 2>moment better in the future with more</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline and more structure and more</v>

1844
01:27:58.971 --> 01:28:03.680
<v Speaker 2>happiness and and even more like</v>
<v Speaker 2>scheduling community events and</v>

1845
01:28:03.681 --> 01:28:04.880
<v Speaker 2>scheduling things.</v>

1846
01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:08.330
<v Speaker 2>You think you know military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious that I don't know any</v>

1847

<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot.</v>

1848
01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no law.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

1854
01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 2>he posts a picture of his watch as he</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets up to work out,</v>

1855
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:30.420

<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bonafide savage navy seal and the</v>

1861
01:28:45.021 --> 01:28:46.820
<v Speaker 2>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his reward.</v>

1862
01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 2>So he gives himself that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all this stuff done that he has to</v>

1863
01:28:50.331 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 2>do during the day.</v>

1864
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:56.080
<v Speaker 2>See the aftermath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll post pictures of like his go</v>

1865
01:28:56.961 --> 01:29:01.290
<v Speaker 2>to is actual page and see all the photos</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his watch for 30 2:00 AM there is up</v>

1866
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his heart in the right place to,</v>

1867
01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a good guy,</v>

1868
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 2>great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great guy.</v>

1869
01:29:06.661 --> 01:29:11.661
<v Speaker 2>And he spends a lot of his time right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm doing these corporate seminars</v>

1870
01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:13.000
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1871
01:29:13.001 --> 01:29:17.370
<v Speaker 2>like explaining to people the importance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of leadership and discipline and that,</v>

1872
01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this how you get things done is say</v>

1873
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:21.990
<v Speaker 2>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how you relieve yourself of your</v>

1874
01:29:21.991 --> 01:29:24.420
<v Speaker 2>demons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your tension and his concept of</v>

1875
01:29:24.421 --> 01:29:28.920
<v Speaker 2>discipline equals freedom really</v>
<v Speaker 2>resonates because if you have the</v>

1876
01:29:28.921 --> 01:29:33.240
<v Speaker 2>discipline to get things done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you feel like I don't feel good</v>

1877
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:35.700
<v Speaker 2>unless I've accomplished this shit I</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do,</v>

1878
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.740
<v Speaker 2>but when I have accomplished should I</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do,</v>

1879
01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:43.010
<v Speaker 2>then I like to kick back on the couch</v>
<v Speaker 2>and watch a boxing match or a television</v>

1880
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:45.540
<v Speaker 2>show that I enjoy.</v>

1881
01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I can enjoy it where I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

1882
01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I have fucking anxiety if I don't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>things done.</v>

1883
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1884
01:29:52.641 --> 01:29:57.360
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because I started the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about anxiety ed and I'm</v>

1885
01:29:57.361 --> 01:30:02.361
<v Speaker 2>thinking it's all about community and</v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnection and for me it may be this</v>

1886
01:30:03.091 --> 01:30:08.091
<v Speaker 2>just a more kind kinda days I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of fucking going,</v>

1887
01:30:08.431 --> 01:30:09.211
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this,</v>

1888
01:30:09.211 --> 01:30:12.960
<v Speaker 2>this and this to give me a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that would probably alleviate</v>

1889
01:30:12.961 --> 01:30:16.080
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of a bunch of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But community is important too.</v>

1890
01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.410
<v Speaker 2>We fucking need each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1891
01:30:18.411 --> 01:30:20.460
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about the comedy</v>

1892
01:30:20.461 --> 01:30:23.160
<v Speaker 2>store and I wish everybody had something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the comedy store,</v>

1893
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a pool hall lot I used to</v>

1894
01:30:25.411 --> 01:30:29.070
<v Speaker 2>go to that was like that where I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be everywhere I would be.</v>

1895
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.731
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1896
01:30:29.731 --> 01:30:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to get back to executive</v>
<v Speaker 2>billiards and hang out with all my</v>

1897
01:30:32.341 --> 01:30:35.270
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like this freak show where it</v>

1898
01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.430
<v Speaker 2>was all these Weirdos was ambler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white plains,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And all these Weirdos and gamblers and</v>

1901
01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:47.070
<v Speaker 2>strange little outcasts of society and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifelong bachelors who were in their</v>

1902
01:30:47.071 --> 01:30:51.630
<v Speaker 2>seventies and we'd all get together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh and hang out until fucking 4:00 in</v>

1903
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:54.480
<v Speaker 2>the morning and then go get something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat and a comic.</v>

1904
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:58.950

<v Speaker 2>think the comedy store and a lot of</v>
