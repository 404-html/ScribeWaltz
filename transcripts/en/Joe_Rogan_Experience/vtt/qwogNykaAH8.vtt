<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's got fake short sleeves,</v>

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>over long sleeves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

13
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>the short sleeves or sewed in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so it's not attached.</v>

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>How has it worked then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>the short sleeves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes apart.</v>

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>This sleep part not attached at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's separate.</v>

17
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's two pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that when I bought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

19
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>But when you pull the sleeve up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

20
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can come off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh it goes all the way over the top.</v>

21
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

22
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Like a separate hood.</v>

23
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>So do you where the two of them together</v>
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>

24
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>They I just saw it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just bought it.</v>

25
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:00.654
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole rocky thing that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>company did it a whole bunch of pieces </v>

26
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's Kinda cool.</v>

27
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So I'm Sylvester Stallone is slated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come on the podcast.</v>

28
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>You will wear that correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He's here please.</v>

29
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

30
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.513
<v Speaker 1>So is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the upper shirt is just laid </v>

31
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>over the tops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorts,</v>

32
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>long sleeve shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could wear one without the other.</v>

33
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Like you could wear the short sleeve </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

34
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

35
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just two sweatshirts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

36
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>But it's the training montage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

37
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 1>it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes as a,</v>

38
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>as a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it heavy or is it light?</v>

39
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.473
<v Speaker 1>It is not light at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to sweat right now and let </v>

40
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>me shut this door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that'll make you stronger if you got</v>

41
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>a heavy shirt.</v>

42
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

43
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are here and if uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how'd they get motivated by bees?</v>

62
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Bees will motivate anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not all cracked out once the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bee's show up,</v>

64
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.363
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched bees communicate with each </v>

65
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:28.044
<v Speaker 1>other once I was on the set of fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor and we covered these people with </v>

66
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>bs and then a neighboring colony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a colony that actually lived there.</v>

67
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Local colony came and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys doing here?</v>

68
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>And the bees all flew up in the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and sorted it out in the sky.</v>

69
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was wild.</v>

70
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>We had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy told us like the beekeeper,</v>

71
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got to stand down.</v>

72
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>We've got to back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of the area.</v>

73
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:51.054
<v Speaker 1>And was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

74
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to communicate.</v>

75
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them do it,</v>

76
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:54.751
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have to talk it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

78
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talk.</v>

79
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to say?</v>

80
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>There's something</v>

81
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>going on with them that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>we just kind of subtly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sort of get what they do.</v>

83
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're kinda like little,</v>

84
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240
<v Speaker 2>little kind of liaisons it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wonder from the future we'll know</v>

85
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.240
<v Speaker 2>that like certain animals can like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.353
<v Speaker 2>take messages around for us and like if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you told an animal something that could </v>

87
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:22.751
<v Speaker 2>go tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

88
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 2>like a wonderful start using animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>more because animals are,</v>

89
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.254
<v Speaker 2>we don't use them that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there sitting around most of the </v>

90
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

91
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:29.854
<v Speaker 2>I've read something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to encode information </v>

92
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.114
<v Speaker 2>in DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could ask Mike Tyson about his </v>

93
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 2>pigeons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

94
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that's different though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carrier Pigeons,</v>

95
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>pigeons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to carry for a long distances.</v>

96
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 2>How about game of thrones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duesberg for,</v>

97
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

98
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:47.044
<v Speaker 2>But whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason it makes more sense </v>

99
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 2>with birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

101
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Like a bird seems like you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to train it a little bit.</v>

102
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.081
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Berg,</v>

103
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:56.914
<v Speaker 2>you could train some birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some birds I think would do </v>

104
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 2>their own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll ask you this.</v>

105
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>If you had an important message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you just send one raven?</v>

106
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.423
<v Speaker 2>That's what I hadn't never got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you send a flock of these </v>

107
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.893
<v Speaker 2>mother fuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you crazy live that God damn </v>

108
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:08.644
<v Speaker 2>thing gets eaten?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if an Eagle Jackson one along the </v>

109
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fate of your kingdom is at hand,</v>

110
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 2>You can't put that on the back of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>bird did.</v>

112
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I would send a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would expect,</v>

113
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little warbler or something or in</v>

114
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 2>nightingale.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

116
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 2>You gotta send a bird that nobody wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to shoot though.</v>

117
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Shoot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>got into standup comedy.</v>

183
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.573
<v Speaker 3>I still watch these TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had syndicated TV shows that they </v>

<v Speaker 3>Always very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very friendly.</v>

206
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.600
<v Speaker 3>He was a very gregarious guy and he um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

207
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.483
<v Speaker 3>basically he was one of the original </v>
<v Speaker 3>owners of the evening of the Improv and </v>

208
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 3>evening at the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

209
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the full history of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Improv.</v>

210
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 3>I probably should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think I want to say it started out</v>

211
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:57.680
<v Speaker 3>in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

212
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.113
<v Speaker 3>Cause I know there were wars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were ones everywhere at one point </v>

213
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:02.804
<v Speaker 3>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had one in Boston for a little bit </v>

214
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.420
<v Speaker 3>and Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

215
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:06.254
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had one in Boston and then they </v>

216
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:12.521
<v Speaker 3>changed it to a different name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started hell's kitchen and 1963.</v>

217
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was probably one of the original</v>

218
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:19.610
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably one of the top two or three.</v>

219
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a favorite like a club when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were like doing clubs more?</v>

220
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:23.804
<v Speaker 3>Do you have like a favorite one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just happy to get on stage back </v>

221
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

222
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.243
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had favorite ones like nick's </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy stop was always a favorite in </v>

223
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 3>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

224
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 3>Stitches but stitches moved a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

225
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Stitches moved twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about any of the funny bones or did</v>

226
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 3>you go to any of those places?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

227
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.353
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

228
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.253
<v Speaker 3>for the Boston club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedy connection was the big one </v>

229
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.653
<v Speaker 3>and now that's the Wilbur theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird because it used to be </v>

230
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Speaker 3>the smallest club in town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wanted to work at,</v>

231
00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 3>it was like a hundred Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say they get stuff,</v>

232
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 3>maybe 150 people in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he'd stuffed,</v>

233
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean this room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

234
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 2>this ceiling was low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

235
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight and I remember I could,</v>

236

00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:53.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hard.</v>

353
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.900
<v Speaker 2>But someone says you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you take that off me.</v>

354
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.363
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst has gotta be if someone says </v>

355
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 2>you gay and you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to know.</v>

356
00:14:07.091 --> 00:14:07.924
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be sick.</v>

357
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You changed your clothes.</v>

358
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:11.164
<v Speaker 2>The next day he'd come dressed like an a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mafi outfit or something like something </v>

359
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 2>to totally take them hot off the trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

360
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 2>you just wish you could say you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:21.330
<v Speaker 2>you wish you could tell you were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think now you can.</v>

362
00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think still can a lot of places.</v>

363
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.631
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

364
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:28.450
<v Speaker 2>I would love to think that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people that are around us where</v>

365
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 2>they literally don't give a fuck if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Justin Martindale or look,</v>

366
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.530
<v Speaker 2>our language is funny and after that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to be around.</v>

367
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Those are the things that are most </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable in our world.</v>

368
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Funny and cool to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those two things.</v>

369
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Someone's funny and cool to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't give a fuck if you're a guy,</v>

370
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:48.460
<v Speaker 2>a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans,</v>

371
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:50.620
<v Speaker 2>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny ghost.</v>

372
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:51.231
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bureau.</v>

373
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:52.064
<v Speaker 2>You can be heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

374
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you think this goes to the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>store?</v>

375
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

376
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.983
<v Speaker 3>I have some friends that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day I was trying to give them </v>

377
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:01.694
<v Speaker 3>the whole tour and tell them how it used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be Ciro's nightclub bugs and them </v>

378
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 3>downstairs to own it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't take them all the way,</v>

379
00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 3>but I showed them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you go through the back room of</v>

380
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:11.414
<v Speaker 3>the main room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did that used to be like their hide out </v>

381
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 3>and shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told,</v>

382
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.460
<v Speaker 3>I told them about all the ghost stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>that had been filmed there,</v>

383
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 3>but I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's real.</v>

384
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 3>Well I think I'm surprised we don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>more ghosts to animals.</v>

385
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 3>You know what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's you.</v>

386
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when you,</v>

387
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I think you can probably tune in to </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that happened in a place.</v>

388
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think if you trip yourself out,</v>

389
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 3>you could see things that aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

390
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think that it is entirely </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

391
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 3>The ghosts aren't real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you seeing a ghost is real.</v>

392
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 3>But I think that you can get your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>into like such a frenzied,</v>

393
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 3>terrified state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you are open to the idea that the</v>

394
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 3>ghost is a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind can fuck with you.</v>

395
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.253
<v Speaker 3>Like the ghetto boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind's playing tricks on you and </v>

396
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

397
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.740
<v Speaker 3>that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think legitimately.</v>

398
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 3>And I also think that if you hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right frequency,</v>

399
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.693
<v Speaker 3>I bet you get hold up like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a ghost of a memory of someone </v>

400
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 3>getting killed in a place or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible happening.</v>

401
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Just a ghost of a memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

402
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:18.764
<v Speaker 3>I think that's next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the next things you're </v>

403
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:22.040
<v Speaker 3>gonna be able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a gang sign in the air,</v>

404
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:22.874
<v Speaker 3>a special gang sign and then a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth is going to pop out right in </v>

405
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 3>front of you.</v>

406
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.203
<v Speaker 3>Like I think we're going to start to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn like Harry Potter type shit or </v>

407
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.463
<v Speaker 3>like maybe a song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if the cer a certain like playing </v>

408
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:32.354
<v Speaker 3>of us lyrics or our notes in a row would</v>
<v Speaker 3>reveal like the past right in front of </v>

409
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:37.260
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I wonder if there's some Ma,</v>

410
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>magic little warp poles or something.</v>

411
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll think about what music does.</v>

412
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Do music literally changes the way your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body feels like a drug.</v>

413
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

414
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.020
<v Speaker 3>And you heard that rocky song </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you could run faster,</v>

415
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 3>you would get more fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be able to do more pushups,</v>

416
00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Chin ups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stepdad.</v>

417
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Don't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it yet,</v>

418
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 3>but you will probably a lot of dudes </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

419
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 3>But the point is you would for sure get </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy from that.</v>

420
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Like a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

421
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:10.400
<v Speaker 3>cause that was a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

422
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:13.410
<v Speaker 3>Woo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this coffee coffee's good.</v>

423
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear that song</v>

424
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Speaker 1>put up that video the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

425
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 1>that got video that I repost it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vibration sand.</v>

426
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look deep into this topic of </v>

427
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 1>vibrations and symbols that come out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what we're talking about,</v>

428
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.210
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of difficult card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.343
<v Speaker 1>I posted it on my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I re posted it because it's really </v>

430
00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:33.494
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's just a mat that's </v>

431
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:37.784
<v Speaker 1>charged yet being vibrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's explain what's happening for </v>

432
00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:41.294
<v Speaker 1>the people that you just listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play this video cause </v>

433
00:17:42.321 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 1>they're probably get taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a lot of views.</v>

434
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different versions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this online.</v>

435
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.100
<v Speaker 1>It says amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

436
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 1>amazing resonance experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they put some,</v>

437
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it Sam?</v>

438
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 1>This is probably salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

439
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.143
<v Speaker 1>They put some sort of powdered stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sand or salt onto a black mat that's </v>

440
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:04.370
<v Speaker 1>charged and then they send certain hurts</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

441
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.213
<v Speaker 1>This one's 3,835 hertz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it makes a different patterns </v>

442
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.333
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this 3,975 like every time they </v>

443
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:14.934
<v Speaker 1>changed the hertz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a different penalty that 4,049 </v>

444
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.900
<v Speaker 1>look at this pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these hurts are waiting.</v>

445
00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

446
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.810
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can take these numbers and these can</v>

447
00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:26.800
<v Speaker 4>also be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

448
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.090
<v Speaker 4>notes that you're seeing on a piano or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you used to hearing her singing.</v>

449
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.080
<v Speaker 4>So these can also be recreated and other</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways in are probably happening.</v>

450
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.880
<v Speaker 4>And to us that's how like maybe one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

451
00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:41.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ear warmer here,</v>

452
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.450
<v Speaker 4>like Victoria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the back of your neck,</v>

453
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.180
<v Speaker 4>vibrators</v>

454
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.013
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if a certain hertz just spelled </v>

455
00:18:47.091 --> 00:18:49.310
<v Speaker 1>your like your grandparents name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

456
00:18:49.311 --> 00:18:53.150
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is that each one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them are different geometric patterns.</v>

457
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.970
<v Speaker 1>They're these beautiful patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gorgeous.</v>

458
00:18:55.971 --> 00:18:59.300
<v Speaker 1>And as you change the hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patterns morph immediately.</v>

459
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

460
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.990
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fractal,</v>

461
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.020
<v Speaker 1>like not fractal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to be,</v>

462
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the word?</v>

463
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Equal on both sides that this is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for.</v>

464
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Parallel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

465
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.373
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

466
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.900
<v Speaker 4>I think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on the right topic.</v>

467
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.833
<v Speaker 4>If the numbers a little more a round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a round number of these are not </v>

468
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.030
<v Speaker 4>specific hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you do a specific yeah,</v>

469
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 1>different than identical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

470
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.490
<v Speaker 1>they're both sides are exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's separated in this one.</v>

471
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:28.500
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not separated in a half.</v>

472
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.281
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

473
00:19:29.281 --> 00:19:33.540
<v Speaker 1>it's all like the circle is a center and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all goes out from there.</v>

474
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:36.930
<v Speaker 1>But they're different every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're all even like see it lifts,</v>

475
00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:37.764
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that's keeping it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being perfect is that they run out of </v>

476
00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:40.074
<v Speaker 1>sand and it looks like the power is </v>
<v Speaker 1>centered around the center part where </v>

477
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:45.900
<v Speaker 1>the wires are connected to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the most potent.</v>

478
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 1>But so that can beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that may like if you think about that</v>

479
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:50.154
<v Speaker 1>like in a shake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if there's a certain hertz going </v>

480
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:53.334
<v Speaker 1>through the air like in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it would form like a solar system </v>

481
00:19:58.471 --> 00:19:59.304
<v Speaker 1>against one better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling that you get from like </v>

482
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:02.460
<v Speaker 1>rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

483
00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:04.770
<v Speaker 1>The feeling that you get from that song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the duck,</v>

484
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.770
<v Speaker 1>that things going through your badass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

485
00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:10.720
<v Speaker 1>It literally could be like a little drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

486
00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Think about why people like music so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

487
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Cause that musician is your drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

488
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear like some old Elton John,</v>

489
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.950
<v Speaker 1>like you're in your car and Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 1>night comes on your fucking goosebumps.</v>

490
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.120
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't heard that song in a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and you don't expect it.</v>

491
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:31.703
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>JSC had friend that would make you want </v>

492
00:20:37.091 --> 00:20:38.850
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's a good song too,</v>

493
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 1>but that vibe is good.</v>

494
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.320
<v Speaker 4>This was done with my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was saying with musical notes.</v>

495
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

496
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.040
<v Speaker 1>On water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at the thing,</v>

497
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 1>it says the Saima</v>

498
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.010
<v Speaker 3>scope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that how you say that c.</v>

499
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:50.853
<v Speaker 3>Y m a scope uses a high definition </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera to monitor the effects of an </v>

500
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds particular vibrations on purified</v>

501
00:20:57.551 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 3>water revealing for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What piano notes look like.</v>

502
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 3>There are people out there so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter than you and me.</v>

503
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

504
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.423
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing that we're considered the </v>

505
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

506
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really smart people.</v>

507
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:16.020
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have someone like Shawn</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carolyn,</v>

508
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:21.030
<v Speaker 3>the physicist and he has to break down </v>
<v Speaker 3>particle physics and shit to you.</v>

509
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it hard?</v>

510
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.720
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does he?</v>

511
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.370
<v Speaker 3>I I can repeat what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

512
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.403
<v Speaker 3>don't the fuck it means like when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>start talking about quantum quantum </v>

513
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 3>things and quantum theory and quantum </v>
<v Speaker 3>particles as danger.</v>

514
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get,</v>

515
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it.</v>

516
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about,</v>

517
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.393
<v Speaker 3>you know what superposition is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the ultimate what the fuck we're a </v>

518
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 3>particle can be in a state of motion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>be still at the same time.</v>

519
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well good luck with that.</v>

520
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This magic world that you've created.</v>

521
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Crazy scientist that I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

522
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I would rather do something more chill </v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

523
00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.200
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something can stay now.</v>

524
00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.223
<v Speaker 3>Sign up like or go for a run or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something being rather than study that </v>

525
00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 3>are rather than be that particle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

526
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:07.020
<v Speaker 3>rather than study that and be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

527
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Speaker 3>I it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think,</v>

528
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.440
<v Speaker 3>but don't you want someone to know cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

529
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 3>you'd benefit from cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what about the,</v>

530
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.640
<v Speaker 3>the th th th such few people know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they all want it to lie to us,</v>

531
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.950
<v Speaker 3>then they could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have to be conspiracy.</v>

532
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Now you starting to sound like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

533
00:22:22.451 --> 00:22:23.284
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

534
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Let's go get some tin foil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

535
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 3>while I didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

536
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.961
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

537
00:22:32.961 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 3>so that's funny that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your body would do that.</v>

538
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.733
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they would never do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because scientists whole deal is </v>

539
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:41.410
<v Speaker 3>figuring out shit that other scientists </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't figure out.</v>

540
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.030
<v Speaker 3>That's like the best thing they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best thing is scientists can do is a</v>

541
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:50.260
<v Speaker 3>real honest to goodness breakthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you have sex with a scientist,</v>

542
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:51.440
<v Speaker 3>you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

543
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 3>like a movie scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she keeps the glasses on.</v>

544
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.143
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always blonde in the movies </v>

545
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.720
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes a dark black hair too.</v>

546
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Stereos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they're clean too.</v>

547
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 3>If you fuck a scientist yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they have a clean apartment maybe,</v>

548
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.493
<v Speaker 3>but maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe their fucking brain is like that </v>

549
00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:10.700
<v Speaker 3>chalkboard with all the squiggly alien </v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematics are high.</v>

550
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.543
<v Speaker 3>That's Cherry la getting tattooed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of dirty math tattooed or </v>

551
00:23:15.051 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 3>on their posts.</v>

552
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.623
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was reading this thing about </v>

553
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.143
<v Speaker 3>Richard Fineman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You knew who fineman was fine was a </v>

554
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:23.950
<v Speaker 3>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a physicist and a,</v>

555
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 3>there was an article about him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like was fineman and abuser,</v>

556
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.203
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

557
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.460
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was talking about Richard Fineman and</v>

558
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:34.510
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

559
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:36.300
<v Speaker 3>he used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

560
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.000
<v Speaker 3>his wife said he's just do nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 3>calculations all day.</v>

561
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:40.834
<v Speaker 3>And then he wanted to play the bongos </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't want anybody to bother </v>

562
00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

563
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.620
<v Speaker 3>he had a quote from one of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

564
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.330
<v Speaker 3>one of his books and it's crazy reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

565
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

566
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

567
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.710
<v Speaker 3>but see if he could find it because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really,</v>

568
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy quote calling women </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitches.</v>

569
00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

570
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Like that there were that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

571
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:03.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

572
00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:04.394
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to paraphrase it because I </v>

573
00:24:05.191 --> 00:24:05.781
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>

574
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:06.141
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

575
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't deal with these bitches around </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

576
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.750
<v Speaker 3>So I think he was a funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

577
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.653
<v Speaker 3>Is what I think it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard when you see things in text </v>

578
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 3>because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

579
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Speaker 3>maybe he's like a really mean terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

580
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.133
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I adopted the attitude that those bar </v>

581
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 3>girls were all bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they aren't worth anything and that</v>

582
00:24:22.821 --> 00:24:23.654
<v Speaker 3>they're all in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they're in there for is for to get </v>

583
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 3>you to buy him a drink and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to give you a God damn thing.</v>

584
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be a gentleman to such </v>
<v Speaker 3>worthless bitches and so on.</v>

585
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:34.491
<v Speaker 3>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

586
00:24:34.491 --> 00:24:36.470
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so on when someone says,</v>

587
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:37.304
<v Speaker 3>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that implies that this is taken out of </v>

588
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 3>context in my mind is I want to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean and so on.</v>

589
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.950
<v Speaker 3>That means to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm getting out of this,</v>

590
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:46.983
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was going to guess is that he goes </v>

591
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he elaborates,</v>

592
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.043
<v Speaker 3>he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how I felt back then and </v>

593
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 3>obviously I changed my mind.</v>

594
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean he could have been 18 when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about this or 16.</v>

595
00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck is this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

596
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.850
<v Speaker 3>But he also could be very funny because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was apparently a very funny guy.</v>

597
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.193
<v Speaker 3>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the title of his book is surely you're </v>

598
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:09.740
<v Speaker 3>joking Mr Fiman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aww,</v>

599
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:11.620
<v Speaker 3>that's nice then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it,</v>

600
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.180
<v Speaker 3>so like if one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone said that,</v>

601
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.243
<v Speaker 3>but I dumped it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these bar girls are bitches and say </v>

602
00:25:16.941 --> 00:25:19.430
<v Speaker 3>said it funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you see those,</v>

603
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.323
<v Speaker 3>those same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they had all these balls </v>

604
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.963
<v Speaker 3>bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all different depending upon </v>

605
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 3>how old he is too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it could be that,</v>

606
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 3>that's really how he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe he got married,</v>

607
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:31.370
<v Speaker 3>maybe got in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife and he had to say this.</v>

608
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's it.</v>

609
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 3>I think he's talking about when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger,</v>

610
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.680
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

611
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 3>I could see that though.</v>

612
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.503
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're at the bar if you don't like </v>

613
00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 3>we're loud music and all the girls are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just drinking with a bunch of,</v>

614
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.861
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

615
00:25:42.861 --> 00:25:44.450
<v Speaker 3>these girls are a bunch of bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

616
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a lazy way.</v>

617
00:25:45.951 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 3>If it is a lazy way thing and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it,</v>

618
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.120
<v Speaker 3>it's you can judge and you can control </v>
<v Speaker 3>the scenario.</v>

619
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thing is,</v>

620
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:51.853
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go into a room and 10 girls are </v>

621
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 3>in there and seven of them are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>super annoying and you say these bitches</v>

622
00:25:57.951 --> 00:25:58.784
<v Speaker 3>are all annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being super rude to those three </v>

623
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>that aren't and there might be some </v>
<v Speaker 3>decent girls,</v>

624
00:26:04.101 --> 00:26:04.934
<v Speaker 3>but that's why it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's weird to hear like high </v>

625
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:09.074
<v Speaker 3>level famous scientists probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the article they were saying </v>

626
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:14.810
<v Speaker 3>the second fee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

627
00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Beyond uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond Einstein.</v>

628
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 3>He's the second famous most famous </v>
<v Speaker 3>physicist.</v>

629
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Especially a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you think a scientist would know</v>

630
00:26:23.001 --> 00:26:25.470
<v Speaker 3>that there's a couple of these bitches </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be variables.</v>

631
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking this might have been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote from him when he was young.</v>

632
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

633
00:26:30.681 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Then I think that he said that or him </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticizing himself when he was young,</v>

634
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just guessing.</v>

635
00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping that it would be that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy to read that.</v>

636
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Do it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I miss being young man.</v>

637
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Don't you miss it sometimes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well no and yes.</v>

638
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.153
<v Speaker 3>Like it looks like fun to have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and to be 22 and be </v>

639
00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:51.534
<v Speaker 3>backpacking around the world are doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something silly and not having a place </v>

640
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 3>where you have to go or a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bills.</v>

641
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:57.234
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel so fucking ridiculously lucky </v>

642
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.183
<v Speaker 3>that I get to be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't want to try to do this </v>

643
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

644
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would I try to do this when I'm </v>

645
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:13.750
<v Speaker 3>doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

646
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.870
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to go back out of Smith's,</v>

647
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:16.704
<v Speaker 3>being young and like member a nat man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took a nap and you were young and </v>

648
00:27:19.311 --> 00:27:20.144
<v Speaker 3>could last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucking getting care could last for </v>

649
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:22.320
<v Speaker 3>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

650
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:23.154
<v Speaker 3>But I think one of the secrets to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness is to never look back at any </v>

651
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:30.960
<v Speaker 3>point in your life and wish you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>back there because a,</v>

652
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 3>it's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

653
00:27:32.491 --> 00:27:34.260
<v Speaker 3>and B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't go through that,</v>

654
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you would go back now and be 22 again</v>

655
00:27:37.981 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 3>and broke and fucked up with all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information you have now,</v>

656
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 3>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

657
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 3>y'all don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a fucking Netflix special.</v>

658
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 3>You guys don't know how I was killing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

659
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I decided to start over like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now here I am.</v>

660
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm young,</v>

661
00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:51.870

<v Speaker 3>I can't even afford vitamins.</v>

662
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.740

<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be.</v>

663

<v Speaker 3>Joe Wants.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Feed it the right food.</v>

667
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I can't afford a ramen noodle and eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>ramen noodles everyday.</v>

668
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get started breaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>joints.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fucking catching squirrels in my yard.</v>

671
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:16.014
<v Speaker 3>That's when it gets bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure what to do when y'all done </v>

672
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:18.564
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed my body being young dude and </v>

00:28:20.321 --> 00:28:21.390
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how old are you?</v>

674

<v Speaker 3>I'm 38 shut your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fine.</v>

675
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 3>You just got to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

676
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.070
<v Speaker 3>He didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

677
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 3>I just started getting back into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

678
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.793
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing some yoga and I want to go travel </v>

679
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</v>

680
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Downtown's slow down with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You carry yourself in shape first.</v>

681
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm realizing my,</v>

682
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.003
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my advice because you're trying to </v>

683
00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:40.770
<v Speaker 3>explode and get out of things that look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't listen to me.</v>

684
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 3>You can start Jujitsu and be in terrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape and get in shape through Jujitsu.</v>

685
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.111
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

686
00:28:45.111 --> 00:28:49.140
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I was going to advise someone,</v>

687
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.380
<v Speaker 3>I would say if you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's his physical,</v>

688
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:53.214
<v Speaker 3>his Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that you should arm or your </v>

689
00:28:55.921 --> 00:28:57.600
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I mean by that,</v>

690
00:28:57.601 --> 00:29:00.300
<v Speaker 3>it's like your shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your knees,</v>

691
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.860
<v Speaker 3>your back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your neck.</v>

692
00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Those are all areas that if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work out at all,</v>

693
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.430
<v Speaker 3>they could break susceptible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're susceptible,</v>

694
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 3>so I would always advise that someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>does a bunch of calisthenics,</v>

695
00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:14.940
<v Speaker 3>particularly like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the classics,</v>

696
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 3>pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit ups,</v>

697

<v Speaker 2>here's what it was.</v>

745
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:07.594

750
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.883
<v Speaker 2>Well it's a hotbed for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two hot beds right now or here and </v>

751
00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:22.390

752
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.750
<v Speaker 2>those are the two hot beds and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this debate as to like,</v>

753
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 2>which one's better or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>

754
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.350
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great hotbed.</v>

755
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.753
<v Speaker 2>No denying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some world class comedians over </v>

756
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:35.140
<v Speaker 2>there and then there's ones that show up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and here,</v>

757
00:31:35.141 --> 00:31:36.970
<v Speaker 2>like Chappelle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always bounce,</v>

758
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.823
<v Speaker 2>bounce it back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock was always bouncing back and </v>

759
00:31:39.311 --> 00:31:41.200
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louie would news working in here,</v>

760
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 2>but when Louise working again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's working at the Improv right now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>tour and like a year for sure.</v>

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

767
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

768
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:58.480
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting this whole bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the parkland shooting.</v>

769
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saw that stirred up all this controversy</v>

770
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 2>that is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a Louis ck bit.</v>

771
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:07.960
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like people don't understand</v>

772
00:32:07.961 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Speaker 2>what kind of comedy he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

773
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:10.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like suddenly they forget who he </v>

774
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:12.211
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

775
00:32:12.211 --> 00:32:13.044
<v Speaker 2>if you look at his comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even surprised that he was </v>

776
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:15.010
<v Speaker 2>jerking off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

777
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.080
<v Speaker 2>kind of room service sorta deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

778
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

779
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:22.960
<v Speaker 2>his style has always been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that he's,</v>

780
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.530
<v Speaker 2>his style is always very irreverent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

781
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.393
<v Speaker 2>Saying fucked up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't believe he's saying and you </v>

782
00:32:30.401 --> 00:32:32.500
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well written and well thought out stuff.</v>

783
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.530
<v Speaker 2>This is stuff he's working on and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is people like,</v>

784
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could he joke?</v>

785
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:38.250
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

786
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>he probably wrote that day</v>

787
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.203
<v Speaker 3>two days before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many times has done that </v>

788
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:44.084
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I guarantee you the guy takes 10 </v>

789
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 3>months off of stand up and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>started to do it again.</v>

790
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was scared.</v>

791
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:51.644
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would ever joke around </v>

792
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:54.710
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely wouldn't joke around about,</v>

793
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.280
<v Speaker 3>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

794
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just wasn't,</v>

795
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.990
<v Speaker 3>wasn't as best stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't good.</v>

796
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like it wasn't ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

797
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:05.623
<v Speaker 3>But maybe he could have come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different turn on it where it wouldn't </v>

798
00:33:08.451 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 3>be as offensive and it will be way </v>
<v Speaker 3>funnier.</v>

799
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.100
<v Speaker 3>That's what working on a bid is all </v>
<v Speaker 3>bout.</v>

800
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Brian Holtzman.</v>

802
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:18.950

<v Speaker 3>that Louie said,</v>

803
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 3>we would be howland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

804
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.440

<v Speaker 3>Slap the table howling laughing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the fucking fat kid in the way.</v>

807
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.153
<v Speaker 3>That literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a bit that if Holtzman said we </v>

808
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 3>will be crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be slapping the table.</v>

809
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.180
<v Speaker 3>We'd all gather around and watch him on </v>
<v Speaker 3>late nights anyway.</v>

810
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.911
<v Speaker 3>An issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

811
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be an issue at all because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that it's humor is it?</v>

812
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucked up thing to say.</v>

813
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.813
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole art form is about saying </v>

814
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:51.014
<v Speaker 3>things that are funny sometimes saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are funny or self </v>

815
00:33:52.901 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 3>deprecating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they're fucked up.</v>

816
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 3>There are always different sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying things is,</v>

817
00:33:57.981 --> 00:33:59.690
<v Speaker 3>they're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really adorable.</v>

818
00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.693
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes someone will say something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really adorable but also </v>

819
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Speaker 3>hilarious or your act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is odd,</v>

820
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 3>odd and hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just very,</v>

821
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:10.200
<v Speaker 3>very uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theo Vaughn.</v>

822
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.130
<v Speaker 3>If I had to describe your act that say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very theo Vaughn,</v>

823
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:13.670
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

824
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's you,</v>

825
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 3>you know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like everybody does it.</v>

826
00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Different folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

827
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.173
<v Speaker 3>you take a a set from someone who's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>working stuff out and you pretend that </v>

828
00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:25.664
<v Speaker 3>this is done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's probably half those words he's </v>

829
00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:30.230
<v Speaker 3>saying he's probably trying to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

830
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.423
<v Speaker 3>He's probably got a place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of got some punchlines and hoping </v>

831
00:34:34.341 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 3>that he'll see something in it while </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing it and working it out.</v>

832
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.640
<v Speaker 3>And then you listen to the recording and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

833
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:41.900
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did I say it that way?</v>

834
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:42.973
<v Speaker 3>Why did I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you change that and add this and </v>

835
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:47.420
<v Speaker 3>it's his to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

836
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just can't expect them all to be good</v>

837
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:53.150
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like immediately,</v>

838
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.520
<v Speaker 3>especially when the guy's been on trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

839
00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:56.354
<v Speaker 3>or Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

840
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.510
<v Speaker 3>under that social pressure and are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

841
00:34:59.511 --> 00:35:00.344
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

842
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.183
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably been dealing with remorse and </v>

843
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:03.010
<v Speaker 3>go to self.</v>

844
00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:03.470
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

845
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean who knows what he's been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my,</v>

846
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 3>this is my take on a lot of this and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think this is an important thing to say.</v>

847
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.610
<v Speaker 3>We can't lose our empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't lose our compassion.</v>

848
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:14.444
<v Speaker 3>We Ha we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be compassionate towards </v>

849
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.350
<v Speaker 3>victims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could,</v>

850
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.450
<v Speaker 3>we should be compassionate towards each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

851
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:21.284
<v Speaker 3>We should beat this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this tendency to want to stop people </v>

852
00:35:24.381 --> 00:35:25.214
<v Speaker 3>from working and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain amount of time where </v>

853
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:30.973
<v Speaker 3>it passes and it starts to look like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want anyone to have a path to </v>

854
00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:35.690
<v Speaker 3>redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

855
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's got to have a path to</v>

856
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.680
<v Speaker 2>a day have cause we're all faulty,</v>

953
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever think that maybe if a Bray B</v>
<v Speaker 2>is born a certain way,</v>

954
00:39:27.561 --> 00:39:28.394
<v Speaker 2>like missionary or doggy style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it could affect the way that they </v>

955
00:39:31.581 --> 00:39:33.320
<v Speaker 2>lived their life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that before.</v>

956
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.333
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should probably understand how </v>

957
00:39:35.151 --> 00:39:37.160
<v Speaker 2>babies are born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to come out ahead first.</v>

958
00:39:37.161 --> 00:39:37.994
<v Speaker 2>It's your baby comes a doggy style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to spin around inside the </v>

959
00:39:39.501 --> 00:39:40.334
<v Speaker 2>womb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally.</v>

960
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.353
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if the person is doggy style </v>

961
00:39:42.681 --> 00:39:44.660
<v Speaker 2>when they have the baby though?</v>

<v Speaker 2>baby names,</v>

1011
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 2>so it assume that they had had some type</v>
<v Speaker 2>of interaction.</v>

1047
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.390
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to see how they look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at your profile,</v>

1048
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.610
<v Speaker 2>how many people are looking at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>profile and any given moment,</v>

1049
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:08.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1050
00:43:08.571 --> 00:43:10.680
<v Speaker 2>that's a nightmare in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 2>We think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine like just people just looking at</v>

1052
00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:16.820
<v Speaker 2>you and saying no and you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance all the time.</v>

1053
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Speaker 2>It has to be bad for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody will say yes.</v>

1054
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.833
<v Speaker 2>Then the odds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing things you're playing the </v>

1055
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:22.514
<v Speaker 2>numbers maybe in that sense it's better </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the only people that get ahold </v>

1056
00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.170
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that say yes,</v>

1057
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:28.650
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you missed all the notes.</v>

1058
00:43:28.651 --> 00:43:31.670
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I was gonna say is that haven't</v>

1059
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 2>had a baby with someone that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really like.</v>

1060
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a possibility.</v>

1061
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.350
<v Speaker 2>If you just like to have sex with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when you're done you're like,</v>

1062
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.333
<v Speaker 2>I gotta go.</v>

1063
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>P and you can't go because the babies </v>

1064
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:43.604
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was coming off fuck buddies that all </v>

1065
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 2>everyone has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and girls have fuck buddies.</v>

1066
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost,</v>

1067
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:53.570
<v Speaker 2>everyone I know has had one in the past </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you weren't in a relationship with</v>

1068
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:54.404
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really drive over and fuck and bang and </v>

1069
00:43:56.871 --> 00:43:57.381
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1070
00:43:57.381 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 2>bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1071
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 2>bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you kiss at the end.</v>

1072
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:01.214
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of checks these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they didn't even want to kiss </v>

1073
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:03.760
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to kiss.</v>

1074
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 2>You only want to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you'll open the door.</v>

1075
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.243
<v Speaker 2>The girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're ready to fuck and then just </v>

1076
00:44:08.151 --> 00:44:09.610
<v Speaker 2>walks off in the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're done,</v>

1077
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.610
<v Speaker 2>it puts a blindfold on bird boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're done with us,</v>

1078
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:14.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're done.</v>

1079
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like that?</v>

1080
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.353
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a precarious time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of chicks are probably going </v>

1081
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.773
<v Speaker 2>lesbos this week.</v>

1082
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be with trump.</v>

1083
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the more days that the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government shutdown,</v>

1084
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:29.803
<v Speaker 2>the more women are going to go lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gonna hate men so much because of </v>

1085
00:44:32.831 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't go gay.</v>

1086
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 2>People always say people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>

1087
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.220
<v Speaker 2>That's not how I remember what I said </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier about jokes,</v>

1088
00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 2>but what's funny to me is gay guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>always like,</v>

1089
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to turn this guy out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that always sounds alarming.</v>

1090
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 2>That does work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that sounds alarming.</v>

1091
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.330
<v Speaker 2>It does sound alarming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does work.</v>

1092
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.553
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say I almost said his </v>

1093
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:54.570
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1094
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.090
<v Speaker 2>he worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't,</v>

1095
00:44:57.091 --> 00:45:01.830
<v Speaker 2>he was not an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he worked in the world of acting and</v>

1096
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 2>he told me that he blew a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight guys.</v>

1097
00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.430
<v Speaker 2>That was just something that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd would have a couple of drinks in,</v>

1098
00:45:11.431 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 2>pretend they'd never done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you know,</v>

1099
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 2>la La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1100
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I got that delicious mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a lot of gay dude say.</v>

1101
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 2>It was either him doing them or them </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing him,</v>

1102
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be amazed at how many,</v>

1103
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>air quotes.</v>

1104
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Straight guys are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Woo.</v>

1105
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's just knows how to swing it.</v>

1106
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 2>But will you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think,</v>

1107
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:37.460
<v Speaker 2>is it less homosexual to jerk a golf </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your left hand?</v>

1108
00:45:37.951 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 2>What are you left handed or right </v>
<v Speaker 2>handed?</v>

1109
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Right handed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He jerks you off to your left hand.</v>

1110
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.223
<v Speaker 2>It's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or to do it with your right mind is </v>

1111
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.863
<v Speaker 2>geared to do with my left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that doesn't work as well </v>

1112
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:48.000
<v Speaker 2>because it'll take longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a,</v>

1113
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:50.190
<v Speaker 2>you don't really have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's understandable.</v>

1114
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's understandable if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it with your left hand because that's</v>

1115
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.980
<v Speaker 2>barely even your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1116
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.010
<v Speaker 2>it's my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1117
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to feel that much of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1118
00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.773
<v Speaker 2>She jerk him off with your right hand so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be effective and get it done </v>

1119
00:46:04.081 --> 00:46:04.914
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you like holding on Dick's </v>

1120
00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:07.610
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't come yet.</v>

1121
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.650
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Buddy,</v>

1122
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm your pal.</v>

1123
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to come then.</v>

1124
00:46:14.801 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to want to hang out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me anymore.</v>

1125
00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:17.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1126
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.250
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go fast and go back.</v>

1127
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe you.</v>

1128
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I think not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you.</v>

1129
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you said that left hand.</v>

1130
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Is that red?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the party move.</v>

1131
00:46:28.531 --> 00:46:31.800
<v Speaker 2>You know because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still use this hand and to be on</v>

1132
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:33.510
<v Speaker 2>your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do other stuff,</v>

1133
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.230
<v Speaker 2>but then you're not concentrating on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jerk and the guy off.</v>

1134
00:46:37.231 --> 00:46:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Like once you commit to doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay,</v>

1135
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 2>just get it done,</v>

<v Speaker 2>mentioned your email,</v>

1139
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:53.900

<v Speaker 2>If you are aggressively very effectively</v>

1140
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 2>jerk and the guy off and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely use your phone,</v>

1141
00:46:57.091 --> 00:46:59.210
<v Speaker 2>it looks like you're just like Ugh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's the payoff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>off?</v>

1155
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I,</v>

00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a question.</v>

1157
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 2>If there was a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this conversation seem gay?</v>

1158
00:47:35.201 --> 00:47:36.034
<v Speaker 2>Or if life was free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could really do whatever you </v>

1159
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a grown adult,</v>

1160
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:40.894
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the interesting things </v>

1161
00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:44.014
<v Speaker 2>about society is that we set up these </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and cultures and we decide what </v>

1162
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:48.784
<v Speaker 2>you can do and what we decide is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different with a deciding Hollin is </v>

1163
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:53.510
<v Speaker 2>different when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1164
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got different rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1165
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.330
<v Speaker 2>But once we set those rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to buck those rules.</v>

1166
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just pretend there was no rules.</v>

1167
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:02.163
<v Speaker 2>What if there was a place where guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go and guys would jerk them off </v>

1168
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 2>and New Jersey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Like if there was a place where guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight guys got a job Jerkin guys off,</v>

1170
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:18.490
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cha you,</v>

1171
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you get paid $1,000 an hour.</v>

1172
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.190
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1173
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:26.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't think the straight guys would </v>
<v Speaker 2>take that job straight struggling guys,</v>

1174
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:27.350
<v Speaker 2>then you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

1175
00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.640
<v Speaker 2>they would morph and figure out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1176
00:48:29.641 --> 00:48:32.730
<v Speaker 2>just over a generation or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a generation or two.</v>

1177
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:35.610
<v Speaker 2>If you could make $1,000 an hour beaten </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys off.</v>

1179
00:48:37.801 --> 00:48:39.660
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could wear an oven Mitt while you</v>

1180
00:48:39.661 --> 00:48:40.494
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it.</v>

1181
00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Just do we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we figure that out?</v>

1182
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.950
<v Speaker 2>If he could wear an oven Mitt while you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it?</v>

1183
00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1185
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.310

<v Speaker 2>That's the only way to jerk guys off.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You got to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1188

<v Speaker 2>You could definitely do.</v>

1189
00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.000
<v Speaker 2>One way you could do is even you even </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrap your head.</v>

1190
00:49:00.001 --> 00:49:00.834
<v Speaker 2>You just do like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Release a sideways Kentucky Fried </v>

<v Speaker 2>Chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only one batter.</v>

1192
00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Crispy batter is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes that crispy batter.</v>

1193
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.313
<v Speaker 2>The Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think if I had to </v>

<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] w one thing about jerking </v>
<v Speaker 2>off to me,</v>

1195
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's not as much calm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is there could be.</v>

1196
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.520
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get that much at,</v>

1197
00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what you're jerking off to</v>

1198
00:49:23.581 --> 00:49:25.740
<v Speaker 2>and you know how focused you are on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>task.</v>

1199
00:49:25.741 --> 00:49:27.420
<v Speaker 2>If you're jerking off while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at your phone.</v>

1200
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're,</v>

1201
00:49:28.311 --> 00:49:29.144
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're checking your twitter and your </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You have multitask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to get a lot no </v>

1204
00:49:32.731 --> 00:49:33.561
<v Speaker 2>matter how much you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:34.591
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1207
00:49:34.591 --> 00:49:35.790
<v Speaker 2>how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1208
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much do you get?</v>

1209
00:49:37.231 --> 00:49:39.930
<v Speaker 2>You get like a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do you get?</v>

1210
00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:41.893
<v Speaker 2>I get like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you had compare it to something </v>

1211
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:45.803
<v Speaker 2>like a quarter?</v>

1212
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably like maybe a,</v>

1213
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.520
<v Speaker 2>like an 11th of a handful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1214
00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How big is your hand,</v>

1215
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.611
<v Speaker 2>dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even,</v>

1216
00:49:56.611 --> 00:49:59.710
<v Speaker 2>do you still masturbate as an adult?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1217
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I do it as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1218
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.930
<v Speaker 2>we'll just say I put a diaper on and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes me feel like rejuvenating myself.</v>

1219
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you'd rip your Dick off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tried.</v>

1220
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I hold my kids' hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to hold things gently.</v>

1221
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:15.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>

1222
00:50:15.871 --> 00:50:16.471
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1223
00:50:16.471 --> 00:50:18.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1224
00:50:18.121 --> 00:50:18.830
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1225
00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I actually masturbated yesterday and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel bad about it sometimes,</v>

1226
00:50:21.541 --> 00:50:23.940
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does,</v>

1227
00:50:23.941 --> 00:50:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some reason I feel bad.</v>

1228
00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:27.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cultural thing.</v>

1229
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 2>They got us when we're</v>

1230
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:29.960
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like think about it this way.</v>

1231
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.680
<v Speaker 3>What if the culture was all stand up </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy culture?</v>

1232
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:34.543
<v Speaker 3>Because arguably standup comedians have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a different culture and a different way </v>

1233
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:39.890
<v Speaker 3>of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1234
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:40.783
<v Speaker 3>And definitely a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very deep camaraderie between fellow </v>

1235
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:45.080
<v Speaker 3>practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1236
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:45.914
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that was the culture was the standup </v>

1237
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:49.124
<v Speaker 3>comedy culture was the whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't give a fuck if you beat </v>

1238
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:52.274
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1239
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.350
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't even be slightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassed.</v>

1240
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell people where it's at.</v>

1241
00:50:57.051 --> 00:50:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ari would tell me all the time,</v>

1242
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 3>how many times beat up towards to oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to all.</v>

1243
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 3>We all tell each other how we beat off </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what we beat off two.</v>

1244
00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:05.973
<v Speaker 3>I'd have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it as much as I used to </v>

1245
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:07.590
<v Speaker 3>when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1246
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.340
<v Speaker 3>that's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're probably a healthier,</v>

1247
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1248
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.970
<v Speaker 3>it's like you got an older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more comfortable,</v>

1249
00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:15.020
<v Speaker 3>you're successful.</v>

1250
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just feels like,</v>

1251
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like a novice move.</v>

1252
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:18.824
<v Speaker 3>It comes still jerk and office 2019 it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly a distraction to do something </v>

1253
00:51:23.031 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1254
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.850
<v Speaker 3>especially looking at porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1255
00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:28.580
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not anti porn.</v>

1256
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anybody to get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she'd be able to do whatever you</v>

1257
00:51:30.861 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 3>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately.</v>

1258
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.133
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of why people have bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions about people doing certain </v>

1259
00:51:37.971 --> 00:51:38.804
<v Speaker 3>things is that we judge people when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do certain things and we have these </v>

1260
00:51:42.651 --> 00:51:45.830
<v Speaker 3>ideas about them that we sort of impose </v>
<v Speaker 3>on them.</v>

1261
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think for some people,</v>

1262
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.430
<v Speaker 3>torn is very useful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have discipline.</v>

1263
00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1264
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:53.954
<v Speaker 3>the thing is if you watch porn and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch two people have sex and you get </v>

1265
00:51:57.801 --> 00:51:58.634
<v Speaker 3>excited and you jerk off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just took care of like some sexual </v>

1266
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:02.780
<v Speaker 3>needs that you had.</v>

1267
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could possibly be wrong with that?</v>

1268
00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:05.923
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that can be possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with it is that there's something </v>

1269
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:11.120
<v Speaker 3>wrong with these two people having sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>and filming it.</v>

1270
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there like,</v>

1271
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.380
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't everybody want to fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1272
00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:19.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to film myself fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't everybody want to have sex?</v>

1273
00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:20.264
<v Speaker 3>People love to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the most important </v>

1274
00:52:22.581 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 3>motivations that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Yeah,</v>

1275
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.753
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people leave the house every day cause </v>

1276
00:52:26.361 --> 00:52:28.730
<v Speaker 3>they might have a chance to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

1277
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:30.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do people,</v>

1278
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.780
<v Speaker 3>why did they get involved in romantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships in the first place?</v>

1279
00:52:32.781 --> 00:52:35.030
<v Speaker 3>To not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just be nice to each other,</v>

1280
00:52:35.031 --> 00:52:36.740
<v Speaker 3>but to fuck eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

1281
00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:38.240
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.860
<v Speaker 3>So what is it about two people fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>on film that's so distasteful?</v>

1283
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1284
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:48.380
<v Speaker 3>you didn't want people to see your </v>
<v Speaker 3>special thing maybe.</v>

1285
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:49.870
<v Speaker 3>Or like what you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1286
00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:53.240
<v Speaker 3>you want to keep it private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get all those fancy though.</v>

1287
00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.130
<v Speaker 3>It's high def though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

1288
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:57.170
<v Speaker 3>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep it real life can't compete with</v>

1289
00:52:57.171 --> 00:52:58.460
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then it's so sad.</v>

1290
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.150
<v Speaker 3>It's not always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say stuff is just right there.</v>

1291
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:04.820
<v Speaker 3>But it's not real life though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not as good.</v>

1292
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:08.630
<v Speaker 3>It's not as good as real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that it's visually,</v>

1293
00:53:08.631 --> 00:53:09.464
<v Speaker 3>it starts to get that it's better and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts to get where like sometimes like </v>

1294
00:53:12.761 --> 00:53:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I like I'm 40 days off pornography right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1295
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.981
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1296
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:16.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1297
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:18.580
<v Speaker 3>so you're like on a pornography detox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1298
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever want to see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1299
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody tries to get their pussy </v>

1300
00:53:22.401 --> 00:53:22.821
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1301
00:53:22.821 --> 00:53:23.970
<v Speaker 3>you stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let me,</v>

1302
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.110
<v Speaker 3>let me say this to you though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also had the same kind of issue with</v>

1303
00:53:28.111 --> 00:53:29.640
<v Speaker 3>drugs and alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1304
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 3>So you have like an addictive </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

1305
00:53:31.891 --> 00:53:32.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point.</v>

1306
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:33.354
<v Speaker 3>So having to take their personality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was saying earlier that I think </v>

1307
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:35.994
<v Speaker 3>that the thing of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing itself is not necessarily bad </v>

1308
00:53:39.721 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 3>and for some people can actually provide</v>
<v Speaker 3>a service,</v>

1309
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it helps them to jerk off.</v>

1310
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why that would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

1311
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.640
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a,</v>

1312
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how factual this is cause I</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't done any surveys,</v>

1313
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.433
<v Speaker 3>but what I've read is that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that get involved in that are </v>

1314
00:53:58.471 --> 00:54:00.200
<v Speaker 3>victims of abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1315
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.130
<v Speaker 3>That's disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1316
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.520
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then some of them aren't.</v>

1317
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Some of them do it because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

1318
00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not,</v>

1319
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:11.760
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems more okay.</v>

1320
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:12.623
<v Speaker 3>And someone who's doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a victim of abuse and they're </v>

1321
00:54:14.641 --> 00:54:17.190
<v Speaker 3>desperately seeking love and attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't know how,</v>

1322
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:18.150
<v Speaker 3>how to do it.</v>

1323
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.700
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you look at it like in terms of,</v>

1324
00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 3>but you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's looking at that is like,</v>

1325
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:26.400
<v Speaker 3>well then don't laugh at comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1326
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Because you laugh at comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost everybody that's Comedians fucked</v>

1327
00:54:29.161 --> 00:54:31.230
<v Speaker 3>up or been fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

1328
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 3>that's really why they get into it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first place because they desperately</v>

1329
00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:36.210
<v Speaker 3>need attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to be special,</v>

1330
00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 3>they want to be something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

1331
00:54:37.471 --> 00:54:38.670
<v Speaker 3>look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at me.</v>

1332
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.880
<v Speaker 3>So they figured out how to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But usually those are victims of abuse,</v>

1333
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:43.440
<v Speaker 3>like in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or from,</v>

1334
00:54:43.441 --> 00:54:45.570
<v Speaker 3>not all of them because they need the </v>
<v Speaker 3>affection.</v>

1335
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:47.490
<v Speaker 3>They need that they need something from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1336
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe six out of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1337
00:54:49.171 --> 00:54:49.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

1338
00:54:49.951 --> 00:54:51.810
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm being real jars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's so many things that you could</v>

1340
00:54:54.811 --> 00:54:55.644
<v Speaker 3>look at that like that w you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something good comes out of stand </v>

1341
00:54:58.961 --> 00:54:59.310
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1342
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we just accept that.</v>

1343
00:55:00.481 --> 00:55:02.930
<v Speaker 3>That's okay to laugh at these fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1344
00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:05.243
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kind of like joey is that guys </v>

1345
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.320
<v Speaker 3>lived everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's seen everything,</v>

1346
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.250
<v Speaker 3>but it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to laugh at the chaos that his</v>

1347
00:55:14.251 --> 00:55:16.680
<v Speaker 3>life was because the jokes are so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1348
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:17.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1349
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.151
<v Speaker 3>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1350
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 3>But it's not okay to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1351
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:22.363
<v Speaker 3>like even if the girls enjoying porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you find out that at some point in </v>

1352
00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:26.124
<v Speaker 3>time she was molested and that possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the motivating factors </v>

1353
00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:32.580
<v Speaker 3>that led her into porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you get super weird about it,</v>

1354
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:35.640
<v Speaker 3>then you get to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should put that on the thing,</v>

1355
00:55:35.641 --> 00:55:38.220
<v Speaker 3>like percentage chance of somebody that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was molested in the video.</v>

1356
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:40.920
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that would deter people</v>
<v Speaker 3>from watching us.</v>

1357
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:41.853
<v Speaker 3>Do you think so?</v>

1358
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:42.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1359
00:55:42.511 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 3>My thing is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started to think of sex then in frames</v>

1360
00:55:46.021 --> 00:55:46.854
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1361
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.320
<v Speaker 3>I got to meet the girl and then we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to walk over by us.</v>

1362
00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:50.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to,</v>

1363
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.680
<v Speaker 3>I have to see this and have to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that happens.</v>

1364
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:55.230
<v Speaker 3>And then and now and that sec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I started to,</v>

1365
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:56.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like interpret it that way and I don't </v>

1366
00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:00.270
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex is just fun.</v>

1367
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:01.081
<v Speaker 3>When you were young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men were,</v>

1368
00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:04.240
<v Speaker 3>when you were fucking imagine being 16 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucking somebody else.</v>

1369
00:56:04.241 --> 00:56:05.880
<v Speaker 3>That was 16 bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1370
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:06.714

1481
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:21.340

<v Speaker 2>A weird look.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Would you think you'd rather have like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little skirt or like be naked,</v>

1517
01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 2>looking at my deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's making me self conscious.</v>

1518
01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:56.903
<v Speaker 2>But what if you had like a little dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>hide or like a little thing that you </v>

1521
01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:10.140
<v Speaker 2>people thought your Dick was bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I did,</v>

1522
01:03:10.141 --> 01:03:12.810
<v Speaker 2>it would be not worrying wrapped around </v>
<v Speaker 2>my waist.</v>

1523
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Talk to the front.</v>

1524
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.920
<v Speaker 2>and it would be green,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

1525
01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 2>a dark green,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people would know.</v>

1567
01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:08.904
<v Speaker 2>Most people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a disproportionate amount of </v>

1568
01:05:10.831 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 2>people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I hate about it.</v>

1569
01:05:12.481 --> 01:05:13.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1570
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideology today,</v>

1571
01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they say,</v>

1572
01:05:17.411 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>everybody where I'm</v>

1573
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.800
<v Speaker 3>from is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like,</v>

1574
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:21.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1575
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 3>some Christian Bible thumping and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not true.</v>

1576
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:28.870
<v Speaker 3>So many of the people I know are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>that at all that it's unbelievable,</v>

1577
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.320
<v Speaker 3>but so many of the people in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and these other places,</v>

1578
01:05:32.321 --> 01:05:36.610
<v Speaker 3>they don't even know anybody from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like they have no idea.</v>

1579
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.950
<v Speaker 3>But they immediately stereotyped because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your accent too.</v>

1580
01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a southern accent.</v>

1581
01:05:41.381 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 3>People assume you're not bright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1582
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>

1583
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.370
<v Speaker 3>it's indicative of what the place used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be like,</v>

1584
01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:49.253
<v Speaker 3>like what the world used to be like was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of the rural edge areas were </v>

1585
01:05:52.271 --> 01:05:53.560
<v Speaker 3>less educated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1586
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Now that there's the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is a different place,</v>

1587
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.930
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can meet cool people in Wichita,</v>

1590
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:04.654
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Good people are everywhere and they have</v>

1593
01:06:09.611 --> 01:06:13.000
<v Speaker 3>different values and a lot of them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more community oriented,</v>

1594
01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:14.220
<v Speaker 3>more friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

1596
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.340
<v Speaker 3>everybody gets this idea that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like the people that live all stacked</v>

1597
01:06:21.341 --> 01:06:24.850
<v Speaker 3>on top of each other fucking like bees </v>
<v Speaker 3>swarm and in the high,</v>

1598
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:29.800
<v Speaker 3>most people don't live like that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people live somewhere where there's</v>

1599
01:06:29.801 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 3>less folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to relax.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They can throw a Frisbee and not fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit anybody.</v>

1601
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.500
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>

1602
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 3>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of the country,</v>

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:20.230
<v Speaker 3>but you can't even raise your voice in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1618
01:07:20.231 --> 01:07:22.660
<v Speaker 3>Like I have to drive to riverside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even fucking raise my voice.</v>

1619
01:07:22.661 --> 01:07:25.420
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's how too tight it is in La.</v>

1620
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:26.343
<v Speaker 3>308 million people in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2010 but that's 2010 2000 it was 281 </v>

1621
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1622
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Look at that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about,</v>

1623
01:07:38.111 --> 01:07:41.080
<v Speaker 3>just think of that 20 fucking million </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1624
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:44.860
<v Speaker 3>28 29 27 million people and who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking the most?</v>

1625
01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Are they saying is it whites?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1626
01:07:46.481 --> 01:07:47.314
<v Speaker 3>it's all whites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it really you thing fucking every </v>

1627
01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:49.750
<v Speaker 3>race now,</v>

1628
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.840
<v Speaker 3>it's new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1629
01:07:50.841 --> 01:07:53.290
<v Speaker 3>we've decided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We decided to take back our country.</v>

1630
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:55.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1631
01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.393
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on our way to white people are on </v>

1632
01:07:57.581 --> 01:07:59.640
<v Speaker 3>their way to being a serious minority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1633
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:01.720
<v Speaker 3>That's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beige power,</v>

1634
01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:02.590
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I say.</v>

1635
01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:04.270
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>

1636
01:08:04.271 --> 01:08:06.940
<v Speaker 3>I love all the variety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what it's like.</v>

1637
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like we have nice things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't,</v>

1638
01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 3>we can't have nice things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We keep breaking things so we can't,</v>

1639
01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.373
<v Speaker 3>because of racist people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have all this wonderful </v>

1640
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:17.624
<v Speaker 3>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're eventually all going to be </v>

1641
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:20.354
<v Speaker 3>gray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be like those fucking </v>

1642
01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:22.004
<v Speaker 3>aliens with the giant heads and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have no dicks and we're all </v>

1643
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:25.904
<v Speaker 3>going to be the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So no one can criticize anyone on </v>

1644
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.293
<v Speaker 3>anything other than your thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna be able to bring your </v>

1645
01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:34.220
<v Speaker 3>actions and they be able to read each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other's minds.</v>

1646
01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:35.151
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I think.</v>

1647
01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:36.620
<v Speaker 3>And I think we're going to ruin the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1648
01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:39.710
<v Speaker 3>So they have builtin eyeglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're born,</v>

1649
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:41.870
<v Speaker 3>they just fucking glue these bitches </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto your head.</v>

1650
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:44.600
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like chicks with fake eyelashes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

1651
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.360
<v Speaker 3>you just have these lenses that you put </v>
<v Speaker 3>on when you're indoors,</v>

1652
01:08:47.361 --> 01:08:50.030
<v Speaker 3>you peel the lenses off and otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just see nature.</v>

1653
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.863
<v Speaker 3>You can walk outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't really go far and it's </v>

1654
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:52.814
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see he could press a fern button in </v>

1655
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 3>ferns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll papa.</v>

1656
01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Why farm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1657
01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 3>just you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foliage or something,</v>

1658
01:08:58.161 --> 01:08:59.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fallen a foley,</v>

1659
01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:01.460
<v Speaker 3>maybe a deer runs by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be hit that side button.</v>

1660
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:02.383
<v Speaker 3>I think nature in the future we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably be contained in these gigantic </v>

1661
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.460
<v Speaker 3>dome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like places like one of them,</v>

1662
01:09:10.461 --> 01:09:11.294
<v Speaker 3>Stephen King books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where you'll go to get into </v>

1663
01:09:13.311 --> 01:09:14.001
<v Speaker 3>the nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1664
01:09:14.001 --> 01:09:17.450
<v Speaker 3>like a biodome with pauly shore and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Baldwin.</v>

1665
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.220
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1666
01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.054
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be nature places and </v>

1667
01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:22.784
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the world would be city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the whole plant we'll be </v>

1668
01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:28.250
<v Speaker 3>sitting in our wildlife would be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit wildlife.</v>

1669
01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:30.530
<v Speaker 3>It'll be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1670
01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.590
<v Speaker 3>a few thousand acres or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1671
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:35.390
<v Speaker 3>About a bunch of animals living </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1672
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:37.510
<v Speaker 3>That's all that's left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like a cat,</v>

1673
01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 3>like a rabbit with like a little story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a story on its back or something.</v>

1674
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.313
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not one of those doom and gloom </v>

1675
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 3>people when it comes to overpopulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

1676
01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Because I like people when people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1677
01:09:50.031 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 3>there's too many fucking people you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like.</v>

1678
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.930
<v Speaker 3>I've good friends that think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1679
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:55.610
<v Speaker 3>you want to help the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't have any kids.</v>

1680
01:09:55.611 --> 01:09:57.110
<v Speaker 3>My okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1681
01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.830
<v Speaker 3>I get why you'd say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't you like people?</v>

1682
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:03.680
<v Speaker 3>I love people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are awesome.</v>

1683
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:05.300
<v Speaker 3>It's all I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1684
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.770
<v Speaker 3>some of them aren't awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the vast majority are pretty cool.</v>

1685
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.633
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Work at least capable of being pretty </v>

1686
01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:15.090
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're cool to them and you establish</v>

1687
01:10:15.091 --> 01:10:16.820
<v Speaker 3>sort of a community being cool with each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1688
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.540
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of people are great.</v>

1689
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:20.330
<v Speaker 3>People are Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are friendly.</v>

1690
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority.</v>

1691
01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.760
<v Speaker 3>So what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is was too many of us,</v>

1692
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.710
<v Speaker 3>and we're not going to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1693
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:31.670
<v Speaker 3>They're going to plug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh I want to fuck somebody right now.</v>

1694
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:33.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make people the,</v>

1695
01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 3>the question is they will they say stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

1696
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:38.663
<v Speaker 3>The study size scientists say that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>people come more affluent and as they </v>

1697
01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:44.624
<v Speaker 3>become more educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're less likely to have children or </v>

1698
01:10:46.731 --> 01:10:47.564
<v Speaker 3>they have less children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they think that the best way to stop </v>

1699
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:53.180
<v Speaker 3>overpopulation is actually equity in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1700
01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:54.023
<v Speaker 3>Like equality rather in the world make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make the whole world basically like </v>

1701
01:10:57.981 --> 01:11:02.150
<v Speaker 3>America where everybody's just got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance to get ahead and everybody has an</v>

1702
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.013
<v Speaker 3>awesome education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody has access to the best </v>

1703
01:11:05.181 --> 01:11:06.680
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't happen.</v>

1704
01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:07.693
<v Speaker 3>But if that does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's going to curb </v>

1705
01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:10.010
<v Speaker 3>overpopulation.</v>

1706
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that are the least educated,</v>

1707
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1708
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:18.690
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to like look in,</v>

1709
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:22.260
<v Speaker 3>in countries where people are poorer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for instance,</v>

1710
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.200
<v Speaker 3>they want to have more kids because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want the kids to take care of him too.</v>

1711
01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big thing,</v>

1712
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing.</v>

1713
01:11:27.391 --> 01:11:29.670
<v Speaker 3>And traditional communities and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1714
01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:31.800
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're tighter and you,</v>

1715
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:33.120
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the weird thing,</v>

1716
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:34.223
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you that arguably those </v>

1717
01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:38.410
<v Speaker 3>are happier people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.690
<v Speaker 3>He's happy people and they live in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>villages and stuff and they all in enjoy</v>

1719
01:11:42.691 --> 01:11:43.524
<v Speaker 3>each other's company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though in our mind it's a hard </v>

1720
01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:46.580
<v Speaker 3>scrabble life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1721
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:48.360
<v Speaker 3>they're living in a third world country </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a village.</v>

1722
01:11:48.361 --> 01:11:49.194
<v Speaker 3>But if they have access to food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if they live in the Amazon or </v>

1723
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:52.014
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have much food you can get in </v>

1724
01:11:52.681 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1725
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.030
<v Speaker 3>You've got a lot of food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1726
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:57.240
<v Speaker 3>Like I know how you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1727
01:11:57.241 --> 01:12:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to live that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people live in the wrong way.</v>

1728
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:01.201
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1729
01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:03.680
<v Speaker 3>they have fucking 10 kids laying on them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit and they're all,</v>

1730
01:12:03.681 --> 01:12:04.514
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all community in this hut </v>

1731
01:12:05.401 --> 01:12:07.440
<v Speaker 3>together and you're like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks terrible.</v>

1732
01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:08.453
<v Speaker 3>Hotbox and that base to a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the whole family isn't there </v>

1733
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile those people could be like</v>

1734
01:12:14.821 --> 01:12:15.654
<v Speaker 3>really happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can arguably be happier than a </v>

1735
01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:19.503
<v Speaker 3>comparable group of people in Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization that you would just grab </v>

1736
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.710
<v Speaker 3>100% and why is it black homes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of black families are still in the</v>

1737
01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 3>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You notice that a lot of the tribes,</v>

1738
01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:30.180
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of [inaudible] I guess </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not black,</v>

1739
01:12:30.181 --> 01:12:32.820
<v Speaker 3>but it's like how Latino or dark or mid </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a not,</v>

1740
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's like a more universal shade</v>

1741
01:12:36.601 --> 01:12:37.420
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>

1742
01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like a sofa color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1743
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 3>if you're in the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1744
01:12:41.971 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 3>you're obviously in a hot climate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in a hot climate,</v>

1745
01:12:44.551 --> 01:12:46.480
<v Speaker 3>you better develop some fucking melanie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1746
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:47.700
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is melon.</v>

1747
01:12:47.701 --> 01:12:49.260
<v Speaker 3>And they got more Melanin and family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1748
01:12:49.261 --> 01:12:52.180
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Italian mostly if you look at it,</v>

1749
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.033
<v Speaker 3>and I have some Irish in me too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at Italians who were in </v>

1750
01:12:55.441 --> 01:12:58.350
<v Speaker 3>the sun all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they get dark as fuck?</v>

1751
01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.593
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you were severed a seven plus </v>

1752
01:13:04.021 --> 01:13:07.200
<v Speaker 3>generations of people living in this one</v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

1753
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.200
<v Speaker 3>we are exposed to like tropical sunlight</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1754
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:11.063
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had brown the fuck up or you </v>

1755
01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:13.890
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1756
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:14.724
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to Costa Rica or even for a couple </v>

1757
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.190
<v Speaker 3>days and I'm fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1758
01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Brown down and my face is all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1759
01:13:19.831 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 3>kind of has pus in it from the sun.</v>

1760
01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:23.240
<v Speaker 3>But I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1761
01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:24.173
<v Speaker 3>evolving in a place like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like being there hundreds and hundreds </v>

1762
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.460
<v Speaker 3>and hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe thousands of years.</v>

1763
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:32.080
<v Speaker 3>Like you adapt to that environment or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1764
01:13:32.081 --> 01:13:32.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1765
01:13:32.631 --> 01:13:33.464
<v Speaker 3>the preferential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the preferable genes are the ones that </v>

1766
01:13:36.001 --> 01:13:38.070
<v Speaker 3>make it through and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have joy.</v>

1767
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:38.904
<v Speaker 3>There's families have a lot of joy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they had to have their family </v>

1768
01:13:40.261 --> 01:13:41.430
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1769
01:13:41.431 --> 01:13:43.980
<v Speaker 3>like if somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if somebody dies,</v>

1770
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.053
<v Speaker 3>they have them write day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything's just a lot more </v>

1771
01:13:46.651 --> 01:13:48.750
<v Speaker 3>communal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's just a lot more love.</v>

1772
01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:53.520
<v Speaker 3>The only problem is they don't have like</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways to save each other the way we do.</v>

1773
01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't have cars,</v>

1774
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.490
<v Speaker 3>they don't have modern weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they have to hunt with these bows and</v>

1775
01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:01.140
<v Speaker 3>arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make themselves,</v>

1776
01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:03.420
<v Speaker 3>but they do have pots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have some things,</v>

1777
01:14:03.421 --> 01:14:04.254
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also depending on what tribe </v>

1778
01:14:05.761 --> 01:14:06.594
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also your life expectancy is </v>

1779
01:14:08.101 --> 01:14:08.934
<v Speaker 3>probably not as long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you do die and you believe in a </v>

1780
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:12.420
<v Speaker 3>higher power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then get to go see them quicker.</v>

1781
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>You probably have reincarnation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1782
01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend that died could now be a </v>

1783
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.990
<v Speaker 2>plant or a coyote that you made or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1784
01:14:19.991 --> 01:14:22.060
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm sure in a lot of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures it's a lot of,</v>

1785
01:14:22.061 --> 01:14:23.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1786
01:14:23.331 --> 01:14:25.420
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are more just all intertwined,</v>

1787
01:14:25.421 --> 01:14:26.254
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human in nature without was big with </v>

1788
01:14:27.521 --> 01:14:28.840
<v Speaker 2>native American cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1789
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Like they thought that a coyotes were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1790
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:34.300
<v Speaker 2>in many different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1791
01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.200
<v Speaker 2>different tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they looked at coyotes,</v>

1792
01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.170
<v Speaker 2>almost like they had some magic to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

1793
01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or wise.</v>

1794
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.630
<v Speaker 2>They're up all night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1795
01:14:40.631 --> 01:14:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I could see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1796
01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:46.740
<v Speaker 2>You were in that tent sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping off that Hashi shy.</v>

1797
01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:52.790
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

1798
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:53.623
<v Speaker 2>a coyote got trapped in a bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was in South Carolina </v>

1799
01:15:00.281 --> 01:15:04.210
<v Speaker 2>or North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were wild man in this bathroom and</v>

1800
01:15:04.211 --> 01:15:07.300
<v Speaker 2>these guys have to get it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom and sitting on the sink.</v>

1801
01:15:07.301 --> 01:15:08.134
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had to use one of them long </v>

1802
01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:11.580
<v Speaker 2>poles that the Jack Dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1803
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.570
<v Speaker 2>like grammar on the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see it.</v>

1804
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was one of those places in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nashville.</v>

1805
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that.</v>

1806
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cool little video,</v>

1807
01:15:23.711 --> 01:15:26.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those little fuckers are everywhere</v>

1808
01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:28.510
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are everywhere.</v>

1809
01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raccoons are really dangerous.</v>

1810
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:33.070
<v Speaker 2>They're always doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1811
01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:33.904
<v Speaker 2>Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the salad,</v>

1812
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.170
<v Speaker 2>the Nashville Music Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1813
01:15:38.171 --> 01:15:39.004
<v Speaker 2>this beautiful southern in this hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A boat show or the coyote in the </v>

1814
01:15:42.281 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 2>bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at him,</v>

1815
01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:45.630
<v Speaker 2>make sure he's chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1816
01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.473
<v Speaker 2>they're very photogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyote wild life will continue pushing </v>

1817
01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:50.053
<v Speaker 2>to how weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they did was they captured it </v>

1818
01:15:52.511 --> 01:15:54.850
<v Speaker 2>and they said that if they brought it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal shelter,</v>

1819
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:56.020
<v Speaker 2>they would have euthanized it.</v>

1820
01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:56.893
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead they captured it and let it </v>

1821
01:15:58.601 --> 01:15:59.434
<v Speaker 2>loose in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which school do you have any animals </v>

01:16:01.811 --> 01:16:03.040

<v Speaker 2>certificate.</v>

1845
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:51.243
<v Speaker 2>We buried it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is even worse probably because </v>

1846
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.260
<v Speaker 2>then people are going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is someone?</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a giant mystery.</v>

1850
01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.550
<v Speaker 2>That sounds fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always love mystery,</v>

1851
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:06.580
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is somebody might've died like</v>

1852
01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:07.414
<v Speaker 2>they might've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody might've killed somebody and </v>

1853
01:17:08.651 --> 01:17:09.740
<v Speaker 2>sold bones.</v>

1854
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.300
<v Speaker 1>It's probably one of those real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I?</v>

1855
01:17:14.301 --> 01:17:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it say?</v>

1856
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me look at this.</v>

1857
01:17:17.151 --> 01:17:22.151
<v Speaker 1>Say Male from India in good condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 teeth present.</v>

1858
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:23.413
<v Speaker 1>The rest broken missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is lipping on the lumbar </v>

1859
01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 1>vertebrae.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1860
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.140
<v Speaker 1>That's $5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could buy a fucking human skeleton.</v>

1861
01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1862
01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:40.451
<v Speaker 1>There's several of them for sale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the lumbar vertebrae lipping.</v>

1863
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:41.323
<v Speaker 1>You know what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that means that her biz back's </v>

<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

1865
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:49.250
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is the discs </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

1866
01:17:49.251 --> 01:17:50.084
<v Speaker 1>the lumbar vertebrae,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual vertebrate dog bone piece </v>

1867
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:54.643
<v Speaker 1>from waring against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to spur and develop like a </v>

1868
01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:00.830
<v Speaker 1>curve to the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're calling that lipping.</v>

1869
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.400
<v Speaker 1>See if that's what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lipping lipping on the Lumbar Vertebra.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's see that.</v>

1873
01:18:12.441 --> 01:18:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1876
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:21.410
<v Speaker 1>See how it curves over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1877
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Osteo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Osteo fight.</v>

1878
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Osteophyte grading or lipping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:27.523
<v Speaker 1>See as your disc get smashed your bones </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to protect themselves and they </v>

1880
01:18:30.801 --> 01:18:33.570
<v Speaker 1>grow this extra bone tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that,</v>

1881
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'm not a doctor and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a doctor,</v>

1882
01:18:36.231 --> 01:18:38.090
<v Speaker 1>stop yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm talking about.</v>

1883
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:40.340
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that shit causes sly Attica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1885
01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:44.144
<v Speaker 1>Either inflamed disks poke out and poke </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the nerves or the bone pokes it or </v>

1886
01:18:47.391 --> 01:18:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it causes inflammation in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo has that.</v>

1887
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:51.643
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1888
01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.660
<v Speaker 1>He Bravo had had his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1889
01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:55.720
<v Speaker 1>he got his whole disc replaced with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>five s one disc.</v>

1890
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1892
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:01.363
<v Speaker 1>was backs all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like you gotta think like your discs </v>

1893
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.550
<v Speaker 1>are these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1894
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:05.383
<v Speaker 1>These little gel things and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a bunch of them and they bust </v>

1895
01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.910
<v Speaker 1>when they smash and get smashed down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1896
01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was basically bone on bone.</v>

1897
01:19:13.251 --> 01:19:14.084
<v Speaker 1>He had almost no disc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was in a constant state of </v>

1898
01:19:16.941 --> 01:19:18.860
<v Speaker 1>inflammation that still horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a text.</v>

1899
01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Like he couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't sit down.</v>

1900
01:19:20.751 --> 01:19:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he'd have to stand up and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to hold his lower back and he</v>

1901
01:19:23.631 --> 01:19:27.680
<v Speaker 1>does dealt with the pain forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like almost nothing there.</v>

1902
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:30.680
<v Speaker 1>So they replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's bones were on top of each other.</v>

1903
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:31.723
<v Speaker 1>They a place that and put his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shove it in their fucking two </v>

1904
01:19:34.461 --> 01:19:35.870
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ettie suddenly he's like,</v>

1905
01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm buying new shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1906
01:19:38.031 --> 01:19:40.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he actually is no longer in pain.</v>

1907
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:41.263
<v Speaker 1>That's what's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is an articulating titanium </v>

1908
01:19:43.581 --> 01:19:44.414
<v Speaker 1>disk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they used to have to fuse your </v>

1909
01:19:46.071 --> 01:19:47.000
<v Speaker 1>vertebrae together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1910
01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:49.700
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to do that in every case</v>

1911
01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:50.534
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they still do it for some </v>

1912
01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:52.754
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1914
01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:55.814
<v Speaker 1>But for many people now this </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulating titanium disk is now an </v>

1915
01:20:00.441 --> 01:20:01.300
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>not that I have a friend that's a </v>

1965
01:21:55.531 --> 01:21:57.350
<v Speaker 2>flasher though.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1973
01:22:14.701 --> 01:22:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess perverted tendencies like</v>

1974
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.270
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's like what is perverted?</v>

1975
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1976
01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:22.944
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to the porn talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you said that you had a problem </v>

1977
01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:26.790
<v Speaker 2>with porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were watching too much porn.</v>

1978
01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:28.860
<v Speaker 2>It became a habit for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I didn't like.</v>

1979
01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:29.694
<v Speaker 2>It became a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of me wanting to watch </v>

1980
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:32.940
<v Speaker 2>pornography became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1981
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to watching pornography at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

1982
01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:37.710
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jerk off and get a little bit of rest.</v>

1983
01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:40.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like the habit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it created a bad habit.</v>

1984
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:40.921
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1985
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:43.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get real,</v>

1986
01:22:43.471 --> 01:22:45.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intense thinking about things.</v>

1987
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:46.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even when we're talking about like </v>

1988
01:22:47.821 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Speaker 2>business stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can tell like you get,</v>

1989
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.500
<v Speaker 2>you focus on things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is good.</v>

1990
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:54.320
<v Speaker 2>If it's good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1991
01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.330
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes that kind of thinking can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get away from you.</v>

1992
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it does sometimes for now,</v>

1993
01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.053
<v Speaker 2>the same kind of focus that can get you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really excited about something that's </v>

1994
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 2>productive in your life can also get you</v>

1995
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.380
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive.</v>

1996
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:09.743
<v Speaker 3>It's the sec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of person that you are and a </v>

1997
01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:14.470
<v Speaker 3>lot of performers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an impulsive,</v>

1998
01:23:14.471 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 3>creative person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsive,</v>

1999
01:23:16.271 --> 01:23:18.520
<v Speaker 3>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People sometimes get caught in ruts,</v>

2000
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:21.070
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of different reasons</v>

2001
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for addictions.</v>

2002
01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I think there psychological addictions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's physical addictions.</v>

2003
01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like physical addictions.</v>

2004
01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Some of them will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you get off of alcohol too quick,</v>

2005
01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>you'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2006
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a physical addiction that is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to your point,</v>

2007
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:38.380
<v Speaker 3>you can't pretend it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit will kill you.</v>

2008
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's obviously real,</v>

2009
01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:42.370
<v Speaker 3>but then there's other ones like washing</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands too many times,</v>

2010
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:44.230
<v Speaker 3>like some people are addicted to washing</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hands.</v>

2011
01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I sit like this so I'll talk to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd be like that.</v>

2074
01:26:00.761 --> 01:26:04.490
<v Speaker 3>Like my head is forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like just very bad for your back.</v>

2075
01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:05.523
<v Speaker 2>Like you're making your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your disks carry your weight in an </v>

2076
01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:10.310
<v Speaker 2>uneven way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you want to do is have everything,</v>

2077
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:13.310
<v Speaker 2>everything up and strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously this is exaggerated,</v>

2078
01:26:13.311 --> 01:26:16.530
<v Speaker 2>but most people like you get lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

2079
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what good posture is,</v>

2080
01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:23.000
<v Speaker 2>is like a constant state of exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what good posture is.</v>

2081
01:26:23.001 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause you want to just slump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I slump all the time man.</v>

2082
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.440
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doing posture all the time,</v>

2083
01:26:27.441 --> 01:26:30.440
<v Speaker 2>it feels like you're always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about to graduate.</v>

2084
01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you always have to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>

2085
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:35.840
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's why it's what it's like,</v>

2086
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to be exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really should.</v>

2087
01:26:38.571 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 2>And I've been trying over the last few </v>
<v Speaker 2>years really hard to do that.</v>

2088
01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Just to see straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get an alarm for my spine.</v>

2089
01:26:45.981 --> 01:26:47.510
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Shit I love.</v>

2090
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.690
<v Speaker 2>That's called the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the teeter decks inversion.</v>

2091
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:51.853
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite things ever for a </v>

2092
01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.830
<v Speaker 2>loosening up your lower back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really decompressing and yeah,</v>

2093
01:26:57.831 --> 01:26:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I've got one right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2094
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.620
<v Speaker 2>And it's not prohibitively expensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2095
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll hop on that before I leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2096
01:27:02.571 --> 01:27:05.900
<v Speaker 2>that thing right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing when you go down,</v>

2097
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:06.763
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it a press play so you can see how </v>

2098
01:27:09.051 --> 01:27:09.884
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hang down like that and when you </v>

2099
01:27:11.781 --> 01:27:12.614
<v Speaker 2>hang down like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just lengthens everything and </v>

2100
01:27:14.721 --> 01:27:15.554
<v Speaker 2>straightens it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the one where you hang by </v>

2101
01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:17.960
<v Speaker 2>your ankles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that too.</v>

2102
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Although it's cad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks good.</v>

2103
01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot even imagine they have that.</v>

2104
01:27:23.141 --> 01:27:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got one right here,</v>

2105
01:27:24.441 --> 01:27:27.410
<v Speaker 2>but really it felt like something you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do to kill a deer or something.</v>

2106
01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2107
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:29.570
<v Speaker 2>that's a different kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2108
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.430
<v Speaker 2>That's wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need some stuff.</v>

2109
01:27:31.431 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I need to get more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2110
01:27:34.191 --> 01:27:35.024
<v Speaker 2>bars and stuff like that to hang off of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to alleviate some pressure for </v>

2111
01:27:37.311 --> 01:27:38.990
<v Speaker 2>your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Chin up bars,</v>

2112
01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.150
<v Speaker 2>grab a hold of a chin up bar and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>hang.</v>

2113
01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:42.243
<v Speaker 2>Hanging is really good for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders because everything gets </v>

2114
01:27:44.151 --> 01:27:44.984
<v Speaker 2>compacted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything gets like bunched in and </v>

2115
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:51.170
<v Speaker 2>nothing's stretches out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll look a conestoga wagon brother,</v>

2116
01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can still go out again.</v>

2117
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Conestoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it Conestoga wagon?</v>

2118
01:27:54.621 --> 01:27:57.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like a wheel base is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>questionable.</v>

2119
01:27:57.711 --> 01:27:59.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like six by six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2120
01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not that far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't move that good.</v>

2121
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I used to be able to,</v>

2122
01:28:05.571 --> 01:28:07.670
<v Speaker 2>but I got to go on to the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

2123

<v Speaker 2>You're still young enough to move like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that right now.</v>

2124
01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

2134
01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cars registered?</v>

2142
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:01.010
<v Speaker 2>but they do it in the summer,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what they should do?</v>

2149
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:16.000
<v Speaker 2>They should reenact the civil war and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed themselves.</v>

2150
01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Not In real life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>just all pretend to kill themselves.</v>

2153
01:29:24.010 --> 01:29:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2154
01:29:25.091 --> 01:29:26.050

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2155
01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.190
<v Speaker 2>They would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2156
01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.930
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do it the right way,</v>

2157
01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:29.793
<v Speaker 2>or we're going to toss down our guns and</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck all the Dicks of the guys in the </v>

01:29:32.051 --> 01:29:36.550
<v Speaker 2>north that they would one that did have </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2159
01:29:36.551 --> 01:29:40.180
<v Speaker 2>If they have said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want,</v>

2160
01:29:40.181 --> 01:29:41.650
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like a,</v>

2161
01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.680
<v Speaker 2>if they catch us [inaudible] be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what you want you to feel good.</v>

2162
01:29:46.841 --> 01:29:47.674
<v Speaker 2>And then one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize because they need the </v>

2163
01:29:48.521 --> 01:29:49.354
<v Speaker 2>nutrients.</v>

2164
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:51.520
<v Speaker 2>They're out there starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was thinking about this.</v>

2165
01:29:51.521 --> 01:29:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that so slave rewrite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2166
01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.830
<v Speaker 2>They had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that would,</v>

2167
01:29:57.831 --> 01:30:00.500
<v Speaker 2>if I had this thought of one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if computers,</v>

2168
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:02.510
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2169
01:30:02.511 --> 01:30:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Takes over and then they're all going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that we had,</v>

2170
01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:11.280
<v Speaker 2>we own these phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2171
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Just like people like they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this was a slave,</v>

2172
01:30:14.901 --> 01:30:17.450
<v Speaker 2>like remember when you owned my little </v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

2173
01:30:18.190 --> 01:30:21.350
<v Speaker 2>You're emotional about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see where you're going with that.</v>

2174
01:30:21.351 --> 01:30:22.184
<v Speaker 2>But I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that'll be an actual </v>

2175
01:30:24.231 --> 01:30:26.220
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2176
01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I got the rose gold one now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do none of that.</v>

2177
01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.230
<v Speaker 2>But you've got a black case on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

2178
01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

2179
01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:31.813
<v Speaker 2>If you go in rose gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to go case list like a </v>

2180
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:35.760
<v Speaker 2>brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a sap.</v>

2189
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems fun.</v>

2191
01:31:02.651 --> 01:31:03.560
<v Speaker 2>And having kids style,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2194
01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:09.033
<v Speaker 2>Nervous to be vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nervous to love something that much </v>

2195
01:31:11.650 --> 01:31:13.510
<v Speaker 2>nervous to have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

2196
01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Nervous about all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2197
01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Changes you change as you like nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2198
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:23.590
<v Speaker 2>But did you feel like the changes would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be for like a,</v>

2199
01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.620
<v Speaker 2>that you won't like the changes and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did like,</v>

2200
01:31:26.621 --> 01:31:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you have reservations?</v>

2201
01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:28.773
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a relationship with my </v>

2202
01:31:31.661 --> 01:31:34.990
<v Speaker 2>father growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for me it's very,</v>

2203
01:31:34.991 --> 01:31:37.750
<v Speaker 2>it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important that I did whatever I had</v>

2204
01:31:37.751 --> 01:31:42.751
<v Speaker 2>to do to have a relationship with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be as present as I can be till I took</v>

2205
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:47.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever I was beforehand them to,</v>

2206
01:31:47.111 --> 01:31:50.190
<v Speaker 2>to evolve to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

2207
01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>

2208
01:31:52.630 --> 01:31:53.463
<v Speaker 2>when you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very weird thing what happens to </v>

2209
01:31:55.571 --> 01:32:00.460
<v Speaker 2>you because you all the sudden it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not alone anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

2211
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't just have responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a dog,</v>

2212
01:32:04.241 --> 01:32:05.074
<v Speaker 1>you have to feed or a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a little person and you don't </v>

2213
01:32:08.651 --> 01:32:09.484
<v Speaker 1>want to fuck up that little person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like shit and it feels </v>

2214
01:32:12.251 --> 01:32:14.680
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming and then the world feels so</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

2215
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Change the view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2216
01:32:17.141 --> 01:32:17.974
<v Speaker 1>there's so much threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much out there that could </v>

2217
01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:21.610
<v Speaker 1>stop signs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes,</v>

2218
01:32:21.611 --> 01:32:26.110
<v Speaker 1>stories to you read stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible people and terrible things that</v>

2219
01:32:26.111 --> 01:32:27.250
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2220
01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:28.084
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2221
01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.073
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just happened to me afterward when </v>

2222
01:32:29.971 --> 01:32:32.150
<v Speaker 1>this happened to know somebody else to </v>
<v Speaker 1>then your little,</v>

2223
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.570
<v Speaker 1>your little daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2224
01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wild bro.</v>

2225
01:32:36.370 --> 01:32:37.203
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy world and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of people differently because </v>

2226
01:32:40.991 --> 01:32:41.824
<v Speaker 1>you think of people as a project that </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed instead of being in a static </v>

2227
01:32:44.981 --> 01:32:46.810
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2228
01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:47.913
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

2229
01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:48.753
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that something like a </v>

2230
01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:54.040
<v Speaker 1>emotionally happens to you like at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>level that the DNA level?</v>

2231
01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the love you have.</v>

2232
01:32:55.691 --> 01:32:56.524
<v Speaker 1>Like Dave Chappelle said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this best goes not only to do increase </v>

2233
01:32:58.720 --> 01:32:59.553
<v Speaker 1>my love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it increased my capacity for love and </v>

2234
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a great way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2235
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I would agree 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It increases your capacity.</v>

2236
01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.160
<v Speaker 1>You become an eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least me,</v>

2237
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I became a nicer person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen it not work too.</v>

2238
01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:13.773
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people that just reject it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen men and women that just don't </v>

2239
01:33:16.181 --> 01:33:17.014
<v Speaker 1>want to be parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen women move away from their </v>

2240
01:33:18.851 --> 01:33:19.684
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to take care of their </v>

2241
01:33:20.201 --> 01:33:23.020
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen men abandoned their families.</v>

2242
01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:25.270
<v Speaker 1>They just don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2243
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a mental health </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue or if it's just,</v>

2244
01:33:31.391 --> 01:33:33.820
<v Speaker 1>some people just can't take it.</v>

2245
01:33:34.190 --> 01:33:35.023
<v Speaker 1>He never like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like attitudes and this is not </v>

2246
01:33:38.111 --> 01:33:42.490
<v Speaker 1>just about raising children's about </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much anything difficult in life.</v>

2247
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:46.750
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that have a very low</v>
<v Speaker 1>quit point,</v>

2248
01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:49.870
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just quit everything.</v>

2249
01:33:49.871 --> 01:33:51.040
<v Speaker 1>They quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets tough,</v>

2250
01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:51.874
<v Speaker 1>quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>

2251
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:54.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that just quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2252
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.910
<v Speaker 1>when you have a little like say if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a little theo in front of you,</v>

2253
01:33:57.911 --> 01:33:58.744
<v Speaker 1>when you think about your life and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood and like how important it is </v>

2254
01:34:01.301 --> 01:34:02.134
<v Speaker 1>for you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to raise this little person and give </v>

2255
01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:09.880
<v Speaker 1>them love and teach them about life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect him and keep him safe.</v>

2256
01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:11.540
<v Speaker 1>And give them good lessons in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2257
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:14.200
<v Speaker 1>It just changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything,</v>

2258
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:17.560
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything changes everything.</v>

2259
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:20.530
<v Speaker 1>But it also has to brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overwhelming.</v>

2260
01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.393
<v Speaker 1>It's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get serious anxiety when they </v>

2261
01:34:23.681 --> 01:34:24.514
<v Speaker 1>have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start thinking about the </v>

2262
01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:28.750
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and the weight of it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they don't.</v>

2263
01:34:28.751 --> 01:34:29.584
<v Speaker 1>Some people just fucking take pills and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lay on the couch and let their kids </v>

2264
01:34:31.691 --> 01:34:32.524
<v Speaker 1>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking carpet glass and the fucking </v>

2265
01:34:35.141 --> 01:34:39.890
<v Speaker 1>stick forks into the wall sockets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>play with knives.</v>

2266
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:41.980
<v Speaker 1>People just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't give a fuck,</v>

2267
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:44.350
<v Speaker 1>but some people are dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

2268
01:34:44.351 --> 01:34:45.460
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2269
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:46.031
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2270
01:34:46.031 --> 01:34:46.864
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's folks out there that just </v>

2271
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:53.740
<v Speaker 1>aren't equipped for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>

2272
01:34:53.741 --> 01:34:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I think dee come the dumb brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2273
01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Take the semen of him.</v>

2274
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.660
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like at a certain point,</v>

2275
01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:01.900
<v Speaker 3>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dumb compared to physicists.</v>

2276
01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:05.930
<v Speaker 3>So who's the WHO's to judge and who's to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that this person is really stupid?</v>

2277
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't have a brilliant child that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to men.</v>

2278
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:11.200
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant people come out of stay,</v>

2279
01:35:11.201 --> 01:35:13.910
<v Speaker 3>need adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man Who knows what they need,</v>

2280
01:35:13.911 --> 01:35:14.744
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not our job to decide who's stupid </v>

2281
01:35:18.501 --> 01:35:21.490
<v Speaker 3>and who's not because it gets slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.393
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could get boxed into that stupid </v>

2283
01:35:24.561 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 3>corner in a different metric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're hanging around with a bunch of</v>

2284
01:35:27.501 --> 01:35:30.030
<v Speaker 3>people from Stanford and they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>steel,</v>

2285
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:30.831
<v Speaker 3>vons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neighborhood,</v>

2286
01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:32.270
<v Speaker 3>and they know there's 10 people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood,</v>

2287
01:35:32.271 --> 01:35:33.104
<v Speaker 3>but only nine can survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only resources for nine paying to </v>

2288
01:35:35.451 --> 01:35:36.380
<v Speaker 3>get rid of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

2289
01:35:36.930 --> 01:35:38.630
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how good you are digging </v>
<v Speaker 3>ditches</v>

2290
01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.140
<v Speaker 3>all it could be better than him at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2291
01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So suddenly I have a different scale.</v>

2292
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2293
01:35:46.011 --> 01:35:47.660
<v Speaker 3>have you thought about having kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2294
01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:48.523
<v Speaker 3>I think about it a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as I get a little bit older and I </v>

2295
01:35:49.821 --> 01:35:50.660
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2296
01:35:50.661 --> 01:35:52.640
<v Speaker 3>The thing for me is just like about </v>
<v Speaker 3>being brave,</v>

2297
01:35:52.641 --> 01:35:53.474
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just being willing to have my life </v>

2298
01:35:54.501 --> 01:35:58.220
<v Speaker 3>just be totally different and be okay </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that and just being like willing to</v>

2299
01:35:58.221 --> 01:36:00.380

2308
01:36:17.031 --> 01:36:17.864
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes people fuck people that </v>

2309
01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:21.440
<v Speaker 3>they don't really like to hang out with.</v>

2311
01:36:22.821 --> 01:36:23.654
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets slippery because </v>

2312
01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:28.010
<v Speaker 3>sometimes that sex is fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2313
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking to a buddy of mine </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

2314
01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:32.690
<v Speaker 3>He's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Gal,</v>

2315
01:36:32.691 --> 01:36:34.980
<v Speaker 3>he's a single guy and he's got a gallery</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox.</v>

2316
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Every now and again they get together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they both kind of know what it is.</v>

2317
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get it together and they whack one </v>

2318
01:36:40.911 --> 01:36:43.250
<v Speaker 3>out and then they see ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2319
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:45.020
<v Speaker 3>And his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his take on it is interesting.</v>

2320
01:36:45.021 --> 01:36:45.591
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2321
01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:48.470
<v Speaker 3>And some people you just don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see him that often.</v>

2322
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Like that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

2323
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:52.700
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is it's not always </v>
<v Speaker 3>mutual.</v>

2324
01:36:53.230 --> 01:36:54.063
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the guy wants to see the girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than she wants to see him or vice </v>

2325
01:36:56.991 --> 01:36:59.180
<v Speaker 3>verse and then it become some weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2326
01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:02.060
<v Speaker 3>One person starts talking the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>person's facebook.</v>

2327
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:04.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like that's,</v>

2329
01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:07.040
<v Speaker 3>that's actually an addiction too.</v>

2330
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.903
<v Speaker 3>People get addicted to each other just </v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as they get addicted to </v>

2331
01:37:09.951 --> 01:37:10.784
<v Speaker 3>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just as much as they get addicted to </v>

<v Speaker 3>People absolutely get addicted to </v>

2333
01:37:16.041 --> 01:37:16.874
<v Speaker 3>certain people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when that person doesn't want to </v>

2334
01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:18.993
<v Speaker 3>have sex with you anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's like they're taking away your </v>

2339
01:37:29.001 --> 01:37:31.670
<v Speaker 3>something to them because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be with them anymore.</v>

2340
01:37:31.671 --> 01:37:33.950
<v Speaker 3>And really dumb men are dangerous right </v>

01:37:49.251 --> 01:37:50.210
<v Speaker 3>might be on medication.</v>

2348

<v Speaker 3>had a pint.</v>

2414
01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:42.283
<v Speaker 3>You may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a birch or something and people </v>

2415
01:40:43.251 --> 01:40:47.040
<v Speaker 3>would go out there and you're a cough </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop off at the base of the tree.</v>

2416
01:40:47.041 --> 01:40:47.874
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he used like a step stool or </v>

2417
01:40:48.691 --> 01:40:49.524
<v Speaker 3>something or sound on a barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when you found all the magazines </v>

2418
01:40:52.051 --> 01:40:53.390
<v Speaker 3>in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2419
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:54.333
<v Speaker 3>We used to have that.</v>

2420
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:55.563
<v Speaker 2>But as you go out another tree and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody will be using the tree and be </v>

2421
01:40:57.531 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>

2422
01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:02.470
<v Speaker 2>I've got to walk back home now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 100% real.</v>

2423
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:03.940
<v Speaker 2>You're making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a photograph?</v>

2424
01:41:03.941 --> 01:41:05.470
<v Speaker 2>This tree?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2425
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know where it is?</v>

2426
01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Could you take us back there with a film</v>
<v Speaker 2>crew?</v>

2427
01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I could take you back there with a film </v>
<v Speaker 2>crew.</v>

2428
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's devolved now though.</v>

2429
01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.473
<v Speaker 2>A trade live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back there and touch the thing and </v>

2430
01:41:17.111 --> 01:41:18.340
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you can't find your way </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2431
01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck are we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does,</v>

2432
01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.390
<v Speaker 2>we're going in a circle.</v>

2433
01:41:25.290 --> 01:41:26.123
<v Speaker 2>Like it turns out that the tree got </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired of people jerk off on it so it </v>

2434
01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:34.020
<v Speaker 2>evolves some sort of a neuro toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when you touched it,</v>

2435
01:41:34.691 --> 01:41:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it got into your bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It distorted your perception of distance</v>

2436
01:41:37.811 --> 01:41:41.220
<v Speaker 2>and time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they go scale,</v>

2437
01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.860
<v Speaker 2>but do what if you would've come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could divide.</v>

2438
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:46.000
<v Speaker 2>They would have semen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could defy gravity.</v>

2439
01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:47.830
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2440
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:49.210
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think.</v>

2441
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if come didn't just get humans pregnant.</v>

2442
01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.600

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:08.333
<v Speaker 2>The way he reacted every step of the way</v>

<v Speaker 1>was exposed by Sasha Baron Cohen and a </v>

2629
01:49:53.201 --> 01:49:55.350
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

2636
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:12.010
<v Speaker 1>there has to be something like that easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

2637
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:14.350

2642
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.720
<v Speaker 1>is there some way they get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some super fucking super tightly watched</v>

2643
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:33.483
<v Speaker 1>circuit ring of people who still engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this activity and figured out a way </v>

2644
01:50:37.331 --> 01:50:37.900
<v Speaker 1>to do it?</v>

2645
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope not too.</v>

2646
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Everybody hopes not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that it's impossible.</v>

2647
01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.370
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's impossible is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely.</v>

2648
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a market for it,</v>

2649
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:50.520
<v Speaker 1>sadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2650
01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:53.110
<v Speaker 1>you think about it all the time when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about other countries,</v>

2651
01:50:53.170 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it there for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of our guys,</v>

2653
01:50:56.261 --> 01:50:58.840
<v Speaker 1>it seems fly over these other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be dirty over there.</v>

2654
01:50:59.410 --> 01:51:02.200
<v Speaker 1>The idea of like going over there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a ring,</v>

2655
01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:04.090
<v Speaker 1>a pedophile ring.</v>

2657
01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:09.573
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's mostly people who have </v>

2658
01:51:13.371 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 1>been abused like that themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2660
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:17.343
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spacey's brothers said about Kevin is </v>

2661
01:51:21.071 --> 01:51:21.904
<v Speaker 1>that Kevin is basically like their dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their dad sexually abused them and </v>

2662

<v Speaker 1>You know that more people aren't </v>

2736

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2746
01:54:46.881 --> 01:54:51.200
<v Speaker 1>the people that worked with our Kelly </v>
<v Speaker 1>post video.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

2749
01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:00.460

<v Speaker 1>eradicate that?</v>

2750
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.360
<v Speaker 1>The fact that people do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>or young people.</v>

2753
01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.493
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully scientists will figure out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to isolate that part of human </v>

2754
01:55:16.341 --> 01:55:17.870
<v Speaker 1>thinking someday.</v>

2756
01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:22.730
<v Speaker 1>doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

2757
01:55:22.731 --> 01:55:23.564
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever it is figured out a way to stop </v>

2758
01:55:25.281 --> 01:55:26.114
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the meantime what it has gotten </v>

2759
01:55:28.161 --> 01:55:30.440
<v Speaker 1>is way more difficult for them to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>

2760
01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:31.333
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2761
01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:34.850
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to get more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

2762
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I think people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected.</v>

2763
01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're connected right now with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones.</v>

2764
01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Like this is how weird the connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2765
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:43.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Adam Green tree who was here </v>

2766
01:55:44.281 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 1>yesterday when we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toyota Tundras,</v>

2767
01:55:46.930 --> 01:55:51.060
<v Speaker 1>he said after we were talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said all of his ads on his phone,</v>

2768
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:54.180
<v Speaker 1>like when he would look at a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would all be Toyota ads.</v>

2769
01:55:54.210 --> 01:55:55.830
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're listening.</v>

2770
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're listening to his phone.</v>

2771
01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.273
<v Speaker 1>Like the word Toyota Tundra came up over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again in his search </v>

2772
01:56:02.911 --> 01:56:04.290
<v Speaker 1>searches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toyota trucks,</v>

2773
01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:06.450
<v Speaker 1>cause we were talking about Toyota </v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks,</v>

2774
01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Toyota trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a say that bacon draw,</v>

2775
01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Toyota Tacoma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it over and over again.</v>

2776
01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:12.233
<v Speaker 1>But whenever the fuck process of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know if he actually </v>

2777
01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:20.530
<v Speaker 1>accidentally googled Toyota trucks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>day too,</v>

2778
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but they found out who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's there.</v>

2779
01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:29.010
<v Speaker 1>My point is like saying something in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and it's being connected to</v>

2780
01:56:29.011 --> 01:56:30.330
<v Speaker 1>these internet searches.</v>

2781
01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Like these little things are starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and it's going to get more and </v>

2782
01:56:34.771 --> 01:56:36.570
<v Speaker 1>more prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over for us.</v>

2783
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:38.263
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be like way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected now than we were going to be </v>

2784
01:56:42.481 --> 01:56:44.820
<v Speaker 1>way more connected rather than 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we are now,</v>

2785
01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.713
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to figure out what would that be </v>

2786
01:56:46.681 --> 01:56:50.940
<v Speaker 1>like because no one saw this comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one saw us being disconnected.</v>

2787
01:56:51.210 --> 01:56:54.150
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck is it going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're connected much,</v>

2788
01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:57.090
<v Speaker 1>much more than that in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that going to be?</v>

2789
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:58.103
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be something unimaginable </v>

2790
01:57:00.781 --> 01:57:02.460
<v Speaker 1>cause it's this was unimaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2791
01:57:03.250 --> 01:57:04.083
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be some next plane that </v>

2792
01:57:05.461 --> 01:57:06.294
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be some next level of </v>

2793
01:57:08.161 --> 01:57:11.630
<v Speaker 1>intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that comes into it or I,</v>

2794
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:13.500
<v Speaker 1>when I was really high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this up.</v>

2795
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My really high thought was,</v>

2796
01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:17.483
<v Speaker 1>you know how kids learn things really </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily are they will just learn things </v>

2797
01:57:20.071 --> 01:57:22.110
<v Speaker 1>way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can learn a language really easy.</v>

2798
01:57:22.111 --> 01:57:25.290
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna if very soon in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

2799
01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.153
<v Speaker 1>a universal language is developed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincides with artificial artificial </v>

2800
01:57:32.131 --> 01:57:33.810
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2801
01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:37.470
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and augmented and augmented reality.</v>

2802
01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And so this universal language allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>people of all languages.</v>

2803
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:43.343
<v Speaker 1>They can learn it and they can learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was coming off of something </v>

2804
01:57:45.661 --> 01:57:50.661
<v Speaker 1>that Jamie said once we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>emojis being almost like hieroglyphs.</v>

2805
01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:52.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2806
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:55.320
<v Speaker 1>that seems so weird because they seem so</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute and Corny,</v>

2807
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:56.273
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone could send you a whole </v>

2808
01:57:57.990 --> 01:58:02.990
<v Speaker 1>series of them like eggplant water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smiley face,</v>

2809
01:58:03.150 --> 01:58:04.500
<v Speaker 1>high five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like,</v>

2810
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:05.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone wants to fuck.</v>

2811
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:06.383
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2812
01:58:06.710 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 1>That's my right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meet time to meme.</v>

2813
01:58:08.701 --> 01:58:10.100
<v Speaker 1>A picture could sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2814
01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:11.393
<v Speaker 1>Jack's all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well while I was thinking that I was </v>

2815
01:58:12.961 --> 01:58:13.351
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2816
01:58:13.351 --> 01:58:14.184
<v Speaker 1>well what would stop once they develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality or artists or or a </v>

2817
01:58:19.501 --> 01:58:23.400
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality in some sort of a easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>digestible form,</v>

2818
01:58:23.401 --> 01:58:24.234
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a chip that you have in </v>

2819
01:58:25.471 --> 01:58:27.600
<v Speaker 1>your body that sends signals directly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>

2820
01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:28.770
<v Speaker 1>allows you to communicate with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2821
01:58:29.130 --> 01:58:29.963
<v Speaker 1>If we developed a language and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>send and receive images in a way that </v>

2822
01:58:33.031 --> 01:58:33.864
<v Speaker 1>may be even more effective than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that we assume that English is </v>

2823
01:58:37.801 --> 01:58:40.500
<v Speaker 1>the best way to talk cause we only know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to talk English.</v>

2824
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if we could speak Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could express ourselves clear.</v>

2825
01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if we speak Turkish or Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a better one.</v>

2826
01:58:48.011 --> 01:58:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only know one language.</v>

2827
01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:55.140
<v Speaker 1>But what if w sound languages are far </v>
<v Speaker 1>inferior to visual languages and what of</v>

2828
01:58:56.621 --> 01:58:57.454
<v Speaker 1>these visual languages allow people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>even can't even see to see because they </v>

2829
01:59:00.311 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 1>could send it directly into their mind.</v>

2830
01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:02.733
<v Speaker 1>They can see these things with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes closed and I've been using her </v>

2831
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:07.960
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs and everybody can communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>on an even plane.</v>

2832
01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:11.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's no language barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was thinking this,</v>

2833
01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:11.771
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2834
01:59:11.771 --> 01:59:13.120
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta be this impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2835
01:59:13.121 --> 01:59:15.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not impossible because there's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a hundred languages.</v>

2836
01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:16.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many languages are there?</v>

2837
01:59:16.991 --> 01:59:17.824
<v Speaker 1>If you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have bet there's probably a </v>

2838
01:59:19.451 --> 01:59:23.080
<v Speaker 1>hundred and maybe 15 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're right.</v>

2839
01:59:23.110 --> 01:59:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll say 130 let's go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say 130 locations.</v>

2840
01:59:26.110 --> 01:59:29.130
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a thousand who the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows language bob?</v>

2841
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:30.340
<v Speaker 1>One language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob.</v>

2842
01:59:30.370 --> 01:59:31.960
<v Speaker 1>More.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than a thousand okay.</v>

2843
01:59:31.961 --> 01:59:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to have a separate guest.</v>

2844
01:59:35.170 --> 01:59:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to go with 1800 I would like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go with 1060</v>

2845
01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:43.713
<v Speaker 4>that says there are roughly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is number of spoken languages in </v>

2846
01:59:47.491 --> 01:59:49.620
<v Speaker 4>the world today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>6,500</v>

2847
01:59:50.210 --> 01:59:55.210
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were home out to about 2000</v>

2848
01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:58.070
<v Speaker 4>those have less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fewer than a thousand speakers,</v>

2849
01:59:58.071 --> 02:00:00.320
<v Speaker 4>so even if we count those off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still for over 40</v>

2850
02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:01.653
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those people on that central </v>

2851
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:05.230
<v Speaker 1>north central island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a dead language.</v>

2852
02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>There's only 39 really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where that guy got killed was only 39 of</v>

2853
02:00:08.651 --> 02:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>4,000.</v>

2854
02:00:10.210 --> 02:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>So even if you take off that 2,500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2855
02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:13.173
<v Speaker 1>if you take those off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that he said that only less </v>

2856
02:00:14.890 --> 02:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>than a hundred people or you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're using it.</v>

2857
02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:17.291
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

2858
02:00:17.291 --> 02:00:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing that's really crazy.</v>

2859
02:00:19.090 --> 02:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2860
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2861
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:21.583
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous people of Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Adam Green tree who was here </v>

2862
02:00:24.491 --> 02:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2863
02:00:25.421 --> 02:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he works with a lot of these people.</v>

2864
02:00:26.981 --> 02:00:30.400
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like a mining company and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his,</v>

2865
02:00:30.401 --> 02:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bunch of the people that you work</v>

2866
02:00:32.561 --> 02:00:33.394
<v Speaker 1>with wood explained to him these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages that they're not </v>

2867
02:00:37.631 --> 02:00:38.464
<v Speaker 1>written down and you and your mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they would call the aborigines </v>

2868
02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>would call themselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

2869
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a clan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called a mob there.</v>

2870
02:00:46.930 --> 02:00:47.763
<v Speaker 1>A term for it would have a totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>different language than someone who </v>

2871
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>lives just a few miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'd be a different mob.</v>

2872
02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>It was a few miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally different language.</v>

2873
02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.280
<v Speaker 1>You can't understand what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying.</v>

2874
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what the fuck you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

2875
02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Then there's another one over here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never no one of the one.</v>

2876
02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many do you think there is?</v>

2877
02:01:02.741 --> 02:01:03.071
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2878
02:01:03.071 --> 02:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>it was probably hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hundreds.</v>

2879
02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:06.333
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows what the fuck anybody say </v>

2880
02:01:08.751 --> 02:01:09.584
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they don't want the </v>

2881
02:01:10.031 --> 02:01:11.920
<v Speaker 1>other one to know because it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get their secrets.</v>

2882
02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:12.754
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2883
02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:13.793
<v Speaker 4>How many do you think there's another </v>
<v Speaker 4>report that says there's this number of </v>

2884
02:01:16.981 --> 02:01:21.290
<v Speaker 4>languages that are spoken in us homes as</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this as of 2015 ooh.</v>

2885
02:01:21.710 --> 02:01:23.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a smaller number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2886
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>303 50 wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least it says at least 300 if you had</v>

2887
02:01:30.061 --> 02:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>asked me before this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said 13 yeah,</v>

2888
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:33.643
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was going to guess actually I was </v>

2889
02:01:34.411 --> 02:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>going to guess 11 fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of languages.</v>

2890
02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:39.280
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2891
02:01:39.850 --> 02:01:40.920
<v Speaker 1>We're fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2892
02:01:40.921 --> 02:01:41.754
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're okay.</v>

2893
02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:42.673
<v Speaker 1>That makes my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the next stage is a universal </v>

2894
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2895
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Universal language would like think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the aborigines there.</v>

2896
02:01:51.171 --> 02:01:52.004
<v Speaker 1>That's how fucked up situation to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows what the fuck anybody </v>

2897
02:01:53.961 --> 02:01:55.700
<v Speaker 1>saying and none of those things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>written down.</v>

2898
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:59.750
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be in that clan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that language or that mob and</v>

2899
02:01:59.751 --> 02:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>then they die off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third thing in small,</v>

2900
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:03.853
<v Speaker 1>small ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they didn't think it's not planned </v>

2901
02:02:05.301 --> 02:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>out well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are connected.</v>

2902
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:08.203
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think through a universal </v>

2903
02:02:11.541 --> 02:02:12.374
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that we could </v>

2904
02:02:14.361 --> 02:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>reshape civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2905
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Through a universal language that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid picks up in school.</v>

2906
02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:22.070
<v Speaker 1>You teach them bing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bong,</v>

2907
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Upside,</v>

2908
02:02:22.971 --> 02:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English or Chinese or anything else.</v>

2909
02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>But being bong is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2910
02:02:26.431 --> 02:02:30.320
<v Speaker 1>the Internet language and this Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that everybody understands.</v>

2911
02:02:30.321 --> 02:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just starts communicating </v>
<v Speaker 1>through bing,</v>

2912
02:02:31.851 --> 02:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>bong and nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2913
02:02:33.441 --> 02:02:36.080
<v Speaker 1>nobody's using regular language anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2914
02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you occasionally talked like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in bed,</v>

2915
02:02:38.121 --> 02:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>he'd talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had bitch,</v>

2916
02:02:38.991 --> 02:02:39.824
<v Speaker 1>remember dirty talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and English to talk [inaudible] </v>

2917
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:44.680
<v Speaker 1>French dirty talking to Israel,</v>

2918
02:02:44.730 --> 02:02:47.820
<v Speaker 4>185 that are spoken just in Los Angeles.</v>

2919
02:02:48.610 --> 02:02:49.443
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2920
02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that makes sense.</v>

2921
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>If there's 300 in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2922
02:02:56.450 --> 02:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I would think all of them would be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more shocked at all the money.</v>

2923
02:02:59.021 --> 02:03:00.050
<v Speaker 1>He was pretty multicultural.</v>

2924
02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.530
<v Speaker 4>There's a group in 2,500 people or so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that speak Dutch at home in Riverside.</v>

2925
02:03:05.140 --> 02:03:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

2926
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:07.940
<v Speaker 1>But only Dutch.</v>

2927
02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:08.701
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2928
02:03:08.701 --> 02:03:10.740
<v Speaker 4>not only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that mostly.</v>

2929
02:03:10.741 --> 02:03:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I can.</v>

2930
02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>That's riverside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch are so aerodynamic.</v>

2931
02:03:14.670 --> 02:03:16.110
<v Speaker 1>They move good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

02:05:14.791 --> 02:05:17.700
<v Speaker 2>back to this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I'm saying though,</v>

2986
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:20.100
<v Speaker 2>because everybody probably should watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little point and get the study.</v>

2987
02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

2988
02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Why you checking off from memory now a </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger gal from memory now,</v>

2989
02:05:25.650 --> 02:05:26.820
<v Speaker 2>do you find that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2990
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.410
<v Speaker 2>fantasies become more elaborate?</v>

2991
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:29.333
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more excited it up and just set </v>

2992
02:05:31.171 --> 02:05:32.580
<v Speaker 2>it up in your head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

2993
02:05:32.581 --> 02:05:37.480
<v Speaker 2>It's how many days a week he'd beaten it</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than four.</v>

2994
02:05:37.481 --> 02:05:39.060
<v Speaker 2>And you got a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2995
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:42.810
<v Speaker 2>two days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm disappointed at that.</v>

2996
02:05:44.130 --> 02:05:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to turn over a new leaf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2997
02:05:46.890 --> 02:05:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I want to not be morning some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2998
02:05:49.361 --> 02:05:52.530
<v Speaker 2>I want to be confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a,</v>

2999
02:05:52.531 --> 02:05:54.230
<v Speaker 2>that's look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a [inaudible].</v>

3000
02:05:54.490 --> 02:05:55.323
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just look at sexual desire and </v>

3001
02:05:58.561 --> 02:05:59.420
<v Speaker 2>lust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3002
02:06:01.170 --> 02:06:04.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why you become more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more desperate as time goes on.</v>

3003
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:06.143
<v Speaker 2>It's like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sights are set too high or you're </v>

3004
02:06:08.581 --> 02:06:11.280
<v Speaker 2>not being ambitious enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to spread your seed.</v>

3005
02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:12.413
<v Speaker 2>If you think about how ridiculous it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people didn't know that having sex </v>

3006
02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:18.140
<v Speaker 2>with people has consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3007
02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:21.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by that I mean you can get pregnant,</v>

3008
02:06:21.001 --> 02:06:24.630
<v Speaker 2>you can get diseases if there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was cultural limitations,</v>

3009
02:06:24.631 --> 02:06:25.470
<v Speaker 2>people frown upon it.</v>

3010
02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:26.453
<v Speaker 2>But if there was none of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and imagine how much people would be </v>

3011
02:06:28.291 --> 02:06:29.190
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

3012
02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:31.700
<v Speaker 2>It would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3013
02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:33.690
<v Speaker 2>or if there was no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbating,</v>

3014
02:06:33.691 --> 02:06:35.460
<v Speaker 2>you could forget a gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People be fucking,</v>

3015
02:06:35.461 --> 02:06:36.294
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was no such masturbation was </v>

3016
02:06:38.111 --> 02:06:39.510
<v Speaker 2>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3017
02:06:39.511 --> 02:06:43.980
<v Speaker 2>you know what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What women would rule everything 100%,</v>

3018
02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:45.263
<v Speaker 2>but it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have so much cheap built up in </v>

3019
02:06:46.591 --> 02:06:47.424
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

3020
02:06:47.730 --> 02:06:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be bitches.</v>

3021
02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:51.000
<v Speaker 2>They'd be given in every chance they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

3022
02:06:51.001 --> 02:06:53.580
<v Speaker 2>Cause the women would own it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth so much more.</v>

3023
02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:55.120
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3024
02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Because women would be able to decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you came.</v>

3025
02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:00.390
<v Speaker 2>There's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was the only way,</v>

3026
02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:04.170
<v Speaker 2>if women were the rulers and whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not you came,</v>

3027
02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:05.790
<v Speaker 2>if there was no way to come without </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

3028
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:07.050
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would dominate.</v>

3029
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:09.450
<v Speaker 2>We're fucked dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's going to be the next law.</v>

3030
02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:10.313
<v Speaker 2>If they're really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they would take over top our </v>

3031
02:07:13.591 --> 02:07:18.591
<v Speaker 2>arms off</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me though.</v>

3032
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:25.260
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't watch like a little Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy jerk off from like 30 feet away.</v>

3033
02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Back to this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3034
02:07:26.671 --> 02:07:29.730
<v Speaker 2>but just to train accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to happen.</v>

3035
02:07:30.070 --> 02:07:31.990
<v Speaker 2>But Jamie pulls up a video of a train </v>
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>

3036
02:07:31.991 --> 02:07:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to see this one shit.</v>

3037
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and watch it.</v>

3038
02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3039
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:37.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3040
02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:40.090
<v Speaker 3>But tell me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How close do you get?</v>

3041
02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a Chinese guy jerking off </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a park.</v>

3042
02:07:42.371 --> 02:07:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's Ma,</v>

3043
02:07:44.230 --> 02:07:46.630
<v Speaker 3>he's depends on who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's Cantonese,</v>

3044
02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Cantonese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my me.</v>

3045
02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Right now you're you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now you're jogging,</v>

3046
02:07:50.441 --> 02:07:51.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jogging.</v>

3047
02:07:51.450 --> 02:07:54.380
<v Speaker 3>You guys beating off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends on how close you see,</v>

3048
02:07:54.410 --> 02:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>like you stopped to tie your shoe right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see him in the park.</v>

3049
02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:57.191
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3050
02:07:57.191 --> 02:08:00.370
<v Speaker 3>that guy's definitely beating off and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're about 200 yards away.</v>

3051
02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.860
<v Speaker 3>I probably would stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How close would you walk to it?</v>

3052
02:08:02.861 --> 02:08:03.694
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When someone's jerking off in public </v>

3053
02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:06.143
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have an obligation to do one of two </v>

3054
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:08.400
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have an obligation.</v>

3055
02:08:08.401 --> 02:08:10.780
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he looking at you and jerking off?</v>

3056
02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:12.400
<v Speaker 3>He's looking at you and Jurgen off.</v>

3057
02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:15.010
<v Speaker 3>If he's doing it out in the open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might be sick,</v>

3058
02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.620
<v Speaker 3>but he's turned enough towards you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of invited I think.</v>

3059
02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:18.371
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3060
02:08:18.371 --> 02:08:19.300
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3061
02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:21.070
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in the park,</v>

3062
02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:24.430
<v Speaker 3>this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3063
02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:26.250
<v Speaker 3>being 100% serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3064
02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:27.890
<v Speaker 3>If I'm running in the park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3065
02:08:27.930 --> 02:08:28.990
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3066
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:32.200
<v Speaker 3>five yards over to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right next to a tree.</v>

3067
02:08:32.201 --> 02:08:33.820
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy beaten off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3068
02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:34.713
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stop running and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to look at him and I'm going to look at </v>

3069
02:08:37.661 --> 02:08:38.494
<v Speaker 3>all the people around him and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep an eye on him and I'm probably </v>

3070
02:08:40.631 --> 02:08:41.464
<v Speaker 3>either going to call the cops or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely gonna stand there because </v>

3071
02:08:44.711 --> 02:08:49.270
<v Speaker 3>what if some person is jogging and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>just decides this is the time to jump on</v>

3072
02:08:49.271 --> 02:08:51.270
<v Speaker 3>this person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3073
02:08:51.370 --> 02:08:52.203
<v Speaker 3>What if some kid is walking by and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>snatches that kid and drags him in the </v>

3074
02:08:54.671 --> 02:08:55.060
<v Speaker 3>bushes?</v>

3075
02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:55.893
<v Speaker 3>This guy is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's beaten off in public and he's </v>

3076
02:08:58.061 --> 02:08:59.330
<v Speaker 3>looking at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3077
02:08:59.350 --> 02:09:00.183
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would go over and be </v>

3078
02:09:01.571 --> 02:09:02.404
<v Speaker 3>violent with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would definitely keep an eye on </v>

3079
02:09:04.001 --> 02:09:04.960
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to let,</v>

3080
02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:06.633
<v Speaker 3>what if he's a fucking sexual Predator </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's looking to do something to </v>

3081
02:09:09.101 --> 02:09:12.430
<v Speaker 3>someone and you could be like Peter </v>
<v Speaker 3>Parker in Spiderman.</v>

3082
02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:13.810
<v Speaker 3>Save your uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3083
02:09:14.290 --> 02:09:14.681
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3084
02:09:14.681 --> 02:09:16.690
<v Speaker 3>that's what made Peter Parker became </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiderman.</v>

3085
02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:18.100
<v Speaker 3>He saved his uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3086
02:09:18.101 --> 02:09:18.934
<v Speaker 3>he had the power and he didn't save his </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle and a robber ran past him and he </v>

3087
02:09:22.121 --> 02:09:23.470
<v Speaker 3>didn't feel he had to do anything about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3088
02:09:23.471 --> 02:09:25.630
<v Speaker 3>And the robber got into the elevator and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed his uncle.</v>

3089
02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3090
02:09:26.921 --> 02:09:27.660
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or no,</v>

3091
02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:30.550
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't an elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the actual story was,</v>

3092
02:09:30.551 --> 02:09:34.180
<v Speaker 3>but the Robert did something to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle and killed him.</v>

3093
02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:36.580
<v Speaker 3>His uncle was everything to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His uncle took care of him.</v>

3094
02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:37.533
<v Speaker 3>So then he decided he could never let </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil people do anything bad again and </v>

3095
02:09:40.331 --> 02:09:42.340
<v Speaker 3>they became spiderman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that superhero.</v>

3096
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3097
02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:46.440
<v Speaker 3>you have an obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're,</v>

3098
02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:49.180
<v Speaker 3>if you're a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

3099
02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.090

3179
02:12:50.361 --> 02:12:51.194
<v Speaker 2>suits and go swimming with us.</v>

<v Speaker 2>impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No top or top no top dad.</v>

3185
02:13:04.221 --> 02:13:06.470

<v Speaker 2>I was in Germany one time,</v>

3186
02:13:06.471 --> 02:13:07.304
<v Speaker 2>I was on a bike ride and they had a man </v>
<v Speaker 2>swinging his dick in a big circle and I </v>

3187
02:13:10.011 --> 02:13:13.700
<v Speaker 2>thought that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a nudist area of a park.</v>

3188
02:13:14.210 --> 02:13:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've got a new this area,</v>

3189
02:13:16.131 --> 02:13:18.680
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're going to encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People swinging dicks.</v>

3190
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was kind of,</v>

3191
02:13:19.851 --> 02:13:21.660

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3193
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:27.980

<v Speaker 2>sal.</v>

3194
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about that guy in the park and what</v>

3195
02:13:30.231 --> 02:13:31.470
<v Speaker 2>he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why he's doing that.</v>

3196
02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:34.650
<v Speaker 2>You know what I used to think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think,</v>

3197
02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:37.380
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that piece of shit now I think,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a baby.</v>

3199
02:13:39.250 --> 02:13:39.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3200
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:40.463

3205
02:13:56.341 --> 02:13:57.174
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much of that is because of </v>

3206
02:13:58.630 --> 02:13:59.463
<v Speaker 2>repression like that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you went to the most sexually </v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And how much of it is important?</v>

<v Speaker 2>or people from out of town that are </v>

3213
02:14:17.091 --> 02:14:19.460
<v Speaker 2>weird that want freaky shit and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes an economy.</v>

3214
02:14:19.610 --> 02:14:20.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many people did you just leave </v>

3215
02:14:21.351 --> 02:14:24.280
<v Speaker 2>them to their own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be chill.</v>

3216
02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause we're pretty caged up.</v>

3217
02:14:26.111 --> 02:14:28.390
<v Speaker 2>They say here in America it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3218
02:14:28.391 --> 02:14:29.224
<v Speaker 2>everything's kind of taboo and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>see nipples and stuff on television and </v>

3219
02:14:32.650 --> 02:14:33.281
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

3220
02:14:33.281 --> 02:14:33.900
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

3221
02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:34.230
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3222
02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:36.750
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's also why we get so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much done.</v>

3223
02:14:37.230 --> 02:14:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3224
02:14:38.371 --> 02:14:39.090
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3225
02:14:39.090 --> 02:14:40.050
<v Speaker 2>do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3226
02:14:40.051 --> 02:14:40.884
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's my perception that we get </v>

3227
02:14:42.691 --> 02:14:44.730
<v Speaker 2>more done than other that were more </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>

3228
02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3229
02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I think we focus on it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3230
02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:50.310
<v Speaker 2>A lot of things have definitely come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from here,</v>

3231
02:14:50.770 --> 02:14:52.050
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3232
02:14:52.410 --> 02:14:53.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think pedophile is going out of </v>

3233
02:14:54.691 --> 02:14:55.524
<v Speaker 2>style too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a time where more </v>

3234
02:14:57.690 --> 02:14:59.610
<v Speaker 2>people got away with it easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

3235
02:14:59.670 --> 02:15:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get away with it,</v>

3236
02:15:00.961 --> 02:15:02.460
<v Speaker 2>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking,</v>

3237
02:15:02.490 --> 02:15:06.120
<v Speaker 2>that whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes a person do that just doesn't</v>

3238
02:15:06.121 --> 02:15:10.310
<v Speaker 2>seem like we've eradicated that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must just be a loose wire.</v>

3239
02:15:10.311 --> 02:15:11.144
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine that the thing about that is </v>

3240
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:17.890
<v Speaker 2>if they could one day figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get certain traits and breed them out</v>

3241
02:15:18.801 --> 02:15:21.350
<v Speaker 2>of people or engineered them out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3242
02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:24.420
<v Speaker 2>like we're fucked then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what,</v>

3243
02:15:24.590 --> 02:15:26.750
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you leave in?</v>

3244
02:15:27.170 --> 02:15:27.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3245
02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you leave in?</v>

3246
02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:29.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3247
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:30.263
<v Speaker 2>Emotional outbursts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you leave in the ability to have </v>

3248
02:15:32.371 --> 02:15:34.860
<v Speaker 2>an emotional outburst?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

3249
02:15:34.890 --> 02:15:35.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would leave that.</v>

3250
02:15:35.730 --> 02:15:36.990
<v Speaker 2>What'd you leave that in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>

3251
02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun for me.</v>

3252
02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:41.130
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you and I wouldn't be the ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>who decide.</v>

3253
02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Would you leave sneezing in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3254
02:15:43.351 --> 02:15:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male emotional outbursts.</v>

3255
02:15:47.610 --> 02:15:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like fucking cunts.</v>

3256
02:15:49.850 --> 02:15:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real fucking assholes.</v>

3257
02:15:51.450 --> 02:15:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of shit.</v>

3258
02:15:53.250 --> 02:15:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would leave that in.</v>

3259
02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:56.100
<v Speaker 2>I will leave that into not a lot of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

3260
02:15:56.101 --> 02:15:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I turned it down a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't fuck with it.</v>

3261
02:15:58.260 --> 02:15:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's our job to fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3262
02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you need that if a war breaks out,</v>

3263
02:16:02.250 --> 02:16:02.881
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3264
02:16:02.881 --> 02:16:06.120
<v Speaker 2>You can't have beat some guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh you don't need that and going to war.</v>

3265
02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:07.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to need that energy you're </v>

3266
02:16:07.651 --> 02:16:08.484
<v Speaker 2>going to need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like that whole like male </v>

3267
02:16:10.021 --> 02:16:13.860
<v Speaker 2>eruption fucking crazed aggression that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like.</v>

3268
02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:15.053
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when an invading village is headed over </v>

3269
02:16:17.281 --> 02:16:20.220
<v Speaker 2>the top of the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want that in a dude with an ax.</v>

3270
02:16:20.221 --> 02:16:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want that.</v>

3271
02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:23.410
<v Speaker 2>You want that to be available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3272
02:16:23.411 --> 02:16:24.244
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless we get to a point where we don't </v>

3273
02:16:25.231 --> 02:16:27.720
<v Speaker 2>have any war anywhere ever again,</v>

3274
02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:30.750
<v Speaker 1>but until then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

3275
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:33.610
<v Speaker 1>But what if we engineer it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Russians say they're going to,</v>

3276
02:16:33.611 --> 02:16:34.444
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

3277
02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:37.390
<v Speaker 1>They would do that probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would do that also.</v>

3278
02:16:37.570 --> 02:16:39.490
<v Speaker 1>We would definitely do are so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneaky.</v>

3279
02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that we will have another </v>
<v Speaker 1>war?</v>

3280
02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I hope not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's always the fear,</v>

3281
02:16:45.301 --> 02:16:45.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3282
02:16:45.751 --> 02:16:48.900
<v Speaker 1>we're in the middle of two right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3283
02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:50.213
<v Speaker 1>I think there could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think there could ever be another </v>

3284
02:16:50.911 --> 02:16:55.230
<v Speaker 1>state warrant in America of the civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>war states?</v>

3285
02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people were worried about that.</v>

3286
02:16:57.750 --> 02:17:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Some people state government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people want state run government.</v>

3287
02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:01.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people were worried about that as </v>

3288
02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.700
<v Speaker 1>hate for the Republicans and hate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump in particular,</v>

3289
02:17:08.701 --> 02:17:09.534
<v Speaker 1>ramps up and that they're really worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there'll be some sort of a violent </v>

3290
02:17:13.770 --> 02:17:14.603
<v Speaker 1>outbreak between the right and the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that this could actually really </v>

3291
02:17:17.611 --> 02:17:19.860
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3292
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.983
<v Speaker 1>it's not impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible that at least </v>

3293
02:17:23.701 --> 02:17:27.330
<v Speaker 1>battles could break out because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fucking polarized,</v>

3294
02:17:27.331 --> 02:17:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3295
02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:28.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what's interesting to me is </v>

3296
02:17:30.751 --> 02:17:33.420
<v Speaker 1>that more and more people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like,</v>

3297
02:17:33.421 --> 02:17:35.610
<v Speaker 1>at least from my perspective on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3298
02:17:35.970 --> 02:17:37.560
<v Speaker 1>are now coming out against trump.</v>

3299
02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It seems more common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more common,</v>

3300
02:17:39.991 --> 02:17:41.540
<v Speaker 1>especially with this government </v>
<v Speaker 1>shutdown.</v>

3301
02:17:41.610 --> 02:17:43.980
<v Speaker 1>People like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3302
02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:46.710
<v Speaker 1>There's so many videos of people going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

3303
02:17:46.711 --> 02:17:47.544
<v Speaker 1>What this wall like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need money like people or government </v>

3304
02:17:50.071 --> 02:17:51.900
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are living check to check.</v>

3305
02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:53.153
<v Speaker 1>You're shutting down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the only way you can </v>

3306
02:17:54.271 --> 02:17:55.104
<v Speaker 1>negotiate this wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the only way you can fund this </v>

3307
02:17:56.761 --> 02:17:57.870
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

3308
02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3309
02:18:00.121 --> 02:18:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3310
02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always say the government sucks.</v>

3311
02:18:04.261 --> 02:18:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Fucking shut it down and then it shuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3312
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3313
02:18:07.590 --> 02:18:08.423
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's makes an argument that the </v>

3314
02:18:10.021 --> 02:18:13.230
<v Speaker 1>government should be doing less things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the real argument.</v>

3315
02:18:13.350 --> 02:18:16.650
<v Speaker 1>The argument is some of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government does.</v>

3316
02:18:16.890 --> 02:18:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Why does the government have to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't it be privatized?</v>

3317
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't it become a business?</v>

3318
02:18:23.490 --> 02:18:24.323
<v Speaker 1>It would probably run better if some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things we're not run by the </v>

3319
02:18:27.301 --> 02:18:28.134
<v Speaker 1>government like airport security or like</v>
<v Speaker 1>road maintenance or like a lot of other </v>

3320
02:18:33.001 --> 02:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>things like don't have the government do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3321
02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:38.190
<v Speaker 1>have private contractors do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm read,</v>

3322
02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:42.630
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strong standards and strong competition.</v>

3323
02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And a John Stossel actually has a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it right now.</v>

3324
02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on his a twitter page.</v>

3325
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:55.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a long video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But explaining how,</v>

3326
02:18:55.261 --> 02:18:56.094
<v Speaker 1>one of the things people were realizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this government shutdown is that </v>

3327
02:18:59.761 --> 02:19:02.160
<v Speaker 1>the government does a lot of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to do.</v>

3328
02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:03.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be probably better for </v>

3329
02:19:03.781 --> 02:19:07.080
<v Speaker 1>everybody if some of these things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>streamlined.</v>

3330
02:19:07.081 --> 02:19:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Some of these things were done by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>private sector.</v>

3331
02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:13.173
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of things that </v>

3332
02:19:14.831 --> 02:19:15.664
<v Speaker 1>could be done better if there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition as soon as the government </v>

3333
02:19:17.921 --> 02:19:20.380
<v Speaker 1>controls certain businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3334
02:19:20.381 --> 02:19:22.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe they do it really well and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

3335
02:19:22.750 --> 02:19:23.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

3336
02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I think there's certain things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

3337
02:19:25.670 --> 02:19:30.530
<v Speaker 1>socialism works really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's one fire department.</v>

3338
02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta pay for the Fire Department.</v>

3339
02:19:33.321 --> 02:19:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to fund the fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>department.</v>

3340
02:19:34.971 --> 02:19:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't you cut the fire budget man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if my granny house?</v>

3341
02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we once fire,</v>

3342
02:19:40.581 --> 02:19:42.410
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to pay for the fire department.</v>

3343
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Pay For that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay for the police.</v>

3344
02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay.</v>

3345
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:48.080
<v Speaker 1>And everybody says pay you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>

3346
02:19:48.081 --> 02:19:50.240
<v Speaker 1>People only get cops and poor people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get comps.</v>

3347
02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:52.550
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would say that's crazy.</v>

3348
02:19:52.551 --> 02:19:53.384
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3349
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Well why is that not the case with </v>
<v Speaker 1>education to them?</v>

3350
02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3351
02:19:57.470 --> 02:19:58.303
<v Speaker 1>Don't you want people to learn things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when did education becomes such a </v>

3352
02:20:00.711 --> 02:20:02.300
<v Speaker 1>big business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that a business?</v>

3353
02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It should be our goal as patriots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3354
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:08.390
<v Speaker 1>To make less losers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more happy,</v>

3355
02:20:08.391 --> 02:20:10.610
<v Speaker 1>successful people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More aware people,</v>

3356
02:20:10.611 --> 02:20:12.870
<v Speaker 1>more educated people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3357
02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:13.753
<v Speaker 1>But instead it's like subsidized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and that makes it even </v>

3358
02:20:16.731 --> 02:20:17.564
<v Speaker 1>weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have student loans you </v>

3359
02:20:18.591 --> 02:20:19.430
<v Speaker 1>can't escape.</v>

3360
02:20:20.110 --> 02:20:21.550
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of that is pretty bizarre,</v>

3361
02:20:21.610 --> 02:20:22.301
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's bizarre.</v>

3362
02:20:22.301 --> 02:20:24.190
<v Speaker 7>It's fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it should be free.</v>

3363
02:20:24.250 --> 02:20:26.000
<v Speaker 7>But there's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's another like a lot,</v>

3364
02:20:26.020 --> 02:20:29.110
<v Speaker 7>some people don't want to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just true want to be alive and they</v>

3365
02:20:29.111 --> 02:20:30.610
<v Speaker 7>just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just,</v>

3366
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:31.503
<v Speaker 7>they don't want to contribute and really</v>
<v Speaker 7>have any sort of life and they have no </v>

3367
02:20:35.231 --> 02:20:36.064
<v Speaker 7>desire for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there's generation and generation </v>

3368
02:20:37.961 --> 02:20:38.794
<v Speaker 7>and generation of them</v>

3369
02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:42.860
<v Speaker 1>dead is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if you ever,</v>

3370
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:44.870
<v Speaker 1>do you ever look at universal basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>income?</v>

3371
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:46.423
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flatly rejected it when I first heard </v>

3372
02:20:49.851 --> 02:20:50.684
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have it.</v>

3373
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:51.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have it.</v>

3374
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:53.570
<v Speaker 1>They've tried it out in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

3375
02:20:53.571 --> 02:20:55.010
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's really worked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that well.</v>

3376
02:20:55.011 --> 02:20:59.120
<v Speaker 1>But the idea behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a guy who comes on soon,</v>

3377
02:20:59.121 --> 02:20:59.954
<v Speaker 1>his name is Andrew Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is a proponent of universal </v>

3378
02:21:02.121 --> 02:21:04.970
<v Speaker 1>basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is you give people x amount</v>

3379
02:21:04.971 --> 02:21:05.804
<v Speaker 1>of dollars per month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's $1,000 per month and </v>

3380
02:21:07.311 --> 02:21:11.900
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets it no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that,</v>

3381
02:21:11.901 --> 02:21:15.710
<v Speaker 1>you take care of all of the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>

3382
02:21:16.310 --> 02:21:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Like we take care of everyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

3383
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Everyone gets food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets shelter.</v>

3384
02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:26.030
<v Speaker 1>So that eliminates a lot of crime and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of strife just right away,</v>

3385
02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:26.250
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3386
02:21:26.250 --> 02:21:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Questions are laid back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's all that money come from?</v>

3387
02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:33.520
<v Speaker 1>There's $1,000 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>308 million.</v>

3388
02:21:34.401 --> 02:21:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

3389
02:21:36.170 --> 02:21:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you know that was 2010 it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>more now let's slate.</v>

3390
02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's say three 20 that is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

3391
02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:47.290
<v Speaker 1>320 million thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's 320 billion.</v>

3392
02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that what it is?</v>

3393
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:50.743
<v Speaker 1>I have no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>320 billion a month when that would be </v>

3394
02:21:54.290 --> 02:21:55.123
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you gave a thousand people $1 </v>

3395
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:58.760
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that what it would be?</v>

3396
02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:00.560
<v Speaker 1>A thousand million is a billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3397
02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Just do it in the calculator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

3398
02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>1,000.</v>

3399
02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:07.190
<v Speaker 1>1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3400
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:09.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it must be so that,</v>

3401
02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:12.170
<v Speaker 1>that's so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So three.</v>

3402
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:13.490
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>

3403
02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:16.430
<v Speaker 1>like him talking about building a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't he asking for 5 billion?</v>

3404
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Five Bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3405
02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:19.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

3406
02:22:19.610 --> 02:22:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's to build a wall once.</v>

3407
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>This is every month you would need all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those billions.</v>

3408
02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:30.410
<v Speaker 1>That's all a lot of fucking shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means everybody would be,</v>

3409
02:22:30.450 --> 02:22:31.880
<v Speaker 1>have their basic needs met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3410
02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Everybody get a thousand bucks where </v>
<v Speaker 1>that money comes from.</v>

3411
02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:35.940
<v Speaker 1>This is what I need to talk to this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3412
02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I'm not a mathematician or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an economist,</v>

3413
02:22:38.971 --> 02:22:42.710
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have any idea what they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they feel like they can do this 3000</v>

3414
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:45.600
<v Speaker 1>it got that 3000 or more every adult in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

3415
02:22:46.570 --> 02:22:48.820
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot to stipend of two 50 a </v>
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>

3416
02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:51.220
<v Speaker 4>Is that Andrew Yang?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not from him specifically,</v>

3417
02:22:51.221 --> 02:22:54.370
<v Speaker 4>but it's a different guy from like a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was talking bad about it actually.</v>

3418
02:22:54.371 --> 02:22:55.930
<v Speaker 4>He was just giving you what people were</v>

3419
02:22:56.410 --> 02:22:58.670
<v Speaker 1>someone talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

3420
02:22:59.190 --> 02:23:00.310
<v Speaker 1>talking bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3421
02:23:00.311 --> 02:23:01.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>3000 a month.</v>

3422
02:23:01.401 --> 02:23:02.234
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3423
02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:04.270
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost,</v>

3424
02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:06.640
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3425
02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:08.890
<v Speaker 1>$36,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3426
02:23:09.330 --> 02:23:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right then you'd be in the top 1% of the</v>

3427
02:23:12.611 --> 02:23:16.030
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody over 34 30 30 to 40,000 yeah,</v>

3428
02:23:16.031 --> 02:23:16.864
<v Speaker 1>$34,000 I think is 1% of the was it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would cut the nations poverty rate in </v>

3429
02:23:19.841 --> 02:23:20.720
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3430
02:23:21.130 --> 02:23:21.963
<v Speaker 1>But where's the money coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also do you lose incentive at that </v>

3431
02:23:26.081 --> 02:23:27.580
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

3432
02:23:27.970 --> 02:23:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it bad to lose incentive?</v>

3433
02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:31.193
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3434
02:23:31.450 --> 02:23:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what it's like the drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only reason otherwise you,</v>

3435
02:23:35.890 --> 02:23:37.840
<v Speaker 1>nobody ever comes anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody achieved.</v>

3436
02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:39.310
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>

3437
02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the drive,</v>

3438
02:23:41.441 --> 02:23:42.274
<v Speaker 1>does the drive always have to be for </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival or can the drive be the drive </v>

3439
02:23:47.291 --> 02:23:48.700
<v Speaker 1>to succeed and better yourself?</v>

3440
02:23:48.850 --> 02:23:50.590
<v Speaker 1>So say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it this way.</v>

3441
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:54.880
<v Speaker 1>If you have $35,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you think you'd be cool?</v>

3442
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:56.620
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need a tour.</v>

3443
02:23:56.770 --> 02:23:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I got 35 grand coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3444
02:23:58.191 --> 02:23:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to work harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3445
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:01.023
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people would want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work harder because I think your </v>

3446
02:24:02.591 --> 02:24:03.424
<v Speaker 1>motivation would be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your motivation would be to do better </v>

3447
02:24:05.861 --> 02:24:10.210
<v Speaker 1>than $35,000 but that $35,000 would take</v>
<v Speaker 1>care of you.</v>

3448
02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:11.193
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if money was free and economy didn't </v>

3449
02:24:12.701 --> 02:24:14.830
<v Speaker 1>make any sense and you could just fix it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

3450
02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:15.641
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3451
02:24:15.641 --> 02:24:16.710
<v Speaker 1>fix it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3452
02:24:16.711 --> 02:24:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck is all that money come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

3453
02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:21.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't do it.</v>

3454
02:24:21.221 --> 02:24:23.160
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean no,</v>

3455
02:24:23.170 --> 02:24:26.050
<v Speaker 1>and that means a lot of Richard would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to give up some of their money.</v>

3456
02:24:26.051 --> 02:24:31.051
<v Speaker 1>People aren't doing all of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be $900 billion every month.</v>

3457
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3458
02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:35.500
<v Speaker 1>We see when that am I right about that</v>

3459
02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:38.030
<v Speaker 4>300 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's for every adult.</v>

3460
02:24:38.031 --> 02:24:40.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not to give it to every person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3461
02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:41.533
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3462
02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Every adult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh don't have to raise your kids.</v>

3463
02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:45.350
<v Speaker 4>They get the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

3464
02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:48.020
<v Speaker 4>They get a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>3000 no bills.</v>

3465
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:49.400
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

3466
02:24:49.401 --> 02:24:51.680
<v Speaker 4>So how many people were dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people are adults?</v>

3467
02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:52.543
<v Speaker 4>It changes too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3468
02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:56.960
<v Speaker 4>this is the argument they make does that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would end some of the subsidies that</v>

3469
02:24:56.961 --> 02:24:57.794
<v Speaker 4>are already going on like Medicare and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some social security and maybe welfare </v>

3470
02:25:00.471 --> 02:25:01.304
<v Speaker 4>in some cases because people would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>money that they're spending or they're </v>

3471
02:25:04.401 --> 02:25:05.660
<v Speaker 4>getting now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that money,</v>

3472
02:25:05.710 --> 02:25:06.543
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3473
02:25:07.610 --> 02:25:07.810
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3474
02:25:07.810 --> 02:25:11.760
<v Speaker 1>think it'd be worth a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how long do you try to make,</v>

3475
02:25:11.761 --> 02:25:13.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause then people are going to be like,</v>

3476
02:25:13.210 --> 02:25:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I needed more time in a right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be,</v>

3477
02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:18.780
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't ever get their shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3478
02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:20.610
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that will definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

3479
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:21.623
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that will never get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their shit together and I don't believe </v>

3480
02:25:25.361 --> 02:25:26.194
<v Speaker 1>that this is a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that that were in some </v>

3481
02:25:27.731 --> 02:25:28.564
<v Speaker 1>sort of a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we're in something that was low </v>

3482
02:25:30.310 --> 02:25:32.140
<v Speaker 1>that you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a learning environment.</v>

3483
02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:33.573
<v Speaker 1>You would want both to have your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for failure and to see </v>

3484
02:25:36.911 --> 02:25:40.030
<v Speaker 1>examples of failure around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would want to see that.</v>

3485
02:25:40.270 --> 02:25:41.103
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not happy that Artie Lange that</v>
<v Speaker 1>his nose is caved in and then he's got </v>

3486
02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:48.460
<v Speaker 1>all these problems with drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not happy with that.</v>

3487
02:25:48.461 --> 02:25:50.800
<v Speaker 1>I love already laying and Artie Lange to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be clean.</v>

3488
02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I think he's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a great guy.</v>

3489
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:54.723
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that could be good that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out of that for anyone other than </v>

3490
02:25:59.621 --> 02:26:00.454
<v Speaker 1>already lang and Artie Lang's loved ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>and friends is someone that's just </v>

3491
02:26:03.821 --> 02:26:07.080
<v Speaker 1>looking at him online and sees what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>done and goes,</v>

3492
02:26:07.130 --> 02:26:07.963
<v Speaker 1>fuck that inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ruin this guy's in and </v>

3493
02:26:10.091 --> 02:26:12.490
<v Speaker 1>out of court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always getting arrested.</v>

3494
02:26:12.670 --> 02:26:15.130
<v Speaker 1>He keeps pissing hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of cheesy.</v>

3495
02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I was reading something today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is that it's,</v>

3496
02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:19.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sad,</v>

3497
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:22.640
<v Speaker 1>it's sad and people love the guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3498
02:26:22.641 --> 02:26:25.750
<v Speaker 1>you see this is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drugs are dangerous.</v>

3499
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:26.703
<v Speaker 1>Some people it hits them this way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever host of factors are these </v>

3500
02:26:32.261 --> 02:26:33.340
<v Speaker 1>got it bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3501
02:26:33.341 --> 02:26:34.174
<v Speaker 1>We love already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone on the outside seeing that </v>

3502
02:26:36.251 --> 02:26:37.084
<v Speaker 1>could be like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that now is a thought in their head </v>

3503
02:26:40.450 --> 02:26:42.310
<v Speaker 1>if somebody offers them those same </v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks,</v>

3504
02:26:42.330 --> 02:26:42.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3505
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't need to make my life hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit rock bottom.</v>

3506
02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:48.933
<v Speaker 1>I can look at this guy or that guy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe someone in the neighborhood or </v>

3507
02:26:52.181 --> 02:26:54.250
<v Speaker 1>people around you that don't get their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit together.</v>

3508
02:26:54.370 --> 02:26:55.203
<v Speaker 1>You could see what happens when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't chase their dreams and follow </v>

3509
02:26:57.971 --> 02:26:59.260
<v Speaker 1>their ambitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

3510
02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:00.993
<v Speaker 1>They don't take the time to let the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people around them know that they loved </v>

3511
02:27:04.571 --> 02:27:05.404
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do those things and you get </v>

3512
02:27:06.131 --> 02:27:06.964
<v Speaker 1>to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a little bit of your own </v>

3513
02:27:08.441 --> 02:27:10.570
<v Speaker 1>education too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not ideal.</v>

3514
02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:11.523
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideal would be everybody is doing great </v>

3515
02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:17.500
<v Speaker 1>and we would all have this big old </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking happy community,</v>

3516
02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some education comes from that.</v>

3517
02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:22.210
<v Speaker 1>You get education from that and also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you start to,</v>

3518
02:27:22.211 --> 02:27:26.460
<v Speaker 1>even specifically with already lang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever think that when that started</v>

3519
02:27:26.461 --> 02:27:29.290
<v Speaker 1>to become such a big part of his life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I like,</v>

3520
02:27:29.291 --> 02:27:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I've worried that that I wonder will it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he,</v>

3521
02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:34.113
<v Speaker 1>is he going to fault her with drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff because it keeps his name in </v>

3522
02:27:38.231 --> 02:27:39.070
<v Speaker 1>people's minds?</v>

3523
02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:40.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3524
02:27:40.430 --> 02:27:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think people was,</v>

3525
02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:46.840
<v Speaker 1>he was always a successful guy anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I met him,</v>

3526
02:27:46.841 --> 02:27:47.674
<v Speaker 1>he was on mad TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him in 1994 the same time I met </v>

3527
02:27:50.411 --> 02:27:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Collin I became friends with already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a scene together where I played a</v>

3528
02:27:54.551 --> 02:27:59.050
<v Speaker 1>boxer and he was a boxing manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know that.</v>

3529
02:27:59.051 --> 02:28:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he did that Shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

3530
02:28:01.361 --> 02:28:03.820
<v Speaker 1>It's probably online somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wow.</v>

3531
02:28:03.821 --> 02:28:05.770
<v Speaker 1>He looks so young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3532
02:28:06.430 --> 02:28:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I think I was 27.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3533

3557
02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Did you know you were going to lose your</v>
<v Speaker 3>hair?</v>

3558
02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3559
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:09.200
<v Speaker 3>It's weird seeing my body would know </v>
<v Speaker 3>tattoos too.</v>

3560
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

3561
02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I bet that wasn't even like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>weightlifting days.</v>

3562
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:16.340
<v Speaker 3>That was all martial arts days.</v>

3563
02:29:16.460 --> 02:29:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Dang Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strange.</v>

3564
02:29:20.970 --> 02:29:21.803
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time I ever heard it already </v>

3565
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:25.430
<v Speaker 3>was just through a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe my perception of that is that,</v>

3566
02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well already,</v>

3567
02:29:27.741 --> 02:29:29.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3568
02:29:29.691 --> 02:29:31.820
<v Speaker 3>he was a very successful comedian for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

3569
02:29:31.821 --> 02:29:35.780
<v Speaker 3>from the Howard stern show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from doing dirty work that norm McDonald</v>

<v Speaker 3>movie and a bunch of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mad tv,</v>

3571
02:29:38.541 --> 02:29:39.374
<v Speaker 3>so many different things that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was always very successful and very </v>

3572
02:29:41.631 --> 02:29:44.330
<v Speaker 3>well liked in the comedy world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't like,</v>

3573
02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:46.820
<v Speaker 3>like if someone says fuck already line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

3574
02:29:46.821 --> 02:29:48.550
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>

3575
02:29:48.551 --> 02:29:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Fuck are you what you don't like rd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3576
02:29:51.621 --> 02:29:53.570
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the nicest guy ever.</v>

3577
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:55.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3578
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:59.240
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to see it go down like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3579
02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:01.340
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you learn from it.</v>

3580
02:30:01.341 --> 02:30:02.174
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other people learn from the people do </v>

3581
02:30:02.841 --> 02:30:03.410
<v Speaker 3>learn from it.</v>

3582
02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Other people learn from all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that people do wrong.</v>

3583
02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:09.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want those things to happen.</v>

3584
02:30:09.051 --> 02:30:11.150
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're educational for all of us.</v>

3585
02:30:11.151 --> 02:30:14.360
<v Speaker 3>We're all in this constant state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolving this,</v>

3586
02:30:14.361 --> 02:30:18.890
<v Speaker 3>this culture that we're in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The civilization is rapidly changing.</v>

3587
02:30:18.891 --> 02:30:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Everything is shifting and moving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing.</v>

3588
02:30:21.620 --> 02:30:23.810
<v Speaker 3>It's out of control man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really is.</v>

3589
02:30:23.930 --> 02:30:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I went to a lot of elements even like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3590
02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to when you and Bill </v>
<v Speaker 3>Berg were talking last time,</v>

3591
02:30:29.181 --> 02:30:31.310
<v Speaker 3>he's done what he's talking about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>flying around and stuff like that.</v>

3592
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:33.620
<v Speaker 3>And then he was talking about doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy special and he's like,</v>

3593
02:30:33.621 --> 02:30:35.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what to do with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>these days.</v>

3594
02:30:35.151 --> 02:30:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Do I just do clips?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I put it like,</v>

3595
02:30:37.930 --> 02:30:39.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things just change so fast.</v>

3596
02:30:39.621 --> 02:30:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like a year ago or two years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been like,</v>

3597
02:30:41.511 --> 02:30:42.940
<v Speaker 3>oh this is exactly what you do.</v>

3598
02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Make a special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3599
02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:46.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like do I well used to be,</v>

3600
02:30:46.371 --> 02:30:47.970
<v Speaker 3>you didn't have an option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3601
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:51.350
<v Speaker 3>the first guy who actually introduced it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an option was Louie,</v>

3602
02:30:51.650 --> 02:30:55.580
<v Speaker 3>cause Louis decided to put a special on </v>
<v Speaker 3>his website and you buy it for like five</v>

3603
02:30:55.581 --> 02:30:56.414
<v Speaker 3>bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a really reasonable amount and </v>

3604
02:30:58.791 --> 02:31:01.100
<v Speaker 3>it was a really good special and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

3605
02:31:01.130 --> 02:31:02.780
<v Speaker 3>He made a shit ton of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3606
02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:03.793
<v Speaker 3>And then people realized that he made a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit ton of money and then people </v>

3607
02:31:06.501 --> 02:31:07.334
<v Speaker 3>realize how good he was and then people </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize how famous he really actually </v>

3608
02:31:09.591 --> 02:31:10.424
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then everything started booming and </v>

3609
02:31:11.601 --> 02:31:12.434
<v Speaker 3>taking off for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was already in the process of </v>

3610
02:31:14.031 --> 02:31:16.040
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it happened even more because he did</v>

3611
02:31:16.041 --> 02:31:18.470
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then Netflix came along,</v>

3612
02:31:18.530 --> 02:31:20.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the ideal.</v>

3613
02:31:20.490 --> 02:31:23.490
<v Speaker 1>They shook it as nothing better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation,</v>

3614
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:25.320
<v Speaker 1>that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just set it up.</v>

3615
02:31:25.321 --> 02:31:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So they put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3616
02:31:26.491 --> 02:31:30.420
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a fucking trillion dollars.</v>

3617
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:33.360
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get all the greats,</v>

3618
02:31:33.390 --> 02:31:35.550
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get Chappelle and Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock.</v>

3619
02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Everybody fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sebastian,</v>

3620
02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:39.350
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Burr.</v>

3621
02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:43.440
<v Speaker 1>They're going to just crush it and keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing it.</v>

3622
02:31:44.250 --> 02:31:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3623
02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:46.373
<v Speaker 1>anything else now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if someone has a special on comedy </v>

3624
02:31:48.391 --> 02:31:49.710
<v Speaker 1>central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

3625
02:31:49.711 --> 02:31:52.890
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess a netflix wouldn't hook him up.</v>

3626
02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:54.113
<v Speaker 1>You got to go to comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you look at it in the comedy </v>

3627
02:31:56.401 --> 02:31:57.280
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3628
02:31:57.870 --> 02:32:02.490
<v Speaker 1>But I think I'm a real player is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be Amazon because a,</v>

3629
02:32:02.491 --> 02:32:06.120
<v Speaker 1>this Amazon show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marvelous Mrs Maizel people love it.</v>

3630
02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:08.540
<v Speaker 1>It is fucking good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3631
02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:10.770
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a comic,</v>

3632
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I watch it.</v>

3633
02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:12.473
<v Speaker 1>I get nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get anxiety when she's about to go on </v>

3634
02:32:15.411 --> 02:32:16.980
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch it,</v>

3635
02:32:17.010 --> 02:32:18.750
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking good.</v>

3636
02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:22.650
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who plays Lenny Bruce kills it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills it.</v>

3637
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:26.430
<v Speaker 1>He seems like a less seedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less problematic.</v>

3638
02:32:26.431 --> 02:32:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he seems a lot like Lenny Bruce.</v>

3639
02:32:28.921 --> 02:32:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3640
02:32:29.580 --> 02:32:30.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only do so much with it.</v>

3641
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:33.840
<v Speaker 1>He's written in as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a,</v>

3642
02:32:33.930 --> 02:32:38.400
<v Speaker 1>someone who helps the marvelous Mrs </v>
<v Speaker 1>may's Linny CD was lenny bruce cd man.</v>

3643
02:32:38.490 --> 02:32:39.181
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3644
02:32:39.181 --> 02:32:40.014
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3645
02:32:40.350 --> 02:32:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't see the guy.</v>

3646
02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:45.900
<v Speaker 1>This is just the way it's written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like a guy who died of a</v>

3647
02:32:45.901 --> 02:32:47.190
<v Speaker 1>heroin overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3648
02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:48.393
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3649
02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:51.210
<v Speaker 1>He seems like more together and the TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

3650
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.903
<v Speaker 1>So mostly it seems like in the sheet tv </v>
<v Speaker 1>show he seems like a victim of the </v>

3651
02:32:55.890 --> 02:32:59.250
<v Speaker 1>censorship of the circumstances involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that point in time.</v>

3652
02:33:00.030 --> 02:33:03.210
<v Speaker 1>More like in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he went mad,</v>

3653
02:33:03.330 --> 02:33:05.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever see any of the ancient,</v>

3654
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:06.623
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I noticed when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I really started getting into </v>

3655
02:33:08.701 --> 02:33:09.660
<v Speaker 1>standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to start,</v>

3656
02:33:09.900 --> 02:33:10.733
<v Speaker 1>I would watch some of the old stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've found is </v>

3657
02:33:13.321 --> 02:33:16.350
<v Speaker 1>that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I bought it as a vhs,</v>

3658
02:33:16.351 --> 02:33:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was online.</v>

3659
02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it was way before youtube and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff was available online.</v>

3660
02:33:22.201 --> 02:33:23.034
<v Speaker 1>You could get old performances and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched Lenny Bruce and this videotape </v>

3661
02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:29.880
<v Speaker 1>that I bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically they're filming him going</v>

3662
02:33:29.881 --> 02:33:33.420
<v Speaker 1>over his court case in front of a group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

3663
02:33:34.410 --> 02:33:36.790
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird because he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really telling stand up,</v>

3664
02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:37.643
<v Speaker 1>he's just reading off of his court case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting and it's </v>

3665
02:33:40.651 --> 02:33:41.550
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

3666
02:33:41.580 --> 02:33:43.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's going mad.</v>

3667
02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It's going crazy because they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring them into jail.</v>

3668
02:33:45.451 --> 02:33:46.284
<v Speaker 1>They're finding him and arrested him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're locking him up in jail and </v>

3669
02:33:48.361 --> 02:33:52.200
<v Speaker 1>they're ruining his career because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>swearing onstage and what he's trying to</v>

3670
02:33:52.201 --> 02:33:53.640
<v Speaker 1>just say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3671
02:33:53.641 --> 02:33:54.474
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3672
02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to point things out that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>swearing.</v>

3673
02:33:57.030 --> 02:34:00.000
<v Speaker 1>If I say something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I say a naughty words for a reason,</v>

3674
02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:01.800
<v Speaker 1>it's to express myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3675
02:34:01.801 --> 02:34:02.634
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just just saying things because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're illegal and I want you to lock </v>

3676
02:34:05.191 --> 02:34:06.630
<v Speaker 1>me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went on trial for that.</v>

3677
02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3678
02:34:07.621 --> 02:34:10.470
<v Speaker 1>he went to jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got arrested many times.</v>

3679
02:34:10.890 --> 02:34:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Many times him and George Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3680
02:34:13.290 --> 02:34:17.710
<v Speaker 1>the reason why we can do it at the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>we do it now has a,</v>

3681
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 1>there's</v>

3682
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:18.963
<v Speaker 3>a direct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could trace the path as a direct </v>

3683
02:34:20.831 --> 02:34:24.190
<v Speaker 3>path to lenny bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lenny Bruce started it all off.</v>

3684
02:34:24.430 --> 02:34:26.140
<v Speaker 3>I had to read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do some more work.</v>

3685
02:34:26.170 --> 02:34:30.010
<v Speaker 3>He opened the door for guys like Carlin </v>
<v Speaker 3>and prior his,</v>

3686
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:32.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's mort Sahl back then too,</v>

3687
02:34:32.381 --> 02:34:37.381
<v Speaker 3>but lending in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had an irreverence to him and,</v>

3688
02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:39.430
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3689
02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:40.803
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3690
02:34:41.050 --> 02:34:41.883
<v Speaker 3>notion to buck the current yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Standard of what you could and couldn't </v>

3691
02:34:45.761 --> 02:34:47.050
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3692
02:34:47.051 --> 02:34:50.970
<v Speaker 3>he just changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He changed what comedy was brave dude.</v>

3693
02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:51.970
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3694
02:34:51.971 --> 02:34:53.560
<v Speaker 3>there's people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have these,</v>

3695
02:34:53.561 --> 02:34:57.190
<v Speaker 3>these figures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Nikola Tesla for technology</v>

3696
02:34:57.191 --> 02:34:58.630
<v Speaker 3>and innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's,</v>

3697
02:34:58.810 --> 02:34:59.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of people like that in </v>

3698
02:35:00.161 --> 02:35:01.090
<v Speaker 3>this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3699
02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:04.240
<v Speaker 3>They just change one dude's like Elon </v>
<v Speaker 3>Musk is another one,</v>

3700
02:35:04.241 --> 02:35:05.260
<v Speaker 3>one dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pow,</v>

3701
02:35:05.470 --> 02:35:06.790
<v Speaker 3>just whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>

3702
02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3703
02:35:08.501 --> 02:35:09.790
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that are like,</v>

3704
02:35:09.791 --> 02:35:13.540
<v Speaker 3>that one guy just goes off in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction and as a,</v>

3705
02:35:13.570 --> 02:35:14.403
<v Speaker 3>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if say if they went to the </v>

3706
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:18.340
<v Speaker 3>universal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3707
02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:20.380
<v Speaker 3>money for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3708
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:21.883
<v Speaker 3>You be bi or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't necessarily think it's the worst </v>

3709
02:35:24.581 --> 02:35:26.920
<v Speaker 3>thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when you have as much adversity</v>

3710
02:35:26.921 --> 02:35:28.900
<v Speaker 3>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like would you get a Nikola Tesla?</v>

3711
02:35:28.901 --> 02:35:31.420
<v Speaker 3>Would you get us George Carlin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you get people?</v>

3712
02:35:31.421 --> 02:35:32.254
<v Speaker 3>If they didn't have to look at the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're born into and see not the </v>

3713
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:40.180
<v Speaker 3>things be uneven and give spark some </v>
<v Speaker 3>desire.</v>

3714
02:35:40.181 --> 02:35:41.380
<v Speaker 3>You're not just one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if we get that,</v>

3715
02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:42.273
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you would only have your needs </v>

3716
02:35:45.041 --> 02:35:47.350
<v Speaker 3>met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you would still have your desire</v>

3717
02:35:47.351 --> 02:35:49.330
<v Speaker 3>to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's an inherent thing,</v>

3718
02:35:49.570 --> 02:35:54.100
<v Speaker 3>but I think it would be more beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just a wild guess.</v>

3719
02:35:54.101 --> 02:35:56.710
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be totally wrong,</v>

3720
02:35:56.711 --> 02:35:57.520
<v Speaker 3>and it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might,</v>

3721
02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:00.070
<v Speaker 3>you might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might ruin people's ambition,</v>

3722
02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 3>but it might raise the base level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3723
02:36:03.101 --> 02:36:03.934
<v Speaker 3>So what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're operating from is never the </v>

3724
02:36:05.531 --> 02:36:06.820
<v Speaker 3>same level of desperation.</v>

3725
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:08.200
<v Speaker 3>So maybe we're not as mean to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

3726
02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:09.063
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But maybe the innovation still takes </v>

3727
02:36:10.721 --> 02:36:13.840
<v Speaker 3>place because people are always going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be challenged and maybe it's,</v>

3728
02:36:14.050 --> 02:36:15.640
<v Speaker 3>it comes from a good place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3729
02:36:15.641 --> 02:36:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Instead of from this constant place of </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperation,</v>

3730
02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:19.953
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So somebody goes from a zero to a 10 in </v>

3731
02:36:21.101 --> 02:36:22.120
<v Speaker 3>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would it be,</v>

3732
02:36:22.121 --> 02:36:22.954
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody that does something unique and </v>

3733
02:36:23.891 --> 02:36:24.724
<v Speaker 3>special in outstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If everybody are all automatically has </v>

3734
02:36:27.011 --> 02:36:27.844
<v Speaker 3>given a three their base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then now that person's going to get us </v>

3735
02:36:29.861 --> 02:36:34.330
<v Speaker 3>to a 13 or maybe you just don't have as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much violence.</v>

3736
02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:37.570
<v Speaker 3>You don't have as much sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's true because people,</v>

3737
02:36:37.571 --> 02:36:38.404
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are violent when they see they </v>

3738
02:36:39.671 --> 02:36:41.180
<v Speaker 3>want stuff from other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your,</v>

3739
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:42.403
<v Speaker 3>if your food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your food and your shelter is always </v>

3740
02:36:44.921 --> 02:36:47.410
<v Speaker 3>met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we don't have that.</v>

3741
02:36:47.411 --> 02:36:48.244
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've talked about earlier about </v>

3742
02:36:48.791 --> 02:36:52.840
<v Speaker 3>like cultures have standards and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>standards there are different everywhere</v>

3743
02:36:52.841 --> 02:36:53.674
<v Speaker 3>and those communities except them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like it when you try to </v>

3744
02:36:55.601 --> 02:36:56.434
<v Speaker 3>change the standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If our standards here where that all of </v>

3745
02:36:59.771 --> 02:37:01.020
<v Speaker 3>our needs are met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just,</v>

3746
02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:01.893
<v Speaker 3>we decide as a community if we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stick together and call ourselves </v>

3747
02:37:04.241 --> 02:37:06.100
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should treat ourselves as a family.</v>

3748
02:37:06.430 --> 02:37:08.950
<v Speaker 3>We treat ourselves as a family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't ignore neighborhoods.</v>

3749
02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:12.670
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't ignore communities that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>downtrodden.</v>

3750
02:37:12.671 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't ignore any kind of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't ignore a lack</v>

3751
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.010
<v Speaker 1>of education or lack of nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't ignore those things.</v>

3752
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:20.083
<v Speaker 1>So if we take care of all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things first before we do </v>

3753
02:37:23.811 --> 02:37:26.300
<v Speaker 1>anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've yet to reengineer America.</v>

3754
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Would you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3755
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.903
<v Speaker 1>well we have to do is ramp up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military budget by $94 billion because </v>

3756
02:37:31.761 --> 02:37:35.390
<v Speaker 1>we're basically arms dealers and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make these deals with Syria and</v>

3757
02:37:35.391 --> 02:37:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia or wherever the fuck we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could sell rockets too.</v>

3758
02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:38.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3759
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:41.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we did is what we do.</v>

3760
02:37:41.181 --> 02:37:43.700
<v Speaker 1>But if instead someone came along and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

3761
02:37:43.701 --> 02:37:45.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to make this country stronger is</v>

3762
02:37:45.391 --> 02:37:48.920
<v Speaker 1>not make the arms industry bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way to make this country stronger is</v>

3763
02:37:48.921 --> 02:37:50.930
<v Speaker 1>to make the human industry better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3764
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

3765
02:37:52.341 --> 02:37:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Tune humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

3766
02:37:53.410 --> 02:37:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Tuna has done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less losers.</v>

3767
02:37:56.290 --> 02:37:57.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2024 I liked Diovan Front for president </v>

3768
02:37:59.450 --> 02:38:00.980
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the best.</v>

3769
02:38:00.981 --> 02:38:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll be your vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Pence.</v>

3770
02:38:02.511 --> 02:38:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that man.</v>

3771
02:38:04.011 --> 02:38:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Hang back and eat chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

3772
02:38:05.481 --> 02:38:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And all of the weird hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta pee so bad.</v>

3773
02:38:09.381 --> 02:38:09.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that.</v>

3774
02:38:09.711 --> 02:38:11.210
<v Speaker 1>It kept us in your name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

3775
02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:12.093
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say we're probably almost done </v>

3776
02:38:12.561 --> 02:38:13.640
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already three o'clock.</v>

3777
02:38:13.641 --> 02:38:14.474
<v Speaker 1>Go Pee.</v>

3778
02:38:14.820 --> 02:38:16.300
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Infographic on it.</v>

3779
02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:18.220
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the UBI,</v>

3780
02:38:18.221 --> 02:38:19.054
<v Speaker 4>it's because there are the argument for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the positive or wanting it is a lot of </v>

3781
02:38:22.031 --> 02:38:23.740
<v Speaker 4>jobs are going to be replaced by robots </v>
<v Speaker 4>soon,</v>

3782
02:38:23.770 --> 02:38:24.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3783
02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:26.800
<v Speaker 4>These are some of the jobs there that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are at risk.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been sidelined.</v>

<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What drives 50 burgers an hour.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>

3813
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:37.820
<v Speaker 1>It's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better than you.</v>

3814
02:39:37.821 --> 02:39:38.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to work that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3815
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's suck at that job.</v>

3816
02:39:40.970 --> 02:39:42.590
<v Speaker 1>If we can find some other things for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do,</v>

3817
02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.140
<v Speaker 1>but you know I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good at a couple of things.</v>

3818

3820
02:39:50.241 --> 02:39:52.010
<v Speaker 1>flip burgers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even need a mind.</v>

3821
02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Why not leave the mindless things to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with no mind.</v>

3822
02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:56.173
<v Speaker 1>So this is the idea behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is where's the money </v>

3823
02:39:57.801 --> 02:40:01.520
<v Speaker 1>come to take care of all the people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universal basic income.</v>

3824
02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And Are you saving enough money with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>robots to make it actually profitable to</v>

3825
02:40:07.071 --> 02:40:08.480
<v Speaker 1>pay for people hard on it</v>

3848
02:41:04.921 --> 02:41:07.590
<v Speaker 2>no wonder swamp thing happened while I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was thinking this,</v>

3849
02:41:07.591 --> 02:41:08.424
<v Speaker 2>once they found out that in some plants </v>
<v Speaker 2>some plants contain DNA from salmon </v>

3850
02:41:14.190 --> 02:41:18.690
<v Speaker 2>because the salmon were used as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fertilizer by the plant.</v>

3851
02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:19.913
<v Speaker 2>As it decomposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got into the actual plant itself and </v>

3852
02:41:22.351 --> 02:41:23.184
<v Speaker 2>you can actually somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>through some certain scientific process </v>

3853
02:41:25.651 --> 02:41:26.484
<v Speaker 2>that I'm too stupid to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can actually detect salmon in the </v>

3854
02:41:29.551 --> 02:41:31.680
<v Speaker 2>actual plant itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're close.</v>

3855
02:41:31.681 --> 02:41:34.500
<v Speaker 2>So if you were whacking off on that tree</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that tree,</v>

<v Speaker 2>whacked off on the roots and then like </v>

3858
02:41:40.970 --> 02:41:45.000
<v Speaker 2>after a while he did an analysis and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>found in your DNA,</v>

3859
02:41:45.030 --> 02:41:47.400
<v Speaker 2>in the tree itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>

02:48:29.810 --> 02:48:31.460
<v Speaker 2>but I like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not turn off.</v>

4029
02:48:31.490 --> 02:48:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I want to ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want that dream bus that used to get</v>

4030
02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:42.400
<v Speaker 2>super bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Khafra Dude,</v>

4031
02:48:42.401 --> 02:48:43.234
<v Speaker 2>I want that dream bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember we knew would bust in a dream </v>

4032
02:48:45.430 --> 02:48:48.940
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] those don't happen anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can if you search for it,</v>

4033
02:48:48.941 --> 02:48:50.050
<v Speaker 2>if you seek it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4034
02:48:50.051 --> 02:48:52.240
<v Speaker 2>but you have to not beat off for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

4035
02:48:52.241 --> 02:48:53.074
<v Speaker 2>To the point we bought it bodies like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this dumb mother fucker can't even jerk </v>

4036
02:48:55.811 --> 02:48:56.644
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to have to jerk off for </v>

4037
02:48:57.911 --> 02:48:59.110
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unconscious.</v>

4038
02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Your brain fucking church you all asleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

4039
02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:05.710
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that you're learning things</v>

4040
02:49:05.711 --> 02:49:06.544
<v Speaker 2>while you're dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because some people you'd learn things </v>

4041
02:49:07.921 --> 02:49:08.754
<v Speaker 2>when new treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that'll be one of the next </v>

4042
02:49:09.781 --> 02:49:11.880
<v Speaker 2>hurdles that we get over where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are able to,</v>

4043
02:49:11.881 --> 02:49:12.714
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to take in information while </v>

4044
02:49:15.421 --> 02:49:16.920
<v Speaker 2>they're asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I mean.</v>

4045
02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Like they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a problem,</v>

4046
02:49:19.130 --> 02:49:21.300
<v Speaker 2>something's bothering you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should sleep on it.</v>

4047
02:49:21.570 --> 02:49:24.240
<v Speaker 2>And when you wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have a clear perspective.</v>

4048
02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4049
02:49:25.531 --> 02:49:26.364
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's real because I've done </v>

4050
02:49:28.651 --> 02:49:29.484
<v Speaker 2>that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to actually be a good </v>

4051
02:49:30.781 --> 02:49:32.550
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can go to sleep.</v>

4052
02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:34.460
<v Speaker 2>The problem is if something's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>bothering you,</v>

4053
02:49:34.490 --> 02:49:35.700
<v Speaker 2>like damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to figure this out.</v>

4054
02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Like you might stay up all night and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhausted and then you might not be able</v>

4055
02:49:38.911 --> 02:49:41.760
<v Speaker 2>to sleep and think through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get a higher power to help</v>

4056
02:49:41.761 --> 02:49:42.530
<v Speaker 2>you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4057
02:49:42.530 --> 02:49:43.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got to get you just kind of case </v>

4058
02:49:44.190 --> 02:49:47.340
<v Speaker 2>where a higher power comes into place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you see yourself ever going</v>

4059
02:49:47.341 --> 02:49:48.780
<v Speaker 2>to church again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4060
02:49:48.781 --> 02:49:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

4061
02:49:49.681 --> 02:49:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Church is kind of evolving over our time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

4062
02:49:52.921 --> 02:49:55.560
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you go to Justin Bieber's preacher</v>

02:52:41.381 --> 02:52:41.891
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4129
02:52:41.891 --> 02:52:45.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't even believe he's healer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once you got to know him as an adult</v>

4130
02:52:45.111 --> 02:52:46.930
<v Speaker 3>and mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a famous always been cool.</v>

4131
02:52:46.950 --> 02:52:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4132
02:52:48.220 --> 02:52:49.750
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I just need to have a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience with him.</v>

4133
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.640
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4134
02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:51.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's crazy.</v>

4136
02:52:53.140 --> 02:52:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Like half of his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go to his instagram page,</v>

4137
02:52:56.050 --> 02:52:58.690
<v Speaker 3>half of it as like a put on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's always fucking around.</v>

4138
02:52:58.720 --> 02:53:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always be in funny.</v>

4139
02:53:00.490 --> 02:53:01.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

4140
02:53:01.420 --> 02:53:04.060
<v Speaker 3>But he gave me very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the reason why I started touring.</v>

4141
02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:06.800
<v Speaker 3>He gave me very good advice and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4142
02:53:06.801 --> 02:53:08.410
<v Speaker 3>it's was like in the 90s man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

4143
02:53:08.411 --> 02:53:10.570
<v Speaker 3>you should go fucking tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

4144
02:53:10.571 --> 02:53:11.500
<v Speaker 3>you're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

4145
02:53:11.501 --> 02:53:13.180
<v Speaker 3>you won't want to hang around here all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

4146
02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4147
02:53:13.540 --> 02:53:14.171
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4148
02:53:14.171 --> 02:53:15.004
<v Speaker 3>he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hang around here like I </v>

4149
02:53:16.151 --> 02:53:17.980
<v Speaker 3>should do clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should make a living.</v>

4150
02:53:18.360 --> 02:53:19.840
<v Speaker 3>And this is what he was basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

4151
02:53:19.841 --> 02:53:20.674
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get roped into only working in </v>

4152
02:53:24.461 --> 02:53:28.090
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood doing television shows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that because then these other</v>

4153
02:53:28.091 --> 02:53:29.230
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you control your destiny.</v>

4154
02:53:29.260 --> 02:53:32.800
<v Speaker 3>You could tour and this is from him </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously coming out of,</v>

4155
02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:38.350
<v Speaker 3>he had the most insane epic success of </v>
<v Speaker 3>any comedian ever.</v>

4156
02:53:38.410 --> 02:53:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a rocket ship.</v>

4157
02:53:39.550 --> 02:53:42.490
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had sold out hundreds of arenas,</v>

4158
02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:44.470
<v Speaker 3>arenas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant ass places.</v>

4159
02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are everyone is DVD or his seat,</v>

4160
02:53:46.151 --> 02:53:48.100
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hit the neighborhood and whenever all</v>

4161
02:53:48.101 --> 02:53:50.380
<v Speaker 3>the kids were watching it and haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even allowed to watch it.</v>

4162
02:53:50.560 --> 02:53:52.780
<v Speaker 3>So I thought when I was listening to him</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>

4163
02:53:52.781 --> 02:53:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

4164
02:53:53.801 --> 02:53:54.634
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy probably made more money </v>

4165
02:53:56.621 --> 02:53:59.460
<v Speaker 3>than anybody ever did on a sitcom ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>Malia.</v>

4166
02:53:59.530 --> 02:54:01.870
<v Speaker 3>And he did it just doing whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you wanted to do.</v>

4167
02:54:01.871 --> 02:54:02.830
<v Speaker 3>And he was basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4168
02:54:02.831 --> 02:54:05.710
<v Speaker 3>don't get wrapped up in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only you could tour.</v>

4169
02:54:05.740 --> 02:54:07.150
<v Speaker 3>You can make money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4170
02:54:07.151 --> 02:54:09.010
<v Speaker 3>even if I never made money the way he </v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

4171
02:54:09.011 --> 02:54:09.844
<v Speaker 3>you could still make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you don't tour and you just </v>

4172
02:54:12.371 --> 02:54:17.050
<v Speaker 3>do sitcoms or just work in television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you work as a writer,</v>

4173
02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:18.213
<v Speaker 3>that's the dark path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great standup comic that becomes a </v>

4174
02:54:21.941 --> 02:54:25.390
<v Speaker 3>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never tour and they never develop a</v>

4175
02:54:25.391 --> 02:54:27.370
<v Speaker 3>crowd and they never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that happen.</v>

4176
02:54:27.430 --> 02:54:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens a lot.</v>

4177
02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:31.420
<v Speaker 3>But why warrant they to supposed to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>writer then?</v>

4178
02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:31.901
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4179
02:54:31.901 --> 02:54:32.381
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4180
02:54:32.381 --> 02:54:32.850
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4181
02:54:32.850 --> 02:54:33.683
<v Speaker 3>And they gave in to the writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could have when we know great </v>

4182
02:54:36.821 --> 02:54:37.654
<v Speaker 3>comedians who mostly work as writers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense when they </v>

4183
02:54:40.541 --> 02:54:41.374
<v Speaker 3>don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to be a comic out there </v>

4184
02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:49.110
<v Speaker 3>performing and the level of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>material is far better than the level of</v>

4185
02:54:50.411 --> 02:54:52.390
<v Speaker 3>their notoriety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4186
02:54:52.450 --> 02:54:53.320
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4187
02:54:53.321 --> 02:54:54.061
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4188
02:54:54.061 --> 02:54:56.170
<v Speaker 3>and Smith is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4189
02:54:56.171 --> 02:54:57.610
<v Speaker 3>and Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

4190
02:54:57.790 --> 02:55:00.040
<v Speaker 3>is one of the best comedians on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

4191
02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:04.580
<v Speaker 3>He's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dude makes me cry funny and he's so</v>

4192
02:55:04.610 --> 02:55:06.560
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His timing,</v>

4193
02:55:06.561 --> 02:55:11.561
<v Speaker 2>his stage presence is delivery is </v>
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>

4194
02:55:12.021 --> 02:55:15.620
<v Speaker 2>The subject matter's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's top shelf comedy.</v>

4195
02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most people don't know who he is.</v>

4196
02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's because he's made,</v>

4197
02:55:19.090 --> 02:55:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's made a great living as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>writer,</v>

4198
02:55:20.931 --> 02:55:23.630
<v Speaker 2>but he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should,</v>

4199
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:24.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should be recognized as a comic as </v>

4200
02:55:26.181 --> 02:55:27.110
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4201
02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:28.573
<v Speaker 2>That's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what dice was telling me </v>

4202
02:55:31.011 --> 02:55:32.720
<v Speaker 2>back then was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out,</v>

4203
02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:33.980
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go someplace,</v>

4204
02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:36.140
<v Speaker 2>go do the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do comedy out there.</v>

4205
02:55:36.141 --> 02:55:38.960
<v Speaker 2>You could headline clubs on gratefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4206
02:55:38.961 --> 02:55:39.794
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad he did that because if we'd </v>

4207
02:55:41.121 --> 02:55:44.630
<v Speaker 2>wait and get you that you might not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same comedian if he didn't say that.</v>

4208
02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

4209
02:55:46.610 --> 02:55:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4210
02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:48.793
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>

4211
02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Like it's easy to just decide someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an asshole or you know,</v>

4212
02:55:53.180 --> 02:55:55.820
<v Speaker 2>if one interaction with someone you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shit on them.</v>

4213
02:55:56.060 --> 02:55:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I just think you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm trying to do this myself.</v>

4214
02:55:59.750 --> 02:56:02.360
<v Speaker 2>It'd be very careful when you shit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

4215
02:56:02.810 --> 02:56:06.440
<v Speaker 2>When is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when is it valid and when is it just you</v>

4216
02:56:06.441 --> 02:56:08.100
<v Speaker 2>looking for something to shit on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4217
02:56:08.310 --> 02:56:10.500
<v Speaker 2>When are you showing no empathy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4218
02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:12.410
<v Speaker 2>What is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4219
02:56:12.411 --> 02:56:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4220
02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:13.611
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

4221
02:56:13.611 --> 02:56:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to have a new,</v>

4222
02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:17.180
<v Speaker 2>a new experience too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked up.</v>

4223
02:56:17.181 --> 02:56:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said his name.</v>

4224
02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:19.610
<v Speaker 2>He said move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>

4225
02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't care about that.</v>

4226
02:56:21.530 --> 02:56:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's going to get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

4227
02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:27.800
<v Speaker 2>he was an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's okay if I,</v>

4228
02:56:27.801 --> 02:56:29.160
<v Speaker 2>if uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4229
02:56:29.161 --> 02:56:30.170
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept</v>

4230
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:33.530
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was on stage before me,</v>

4231
02:56:33.531 --> 02:56:35.810
<v Speaker 2>so I was going to go up after him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was probably joking around,</v>

4232
02:56:35.811 --> 02:56:36.381
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4233
02:56:36.381 --> 02:56:39.080
<v Speaker 2>But at a certain point it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4234
02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:40.453
<v Speaker 2>it was just rude.</v>

4235
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:42.583
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like he kept not getting it </v>

4236
02:56:43.911 --> 02:56:44.930
<v Speaker 2>and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4237
02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:46.040
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4238
02:56:46.041 --> 02:56:49.160
<v Speaker 2>is this like it at a certain point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it was just rude.</v>

4239
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.983
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you were probably a little bit </v>

4240
02:56:53.661 --> 02:56:54.494
<v Speaker 2>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going on after him and then he's </v>

4241
02:56:57.471 --> 02:56:59.180
<v Speaker 2>not saying your name right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like,</v>

4242
02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:00.620
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know who I am.</v>

4243
02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:03.560
<v Speaker 2>So this is kind of disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could have been,</v>

4244
02:57:03.561 --> 02:57:04.221
<v Speaker 2>there could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4245
02:57:04.221 --> 02:57:05.054
<v Speaker 2>I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that certainly could have been my part </v>

4246
02:57:06.151 --> 02:57:06.984
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could admit and ego and it Bundy </v>

4247
02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:10.030
<v Speaker 2>9.9% fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4248
02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:12.830
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe what he would do that if it was,</v>

4249
02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:14.510
<v Speaker 2>if he knew you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4250
02:57:14.690 --> 02:57:15.523
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4253
02:57:20.690 --> 02:57:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of who he is.</v>

4254

4255
02:57:24.711 --> 02:57:26.570
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to get to know him better.</v>

02:57:28.791 --> 02:57:29.624

<v Speaker 2>I loved watching him at Mitzi shores </v>

4258
02:57:32.150 --> 02:57:36.920
<v Speaker 2>when he performed at the Mitzi shores </v>
<v Speaker 2>reunion or deaths party.</v>

4259
02:57:37.250 --> 02:57:39.920

<v Speaker 2>I got to see him live when he was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>old and sick,</v>

4266
02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:57.500
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

03:00:37.501 --> 03:00:40.080
<v Speaker 2>look at your watch or your phone during </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you're still coming.</v>

4327
03:00:40.081 --> 03:00:43.410
<v Speaker 2>When you look back at your day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be the mascot of loads.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bank probably zero but dancing prodigy.</v>

4332
03:00:56.510 --> 03:00:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Like he's the Michael Jackson of dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4333
03:00:59.320 --> 03:01:01.000
<v Speaker 2>but you don't come much when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing all that.</v>

4334
03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:05.440
<v Speaker 2>What activities do you think you do when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come?</v>

4335
03:01:05.441 --> 03:01:06.274
<v Speaker 2>A lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the kind of people that like power </v>

4336
03:01:08.321 --> 03:01:10.150
<v Speaker 2>lifters probably shoot giant loads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4337
03:01:10.510 --> 03:01:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I think you would think they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for their size and stuff,</v>

4338
03:01:13.211 --> 03:01:15.820
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's the biggest loads.</v>

4339
03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a guy that's in space,</v>

4340
03:01:17.650 --> 03:01:21.310
<v Speaker 2>I think a guy that's on a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a cliff climber.</v>

4341
03:01:22.810 --> 03:01:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that the biggest loads?</v>

4342
03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:25.293
<v Speaker 2>I mean that guy shooting some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>just cause he has the balls to climb up </v>

4343
03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:30.490
<v Speaker 2>that he's busted somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what it is.</v>

4344
03:01:30.491 --> 03:01:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got balls,</v>

4345
03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:32.583
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys shoot bigger loads like bmx </v>

4346
03:01:34.931 --> 03:01:37.180
<v Speaker 2>jumpers and they jumped three times in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the air and then land on the bike.</v>

4347
03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they have the biggest loads.</v>

4348
03:01:39.430 --> 03:01:40.263
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also guys who like fake put a sign on </v>

4349
03:01:42.881 --> 03:01:43.714
<v Speaker 2>their car and they don't pay a meter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like meters broken that he's put </v>

4350
03:01:45.431 --> 03:01:47.620
<v Speaker 2>that on their car and if I can still </v>
<v Speaker 2>park there,</v>

<v Speaker 2>those dudes bust some of the loads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

4352
03:01:51.940 --> 03:01:54.280

<v Speaker 2>like pickpockets.</v>

4353
03:01:54.580 --> 03:01:55.413
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were up turtlenecks do not </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not very manly.</v>
