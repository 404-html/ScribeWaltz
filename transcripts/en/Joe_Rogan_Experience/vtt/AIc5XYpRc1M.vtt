<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

13
00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:33.931
<v Speaker 2>to say that you've had a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience in this life is one of the</v>

14
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 2>most understated things a person could</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever say.</v>

15
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 2>where do we begin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

17
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Let's tell everybody your store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were wrongfully committed of</v>

18
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:50.141
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You spent 22 years on death row before</v>

19
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you were exonerated by DNA evidence.</v>

20
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My name is Nick Harris and I was X.</v>

22
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Joe said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>convicted and sentenced to die for rape</v>

23
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 3>and murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't commit at the age of 21 in 1981</v>

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 3>of woman named</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs. Craig was murdered in Delaware.</v>

25
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 3>I have never met the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in prison on unrelated charges and</v>

26
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 3>I stupidly made up a story to try and</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of those charges.</v>

27
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 3>The police soon feel realized that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a liar and they fabricated the charges</v>

28
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 3>around me then so it's ironic than in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few days you're going to upper darby,</v>

29
00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's where the murder happened.</v>

30
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>

31
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 3>and Linda May,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Craig was leaving her job at 4:05 PM on</v>

32
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 3>December 15th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1981 she's going home.</v>

33
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 3>She gets abducted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know any of this,</v>

34
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 3>but I tried in desperation to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lie that this officer put on me.</v>

35
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got pulled over in a stolen car.</v>

36
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 3>The cop beats me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He puts charges on me.</v>

37
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm facing life imprisonment and I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>junkie because all of my life I was</v>

38
00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:03.260
<v Speaker 3>destroyed by what happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the age of seven I had my head beaten</v>

39
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:08.261
<v Speaker 3>him by a man with a rock in his hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>after he sexually assaulted me and I did</v>

40
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 3>all the stupid things that people can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the aftermath.</v>

41
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I kept it a secret and I let it foster</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the anger in me.</v>

42
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 3>I became very aggressive as a child and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up in trouble all the time.</v>

43
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 3>And when I was in prison on these</v>
<v Speaker 3>unrelated charges to the murder,</v>

44
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 3>I stupidly fell into that mindset of</v>
<v Speaker 3>desperation of trying to get out of it.</v>

45
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 3>So the police put a prisoner in the cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>next to me.</v>

46
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I confess to him,</v>

47
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 3>I was given a three day trial.</v>

48
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 3>I was sentenced to death and put on</v>
<v Speaker 3>death row.</v>

49
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 3>And then stupidly I escaped from prison</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1985 and ended up on the FBI's most</v>

50
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:51.031
<v Speaker 3>wanted list to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was being transported to court and the</v>

51
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 3>sheriffs were being cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>

52
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 3>first they were talking about what was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in Philly.</v>

53
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.940
<v Speaker 3>They were two nice like sixties</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 68 67 and we drove five</v>

54
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 3>hours from one of the hardest prisons in</v>
<v Speaker 3>America called Huntington.</v>

55
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 3>And I left there after spending two</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of my first two years in silence.</v>

56
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 3>So if you opened your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would come in and beat your head.</v>

57
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 3>And so I was so glad to get in the car</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause my mom was waiting in my lawyer's</v>

58
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 3>office cause they were gonna give me a</v>
<v Speaker 3>review of my trial because they withheld</v>

59
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 3>so much evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was eager to go to court and it was</v>

60
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:33.721
<v Speaker 3>the coldest day of 1985 February 15th we</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop at a gas station and in Exton,</v>

61
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania.</v>

62
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 3>And as I got out of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the officer driving,</v>

63
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 3>pull past the cubicles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we all got out of the car and ran</v>

64
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 3>over to the cubicle together and I went</v>
<v Speaker 3>in to start a peon and an is holding the</v>

65
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 3>door for me and my eyeglasses start</v>
<v Speaker 3>fogging up.</v>

66
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you go from the freezing cold to</v>

67
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 3>warm to the cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your eyeglasses.</v>

68
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 3>So all I know is I turned around and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out and he has the door like that</v>

69
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 3>and I put my head down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go under his arm and I turned left and</v>

70
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 3>go back to the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the dude smoking a cigarette,</v>

71
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know that his partner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the cubicle,</v>

72
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 3>the pis and as I'm running back to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>duty,</v>

73
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 3>pulls his pistol out and point blank</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoots at me,</v>

74
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Joe like Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as it went past my face,</v>

75
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

76
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I hit the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran and he's following me with the</v>

77
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 3>gun.</v>

78
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.450
<v Speaker 3>I could feel it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

79
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 3>like I was waiting from the blast me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

80
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 3>cause he thought it overpowered his</v>
<v Speaker 3>partner.</v>

81
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh he doesn't know his testimony at</v>
<v Speaker 3>trial was I turned around,</v>

82
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 3>Nick's running at me and my partners</v>
<v Speaker 3>down are gone.</v>

83
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 3>I pulled my gun and he runs and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going to let a death row</v>

84
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 3>prisoner run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've tried to stop him.</v>

85
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 3>I shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I run around the corner,</v>

86
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I hit the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ripped all the skin off my hands.</v>

87
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 3>I've run around the corner and I fly</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards this restaurant and there's all</v>

88
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 3>these people innocently eaten dinner and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm running right towards the plate</v>

89
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 3>glass window cause he ain't going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>blast me,</v>

90
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I ran like I knew he couldn't shoot.</v>

91
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 3>And then I shot around the corner and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran down to a gas station.</v>

92
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 3>I tried to steal a car that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I ran like 400 yards,</v>

93
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 3>400 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>400 yards,</v>

94
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 3>and I hid behind the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just escaped from and I was laying in</v>

95
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.950
<v Speaker 3>the weeds behind the gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 50 yards from a muddy road</v>

96
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 3>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the bigger idiot for letting</v>

97
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 3>this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking,</v>

98
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what am I doing?</v>

99
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 3>What do I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>

100
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do I just jump up and say,</v>

101
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a mistake.</v>

102
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 3>You know that he already tried to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>me in the face,</v>

103
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go high behind the police station.</v>

104
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 3>Next four hours I'll have my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Jeanne paid,</v>

105
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:41.881
<v Speaker 3>chased by a helicopter and he chases me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he pins me and he chases me.</v>

106
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 3>And I was so fit that I ran for four</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours through the woods without care,</v>

107
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 3>with the branches did to my face or</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

108
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I blew out both quads.</v>

109
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I did my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hamstrings.</v>

110
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 3>I ripped my feet open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran so hard in terror that I didn't</v>

111
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.733
<v Speaker 3>care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

112
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 3>And I got away and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made it all way to Florida and I was</v>

113
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 3>going to lead the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you notice?</v>

114
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go back.</v>

115
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 3>How did you get to Florida?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stole a dude's wallet,</v>

116
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got on an airplane and I went down</v>

117
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.060
<v Speaker 3>to Florida and I tried to rob a drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealer and I tried to do just,</v>

118
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so angry.</v>

119
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 3>I was going to kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on,</v>

120
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget this day.</v>

121
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want my folks to see me in</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>

122
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Handcuffs no more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

123
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 3>so I was going by a raft and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go on the ocean and I was going to</v>

124
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 3>have one last party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all the foods that I loved,</v>

125
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 3>then I was going to stab the raft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait for the sharks,</v>

126
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 3>have to cut my wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

127
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 3>and then it was going to cap myself and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

128
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.021
<v Speaker 3>Then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

129
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I turned myself back in.</v>

130
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 3>They put me on death row in Florida and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back and I faced it,</v>

131
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say beat me for four minutes,</v>

132
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They broke my face,</v>

133
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 3>broke my back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crushed me,</v>

134
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tortured me and I thought I'm to get you</v>

135
00:06:57.861 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

136
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 3>for all the days you made me go in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cage and beat some other prisoner while</v>

137
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 3>you stood there with a club laughing at</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

138
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make sure I started being a</v>

139
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 3>loving person again.</v>

140
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.150
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sitting there in 1985 1986 with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>105 years plus the death penalty.</v>

141
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 3>And I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this,</v>

142
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started to learn,</v>

143
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suffer from Aphasia.</v>

144
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 3>I had my head beaten him with a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is Aphasia?</v>

145
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Aphasia can be identified simply in</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have stuttering disorder.</v>

146
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Their brain and their of vernacular</v>
<v Speaker 3>abilities are distorted by disruption in</v>

147
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 3>their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either their brain is functioning too</v>

148
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 3>fast or their mouth is functioning too</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast,</v>

149
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:52.031
<v Speaker 3>or there's a combination of the two</v>
<v Speaker 3>misfiring and Aphasia can be through</v>

150
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 3>trauma or through genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Aphasia affected my life so much as</v>

151
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 3>a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had the respect to listen to</v>

152
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 3>people because I couldn't function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't articulate,</v>

153
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't speak when I was at trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people spoke words that I didn't</v>

154
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 3>understand and it frustrated me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I tried to speak and I</v>

155
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 3>stuttered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would be like that.</v>

156
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>C'mon retard.</v>

157
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:18.611
<v Speaker 3>When he got to say so after that beaton</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they beat me for four minutes and</v>

158
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:24.161
<v Speaker 3>he broke my face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I began practicing speaking to myself.</v>

159
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Every day I learn new words and I taught</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself how to correctly articulate that</v>

160
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:37.781
<v Speaker 3>word into a sentence beautifully from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>own self and myself every day.</v>

161
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.790
<v Speaker 3>And then I became very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good at writing.</v>

162
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 3>I began helping other prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I became the most dangerous prisoner</v>

163
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:52.130
<v Speaker 3>that they held because I cared about</v>
<v Speaker 3>other men.</v>

164
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I wrote to their mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote letters to their lawyers.</v>

165
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 3>I gave up opportunities for people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>write books about me so I could help</v>

166
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 3>another innocent man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did all those things because that's</v>

167
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 3>how I got back at him for night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did to me.</v>

168
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:10.250
<v Speaker 3>So in 1988 I'm sitting in my cell and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>read about Dna and I knew right then I</v>

169
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 3>could prove my innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was the first man in America in</v>

170
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 3>February of 1988 to ask for DNA testing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to prove my innocence.</v>

171
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 3>And he threw away out hot tubs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

172
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 3>And when I discover new evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they destroyed that.</v>

173
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 3>And his woman who came to meet me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>start visiting me fell in love with me</v>

174
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 3>and she believed in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she stood by me and told me that she</v>

175
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:38.481
<v Speaker 3>would be with me either to the gallows</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk or to the Moma approved medicines.</v>

176
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 3>And for nine years she stood by me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

177
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.200
<v Speaker 3>And finally we found some evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was testable in 1995 what?</v>

178
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 3>What was the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was sperm from the rape and it was</v>

179
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 3>being sent out here to California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Dr. Edward Blake.</v>

180
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 3>And it broke open and transport and</v>
<v Speaker 3>spilled.</v>

181
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 3>So Jackie left me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had nothing left,</v>

182
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 3>and then they put me in a special unit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it started torturing me.</v>

183
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I keep this part quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never told a story.</v>

184
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 3>It would ruin what happened if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 it's now out on Netflix,</v>

185
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.600
<v Speaker 3>but they finally closed down the old</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison I was in for 12 years,</v>

186
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 3>where the average rate of survival is</v>
<v Speaker 3>only five and I was wanting hard as Jews</v>

187
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:29.184
<v Speaker 3>there and I made it.</v>

188
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 3>They closed the prison down and open up</v>
<v Speaker 3>green county,</v>

189
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Super Max.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the courts ordered that every</v>

190
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 3>prisoner in Pennsylvania be loud out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their cell for eight hours.</v>

191
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 3>The administration looked at each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>it fuck that.</v>

192
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Not the crazy cannibals and not to</v>
<v Speaker 3>serial killers,</v>

193
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.100
<v Speaker 3>not the dudes that have been assault and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rape and each other.</v>

194
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Speaker 3>So they picked 48 if it us out and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>put us in Pittsburgh and a special</v>

195
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 3>penitentiary setting in which we were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sealed unit and they put all these</v>

196
00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 3>guards in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't allowed to touch other</v>

197
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 3>prisoners because they're so violent and</v>
<v Speaker 3>told them that we're giving you the</v>

198
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 3>craziest of the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

199
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Buffalo Bill from silence of the land</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a real man,</v>

200
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:09.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name was Gary Hide Nick.</v>

201
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.960
<v Speaker 3>He abducted black women in Philadelphia</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put them in a pit under his house</v>

202
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:15.960
<v Speaker 3>and fed one of them to the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>survivors because he was building a</v>

203
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 3>master race.</v>

204
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 3>He was my neighbor man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like so they started torturing us and</v>

205
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 3>doing all this psychological crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>to his word.</v>

206
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 3>They were feeding us to each other like</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves.</v>

207
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.550
<v Speaker 3>So I kept it all quiet until this year</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

208
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 3>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>misfortune fell on my life and I</v>

209
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 3>released monsters a madman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new book that I was going to give</v>

210
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.700
<v Speaker 3>you today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought,</v>

211
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell that story,</v>

212
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's been so hard to come back from</v>

213
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 3>these moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

214
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:47.901
<v Speaker 3>It's just like I look at what they did</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me and how I went to that moment</v>

215
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 3>where the DNA is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackie leaves me.</v>

216
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.110
<v Speaker 3>And so I find that I'm dying from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hepatitis C that they did learn.</v>

217
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 3>They infected me of it when they broke</v>
<v Speaker 3>my teeth when they beat me.</v>

218
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 3>So I asked to be executed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

219
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 3>I studied all the world's religions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read over 9,000 books.</v>

220
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.920
<v Speaker 3>I did everything in piety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother asked me to do,</v>

221
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't want a guy like they'll carter</v>
<v Speaker 3>did with the cards,</v>

222
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 3>come into his cell and taunting them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

223
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 3>teasing him and listen to a man scream</v>
<v Speaker 3>in agony because the pile in his belly</v>

224
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 3>is killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote to the courts and I asked to</v>

225
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 3>be executed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

226
00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:35.214
<v Speaker 3>fuck it man.</v>

227
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I want to die as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love who can respect himself.</v>

228
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 3>The court intervened in order to DNA</v>
<v Speaker 3>testing that was going to be done on</v>

230
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:53.281
<v Speaker 3>evidence is spelled</v>
<v Speaker 3>July of 2003 the DNA test come back and</v>

231
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:56.960
<v Speaker 3>he proved innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did so the,</v>

232
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 3>the dea evidence spilled and they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>captured it.</v>

233
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Once it spill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in a box with all this evidence.</v>

234
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 3>And Dr. Edward Blake who did the Oj</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simpson trial DNA,</v>

235
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.990
<v Speaker 3>said that there would be challenges to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it if he did the DNA in 1999 1998 and</v>

236
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:18.181
<v Speaker 3>2003 they had advanced mitochondrial DNA</v>
<v Speaker 3>separation so well that he felt</v>

237
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:22.060
<v Speaker 3>confident in his results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the federal court got involved and</v>

238
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:22.894
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

239
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have this man executed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the DNA done.</v>

240
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.740
<v Speaker 3>So they did that and it was amazing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the day that I called the lawyers,</v>

241
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 3>they revealed the truth to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called his lawyer and I'm like,</v>

242
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:37.180
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

243
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.013
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nick,</v>

244
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 3>we got DNA from three separate sources</v>
<v Speaker 3>that prove you're innocent.</v>

245
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.920
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing,</v>

246
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really grateful.</v>

248
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

249
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 3>we used to tell people you're crazy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never believed in you.</v>

250
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sorry for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

251
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.980
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

253
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.300
<v Speaker 3>So I was really downcast at the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called my mother,</v>

254
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 3>my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mikey was having a seizure at her feet</v>

255
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:10.660
<v Speaker 3>cause he was an alcoholic after he fell</v>
<v Speaker 3>off a roof and he died shortly after.</v>

256
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:14.920
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just went fucking crazy from there.</v>

257
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.980
<v Speaker 3>They take me off death row and they put</v>
<v Speaker 3>me in a psychological cell and they tell</v>

258
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:25.771
<v Speaker 3>me they can't trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that no human being who has had done to</v>

259
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 3>them what we've done to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot be angry that we open this</v>

260
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 3>door up and we let you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get us.</v>

261
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to leave you until the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day they let you out.</v>

262
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 3>We're going to leave you in this cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we don't trust you not to kill</v>

263
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 3>us for what we did to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did they do to you?</v>

264
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.750
<v Speaker 3>He to have the thing called gladiator</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

265
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.990
<v Speaker 3>so to lieutenant will be off on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday.</v>

266
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.430
<v Speaker 3>And the guards who started to come from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Philadelphia area were black.</v>

267
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Nadian liked the guards up in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillbillies,</v>

268
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 3>beaten on black prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a weird thing happened where this</v>

269
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:05.450
<v Speaker 3>lieutenant came up with an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll look,</v>

270
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 3>let's let the prisoners get this</v>
<v Speaker 3>frustration outta you guys buy you pick</v>

271
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 3>out the biggest guy and you pick out</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>

272
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 3>So one day I'm sitting there minding my</v>
<v Speaker 3>own business and they open up my cell</v>

273
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 3>and there's four of them were clubs</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe.</v>

274
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 3>So I got to go in the cage and I got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and hurt somebody while they stand</v>

275
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't fight,</v>

276
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 3>they're going to come in and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be worse than you can beat a</v>

277
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:28.400
<v Speaker 3>man or get beaten by one man.</v>

278
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

279
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 3>So they did all this for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment.</v>

280
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Would they ever punished for this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not until after the riot on one of them</v>

281
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 3>testified against the others for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>murder and stuff.</v>

282
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:45.993
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

283
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I've watched the 11 people commit</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>

284
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I've been stabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangled,</v>

285
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.650
<v Speaker 3>beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>senseless.</v>

286
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.630
<v Speaker 3>The cards used to talk because I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>qs.</v>

287
00:15:57.631 --> 00:16:01.420
<v Speaker 3>If a psychological murder of going out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stock and his poor woman,</v>

288
00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:04.510
<v Speaker 3>because she looked like my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said I was never treated like a</v>

289
00:16:04.511 --> 00:16:07.390
<v Speaker 3>prisoner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was treated with deference.</v>

290
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.920
<v Speaker 3>The worst word I know in English</v>
<v Speaker 3>dictionary do we I was treated was so</v>

291
00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:16.921
<v Speaker 3>harsh that it was cruel beyond cruel and</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet all I wanted to do was have enough</v>

292
00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:22.060
<v Speaker 3>within me to learn to beautifully</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks.</v>

293
00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:26.560
<v Speaker 3>It didn't on a date at the executed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could tell them how much I cared about</v>

294
00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:27.394
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

295
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.490
<v Speaker 3>I was more important to me than living</v>
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

297
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.010
<v Speaker 3>somehow when you suffer like I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffered,</v>

298
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.560
<v Speaker 3>your head cracks open and you have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>hyper sensitivity to life</v>

299
00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:50.070
<v Speaker 3>so that when you touch the human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never forget the 14 years no one was</v>

300
00:16:50.071 --> 00:16:53.220
<v Speaker 3>allowed to touch you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

301
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ain't crying no more.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

303
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.170

318
00:17:46.201 --> 00:17:50.970

<v Speaker 3>I believe that I had again and was three</v>

319
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 3>years again when years ago when I met my</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife,</v>

320
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 3>current wife Laura.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

321
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I had a woman in my life before that</v>
<v Speaker 3>used me and left me here in Los Angeles.</v>

322
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.810
<v Speaker 3>I ended up homeless on the streets here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was actually living up in this</v>

323
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:08.960
<v Speaker 3>area on the streets because my good</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend Noah,</v>

324
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 3>lives around here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him and Jason took care of me and my bad</v>

325
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:16.380
<v Speaker 3>times I call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go back to England,</v>

326
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 3>I meet this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall in love.</v>

327
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.300
<v Speaker 3>We have a baby and she's born on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>birthday.</v>

328
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 3>And I start to believe in hope again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go do a podcast and England with my</v>

329
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:31.320
<v Speaker 3>good friend Brian from Chew Jordy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I start to spread my message again</v>

330
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:34.200
<v Speaker 3>and I want to get all these young kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe in themselves.</v>

331
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:40.610
<v Speaker 3>And then one day I put the baby down for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nap and I get Laura to lay in my arms</v>

332
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:45.360
<v Speaker 3>because she's sick and we'd get up 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes later and the baby's dead and</v>

333
00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:47.400

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 3>they lost a baby that day.</v>

344
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.850
<v Speaker 3>And so when our baby died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put out a tweet to saying,</v>

345
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate the people in your life cause</v>

346
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:29.730
<v Speaker 3>they're so precious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the police came to our house and</v>

347
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:33.960
<v Speaker 3>humiliated me and wanted to know how I</v>
<v Speaker 3>could tweet about something because my</v>

348
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 3>clock was nine hours off because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>living on the streets of Los Angeles and</v>

349
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Speaker 3>my time was still on la time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause the anthony and I are developing a</v>

350
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 3>major motion picture about my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I told the police,</v>

351
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 3>what are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why would I so I can't even get a</v>

352
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:53.900
<v Speaker 3>break on the death of my daughter like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

353
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.900
<v Speaker 3>that was the moment that the director of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the film fear of 13 decided to rip me</v>

354
00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:00.760
<v Speaker 3>off for my rights to the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

355
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I decided to rip you off how he owed me</v>
<v Speaker 3>50,000 pounds from doing the film.</v>

356
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Fear of 30 decided to rip you off</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he thought you killed your baby.</v>

357
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Now he decided to rip me off and not pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>me my money.</v>

358
00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:13.830
<v Speaker 3>When I asked him I needed money to bury</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter.</v>

359
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.480
<v Speaker 3>So I end up in a shouting match with</v>
<v Speaker 3>authored the Moelis,</v>

360
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.300
<v Speaker 3>the billionaire from Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I promised to get on his plane and come</v>

361
00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:25.150
<v Speaker 3>kick his ass over the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're arguing over cause I begged I,</v>

362
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.600
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up,</v>

363
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm still confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

364
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 3>So your child dies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it my child dies and everything goes</v>

365
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:35.160
<v Speaker 3>badly on syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

366
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.940
<v Speaker 3>And everybody that I counted on to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>my back,</v>

367
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 3>including director David Sinkton who</v>
<v Speaker 3>promised to pay me for my participation</v>

368
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Speaker 3>in the film all then tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

369
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm not paying you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

370
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:51.280
<v Speaker 3>how can you do this when I need this</v>
<v Speaker 3>money to bury my baby?</v>

371
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Why did he say it wasn't paying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause he said he didn't owe it to me and</v>

372
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:55.361
<v Speaker 3>all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

373
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:56.200
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you crazy?</v>

374
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a written contract.</v>

375
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how that entertainment</v>

376
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 3>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they get what they get out of you,</v>

377
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:06.740
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he just said he wasn't going to pay</v>

378
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.700
<v Speaker 3>you what the contract said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

379
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 3>So author demaurice invested in the film</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he owns most of it.</v>

380
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.910
<v Speaker 3>So I write to author,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call myself author.</v>

381
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.610
<v Speaker 3>David's not paying me my money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you help me?</v>

382
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Cause he owned most of the film by that</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

383
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 3>So author gets all annoyed at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

384
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter just died.</v>

385
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I blew up at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told them,</v>

386
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 3>send me your private jet or come to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston,</v>

387
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 3>we can have a fist fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You love to fight and all that shit.</v>

388
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 3>I just lose control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then author out of His grace sends</v>

389
00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:40.420
<v Speaker 3>me some money so we could bury the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it went through all this terrible</v>

390
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started,</v>

391
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.120
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm going back to America.</v>

392
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.560
<v Speaker 3>So I leave England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come over here.</v>

393
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I got two daughters with Laura.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go over here now and the Oregon and</v>

394
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

395
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I meet this amazing man only because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muhammad Ali dying.</v>

396
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 3>And now he's going to help me make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>major motion picture about my life.</v>

397
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.260
<v Speaker 3>So I get away from all that trauma of</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing a baby and being humiliated by</v>

398
00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 3>people thinking I would do some shit to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little girl.</v>

399
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.580
<v Speaker 3>And I go back and rebuild everything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I try to go to Canada and they</v>

400
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:16.510
<v Speaker 3>won't let me in as crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can't go do my job there.</v>

401
00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:17.070
<v Speaker 3>I lose all.</v>

402
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Don't let you in because you were on</v>
<v Speaker 3>death row for 22 years.</v>

403
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're innocent.</v>

404
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just came from speaking before the</v>

405
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 3>United Nations sitting next to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>president and current former presidents</v>

406
00:22:28.031 --> 00:22:30.970
<v Speaker 3>of Switzerland and I have a security</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearance from that.</v>

407
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.770
<v Speaker 3>I worked in a high profile job in</v>
<v Speaker 3>England going around speaking over to</v>

408
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:38.950
<v Speaker 3>governments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Canada holds it against me because I</v>

409
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:42.330
<v Speaker 3>escaped from death row,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can't enter the cat.</v>

410
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.540
<v Speaker 3>The country of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robin Sharma tried to have me come up</v>

411
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:50.130
<v Speaker 3>there and speak for him with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>conference and I had the humiliating.</v>

412
00:22:50.131 --> 00:22:53.020
<v Speaker 3>They do it from my home via skype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

413
00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I'll never stop being punished for what</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

414
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't care about that.</v>

415
00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:00.880
<v Speaker 3>What really bothered me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was that all those things started to</v>

416
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 3>fall me and I started losing hope again.</v>

417
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.710
<v Speaker 3>So I go and I even tried recently just</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a normal job and give up</v>

418
00:23:08.711 --> 00:23:09.544
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

419
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm a beautiful speaker in schools and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>go around and try and help people with</v>

420
00:23:13.181 --> 00:23:14.800
<v Speaker 3>their education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

421
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.200
<v Speaker 3>So I was trying to do that the last year</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>

422
00:23:18.201 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine named Wayne Sharp from</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand.</v>

423
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:24.250
<v Speaker 3>He has a company called my verse and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to help children find the correct</v>

424
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:26.380
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Education so important.</v>

425
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.440
<v Speaker 3>We can't get that gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

426
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I just decide I'm going to give up</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and just go get a normal job.</v>

427
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sitting there and it's Jamie's</v>

428
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 3>birthday and I'm angry like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

429
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.310
<v Speaker 3>How could it fall apart again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit in,</v>

430
00:23:45.311 --> 00:23:49.180
<v Speaker 3>you contact me after I tweeted and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all starts again.</v>

431
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm back to believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how it got in his</v>

432
00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:57.790
<v Speaker 3>chair or it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That demand proceeding me has everything</v>

433
00:23:57.791 --> 00:24:00.790
<v Speaker 3>and I had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still believe in</v>

434
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.340
<v Speaker 3>you this time and I told you now I</v>
<v Speaker 3>messed.</v>

438
00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:12.070
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have to be nice to me.</v>

439
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.100

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.580

<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't think anybody can imagine</v>

444
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.620
<v Speaker 3>what it's like to spend 22 years on</v>
<v Speaker 3>death row for something you didn't do.</v>

445
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.670

<v Speaker 3>I'm fighting with my two brothers all</v>

<v Speaker 3>ran my mouth.</v>

470
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:55.483
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And he's got me on the duckhorn and his</v>

<v Speaker 3>name is Benny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

480

<v Speaker 3>me pressed against the top of the car</v>

<v Speaker 3>breathe.</v>

482
00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:28.360
<v Speaker 3>So I start resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I popped his arm off and the adrenaline</v>

00:26:28.361 --> 00:26:29.470
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

485
00:26:33.731 --> 00:26:36.760
<v Speaker 3>tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like off the charts and so I</v>

486
00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:38.830
<v Speaker 3>pushed him back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remembered that and he couldn't</v>

487
00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:39.190
<v Speaker 3>believe it.</v>

488
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 3>He pulled out his stick and raised it up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just snatched it out of his and</v>

489
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 3>chucked it away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at him like,</v>

490
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Zombie guy.</v>

491
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 3>And he went furious many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out the pistol and I seen it</v>

492
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:54.070
<v Speaker 3>coming and I grabbed his hand and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed down and I had my arms out</v>

493
00:26:54.071 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 3>stretched and the gun whoop boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>down into the ground like that.</v>

494
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I looked at him and he put the gun up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and he's dead.</v>

495
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Motha fucking Wuss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He puts me in a car.</v>

496
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting in the backseat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm freaking out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the front seat.</v>

499
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Then he waits and he looks at me in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mirror and he grabs the mic and he's</v>

<v Speaker 3>Now I'm charged with attempted murder</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kidnapping of a police officer.</v>

514
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm 20 years old and I meet skipped</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dimatteo public defender who didn't</v>

515
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:52.590
<v Speaker 3>tells me I'm facing life imprisonment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's it,</v>

516
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to put me into</v>
<v Speaker 3>security wing because my bail is gonna</v>

517
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 3>be so high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked at him,</v>

518
00:27:57.121 --> 00:27:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean man?</v>

519
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying home a minister one</v>
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>

520
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 3>like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no man,</v>

521
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:07.670
<v Speaker 3>you ain't never going home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I broke down and I went through detox</v>

522
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:09.540
<v Speaker 3>with note no help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

523
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:14.430
<v Speaker 3>So three days I'm in a cell with nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this newspaper.</v>

524
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.450
<v Speaker 3>And as the headline on the newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Craig's murder,</v>

525
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 3>and it starts taunting me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taunting me,</v>

526
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.370
<v Speaker 3>it's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow in my head,</v>

527
00:28:24.371 --> 00:28:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I came up with this crazy mantra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I knew something about something that</v>

528
00:28:28.691 --> 00:28:30.910
<v Speaker 3>big up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can let me go about this lie.</v>

529
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I didn't try to kill nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting on my bed and the guard</v>

530
00:28:38.631 --> 00:28:41.150
<v Speaker 3>was walking by and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with you?</v>

531
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 3>And I started telling him what was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>through my head,</v>

532
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.630
<v Speaker 3>the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was it,</v>

533
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

534
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.650
<v Speaker 3>He ran down the block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He rented a sergeant's office.</v>

535
00:28:52.651 --> 00:28:55.870
<v Speaker 3>They got me to the warden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The warden's now been told to say,</v>

536
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.600
<v Speaker 3>you're telling them what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your head.</v>

537
00:28:57.601 --> 00:28:59.460
<v Speaker 3>So I repeated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had,</v>

538
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 3>you had a plan to tell him a story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell them a lie.</v>

539
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.050
<v Speaker 3>And when that officer responded because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he heard the story,</v>

540
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have any idea what the impact</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my words were.</v>

541
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I was so stupid.</v>

542
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were also going through detox?</v>

543
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they take me to the awards office</v>

544
00:29:18.461 --> 00:29:21.210
<v Speaker 3>and he starts praising me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take me out of solitary</v>

545
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 3>confinement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me I'm doing a great job.</v>

546
00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 3>What did you tell him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told him that a man that I knew in the</v>

547
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 3>area had told me he had done the crime</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that if they let me out,</v>

548
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.090
<v Speaker 3>I would tell them all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he told me I was helping the</v>

549
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were taking me out of solitary</v>

550
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:41.380
<v Speaker 3>confinement and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They told that,</v>

551
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they spoke to officer,</v>

552
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 3>right and he was going to retract his</v>
<v Speaker 3>charges and only charged me resisting</v>

553
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 3>arrest and they were going to drop the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the charges and everything was</v>

554
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:54.040
<v Speaker 3>going to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then three days later they came back</v>

555
00:29:54.041 --> 00:29:54.970
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

556
00:29:54.971 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 3>you lied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason you lied is because</v>

557
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:01.900
<v Speaker 3>you want to tell us that you did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put me in a room and start doing</v>

558
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:04.450
<v Speaker 3>all this shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find out that you lied to do did I</v>

559
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:07.390
<v Speaker 3>made the story up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A was no longer a drug addict.</v>

560
00:30:07.391 --> 00:30:08.380
<v Speaker 3>And he had an alibi.</v>

561
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:14.940
<v Speaker 3>So you just tried to pin the story on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on some other drug addict they do to rob</v>

562
00:30:14.941 --> 00:30:18.540
<v Speaker 3>me a rolled me up in a rogue and tried</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kill me with a three 57 magnum.</v>

563
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.650
<v Speaker 3>So I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard the story that he was dead and</v>

564
00:30:22.651 --> 00:30:24.690
<v Speaker 3>figure out he won't even find him</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

565
00:30:24.691 --> 00:30:27.420
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a 20 year old doesn't have any</v>

566
00:30:27.421 --> 00:30:28.860
<v Speaker 3>concept of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

567
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.440
<v Speaker 3>complex stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the 80s.</v>

568
00:30:31.441 --> 00:30:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

569
00:30:32.281 --> 00:30:35.400
<v Speaker 3>they came right back to me and they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>me in a Delaware County district</v>

570
00:30:35.401 --> 00:30:40.290
<v Speaker 3>attorney's office and this detective</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin told me no certain terms.</v>

571
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:42.480
<v Speaker 3>I was gone tell him why I killed that</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

572
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:47.130
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't leaving that room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for 13 hours they tortured me.</v>

573
00:30:47.131 --> 00:30:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Matt started bringing up my childhood</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that Shit.</v>

574
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.043
<v Speaker 3>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

575
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.650
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to blow up my whole world</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Nasssa.</v>

576
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:56.483
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

577
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 3>So this is my confession consists of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

578
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.520
<v Speaker 3>and I kill anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never meant to kill anyone.</v>

579
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.680
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

580
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.590
<v Speaker 3>You never meant to kill her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

581
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:12.600
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to trial and I was given a three</v>

582
00:31:12.601 --> 00:31:17.601
<v Speaker 3>day trial for the murder of Mrs. Craig</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the jury found me not guilty of</v>

583
00:31:18.481 --> 00:31:22.620
<v Speaker 3>all my original charges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was really frustrated that a jury</v>

584
00:31:22.621 --> 00:31:27.540
<v Speaker 3>heard the testimony of officer right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would later be fired from the force,</v>

585
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being caught up in a drug gang and</v>

586
00:31:29.751 --> 00:31:31.590
<v Speaker 3>chester,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was dirty.</v>

587
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't know that at the time.</v>

588
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.930
<v Speaker 3>But a jury found me not guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That prosecutor,</v>

589
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.750
<v Speaker 3>my mental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that happened and he decided to</v>

590
00:31:39.751 --> 00:31:43.380
<v Speaker 3>seek the death penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a month after I was found guilty,</v>

591
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.060
<v Speaker 3>not guilty of all my original charges</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I made the stupid story up.</v>

592
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave me a three day murder trial.</v>

593
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.900
<v Speaker 3>That in essence was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they did was they prayed upon</v>

594
00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:59.100
<v Speaker 3>the poor jury and showed them pictures</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the victim and stuff like that,</v>

595
00:31:59.101 --> 00:32:02.130
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had an inmate who burglarized</v>

596
00:32:02.131 --> 00:32:05.970
<v Speaker 3>the prosecutors home and was facing 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>years come into court and say,</v>

597
00:32:05.971 --> 00:32:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I confessed to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

598
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.530
<v Speaker 3>So the inmates so that you confessed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

599
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.080
<v Speaker 3>Charles Catalina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got to got to do that.</v>

600
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sitting there and they dropped a</v>

601
00:32:17.581 --> 00:32:19.830
<v Speaker 3>bomb on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's coming.</v>

602
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.880
<v Speaker 3>The jury was so crest at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went out to the wagon wheel</v>

603
00:32:23.881 --> 00:32:27.990
<v Speaker 3>restaurant and put their dessert order</v>
<v Speaker 3>on hold while they found me guilty.</v>

604
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.740
<v Speaker 3>And then during the sentencing phase</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had their dessert.</v>

605
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

606
00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.740
<v Speaker 3>I was 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

607
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't real man.</v>

608
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I never killed a this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can this happen?</v>

609
00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Yoni mistake I truly think I</v>

610
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:47.720
<v Speaker 3>made was that I told the judge go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hell when he sentenced me to death</v>

611
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 3>because he couldn't look me in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that's a mistake?</v>

612
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Because he decided to send me to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huntington prison.</v>

613
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.650
<v Speaker 3>The hardest prison in America at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time wasn't going to do before that,</v>

614
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he made sure I went to the place</v>

615
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 3>that they broke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

616
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Huntington was designed as the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he raped another inmate,</v>

617
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 3>they sent you there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the first shoe program in</v>

618
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:10.030
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the first really what does shoot</v>

619
00:33:10.031 --> 00:33:12.950
<v Speaker 3>program?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A special housing unit or security</v>

620
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:15.980
<v Speaker 3>housing unit were s level five supermax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

621
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 3>like Pelican Bay.</v>

622
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.920
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your punishment was that you weren't</v>

623
00:33:21.921 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 3>allowed to speak in yourself and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>got caught speaking in yourself,</v>

624
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.000
<v Speaker 3>they came in with a nurse and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after they beat you down,</v>

625
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.930
<v Speaker 3>she jabbed you in the ass with thorazine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they knocked you off for a week and</v>

626
00:33:32.931 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 3>you lost your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was horrible.</v>

627
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Like I told you the first two years of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sentence,</v>

628
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 3>every day I kept my mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care what was done around me.</v>

629
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:48.110
<v Speaker 3>And you weren't allowed to say a God</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn word and a minute and you know,</v>

630
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 3>a lot of talk to other inmates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

631
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I day to sing happy birthday to yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I did.</v>

632
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I paid for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucked me up,</v>

633
00:34:01.091 --> 00:34:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't care about that.</v>

634
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized I was in a race.</v>

635
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.900
<v Speaker 3>I had to kill off the person that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The person that I initially was upon</v>

636
00:34:17.291 --> 00:34:19.780
<v Speaker 3>entering prison was a deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lying,</v>

637
00:34:19.781 --> 00:34:22.670
<v Speaker 3>coward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but know fortitude because no self</v>

638
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:27.400
<v Speaker 3>respect resided within me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in utter humbleness,</v>

639
00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I took everything that they did to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I paid for every window.</v>

640
00:34:31.871 --> 00:34:34.490
<v Speaker 3>I broke everything I stole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rely at all,</v>

641
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 3>and then I started to love myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured I ain't get nothing out of</v>

642
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:43.150
<v Speaker 3>this but misery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going out like the dude.</v>

643
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm a stand up and not misspeak</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautifully on the daily to execute me.</v>

644
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm a walk to that walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

645
00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Judas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't kill that woman,</v>

646
00:34:54.071 --> 00:34:59.071
<v Speaker 3>but I damn sure ain't no coward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find out everything I can</v>

647
00:34:59.651 --> 00:35:03.430
<v Speaker 3>about life and then I'm gonna face my</v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

648
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm a do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was [inaudible] man,</v>

649
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:11.160
<v Speaker 3>like I had this beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful speech ready for him too.</v>

650
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.400
<v Speaker 3>I was going to lay it out and just be at</v>
<v Speaker 3>peace because I realized there was</v>

651
00:35:15.401 --> 00:35:19.360
<v Speaker 3>nothing else to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could fight.</v>

652
00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.480
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't argue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't matter because God's in</v>

653
00:35:22.481 --> 00:35:25.240
<v Speaker 3>control of my life and I really believed</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had a choice,</v>

654
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:30.690
<v Speaker 3>either be a bitter pill and get sucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>dry by all the misery of mountain me or</v>

655
00:35:31.481 --> 00:35:33.550
<v Speaker 3>get my shit right and start loving</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

656
00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 3>So I taught myself how to speak and</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcome this,</v>

657
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aphasia.</v>

658
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 3>It affected me my whole life and I found</v>
<v Speaker 3>out that I was giving myself</v>

659
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:50.070
<v Speaker 3>neuro-plasticity healing and I became</v>
<v Speaker 3>very graceful and calm and prison.</v>

660
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.540
<v Speaker 3>I was so serene and so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you find out you were giving</v>

661
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:58.350
<v Speaker 3>yourself neuroplasticity healing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found that out from Robin Sharma,</v>

662
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Robin Sharma's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the foremost authority on speaking about</v>

663
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:06.240
<v Speaker 3>neuroplasticity healing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he found about what I speak</v>

664
00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

665
00:36:07.681 --> 00:36:10.200
<v Speaker 3>I am the living embodiment of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>teachings.</v>

666
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 3>That through grace and dignity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>kindness,</v>

667
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I've developed my own charisma that</v>
<v Speaker 3>carries me with confidence.</v>

668
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 3>And that is the description of what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>teaches professionals,</v>

669
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 3>beginners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone to explain neuroplasticity for</v>

670
00:36:24.061 --> 00:36:28.710
<v Speaker 3>people to neuroplasticity is a reward</v>
<v Speaker 3>system within your brain where in your</v>

671
00:36:28.711 --> 00:36:31.530
<v Speaker 3>interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with other human beings,</v>

672
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 3>heals you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people who suffer from PTSD,</v>

673
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:40.590
<v Speaker 3>people who have had trauma in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives can actually heal themselves by</v>

674
00:36:40.591 --> 00:36:45.591
<v Speaker 3>being meticulously polite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I began all of this when I was</v>

675
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:50.910
<v Speaker 3>released.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother sat me down and she said,</v>

676
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.940
<v Speaker 3>Nikki listened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For you to get out of prison and not be</v>

677
00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:58.890
<v Speaker 3>a nice man is a waste of everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

678
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Every prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time someone called me to mother</v>

679
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:05.220
<v Speaker 3>of monster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time a woman's spit in my face,</v>

680
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.960
<v Speaker 3>every thing that I went through is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>waste of time for you not to be a nice</v>

681
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:11.870
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

682
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.870
<v Speaker 3>So I want you to promise me one thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day I want you to go out and say,</v>

683
00:37:17.641 --> 00:37:19.410
<v Speaker 3>yes ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>

684
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 3>And thank you because I want you to show</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect for who you are and that way</v>

685
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.900
<v Speaker 3>they hurt this family badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the only thing I ask.</v>

686
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.630
<v Speaker 3>I didn't notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She handed me the tool to healing</v>

687
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.200
<v Speaker 3>because neuroplasticity is the self</v>
<v Speaker 3>contrived act of rewarding yourself for</v>

688
00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:42.921
<v Speaker 3>being a nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my gift over the last 14 years is</v>

689
00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:48.351
<v Speaker 3>that I made myself so amazingly pliable</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gifted at helping others find the</v>

690
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 3>good within them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason I'm truly here today.</v>

691
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.740
<v Speaker 3>The thing that I've been able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish through my writing and</v>

692
00:37:58.741 --> 00:38:03.741
<v Speaker 3>through my efforts is to show people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you take things personally in life,</v>

693
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.280
<v Speaker 3>you'd be then a full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what you've done is you've taken</v>

694
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 3>all the hurts and you've made them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>justify reason why you have to be an</v>

695
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.860
<v Speaker 3>asshole to somebody.</v>

696
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Whereas you keep forgetting that you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been given a break over and over just to</v>

697
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:19.830
<v Speaker 3>be here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

698
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been shot,</v>

699
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 3>stabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangled,</v>

700
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 3>run over by a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hung myself in prison to drug overdoses</v>

701
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:28.770
<v Speaker 3>and I had accountable trying to murder</v>
<v Speaker 3>me for two solid years.</v>

702
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I know that I could fall at any moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>from my own hand,</v>

703
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.550
<v Speaker 3>but God blessed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe so much in my purpose in life</v>

704
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 3>that I won't kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't give up and it's only because</v>

705
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 3>I've been tested that I know that it has</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be for a reason.</v>

706
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 3>I had dreams about all this while I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in death row.</v>

707
00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I had the most amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense dreams because of my suffering</v>

708
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.000
<v Speaker 3>and they play out now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened?</v>

709
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Did I manage to touch something we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>all chasing.</v>

710
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Where am I in a delusional world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>

711
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:09.340
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by that?</v>

712
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 3>I told people last June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last year,</v>

713
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:18.091
<v Speaker 3>I told everybody on facebook something</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to bag was going to happen and</v>

714
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:23.371
<v Speaker 3>it did when my daughter broke her elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I told everybody before it happened</v>

715
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.200
<v Speaker 3>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told my wife Laura,</v>

716
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 3>I was coming back here to meet Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm on Donnie and go on the good news</v>

717
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 3>network and do a thing with Mei,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mei Ali,</v>

718
00:39:32.921 --> 00:39:37.921
<v Speaker 3>who's a good friend of mine and I told</v>
<v Speaker 3>him how things would happen and sure</v>

719
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:42.940
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time it's played out I,</v>

720
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.330
<v Speaker 3>why did you think something was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad was going to happen when you said</v>

721
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.430
<v Speaker 3>something bad was going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your daughter broke her arm.</v>

722
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a meeting with a guy named Kevin</v>

723
00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:53.530
<v Speaker 3>and John and I look at them and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to,</v>

724
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:58.330
<v Speaker 3>and I'm on Melrose Boulevard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My daughter is playing in the playground</v>

725
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 3>a few blocks away and I'm in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting with these men about my film.</v>

726
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.740
<v Speaker 3>I stand up at the table and I say to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

727
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I have to go right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run outside and I asked my wife,</v>

728
00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Laura,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is she okay?</v>

729
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.930
<v Speaker 3>My daughter fell and broke her elbow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to have six pins put into it and</v>

730
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Cedars Sinai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a $63,000 bill did.</v>

731
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 3>It is stuck us with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I knew it was going to happen before</v>

732
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:26.260
<v Speaker 3>it did and I even told people it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>

733
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 3>How can I have that touch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you knew that was going to happen</v>

734
00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:32.830
<v Speaker 3>specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the event,</v>

735
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:36.670
<v Speaker 3>but not in real time so I could make</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of it,</v>

736
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.210
<v Speaker 3>but I saw the greenery at the park when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we pulled up,</v>

737
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 3>it was the same and I had the flash last</v>
<v Speaker 3>night when I met Stedman Graham.</v>

738
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I had all these moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that woman last night pinned the thing</v>

739
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 3>on my collar and she looked just like my</v>
<v Speaker 3>mother and I had this dream because my</v>

740
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:55.810
<v Speaker 3>mom died on September 9th and 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

741
00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I was actually on a flight September 11</v>
<v Speaker 3>for her funeral and it's all crazy how I</v>

742
00:41:02.051 --> 00:41:06.700
<v Speaker 3>saw all these things in my dreams on</v>
<v Speaker 3>death row and they play out and it keeps</v>

743
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:11.701
<v Speaker 3>happening with witnesses to my life that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are recognizing it with me so I can't</v>

744
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 3>make it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

745
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.010
<v Speaker 3>I wish my friend Jason was here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

746
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 3>he's been able to help me just put this</v>
<v Speaker 3>in context and I'm doing this badly,</v>

747
00:41:20.891 --> 00:41:25.891
<v Speaker 3>but I just think that somehow I went</v>
<v Speaker 3>through an experience so intense that it</v>

748
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:30.220
<v Speaker 3>is truly cracked open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that has given me a</v>

749
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:35.221
<v Speaker 3>hypersensitivity to things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it is allowed me truly to</v>

750
00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:40.871
<v Speaker 3>be humble enough to really give my life</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a purpose and not be ego driven.</v>

751
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Like I have nothing at this moment where</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sit here,</v>

752
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 3>but I am so proud of the fact that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't never stop me from believing in</v>

753
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 3>good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could beat me all day.</v>

754
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.890
<v Speaker 3>You could put in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do whatever you want to me,</v>

755
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's up to me that didn't make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>misery.</v>

756
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:02.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm choosing not to men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how much I got a struggle</v>

757
00:42:02.451 --> 00:42:05.420
<v Speaker 3>from this point on or what grace is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and granted,</v>

758
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I just want one thing to stay true in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life that I don't lose who I am.</v>

759
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.340
<v Speaker 3>I fought so hard to be this man through</v>
<v Speaker 3>a childhood of a feeling so inadequate</v>

760
00:42:16.461 --> 00:42:21.461
<v Speaker 3>because another man raped me to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings that I was so low of being cast</v>

761
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:27.011
<v Speaker 3>aside as a condemned human being that</v>
<v Speaker 3>then rise up and go and speak before</v>

762
00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:30.580
<v Speaker 3>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To the point that Kofi Annan told me</v>

763
00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:35.030
<v Speaker 3>that I was one of the finest speakers in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world to then go and follow that and</v>

764
00:42:35.031 --> 00:42:38.900
<v Speaker 3>stand at the base of the Coliseum where</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings were put to death for</v>

765
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:43.910
<v Speaker 3>entertainment and blow 20,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 3>away and have it flawlessly done.</v>

766
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 3>And to recognize that I had it all</v>
<v Speaker 3>within me to do because of one thing</v>

767
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 3>that neuroplasticity came me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charisma,</v>

768
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:57.410
<v Speaker 3>the kind of charisma you exude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know where it is that you hit</v>

769
00:42:57.411 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 3>that point where you decided to really</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in yourself,</v>

770
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 3>but like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't listen to that shit that</v>

771
00:43:03.261 --> 00:43:06.110
<v Speaker 3>people were telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you did that,</v>

772
00:43:06.111 --> 00:43:09.830
<v Speaker 3>you started to contrive all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful charisma because I didn't even</v>

773
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:11.930
<v Speaker 3>watch the fight Saturday when you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking,</v>

774
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I listened to you and I thought he so</v>
<v Speaker 3>flawless.</v>

775
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Speaker 3>It's not even thought of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people would never grant you that</v>

776
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 3>you dad to do something in your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something within you made you believe in</v>

777
00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:24.740
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

778
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.910
<v Speaker 2>man was I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not had much resistance at all.</v>

779
00:43:27.911 --> 00:43:29.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what you're,</v>

780
00:43:29.891 --> 00:43:32.350
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying about me is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind.</v>

781
00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really haven't had much resistance.</v>

782
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what it is about you that makes you</v>

783
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 3>believe in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

784
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd you hit that point?</v>

785
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it came from martial</v>

786
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:47.720
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from martial arts competition when I was</v>

787
00:43:47.721 --> 00:43:51.240
<v Speaker 2>very young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure from the first,</v>

788
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when neither neither.</v>

789
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

790
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:59.090
<v Speaker 2>just how difficult it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

791
00:43:59.091 --> 00:43:59.924
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

792
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.580
<v Speaker 2>doing it from 15 to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

793
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I was 22,</v>

794
00:44:05.841 --> 00:44:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I stopped somewhere around 22,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just the fact that it was so</v>

795
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 2>difficult that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

796
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.950
<v Speaker 2>it taught me hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taught me focus and,</v>

797
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.860
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anything before that</v>

798
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 2>before that I thought it was a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really thought it was a loser.</v>

799
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father,</v>

800
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Stepdad's a very nice guy,</v>

801
00:44:26.091 --> 00:44:31.091
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about growing up</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a father that is still alive,</v>

802
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

803
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 2>my mom worked all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My stepdad worked all day.</v>

804
00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:39.060
<v Speaker 2>There was no one around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

805
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

806
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.900
<v Speaker 2>and we moved a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have any friends.</v>

807
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.640
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

808
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never felt like I was worthwhile,</v>

809
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I wasn't anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you experienced?</v>

810
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was enough within you that it was</v>

811
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.540
<v Speaker 2>the point where I needed to prove</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

812
00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:59.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what I need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to show,</v>

813
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:00.361
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

814
00:45:00.361 --> 00:45:04.260
<v Speaker 2>there was something inside me that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to show that it wasn't useless</v>

815
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 2>and the only way I could show that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't useless was by being good at</v>

816
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:09.210
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And initially it was art.</v>

817
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.690
<v Speaker 2>And then after art it became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts in the martial arts thing</v>

818
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 2>was more important than art because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts tested me.</v>

819
00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Like art was beautiful because I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>draw things and people would love them.</v>

820
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.890
<v Speaker 2>And then it made me feel good that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people liked my work.</v>

821
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference between that</v>

822
00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:25.650
<v Speaker 2>and the martial arts.</v>

823
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.520
<v Speaker 2>The martial arts was so difficult to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to compete at a,</v>

824
00:45:30.521 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a national level,</v>

825
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

826
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 2>every time I did it I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But after it was over,</v>

827
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I felt better about myself and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood that I could actually be good</v>

828
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:42.450
<v Speaker 2>at things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was the first thing that I ever</v>

829
00:45:42.451 --> 00:45:47.451
<v Speaker 2>did that gave me a feeling of of value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went from being a loser to being an</v>

830
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:50.610
<v Speaker 2>extreme winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's brilliant.</v>

831
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.160
<v Speaker 2>But it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

832
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.350
<v Speaker 2>But is your point though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying that people like held</v>

833
00:45:55.351 --> 00:45:58.380
<v Speaker 2>me back and that's not really the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

834
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm sure people judged me one way</v>

835
00:46:02.311 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 2>or another because of fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the other things.</v>

836
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about going through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts competition and everything,</v>

837
00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:10.284
<v Speaker 2>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

838
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck how other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>view me.</v>

839
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just do what I like.</v>

840
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I do what I like and I try to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's where your charisma comes</v>

841
00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:22.200
<v Speaker 2>from and where you got that from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still yours,</v>

842
00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I admired it.</v>

843
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.070
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence to do that,</v>

844
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 2>to shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That noise,</v>

845
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.740
<v Speaker 2>that thing that makes us all react to</v>
<v Speaker 2>every one else's opinion.</v>

846
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Well I react to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

847
00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:33.261
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

848
00:46:33.261 --> 00:46:35.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm most certainly feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't,</v>

849
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.220
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't let it change the way I,</v>

850
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I go through life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

851
00:46:41.191 --> 00:46:44.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because of the lessons that I've</v>

852
00:46:44.131 --> 00:46:46.830
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to express that as much as</v>

853
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 2>possible for people that haven't gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>through those same lessons.</v>

854
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.410
<v Speaker 2>So I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

855
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.740
<v Speaker 2>I can express that information and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can absorb some of it without</v>

856
00:46:57.811 --> 00:46:59.340
<v Speaker 2>having to go through what I went</v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

857
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I think what you went through is</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinitely more difficult,</v>

858
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:09.530
<v Speaker 2>more trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that your message and your</v>

859
00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:15.051
<v Speaker 2>story can show people that in the worst</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible scenario,</v>

860
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:20.901
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of your life as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrongfully committed to life in</v>

861
00:47:22.651 --> 00:47:26.760
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are going to spend the rest of your</v>

862
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 2>life until they execute you on death row</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the horrors that you've gone</v>

863
00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 2>through to come out of that and to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that with a purpose of being a</v>

864
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 2>nice person and learning how to speak</v>
<v Speaker 2>and learning how to speak clearly and</v>

865
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:43.890
<v Speaker 2>confidently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lesson in that that said,</v>

866
00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is almost like at a,</v>

867
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:54.040
<v Speaker 2>at a religious level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you talk about someone who's</v>

868
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.770
<v Speaker 2>created a diamond from pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what you've done well,</v>

869
00:47:57.771 --> 00:48:00.520
<v Speaker 2>you've done is you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've figured out a way to,</v>

870
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.810
<v Speaker 2>despite all this raging hurricane of</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion that goes through your mind,</v>

871
00:48:04.811 --> 00:48:07.450
<v Speaker 2>that's caused you to cry when you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these things,</v>

872
00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you can express yourself in a very clear</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that lets people,</v>

873
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:18.841
<v Speaker 2>it just at least peer through the window</v>
<v Speaker 2>into what you've experienced in your</v>

874
00:48:19.511 --> 00:48:21.790
<v Speaker 2>life and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

875
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.500
<v Speaker 2>it can give people a perspective that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there just is very,</v>

876
00:48:26.501 --> 00:48:30.910
<v Speaker 2>very rare that someone gets fucked over</v>
<v Speaker 2>in life as bad as you did.</v>

877
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rare and it's even more rare to</v>

878
00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:36.820
<v Speaker 2>come through at the end with a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose</v>

879
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.940
<v Speaker 3>everyday of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone writes me and tells me they</v>

880
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:43.300
<v Speaker 3>didn't kill themselves today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that every day man,</v>

881
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 3>did he stop drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a young man living in my house</v>

882
00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 3>named Zach curves is a really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine.</v>

883
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:54.360
<v Speaker 3>He really changed his whole life since</v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting me.</v>

884
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even my close friends have told me I've</v>

885
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:04.141
<v Speaker 3>changed their life and I appreciate it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I recognize a lot of times it's</v>

886
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:11.371
<v Speaker 3>the good within then that's resonating</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm proud of the fact that I have</v>

887
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.880
<v Speaker 3>sat and listened to the words I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>deserve for what I've tried and I'm</v>

888
00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 3>going to learn in the future to accept</v>
<v Speaker 3>the graces that you just did to me.</v>

889
00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 3>Because in the past I always tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you see,</v>

890
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:30.010
<v Speaker 3>diminish it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have worked very hard,</v>

891
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have worked very hard to craft,</v>

892
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my work into writing and like your</v>

893
00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:36.934
<v Speaker 3>drawings.</v>

894
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:42.030
<v Speaker 3>I was so proud of having a number one</v>
<v Speaker 3>bestseller in my first book and I was so</v>

895
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:47.680
<v Speaker 3>proud of using my talent as a writer to</v>
<v Speaker 3>then articulate what it's like to lose a</v>

896
00:49:47.681 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 3>baby and my journey through her eyes or</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use,</v>

897
00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this last effort in monsters,</v>

898
00:49:52.571 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 3>a med men too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help people.</v>

899
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.180
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to have a bigger secret than</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that people know you by and</v>

900
00:49:58.181 --> 00:50:00.670
<v Speaker 3>still live with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when it's right,</v>

901
00:50:00.671 --> 00:50:03.790
<v Speaker 3>you can share it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I've made a point that I'm done</v>

902
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 3>writing because I've accomplished all my</v>
<v Speaker 3>work as a writer and now I want to do</v>

903
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 3>one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

904
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.030
<v Speaker 3>I want to help young students around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world take them so seriously with their</v>

905
00:50:13.031 --> 00:50:17.290
<v Speaker 3>education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did over 500 of them in schools over</v>

906
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:19.780
<v Speaker 3>England and Europe and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it,</v>

907
00:50:19.781 --> 00:50:23.380
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got all these young lads and lasses to</v>

908
00:50:23.381 --> 00:50:27.680
<v Speaker 3>come back to me and show me degrees that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got when I showed him important are</v>

909
00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 3>education was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

910
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.420
<v Speaker 3>I really thrive in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah,</v>

911
00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.150
<v Speaker 2>environment because I think that's where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's still is for me.</v>

912
00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a kid,</v>

913
00:50:40.171 --> 00:50:43.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who won't let go of needing to still</v>

914
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:46.590
<v Speaker 2>chase the good in my life.</v>

915
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:52.280
<v Speaker 3>And I notice things in the woods and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>know there's a billion things in the</v>

916
00:50:52.381 --> 00:50:55.230
<v Speaker 3>woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still willing to walk that path</v>

917
00:50:55.231 --> 00:50:58.680
<v Speaker 3>and find something meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I came here to really</v>

918
00:50:58.681 --> 00:51:03.681
<v Speaker 3>say is that I want to make an impact</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my words,</v>

919
00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.800
<v Speaker 3>but not overdo it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't want to do,</v>

920
00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any other podcast after this one except</v>

921
00:51:11.311 --> 00:51:14.460
<v Speaker 3>for my friend Brian's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I wanted to,</v>

922
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:19.790
<v Speaker 3>the meaningful thing without it having</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be attached to the social media draw</v>

923
00:51:22.001 --> 00:51:24.090
<v Speaker 3>that has hurt my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much</v>

924
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.250
<v Speaker 2>social media draw that has hurt your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

925
00:51:26.251 --> 00:51:27.690
<v Speaker 2>How has it hurt you live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

926
00:51:27.691 --> 00:51:30.840
<v Speaker 2>when my daughter broke her arm and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>put up a go fund me page,</v>

927
00:51:30.841 --> 00:51:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I was viciously attack because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>expect me to have funds but they don't</v>

928
00:51:34.681 --> 00:51:35.610
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.310
<v Speaker 2>things need to have funds because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and the book.</v>

930
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.350
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing.</v>

931
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I borrowed money to get here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people don't know that I'm wearing</v>

932
00:51:44.491 --> 00:51:48.210
<v Speaker 2>a shirt from my friend because he funded</v>
<v Speaker 2>me to be here,</v>

933
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd have food while I was here.</v>

934
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like that real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

935
00:51:51.181 --> 00:51:56.181
<v Speaker 2>so people don't want me to not succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I hurt third image of me if I don't</v>

936
00:51:59.041 --> 00:52:02.100
<v Speaker 2>have wealth in addition to being this</v>
<v Speaker 2>person before them.</v>

937
00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think people just,</v>

938
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:05.430
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:52:05.431 --> 00:52:10.230
<v Speaker 2>the people see someone else's life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to assume the worst and they</v>

940
00:52:10.231 --> 00:52:13.020
<v Speaker 2>like to criticize you whenever they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity.</v>

941
00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.020
<v Speaker 2>So if they see any vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pounce and you know what you've</v>

942
00:52:18.331 --> 00:52:21.690
<v Speaker 2>gone through is the opposite of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people go through.</v>

943
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.050
<v Speaker 2>People have difficult times in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life but more than difficult times.</v>

944
00:52:25.051 --> 00:52:29.730
<v Speaker 2>You know what they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have long periods where they don't</v>

945
00:52:29.731 --> 00:52:34.731
<v Speaker 2>have anything happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where life is boring and life is just a</v>

946
00:52:34.971 --> 00:52:39.971
<v Speaker 2>dull gray and life is just work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming home from work and the trials and</v>

947
00:52:41.011 --> 00:52:46.011
<v Speaker 2>tribulations of that and traffic and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of insane experiences that you had</v>

948
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 2>being wrongly convicted and spending 22</v>
<v Speaker 2>years confined in a cage forced to fight</v>

949
00:52:56.970 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 2>because of vicious psychopath guards</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those kinds of experiences or the</v>

950
00:53:03.331 --> 00:53:05.700
<v Speaker 2>experiences that allowed you to come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

951
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:11.510
<v Speaker 2>This very kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very open minded person who's trying to</v>

952
00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:16.650
<v Speaker 2>better yourself and wants to see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best in other people,</v>

953
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.040
<v Speaker 2>the people that go through their life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this dull state of jealousy and</v>

954
00:53:22.681 --> 00:53:27.681
<v Speaker 2>bitterness and resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just constantly focused on</v>

955
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:32.400
<v Speaker 2>themselves as self obsessive culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have.</v>

956
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.940
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things about social media</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's most fucked up is you're looking</v>

957
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:40.380
<v Speaker 2>at all these other people's lives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shedding on them and comparing yourself</v>

958
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:45.381
<v Speaker 2>to them and finding faults in them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking them in the comments section</v>

959
00:53:46.201 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 2>and attacking what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people that are doing that,</v>

960
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Speaker 2>they're all doing that because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

961
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 2>they're in agony during a different kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of agony than you.</v>

962
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.100
<v Speaker 2>But it's an agony of nothing.</v>

963
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:58.480
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I looked at it and I thought,</v>

964
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I try to craft a beautiful message on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social medias so that I don't get</v>

965
00:54:03.731 --> 00:54:06.510
<v Speaker 3>caught up in arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always try to show the good dude</v>

966
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:09.100
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I love like the good news</v>

967
00:54:09.101 --> 00:54:11.710
<v Speaker 3>network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try and deliberately stay away from</v>

968
00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.860
<v Speaker 3>things that poisoned my mind cause I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to contribute.</v>

969
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get caught up in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump era argument or the previous</v>

970
00:54:18.401 --> 00:54:22.120
<v Speaker 3>argument or the new argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to post meaningful messages of</v>

971
00:54:22.121 --> 00:54:26.320
<v Speaker 3>good because that's my overall message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought recently maybe I can</v>

972
00:54:26.321 --> 00:54:29.290
<v Speaker 3>contrive three beautiful messages for</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

973
00:54:29.291 --> 00:54:30.490
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Instagram,</v>

974
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.180
<v Speaker 3>and I could leave out this wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 3>message and then I can go about my</v>

975
00:54:34.181 --> 00:54:38.350
<v Speaker 3>business of going back into schools and</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to students because it gets too</v>

976
00:54:38.351 --> 00:54:40.270
<v Speaker 3>chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

977
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.810
<v Speaker 3>in addition to all the lovely messages</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

978
00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:47.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful human beings that listened to</v>

979
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:49.810
<v Speaker 3>me speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they saw the film fear of 13,</v>

980
00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.350
<v Speaker 3>read one of my books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also a lot of women out there,</v>

981
00:54:53.351 --> 00:54:55.600
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd been harassing me and</v>

982
00:54:55.601 --> 00:54:58.720
<v Speaker 3>bothering me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's put a lot of conflict in my</v>

983
00:54:58.721 --> 00:55:02.410
<v Speaker 3>life and I don't want that harass you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bothering you.</v>

984
00:55:02.411 --> 00:55:05.200
<v Speaker 3>How a lot of women fall in love because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the film.</v>

985
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.050
<v Speaker 3>The film made me look very attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about</v>

986
00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:10.060
<v Speaker 2>women and men that are on death row?</v>

987
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.570
<v Speaker 3>There's the one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

988
00:55:11.571 --> 00:55:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to it.</v>

989
00:55:12.531 --> 00:55:14.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll contact me and tell me about</v>

990
00:55:14.091 --> 00:55:15.890
<v Speaker 3>their inmate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an inmate,</v>

991
00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:18.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a death row prisoner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on death row.</v>

992
00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:21.520
<v Speaker 3>That is a strange obsession that some</v>
<v Speaker 3>women have it.</v>

993
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:25.460
<v Speaker 3>And it goes to a psychological feature</v>
<v Speaker 3>of women,</v>

994
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:28.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who can fix things with their loan.</v>

995
00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:32.330
<v Speaker 3>So they want me to deceive my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be with them,</v>

996
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:36.320
<v Speaker 3>but not be deceitful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want me to ignore all the social</v>

997
00:55:36.321 --> 00:55:38.930
<v Speaker 3>chaos I could cause to go and leave a</v>
<v Speaker 3>family to be with them,</v>

998
00:55:38.931 --> 00:55:42.410
<v Speaker 3>but they still want to harass me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was so bad recently,</v>

999
00:55:42.411 --> 00:55:45.080
<v Speaker 3>even on my anniversary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to cut off the people who were</v>

1000
00:55:45.081 --> 00:55:46.820
<v Speaker 3>bothering me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

1001
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an act of stalker in my life.</v>

1002
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all kinds of crazy.</v>

1003
00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gone through a lot of experiences</v>

1004
00:55:52.581 --> 00:55:54.530
<v Speaker 3>where the social media is really tested</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

1005
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.870
<v Speaker 3>So I thought I'm going to try and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the dude.</v>

1006
00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.050
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to execute me said that</v>

1007
00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:01.910
<v Speaker 3>twice the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dude is the guy that knows art.</v>

1008
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:04.700
<v Speaker 3>So this is my last scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean like from the Big Lebowski?</v>

<v Speaker 3>like the dude so seriously.</v>

<v Speaker 3>everything hit the fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is before things went tits up.</v>

1036
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this real great blessing.</v>

1037
00:57:18.851 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 3>So Alejandro Monte Verde,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1038
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Speaker 3>who did the little boy with a Kevin</v>
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>

1039
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:27.230
<v Speaker 3>he has an amazing life story himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean his,</v>

1040
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:30.310
<v Speaker 3>his family was abducted by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kidnappers and executed.</v>

1041
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:31.810
<v Speaker 3>This is real drama.</v>

1042
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 3>The day I meet this man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm at a red carpet event in La and he</v>

1043
00:57:37.241 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 3>goes home and watches fear of 13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he comes back and he tells me,</v>

1044
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make your movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to help you.</v>

1045
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but God told me there's certain movies</v>

1046
00:57:48.371 --> 00:57:50.800
<v Speaker 3>that have to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's making one right now with Tim</v>

1047
00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Ballard from the CIA about um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rescuing children from the sex trades</v>

1048
00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:57.310
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's doing really serious work.</v>

1049
00:57:57.311 --> 00:57:58.720
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So make a feature.</v>

1050
00:57:58.721 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Films that are going to make a feature</v>
<v Speaker 3>film about me called conviction right</v>

1051
00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.100
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be changed,</v>

1052
00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 3>but I got the script and it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

1053
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:08.140
<v Speaker 3>man to read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we have all these a list actors.</v>

1054
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:11.050
<v Speaker 3>And my dream of course was Chris Pine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think he's one of the best.</v>

1055
00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have no say.</v>

1056
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 3>But I get this amazing chance to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>out here and meet all these people for</v>

1057
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 3>the film being made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I realize it's all meant to beam and</v>

1058
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:26.731
<v Speaker 3>like all this crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe if I craft my message right,</v>

1059
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:31.060
<v Speaker 3>I can step back and let people</v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate the message I had without</v>

1060
00:58:31.061 --> 00:58:33.250
<v Speaker 3>distorting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I don't want to ruin it.</v>

1061
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go too far and end up</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a fool of myself when I thought</v>

1062
00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:42.910
<v Speaker 3>the right thing to do was teach people</v>
<v Speaker 3>about neuroplasticity and how to make</v>

1063
00:58:42.911 --> 00:58:47.270
<v Speaker 3>yourself a really bad ass outside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ring by being a kind man and how to</v>

1064
00:58:47.271 --> 00:58:50.980
<v Speaker 3>rarely make yourself a really nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>person to the family and loved ones by</v>

1065
00:58:50.981 --> 00:58:55.480
<v Speaker 3>having the self respect about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be patient in life and things like</v>

1066
00:58:55.481 --> 00:58:56.314
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1067
00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.840
<v Speaker 3>and don't ruin it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I,</v>

1068
00:58:58.841 --> 00:59:00.850
<v Speaker 3>you keep saying don't ruin it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1069
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:03.700
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one thing to take into</v>

1070
00:59:03.701 --> 00:59:07.360
<v Speaker 3>consideration is when you do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a go fund me or any,</v>

1071
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:12.220
<v Speaker 3>anytime there's anything controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are magnets for hate and you might</v>

1072
00:59:12.221 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 3>think that everyone hates you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you're dealing with is a very</v>

1073
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:20.690
<v Speaker 3>small amount of people from a very large</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of people that,</v>

1074
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you thinking about the whole</v>

1075
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.791
<v Speaker 2>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1076
00:59:22.791 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 2>and all the English speaking people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with hundreds and</v>

1077
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.150
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of millions of people that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve so much in what you said.</v>

1078
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm here now because on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>website,</v>

1079
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.870
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] dot org we organized so</v>
<v Speaker 2>today's listeners can go there and</v>

1080
00:59:35.871 --> 00:59:39.710
<v Speaker 2>download copies of my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get out of destitute times.</v>

1081
00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I can get my life together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did everything we could knowing that</v>

1082
00:59:43.221 --> 00:59:44.870
<v Speaker 2>this podcast is reaching a million</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1083
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:46.280
<v Speaker 2>So you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1084
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean even you like your social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean is just the thing is to not</v>

1085
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 2>get caught up in the numbers that come</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you that are negative because it's</v>

1086
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:57.320
<v Speaker 2>just a sheer matter of volume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1087
00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:59.450
<v Speaker 2>If you're reaching people through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

1088
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.810
<v Speaker 2>you're reaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows how many human beings.</v>

1089
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I think one out of a hundred is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the type of person that wants to send</v>

1090
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:11.600
<v Speaker 2>a hateful message because it's easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have to look you in</v>

1091
01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:12.650
<v Speaker 2>the eyes when they do it.</v>

1092
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:16.040
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to feel any social</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

1093
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to feel your pain when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they insult you or,</v>

1094
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.070
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say awful things,</v>

1095
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:24.950
<v Speaker 2>but you or your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it because they want to</v>

1096
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Speaker 2>affect you because they're hurting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hurting for a very different</v>

1097
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:32.330
<v Speaker 2>reason than the way you're hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is what's wrong with social</v>

1098
01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:36.170
<v Speaker 2>media is because human beings are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant to communicate that way.</v>

1099
01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:41.290
<v Speaker 2>We lose our humanity in this very</v>
<v Speaker 2>shallow form of interaction because all</v>

1100
01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:45.800
<v Speaker 2>those parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's what's important about people's</v>

1101
01:00:45.801 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 2>looking them in the eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to them,</v>

1102
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:50.090
<v Speaker 2>hugging them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaking their hand,</v>

1103
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:55.070
<v Speaker 2>communicating honestly and anytime you</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're missing any of those pieces.</v>

1104
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.400
<v Speaker 2>When you communicate dishonesty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't want to shake someone's</v>

1105
01:00:58.401 --> 01:00:59.540
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't want to look them in the</v>

1106
01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:00.950
<v Speaker 2>eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't want to enter in your</v>

1107
01:01:00.951 --> 01:01:01.784
<v Speaker 2>interact with them.</v>

1108
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 2>When you don't care about them as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

1109
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:08.000
<v Speaker 2>all those things leave you feeling like</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and all those.</v>

1110
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:09.230
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1111
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:13.940
<v Speaker 2>The social media is the worst form of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's just text.</v>

1112
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:17.200
<v Speaker 2>You have to interpret it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the fuck is going on</v>

1113
01:01:17.201 --> 01:01:18.830
<v Speaker 2>in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know who they are,</v>

1114
01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.340
<v Speaker 2>but you read that text and you absorb it</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

1115
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.640
<v Speaker 2>You absorb a personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take it in the worst possible form</v>

1116
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:29.570
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel that critique in your chest,</v>

1117
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.430
<v Speaker 2>you feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel it in your head.</v>

1118
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.710
<v Speaker 2>And now I guess I got caught up in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>notion that</v>

1119
01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I could just copy a normal guy and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a normal job and people would leave me</v>

1120
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1121
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.630
<v Speaker 2>they would if you weren't on social</v>
<v Speaker 2>media and uh,</v>

1122
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:46.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've already entered that form so you</v>

1123
01:01:46.611 --> 01:01:47.960
<v Speaker 2>don't have to stay in that form.</v>

1124
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.250
<v Speaker 2>But it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing.</v>

1125
01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Even if you do use that form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you can do.</v>

1126
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 2>You just don't interact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Sal is,</v>

1127
01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said.</v>

1128
01:01:55.971 --> 01:01:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I was on it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for people to understand that</v>

1129
01:01:59.031 --> 01:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>are on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1130
01:01:59.991 --> 01:02:00.741
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked all,</v>

1131
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:03.200
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to interact with me because I</v>

1132
01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:04.400
<v Speaker 2>love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1133
01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:08.540
<v Speaker 2>and I want you to recognize that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing you and I appreciate that</v>

1134
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:10.640
<v Speaker 2>from people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to understand the volume</v>

1135
01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>of people that someone like you is</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with.</v>

1136
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:15.350
<v Speaker 2>That's what I tried to convey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I try very sincerely,</v>

1137
01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:18.170
<v Speaker 2>never to be ignorant to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1138
01:02:18.171 --> 01:02:19.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking mind blowing joke.</v>

1139
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Cause I had my mind made up and now I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized that I do.</v>

1140
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 3>And it all goes back to a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were boy Jason Daily?</v>

1141
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Me and him were driving along the four</v>
<v Speaker 3>five one day in a film for it.</v>

1142
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Fear of 13 is about to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I told him I didn't want it to come</v>

1143
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:39.000
<v Speaker 3>out and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't own that film.</v>

1144
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Every kid that's ever had a shitty</v>
<v Speaker 3>childhood owns that film.</v>

1145
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Everybody who's got a broken marriage or</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shitty lifers really struggling owns</v>

1146
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:49.650
<v Speaker 3>that film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you fuck this up,</v>

1147
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:53.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll never be your friend again man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was right.</v>

1148
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:58.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't own the fear of 13 and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>own really anything of it,</v>

1149
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:02.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's message is so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did what I could to tell my story</v>

1150
01:03:02.671 --> 01:03:05.670
<v Speaker 3>because we're all living our life as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

1151
01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:07.620
<v Speaker 3>but we can only convey it as a memory.</v>

1152
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:11.850
<v Speaker 3>And I did beautifully for myself and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>so proud of the effort I made.</v>

1153
01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't care that the director rob me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll make my way.</v>

1154
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what I went through to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment because I truly appreciate the</v>

1155
01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:23.280
<v Speaker 3>person who wrote me last night and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks ago I was released from a</v>

1156
01:03:23.281 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 3>mental hospital after trying to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

1157
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.910
<v Speaker 3>And my mom sat me down and made me watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>film now,</v>

1158
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 3>and the last two weeks I've been going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to therapy and I'm getting my shit</v>

1159
01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:36.540
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't film Joe and I don't own my</v>

1160
01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:39.450
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess my message is taken on by the</v>

1161
01:03:39.451 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 3>people who love me or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1162
01:03:42.121 --> 01:03:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be bothered by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>negatives.</v>

1163
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I had a terrible experience with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stalker for 12 years who won't leave me</v>

1164
01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:51.600
<v Speaker 3>alone in it cost me and my daughter in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>divorce,</v>

1165
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.860
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of crazy stuff.</v>

1166
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 3>So it was really affecting me and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>current wife and I didn't like it,</v>

1167
01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:59.970
<v Speaker 3>but I think I'm going to actually beat a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude and just hang around for a little</v>

1168
01:03:59.971 --> 01:04:02.520
<v Speaker 3>bit longer and make you proud of me for</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I do from heroin.</v>

1169
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about me man.</v>

1170
01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Now everyone that I love as though to</v>
<v Speaker 3>always be on that list,</v>

1171
01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1172
01:04:09.091 --> 01:04:13.200
<v Speaker 3>that's what you use for motivation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great and there's nothing wrong</v>

1173
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:14.650
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1174
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 3>but I think that what you can do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you are doing,</v>

1175
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.190
<v Speaker 3>it show that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can overcome things.</v>

1176
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 3>You can overcome horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the most horrible experiences a</v>

1177
01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:30.270
<v Speaker 3>person could ever face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can overcome them and you have.</v>

1178
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:34.560
<v Speaker 3>And those messages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give people inspiration.</v>

1179
01:04:34.561 --> 01:04:37.770
<v Speaker 3>And inspiration is one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 3>things you can give a person and her</v>

1180
01:04:37.771 --> 01:04:39.540
<v Speaker 3>that you inspiring me today.</v>

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:30.870
<v Speaker 3>My kindness makes me able to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My good heart is made better by the fact</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1202
01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1203
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:45.190

<v Speaker 3>I didn't know his story,</v>

1204
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:50.820
<v Speaker 3>but one day I get contacted by a man</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's seen the fear of 13 and I learned</v>

1205
01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:54.280
<v Speaker 3>that he went to university out here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he became a lawyer because of a promise</v>

1206
01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:58.210
<v Speaker 3>to his mother to be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes to the mosque every Friday and</v>

1207
01:05:58.211 --> 01:06:02.500
<v Speaker 3>becomes close friends with Mohamad a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neko to dinner every night with Mei Mei</v>

1208
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:03.370
<v Speaker 3>on Fridays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1209
01:06:03.371 --> 01:06:06.340
<v Speaker 3>and he become real close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he tells me this story how at a</v>

1210
01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:08.620
<v Speaker 3>young age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed looks him in the face and says,</v>

1211
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.920
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be one of the men that</v>
<v Speaker 3>carries my message in life.</v>

1212
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.180
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 22 what could I possibly have to</v>

1213
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:20.710
<v Speaker 3>offer anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he goes through this experience and</v>

1214
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:25.570
<v Speaker 3>on the date of Muhammad Ali had approval</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the government patent office for</v>

1215
01:06:25.571 --> 01:06:28.240
<v Speaker 3>this bracelet that says within good</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has god.</v>

1216
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.840
<v Speaker 3>He called me in England where I was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1217
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.330
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a question for you.</v>

1218
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I saw your film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot about you since then.</v>

1219
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.900
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't you bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

1220
01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Why are you still willing to believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1221
01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.600
<v Speaker 3>my mother never prayed for anything but</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1222
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:50.530
<v Speaker 3>She always told me that only good there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was was an was within God.</v>

1223
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.680
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1224
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

<v Speaker 3>men I ever met my life.</v>

1247
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.980

<v Speaker 3>I'm already changing things about my</v>

1248
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:14.590
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>retarded,</v>

<v Speaker 3>mindless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry person.</v>

1253

<v Speaker 3>been handed this shit.</v>

1274
01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember reading stories about</v>
<v Speaker 3>you going to the MMA and just doing it</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1277
01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:44.840
<v Speaker 3>that's true in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1278
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:46.160
<v Speaker 3>When I first started working for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>

1279
01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:47.900
<v Speaker 3>I did the first if not for money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1280
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.930
<v Speaker 3>I did the first 15 shows for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For free.</v>

1281
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See what I mean?</v>

1282
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was probably foolish financially.</v>

1283
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.290
<v Speaker 2>My manager didn't think it was a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

1284
01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1285
01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.713
<v Speaker 2>I was enjoying it.</v>

1286
01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1287
01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:03.360
<v Speaker 3>it's what I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1288
01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:04.740
<v Speaker 3>I want to be the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man</v>

1289
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:08.220
<v Speaker 2>was also struggling company that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>believed in and I wanted to help him.</v>

1290
01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is interesting</v>

1291
01:10:10.981 --> 01:10:13.710
<v Speaker 2>because you have one theme that you keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeating,</v>

1292
01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.290
<v Speaker 2>that you want to do things for other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1293
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:19.460
<v Speaker 2>He keeps saying that like you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that from May.</v>

1294
01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:23.940
<v Speaker 2>May you wanted to make me proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a constant theme that you,</v>

1295
01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:27.840
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to do good for other people.</v>

1296
01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:32.490
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing mindset for someone who's been</v>

1297
01:10:32.491 --> 01:10:34.290
<v Speaker 2>through everything that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

1298
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.670
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sentiment,</v>

1299
01:10:35.671 --> 01:10:38.130
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and then your gratitude.</v>

1300
01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.470
<v Speaker 2>That's another very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful thing.</v>

1301
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love and gratitude are two of the most</v>

1302
01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:48.840
<v Speaker 2>incredible expressions and some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most influential.</v>

1303
01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Because when you showed true gratitude</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people and true love to people,</v>

1304
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:56.760
<v Speaker 2>they feel that that affects the way they</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with the rest of the people</v>

1305
01:10:56.761 --> 01:10:58.050
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to experience.</v>

1306
01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Like if they run into a new person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just moments after meeting you,</v>

1307
01:11:01.981 --> 01:11:06.240
<v Speaker 2>they will be nicer and they will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will feel that gratitude and feel</v>

1308
01:11:06.241 --> 01:11:07.350
<v Speaker 2>that love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real,</v>

1309
01:11:07.351 --> 01:11:09.630
<v Speaker 2>and that's one thing that we all can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1310
01:11:09.631 --> 01:11:12.180
<v Speaker 2>this thought that we're all a powerless</v>
<v Speaker 2>and helpless.</v>

1311
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:17.810
<v Speaker 2>It's of the problems with there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>society is that the society is so</v>

1312
01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:20.520
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have so much information coming at</v>

1313
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the message is that what's important</v>

1314
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1315
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:29.571
<v Speaker 2>beautiful girls with short skirts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast shiny cars and big giant houses and</v>

1316
01:11:31.111 --> 01:11:36.111
<v Speaker 2>private jets and diamond rings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Expensive Watches and all this horse</v>

1317
01:11:37.111 --> 01:11:39.630
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what people seek.</v>

1318
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:44.190
<v Speaker 2>They seek that instead of seeking love</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gratitude because it doesn't seem</v>

1319
01:11:44.191 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 2>that that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's way more important.</v>

1320
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:49.890
<v Speaker 2>It's everything because that literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes the world.</v>

1321
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.110
<v Speaker 2>It changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1322
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought that that expression,</v>

1323
01:11:53.281 --> 01:11:55.440
<v Speaker 2>the wings of the butterfly eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>become a hurricane.</v>

1324
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.390
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking stupid cause that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>work that way.</v>

1325
01:11:57.391 --> 01:12:00.900
<v Speaker 2>A butterfly just generates a very small</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of wind and they're small and it</v>

1326
01:12:00.901 --> 01:12:04.080
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really work that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea behind it,</v>

1327
01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Speaker 2>what what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it,</v>

1328
01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:10.150
<v Speaker 2>what it represents as a metaphor is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally buy your one person that</v>

1329
01:12:14.701 --> 01:12:17.550
<v Speaker 2>lives amongst 300 plus million people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country,</v>

1330
01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:22.320
<v Speaker 2>one person with love and gratitude and</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration,</v>

1331
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.160
<v Speaker 2>especially the way you can express</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that affects people you come in</v>

1332
01:12:28.201 --> 01:12:33.201
<v Speaker 2>contact with and that in turn affects</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people they come in contact with and</v>

1333
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:36.420
<v Speaker 2>that literally can change the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually could change the world.</v>

1334
01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:37.830
<v Speaker 2>That's real necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1335
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it.</v>

1336
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I've helped so many people heal their</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives when I've interacted with them and</v>

1337
01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:46.600
<v Speaker 2>tense time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've made it.</v>

1338
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Let me stop you because this is one</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that you said to me before the</v>

1339
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Speaker 2>podcast and you said it again during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

1340
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.320
<v Speaker 2>The only want to do this one podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to say anymore.</v>

1341
01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.610
<v Speaker 2>And I want to ask you why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have this powerful</v>

1342
01:12:59.611 --> 01:13:02.100
<v Speaker 2>message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more people you reach and the more</v>

1343
01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:04.330
<v Speaker 2>you express yourself with this message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to cheap.</v>

1344
01:13:04.331 --> 01:13:07.050
<v Speaker 2>And your message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're going to do is you're going</v>

1345
01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:10.440
<v Speaker 2>to get it out to more and more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the more people that you can get out</v>

1346
01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:13.410
<v Speaker 2>your words and the way you express</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

1347
01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.920
<v Speaker 2>that's going to affect people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to affect people in a very,</v>

1348
01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:18.990
<v Speaker 2>very positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1349
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.270
<v Speaker 2>But the other side of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one can appreciate is that I'm</v>

1350
01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:26.610
<v Speaker 2>failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been able to get anything</v>

1351
01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:27.810
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to start upon,</v>

1352
01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:28.171
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1353
01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:28.501
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1354
01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:29.251
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

1355
01:13:29.251 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 2>let me stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me stop you.</v>

1356
01:13:30.421 --> 01:13:32.220
<v Speaker 2>You're not failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1357
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:34.680
<v Speaker 2>you've only been out of jail for 13</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1358
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:39.330
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were in jail for 22 years on death</v>

1359
01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:40.980
<v Speaker 2>row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a whole lot of people get</v>

1360
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:44.190
<v Speaker 2>through that experience and can tie</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own fucking shoes after they're</v>

1361
01:13:44.191 --> 01:13:45.390
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1362
01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1363
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:48.300
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have every right in the world to be</v>

1364
01:13:48.301 --> 01:13:51.150
<v Speaker 2>shell shocked and incapacitated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>

1365
01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get things going that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world does not open its doors for you</v>

1366
01:13:56.581 --> 01:13:59.130
<v Speaker 2>and success does not come easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work that way.</v>

1367
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:00.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for you to say you failed,</v>

1368
01:14:00.931 --> 01:14:02.910
<v Speaker 2>you haven't failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've already written books.</v>

1369
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.430
<v Speaker 2>You've already have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a documentary made about you.</v>

1370
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:07.800
<v Speaker 2>You're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the process of making a feature</v>

1371
01:14:07.801 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 2>length film about your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a failure.</v>

1372
01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just failed getting the platforms</v>

1373
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.980
<v Speaker 3>together that I need and I guess</v>

1374
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1375
01:14:16.001 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't always work out right the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>

1376
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:20.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a failure.</v>

1377
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:21.370
<v Speaker 2>You're not a failure.</v>

1378
01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then here's the deal for you,</v>

1379
01:14:22.921 --> 01:14:25.950
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prove your words right to me and come on</v>

1380
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.860
<v Speaker 3>when I get my shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come on my podcast.</v>

1381
01:14:28.861 --> 01:14:30.720
<v Speaker 3>When we finished the conversation,</v>

1382
01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:32.160
<v Speaker 2>later on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do that,</v>

1383
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:34.470
<v Speaker 2>but even if I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>

1384
01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.170
<v Speaker 2>You can do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wow,</v>

1385
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I just want to showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you yourself,</v>

1386
01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:42.000
<v Speaker 2>this idea that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've failed is crazy.</v>

1387
01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have not failed.</v>

1388
01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:45.810
<v Speaker 2>If you've done things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1389
01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>everyone does things that don't succeed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you recalibrate and you adjust</v>

1390
01:14:52.261 --> 01:14:55.830
<v Speaker 2>and you try again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one succeeds and wins the world</v>

1391
01:14:55.831 --> 01:14:59.970
<v Speaker 2>championship in their first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one writes a book and without</v>

1392
01:14:59.971 --> 01:15:03.420
<v Speaker 2>learning English and without practicing</v>
<v Speaker 2>essays,</v>

1393
01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:05.760
<v Speaker 2>that becomes the greatest book the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world's ever written,</v>

1394
01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.320
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>

1395
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:08.690
<v Speaker 2>whatever you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1396
01:15:08.691 --> 01:15:11.490
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take time and you learn.</v>

1397
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:16.790
<v Speaker 2>This is what life is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is about this process and through</v>

1398
01:15:16.831 --> 01:15:21.831
<v Speaker 2>that process you find yourself through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difficult tasks that you undertake,</v>

1399
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:28.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe adjust and you become better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said he started a podcast and you</v>

1400
01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:30.420
<v Speaker 2>feel well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long did you do it for?</v>

1401
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I didn't never got off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one believes in me.</v>

1402
01:15:33.031 --> 01:15:35.180
<v Speaker 3>And then I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying,</v>

1403
01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.330
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcasts are easy,</v>

1404
01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:39.100
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that phone you have right there?</v>

1405
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:44.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that phone has a audio recorder</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done by living my $11 phone</v>

1406
01:15:45.821 --> 01:15:46.780
<v Speaker 2>probably does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1407
01:15:46.781 --> 01:15:48.550
<v Speaker 2>they all do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every phone does.</v>

1408
01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.310
<v Speaker 2>That's not $11 madness or regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>android phone.</v>

1409
01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good phone.</v>

1410
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 2>It's one of these wafer these me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>

1411
01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:02.140
<v Speaker 2>if you had this phone fucking 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago that people think you are a wizard.</v>

1412
01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1413
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 2>if he were in the fifth century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1414
01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that phone I'm sure has,</v>

1415
01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.270
<v Speaker 3>you know you're kicking me into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1416
01:16:09.271 --> 01:16:12.540
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to have to respond because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the way I've always been wired.</v>

1417
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:15.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I can do anything.</v>

1418
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:17.131
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1419
01:16:17.131 --> 01:16:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I am all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need never again encouraged me,</v>

1420
01:16:20.071 --> 01:16:20.904
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1421
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.840
<v Speaker 3>If I go around doing that for others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have been rough on myself because I</v>

1422
01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:27.660
<v Speaker 3>thought I'd have a platform and</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish the things that I wanted to</v>

1423
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:30.960
<v Speaker 3>and I felt really shitty that I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to take care and provide for my</v>

1424
01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:33.490
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the heart of it really was</v>

1425
01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:36.180
<v Speaker 3>the struggle and that side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't give a shit about fame.</v>

1426
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.550
<v Speaker 3>I've had the most amazing experiences of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life,</v>

1427
01:16:38.551 --> 01:16:40.860
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my first interviews was the</v>

1428
01:16:40.861 --> 01:16:43.020
<v Speaker 3>village voice and the woman learns me at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end,</v>

1429
01:16:43.021 --> 01:16:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Jennifer Gonnerman's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she says,</v>

1430
01:16:44.311 --> 01:16:46.470
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're living one of the</v>

1431
01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:48.750
<v Speaker 3>greatest stories ever told man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ain't no joke.</v>

1432
01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.690
<v Speaker 3>And every time she's told me that words</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my head,</v>

1433
01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:56.280
<v Speaker 3>I realized comes with a hell of a ride</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a price.</v>

1434
01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:59.190
<v Speaker 3>So if I've got to own it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to own all of it.</v>

1435
01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I keep telling people to own it when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do well.</v>

1436
01:17:01.381 --> 01:17:05.610
<v Speaker 3>So maybe I needed to bounce back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the day I stepped forward and</v>

1437
01:17:05.611 --> 01:17:08.640
<v Speaker 3>start kicking ass again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that will get me out of those</v>

1438
01:17:08.641 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 3>tearful that I've had to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you have every right to have a</v>

1439
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:15.400
<v Speaker 3>struggle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if anybody has any right to,</v>

1440
01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have difficult emotions and a</v>

1441
01:17:18.951 --> 01:17:22.010
<v Speaker 3>difficulty expressing those emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's you.</v>

1442
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:25.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I understand how you could dwell on</v>

1443
01:17:25.131 --> 01:17:29.030
<v Speaker 3>things not succeeding the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>anticipated one of them too.</v>

1444
01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 3>But he just kind of keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1445
01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:32.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm such a honest person.</v>

1446
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 3>I could never come on here and fake it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1447
01:17:34.701 --> 01:17:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I could never do that for you man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that would be so insincere.</v>

1448
01:17:38.031 --> 01:17:40.540
<v Speaker 3>So I just came down here and I decided I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1449
01:17:40.541 --> 01:17:43.030
<v Speaker 3>cause it was poured out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly we did.</v>

1450
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.970
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like the best thing about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like jelly.</v>

1451
01:17:46.971 --> 01:17:49.610
<v Speaker 3>Like you're so like me in so many ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

1452
01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:51.260
<v Speaker 3>on the download,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you just,</v>

1453
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:55.010
<v Speaker 3>he's just want good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you just want to have a purposeful</v>

1454
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:58.640
<v Speaker 3>message that you want to share and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I thought was really cool.</v>

1455
01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 3>I had a really cool experience last</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1456
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I went to East Germany to speak before</v>
<v Speaker 3>company and I met all these Lebanese</v>

1457
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:10.931
<v Speaker 3>refugees after meeting navy seals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dude's on the plane love me man.</v>

1458
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I built them up for being part of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>military system.</v>

1459
01:18:14.601 --> 01:18:17.180
<v Speaker 3>I made them really respect and honor</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

1460
01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Then I was on the streets of Berlin</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out with these Lebanese refugees</v>

1461
01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.790
<v Speaker 3>and I made them feel so good about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that they still believed in each</v>

1462
01:18:25.791 --> 01:18:29.240
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have some magical ability to go</v>

1463
01:18:29.241 --> 01:18:34.241
<v Speaker 3>around and touch different groups and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>message resonates with people who've</v>

1464
01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:37.550
<v Speaker 3>been in the military or have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>through trauma or not been through</v>

1465
01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:39.380
<v Speaker 3>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have a gift.</v>

1466
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:44.410
<v Speaker 3>I know it and I've spoken in some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most prestigious places and one of them</v>

1467
01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 3>is still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the highest honors.</v>

1468
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I spoke at St John's church in London</v>
<v Speaker 3>where a ticket on the Vietnamese monk</v>

1469
01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:56.510
<v Speaker 3>who marched with Martin Luther King in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Selma,</v>

1470
01:18:56.511 --> 01:19:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Alabama spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he used to be my pen pal on death</v>

1471
01:19:00.051 --> 01:19:02.450
<v Speaker 3>row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the first man that gave me</v>

1472
01:19:02.451 --> 01:19:06.470
<v Speaker 3>respect when I was on death row and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>questioned why I didn't have respect a</v>

1473
01:19:06.471 --> 01:19:08.120
<v Speaker 3>lot like you're doing for me today.</v>

1474
01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:11.480
<v Speaker 3>And he taught me to look at myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>

1475
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:16.700
<v Speaker 3>So I went through a whole one year</v>
<v Speaker 3>period of my experiences before I could</v>

1476
01:19:16.701 --> 01:19:18.710
<v Speaker 3>speak at that church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I did,</v>

1477
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.450
<v Speaker 3>I was absolutely flawless because I knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my friend was there and he was</v>

1478
01:19:23.451 --> 01:19:26.960
<v Speaker 3>guiding me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And somewhere within me I have some</v>

1479
01:19:26.961 --> 01:19:29.480
<v Speaker 3>magical ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where it comes from,</v>

1480
01:19:29.481 --> 01:19:34.481
<v Speaker 3>but I have an order to skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once I'm past these dark days,</v>

1481
01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I can lay it down well so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can carry a message beautifully to</v>

1482
01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:44.831
<v Speaker 3>educational fields purposefully into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporate fields or wherever I want to</v>

1483
01:19:45.651 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 3>go and I love it that I do have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>winning hand and I have a gift behind it</v>

1484
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 3>that was earned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not control yourself.</v>

1485
01:19:53.061 --> 01:19:54.770
<v Speaker 3>How to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about what you were saying</v>

1486
01:19:54.771 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 3>earlier about learning how to speak so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could speak at your own</v>

1487
01:19:57.681 --> 01:19:58.514
<v Speaker 3>execution.</v>

1488
01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:01.550
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's a powerful motivating</v>
<v Speaker 3>force.</v>

1489
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to learn all of the world's</v>

1490
01:20:04.461 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 3>religions so that you understood what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>means to speak.</v>

1491
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Do you know in the Sanskrit religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the words are used as</v>

1492
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 3>descriptive forms of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So chair isn't the object,</v>

1493
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:20.250
<v Speaker 3>it's the feeling of sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have a responsibility and not</v>

1494
01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.860
<v Speaker 3>only in the words that you choose to</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak,</v>

1495
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 3>but in a manner that you deliver them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the vibrations within you that you</v>

1496
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:32.001
<v Speaker 3>carrying leash share with another person</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there is a receptor within us</v>

1497
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.230
<v Speaker 3>all to the truth and it resonates and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>rises within us.</v>

1498
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:42.560
<v Speaker 3>And so I found that powerful ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to myself in that manner so that I</v>

1499
01:20:43.441 --> 01:20:48.441
<v Speaker 3>could love myself and I would stand in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wouldn'to of my cell and talk to</v>

1500
01:20:49.381 --> 01:20:54.381
<v Speaker 3>myself or quote beautiful texts and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>loved reading the Prophet I Kahleel</v>

1501
01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:55.470
<v Speaker 3>Goubran.</v>

1502
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I read it over 20 times because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought his message was so powerful</v>

1503
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 3>because he lost his entire family while</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote this book over a three year</v>

1504
01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:08.691
<v Speaker 3>journey and although I might have come</v>
<v Speaker 3>back from the ashes like pg Carnahan and</v>

1505
01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:11.940
<v Speaker 3>the man who beat would be king from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roger Kipling,</v>

1506
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:18.380
<v Speaker 3>I still feel like I have a valid message</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivating me to go forward.</v>

1507
01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:24.230
<v Speaker 3>And my idea from this wine on is I want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go home to Laura and the kids and</v>

1508
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:28.110
<v Speaker 3>regroup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get myself together and I know a lot of</v>

1509
01:21:28.111 --> 01:21:31.590
<v Speaker 3>people are going to contact me because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your grace to have me on your show</v>

1510
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:35.460
<v Speaker 3>and what I plan to do over the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years,</v>

1511
01:21:35.461 --> 01:21:40.461
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is I want to show myself not just user</v>

1512
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:44.190
<v Speaker 3>that I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being a kind man.</v>

1513
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Being a goodhearted man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being meticulously polite doesn't mean</v>

1514
01:21:49.021 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 3>you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you're a full and if</v>

1515
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:55.110
<v Speaker 3>people take advantage of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's down to you to take it as an insult</v>

1516
01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:58.440
<v Speaker 3>or rise the fuck up about the insult and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just move past it.</v>

1517
01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:03.900
<v Speaker 3>The reason I'm not bitter is because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't take it personal when they broke</v>

1518
01:22:03.901 --> 01:22:06.420
<v Speaker 3>my teeth and put me in death row and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tortured me.</v>

1519
01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:11.640
<v Speaker 3>I didn't take it personal because right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now there are 2 million people</v>

1520
01:22:11.641 --> 01:22:16.410
<v Speaker 3>incarcerated in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't take it personal because 150</v>

1521
01:22:16.411 --> 01:22:21.411
<v Speaker 3>other men got off of death row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm able to function because</v>

1522
01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:25.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't take life personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd take love personally.</v>

1523
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I take it so personally to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to love myself.</v>

1524
01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:31.470
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how hard it is to get a</v>

1525
01:22:31.471 --> 01:22:35.240
<v Speaker 3>woman to look at herself without looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a fall they can't stand?</v>

1526
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how hard it is to get a man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be honest with his emotions,</v>

1527
01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.010
<v Speaker 3>thinking that he's weak?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he does,</v>

1528
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I would rather have tears on my face</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking down the street and frustration.</v>

1529
01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Then just rip on somebody and hurt</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

1530
01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.040
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of caliber of level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity I want to find them myself.</v>

1531
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:55.770
<v Speaker 3>And I think we all do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the message,</v>

1532
01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:58.680
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been distorted by the social media</v>

1533
01:22:58.681 --> 01:23:02.900
<v Speaker 3>so badly that we need more talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would all,</v>

1534
01:23:02.901 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>I would dream of having a late night</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk and</v>

1535
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 2>play some of my calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>music and talk to people,</v>

1536
01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:13.741
<v Speaker 2>just average people and just open it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to just share what's good</v>

1537
01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:19.381
<v Speaker 2>about me because my mother was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't have just been a terrible waste</v>

1538
01:23:19.721 --> 01:23:22.930
<v Speaker 2>of time if I got out of jail and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just another asshole on the street,</v>

1539
01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.600
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1540
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:30.010
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that keeps coming up</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you are longing for community.</v>

1541
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:34.240
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about a lot lately because I</v>

1542
01:23:34.241 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 2>think one of the things that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly searching for in this world</v>

1543
01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:40.570
<v Speaker 2>is happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1544
01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:45.760
<v Speaker 2>So one thing that people don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wish they had that comes up over</v>

1545
01:23:45.761 --> 01:23:50.020
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reoccurring theme and one of the</v>

1546
01:23:50.021 --> 01:23:54.430
<v Speaker 2>things that's also a big part of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>life that we are all are living right</v>

1547
01:23:54.431 --> 01:23:59.431
<v Speaker 2>now is this very recent disconnect</v>
<v Speaker 2>between our neighbors,</v>

1548
01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:06.010
<v Speaker 2>our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by commuting to work and it's being</v>

1549
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:11.011
<v Speaker 2>stuck in this stuffy environment where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can express yourself normally and</v>

1550
01:24:11.321 --> 01:24:13.870
<v Speaker 2>this is the majority of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of your time.</v>

1551
01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:17.350
<v Speaker 2>And then we wonder why we're sad and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't spend enough time together with</v>

1552
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:18.550
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

1553
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:23.050
<v Speaker 2>here's when you aren't sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're having fun with your friends</v>

1554
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 2>because that's what human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant to do.</v>

1555
01:24:25.481 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're meant to work together to do</v>

1556
01:24:27.911 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 2>something together like something</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful core of your healing.</v>

1557
01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:34.570
<v Speaker 2>It's meant we're meant to have community</v>
<v Speaker 2>or meant to have friends and we're meant</v>

1558
01:24:34.571 --> 01:24:37.660
<v Speaker 2>to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll meant to share experiences were</v>

1559
01:24:37.661 --> 01:24:41.770
<v Speaker 2>meant to care for each other and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not happening in your life,</v>

1560
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:46.090
<v Speaker 2>you feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is spreading the</v>

1561
01:24:46.091 --> 01:24:48.790
<v Speaker 2>fingers of your community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're spreading the branches of your</v>

1562
01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:51.730
<v Speaker 2>community by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by expressing yourself and helping other</v>

1563
01:24:51.731 --> 01:24:53.650
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by expressing yourself and inspiring</v>

1564
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:56.530
<v Speaker 2>other people by sending your message out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1565
01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:00.340
<v Speaker 2>This is a type of community for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are longing for community.</v>

1566
01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:04.420
<v Speaker 2>You're connecting with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are longing to feel a</v>

1567
01:25:04.421 --> 01:25:05.254
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>

1568
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.690
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something that's missing.</v>

1569
01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Is this something that's greatly missing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our society?</v>

1570
01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:15.930
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand it more than most because</v>

1571
01:25:16.421 --> 01:25:21.421
<v Speaker 2>your time that they forced you to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate from community that they did.</v>

1572
01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.000
<v Speaker 2>They gave you the opposite of community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you communicated,</v>

1573
01:25:25.001 --> 01:25:27.400
<v Speaker 2>they beat you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave you the opposite of the</v>

1574
01:25:27.401 --> 01:25:29.200
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They locked you in a cage,</v>

1575
01:25:29.201 --> 01:25:32.500
<v Speaker 2>didn't let you mingle with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the people that were around</v>

1576
01:25:32.501 --> 01:25:33.880
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't want to mingle with them.</v>

1577
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Horrific people that are just the worst</v>
<v Speaker 2>examples of a life gone wrong and you're</v>

1578
01:25:40.811 --> 01:25:42.850
<v Speaker 2>surrounded with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still emerged.</v>

1579
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:45.640
<v Speaker 2>And that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that alone gives people hope.</v>

1580
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:49.000
<v Speaker 2>And that hope is something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody needs is a good person on</v>

1581
01:25:49.001 --> 01:25:50.200
<v Speaker 2>death row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the point that,</v>

1582
01:25:50.201 --> 01:25:52.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man named Tom Lowenstein wanted to</v>

1583
01:25:52.421 --> 01:25:55.870
<v Speaker 2>write a book about me and I turned them</v>
<v Speaker 2>on to water oh,</v>

1584
01:25:55.871 --> 01:25:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Grad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's still sitting on death row.</v>

1585
01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.340
<v Speaker 2>And I asked them to write the book about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walter.</v>

1586
01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 2>And then CNN death row stories wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and have Susan's</v>

1587
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:06.770
<v Speaker 3>friend and narrate my story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two and a half years ago,</v>

1588
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I told him again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>water still on death row,</v>

1589
01:26:09.951 --> 01:26:11.330
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do for him.</v>

1590
01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Now what's Walter Store that Walter was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walter,</v>

1591
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:17.420
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab was convicted of killing a little</v>

1592
01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 3>girl and put her in a TV box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't do it.</v>

1593
01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:24.710
<v Speaker 3>And he had the misfortune of having his</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother attacked in his house and nearly</v>

1594
01:26:24.711 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 3>murdered and being brought in for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation.</v>

1595
01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.820
<v Speaker 3>And then simply asked by detective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1596
01:26:29.821 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 3>there's a girl killed on your street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know anything about it?</v>

1597
01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.081
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1598
01:26:33.081 --> 01:26:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>

1599
01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 3>he's facing death row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a jury finds him not guilty,</v>

1600
01:26:39.741 --> 01:26:43.280
<v Speaker 3>but before the sabotage of one juror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ends up on death row.</v>

1601
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:46.250
<v Speaker 3>When the SEC sabotage of one juror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he voted not guilty.</v>

1602
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:47.940
<v Speaker 3>And then he'd products out during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>vault.</v>

1603
01:26:47.941 --> 01:26:48.651
<v Speaker 3>Dare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lied,</v>

1604
01:26:48.651 --> 01:26:48.990
<v Speaker 3>I lied.</v>

1605
01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:49.910
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's guilty.</v>

1606
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.220
<v Speaker 3>So they declare a mistrial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the guy,</v>

1607
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:55.880
<v Speaker 3>they called him on senior to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that now he confessed to him,</v>

1608
01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:59.930
<v Speaker 3>they have a second trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they put all their on death row and I</v>

1609
01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:02.510
<v Speaker 3>meet him and everybody's abusing shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of him.</v>

1610
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the unnatural thing.</v>

1611
01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I stood up for him for all the bullies</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I told the two men that were abusing</v>

1612
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:13.220
<v Speaker 3>them if they put their hands on him</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1613
01:27:13.221 --> 01:27:16.700
<v Speaker 3>I was going to get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I started helping Walter with his</v>

1614
01:27:16.701 --> 01:27:19.160
<v Speaker 3>lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ever since I got out of prison,</v>

1615
01:27:19.161 --> 01:27:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I kept my word to stick by them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight for him.</v>

1616
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:24.920
<v Speaker 3>So I gave up opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could have changed my life.</v>

1617
01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:28.670
<v Speaker 3>And now death row stories is back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do my story.</v>

1618
01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 3>And Walter is still on death row right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1619
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's innocent.</v>

1620
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:35.720
<v Speaker 3>And what can be done to help walter</v>
<v Speaker 3>contact Tom Wolfe and ask him why the</v>

1621
01:27:35.721 --> 01:27:40.610
<v Speaker 3>innocence projects and the and integrity</v>
<v Speaker 3>units won't take up his case.</v>

1622
01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:42.290
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1623
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.710
<v Speaker 3>it was clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you see the show on a death</v>

1624
01:27:45.711 --> 01:27:47.990
<v Speaker 3>row stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just laid out so clear.</v>

1625
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:51.500
<v Speaker 3>I was a little disappointed they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>mention me that I turned them on to</v>

1626
01:27:51.501 --> 01:27:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Walter Myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Selfless sac was overlooked but that was</v>

1627
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:57.980
<v Speaker 3>just my ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I always am like that and that's</v>

1628
01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:01.460
<v Speaker 3>what I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that they were despicable joe and</v>

1629
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:04.100
<v Speaker 3>the acts that a lot of men did word</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacle,</v>

1630
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:09.500
<v Speaker 3>but if I let that stop me from loving</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of them than I was going to be</v>

1631
01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:11.390
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1632
01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:14.390
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them were really messed up man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the ones that needed it,</v>

1633
01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I set aside everything and still cared</v>
<v Speaker 3>about men.</v>

1634
01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.860
<v Speaker 3>So spell out Walter's name for</v>

1646
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:47.240

1647
01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Ernie Simmons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got out here the trials of Walter Al</v>

1648
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Grod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shocking murder,</v>

1649
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:56.240
<v Speaker 3>so-called confessions and notorious</v>
<v Speaker 3>snitch to send a man to death row.</v>

1650
01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Tom Lowenstein came to me while I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>still on death row in 2002 and he said,</v>

1651
01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:02.730
<v Speaker 3>nick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

1652
01:29:02.731 --> 01:29:04.650
<v Speaker 3>your story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to write a book about you.</v>

1653
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:05.630
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1654
01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:08.580
<v Speaker 3>that's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how about the guy sitting next to</v>

1655
01:29:08.581 --> 01:29:10.350
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have lawyers or DNA or</v>

1656
01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:11.340
<v Speaker 3>anybody to help him.</v>

1657
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 3>How about helping him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1658
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:15.480
<v Speaker 3>are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're given up an opportunity.</v>

1659
01:29:15.481 --> 01:29:16.314
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1660
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.170
<v Speaker 3>it ain't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this man.</v>

1661
01:29:19.650 --> 01:29:23.130
<v Speaker 3>He has no lawyers like I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the pattern.</v>

1662
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:27.150
<v Speaker 3>That's who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't take credit for it,</v>

1663
01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:31.800
<v Speaker 3>but I really did try to help another man</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I felt like I would be so</v>

1664
01:29:31.801 --> 01:29:34.650
<v Speaker 3>disappointing if I just took and took</v>
<v Speaker 3>and took for myself</v>

1665
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually grateful I didn't go on</v>

1666
01:29:38.191 --> 01:29:43.191
<v Speaker 3>your podcast two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a homeless person without a family</v>

1667
01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:48.750
<v Speaker 3>and now I got the two amazing girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sara and Bethany and my wife Laura.</v>

1668
01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:52.560
<v Speaker 3>These two English girls get the dream</v>
<v Speaker 3>life change.</v>

1669
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:56.430
<v Speaker 3>They get to move from Somerset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>England out here to Oregon and my little</v>

1670
01:29:56.431 --> 01:30:00.940
<v Speaker 3>girl gets on a yellow school bus show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes the bus every day.</v>

1671
01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.680
<v Speaker 3>She's in school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1672
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:04.230
<v Speaker 3>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the community.</v>

1673
01:30:04.231 --> 01:30:06.600
<v Speaker 3>I got all these wonderful friends up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oregon,</v>

1674
01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:09.360
<v Speaker 3>like Donnie Hobbs and these guys that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are my personal friends now.</v>

1675
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:13.470
<v Speaker 3>I built my community again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I got all these cool people up</v>

1676
01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:15.220
<v Speaker 3>there that love me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1677
01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:17.760
<v Speaker 3>my wife's right now in Salem with her</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend carly,</v>

1678
01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:21.000
<v Speaker 3>and they're opening up a new shop up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and all this stuff.</v>

1679
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:25.230
<v Speaker 3>So I really did it despite not having</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1680
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:29.520
<v Speaker 3>I did exactly what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and overcame the debt probation</v>

1681
01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:32.550
<v Speaker 3>and found community and built my tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1682
01:30:32.551 --> 01:30:36.390
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people s a struggle to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have people in their life that aren't</v>

1683
01:30:36.391 --> 01:30:39.150
<v Speaker 3>causing conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's you is allowing it,</v>

1684
01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:41.220
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out and find new people to be around.</v>

1685
01:30:41.221 --> 01:30:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Cause a lot of people want you if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice person.</v>

1686
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:45.010
<v Speaker 3>It's just hard for me</v>

1687
01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:48.190
<v Speaker 2>people to find those people sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where they lose hope.</v>

1688
01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:51.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that don't and one of the things</v>

1689
01:30:51.311 --> 01:30:53.200
<v Speaker 2>they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know where to get started,</v>

1690
01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:55.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to,</v>

1691
01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:57.450
<v Speaker 2>how to get their life going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to get moving,</v>

1692
01:30:57.490 --> 01:30:59.470
<v Speaker 2>how to feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to get success.</v>

1693
01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:02.260
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1694
01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:06.340
<v Speaker 2>to those people I say just do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more things you do,</v>

1695
01:31:06.341 --> 01:31:08.440
<v Speaker 2>the more things you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do something,</v>

1696
01:31:08.441 --> 01:31:11.200
<v Speaker 2>do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's commit to walking around</v>

1697
01:31:11.201 --> 01:31:16.201
<v Speaker 2>the block 10 times a night with whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a committing to writing your life</v>

1698
01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:18.020
<v Speaker 2>story</v>

1699
01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.450
<v Speaker 3>and you knew it stops a lot of people is</v>
<v Speaker 3>their self imagery.</v>

1700
01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:23.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I,</v>

1701
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.140
<v Speaker 3>I was convicted of a rape and murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in everyone's eyes,</v>

1702
01:31:27.141 --> 01:31:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I was a psychologically deranged person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to live with that stigma everyday.</v>

1703
01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when I got out,</v>

1704
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:38.960
<v Speaker 3>everybody thought I must be crazy as</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck because I spent 8,057 days in</v>

1705
01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:42.340
<v Speaker 3>solitary confinement being tortured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no way I could be saying,</v>

1706
01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:43.540
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1707
01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Their perspective had no effect on me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because by that time I'd given myself</v>

1708
01:31:51.201 --> 01:31:56.150
<v Speaker 3>enough education to know the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between what was done to me and who I</v>

1709
01:31:56.151 --> 01:31:57.890
<v Speaker 3>am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the problem with a lot of</v>

1710
01:31:57.891 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fail to stop doing this thing where</v>

1711
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:05.800
<v Speaker 3>I am this or I am that and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1712
01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:11.370
<v Speaker 3>So I really have never cared about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of anyone in the negative</v>

1713
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 3>except for when they got it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from my intent to do good with them.</v>

1714
01:32:19.450 --> 01:32:21.970
<v Speaker 3>And then it just became a battle of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>own ego.</v>

1715
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:26.710
<v Speaker 3>So I realized that the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as I know I'm doing right and</v>

1716
01:32:26.711 --> 01:32:29.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't going to matter about their</v>

1717
01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:31.870
<v Speaker 3>perspective because the same person who</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought I was a rapist,</v>

1718
01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:35.320
<v Speaker 3>scumbag murderer now thinks I'm one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most eloquent speakers they met in</v>

1719
01:32:35.321 --> 01:32:37.600
<v Speaker 3>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their perspective about me changed,</v>

1720
01:32:37.601 --> 01:32:40.870
<v Speaker 3>but mine surely shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it did.</v>

1721
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:42.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's what a lot of people suffer</v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

1722
01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:47.190
<v Speaker 3>They let that negative comment make them</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like they have to overcome it or</v>

1723
01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.300
<v Speaker 3>have to live with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you what,</v>

1724
01:32:49.301 --> 01:32:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really never expected this,</v>

1725
01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:55.330
<v Speaker 3>but for the first time in my life from</v>
<v Speaker 3>conducting an interview throughout the</v>

1726
01:32:55.331 --> 01:32:58.240
<v Speaker 3>whole process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been reevaluating who I am and what</v>

1727
01:32:58.241 --> 01:33:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a fucking slap in the face,</v>

1728
01:33:01.241 --> 01:33:01.960
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1729
01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Like I came in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drag world with my emotions,</v>

1730
01:33:05.081 --> 01:33:07.180
<v Speaker 3>carrying him on my sleeves and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress.</v>

1731
01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:09.520
<v Speaker 3>I haven't slept well for days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't taken care of us.</v>

1732
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:14.790
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do well in articulating and you</v>

1733
01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:18.070
<v Speaker 3>gave me a wake up call that I have never</v>
<v Speaker 3>had before.</v>

1734
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:20.800
<v Speaker 3>In any experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go back and look through the</v>

1735
01:33:20.801 --> 01:33:24.910
<v Speaker 3>history of the many experiences of ahead</v>
<v Speaker 3>of interviews and I've done some</v>

1736
01:33:24.911 --> 01:33:28.180
<v Speaker 3>outstanding ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a personal experience</v>

1737
01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.970
<v Speaker 3>where throughout the course of speaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>of another man,</v>

1738
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I started to reevaluate everything I</v>
<v Speaker 3>held firmly to,</v>

1739
01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:38.860
<v Speaker 3>and I promise you I'm going to go and</v>
<v Speaker 3>think a whole lot about this and get my</v>

1740
01:33:38.861 --> 01:33:42.220
<v Speaker 3>shit together because I do owe it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>allow to people to be one bad ass</v>

1741
01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker with a hell of a message to</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

1742
01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Damn straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1743
01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:52.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really am an so if you want me to come</v>

1744
01:33:52.031 --> 01:33:53.740
<v Speaker 3>and speak before your corporate</v>
<v Speaker 3>functions,</v>

1745
01:33:53.741 --> 01:33:58.090
<v Speaker 3>if we're a high school or university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do that better than anyone.</v>

1746
01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine.</v>

1747
01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:01.360
<v Speaker 3>One of the finest speakers on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

1748
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.780
<v Speaker 3>and I learned it because I watched Bruce</v>
<v Speaker 3>springsteen.</v>

1749
01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:07.750
<v Speaker 3>You remember that speech he gave at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oscars for Philadelphia?</v>

1750
01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never watched the Oscars.</v>

1751
01:34:10.391 --> 01:34:11.410
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get that up.</v>

1752
01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:14.180
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bruce springsteen is one of the finest</v>

1753
01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:16.530
<v Speaker 3>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1754
01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:19.720
<v Speaker 3>but just the image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But dude gave one of the most profound</v>

1755
01:34:19.721 --> 01:34:23.400
<v Speaker 3>speeches I ever waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful Girl.</v>

1756
01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 3>He made the nexus point between music</v>
<v Speaker 3>and imagery.</v>

1757
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:32.881
<v Speaker 3>So poignant that I was blown away by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much so that when we made the</v>

1758
01:34:33.461 --> 01:34:37.810
<v Speaker 3>documentary fear of 13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all I'd kept imagining when I</v>

1759
01:34:37.811 --> 01:34:40.210
<v Speaker 3>spoke was the imagery we would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>lended.</v>

1760
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:45.870
<v Speaker 3>And I love the fact that I worked very</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to bring the whole audience into my</v>

1761
01:34:46.771 --> 01:34:51.771
<v Speaker 3>cell one time to spend with me my story</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that no one ever did before and</v>

1762
01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:54.730
<v Speaker 3>I fucking rocked it.</v>

1763
01:34:54.850 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1764
01:34:57.651 --> 01:35:00.110
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the fact that I know I have</v>

1765
01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:02.900
<v Speaker 3>talent in that field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to boast,</v>

1766
01:35:02.901 --> 01:35:06.770
<v Speaker 3>but I have a gift and it King uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>light years ahead of me.</v>

1767
01:35:06.771 --> 01:35:11.771
<v Speaker 3>When I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had 400 students in ealing enraptured</v>

1768
01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:16.560
<v Speaker 3>at a conference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend at educator named Emma Dopson</v>

1769
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.430
<v Speaker 3>set this whole thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go there,</v>

1770
01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 3>you could hear a pin drop because all</v>
<v Speaker 3>along,</v>

1771
01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.440
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an energy clicks in and I can hold a</v>

1772
01:35:30.381 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 3>room in palm of my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had some amazing experiences with</v>

1773
01:35:34.881 --> 01:35:39.590
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to stay at,</v>

1774
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:45.050
<v Speaker 3>but that cult of personality lure of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being on the stage and talking to people</v>

1775
01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:49.430
<v Speaker 3>is powerful man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can see why Tony Robbins and</v>

1776
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:52.520
<v Speaker 3>everybody gets up in nine eight Dudette</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a life coach.</v>

1777
01:35:52.521 --> 01:35:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I can't coach no one's life.</v>

1778
01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:59.300
<v Speaker 3>But I can tell you about your life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ma in ways that would make you really</v>

1779
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.260
<v Speaker 3>invigorated to want to make a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>life for yourself,</v>

1780
01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.810
<v Speaker 3>but no one could truly be your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>coach.</v>

1781
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:08.960
<v Speaker 3>You got to do that shit yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I love it.</v>

1782
01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I love it that I understood those</v>
<v Speaker 3>moments because one of the coolest</v>

1783
01:36:12.561 --> 01:36:17.090
<v Speaker 3>things was I used to go to the globe</v>
<v Speaker 3>theater.</v>

1784
01:36:17.091 --> 01:36:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Anybody did understand Shakespeare</v>
<v Speaker 3>understands the globe.</v>

1785
01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Theater is the center of the world for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shakespeare.</v>

1786
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:27.910
<v Speaker 3>They would perform titus andronicus and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then after which Cleopatra would come</v>

1787
01:36:28.611 --> 01:36:31.520
<v Speaker 3>out on stage and introduced me to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carl.</v>

1788
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Now I had eight minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes tops to do this thing and in</v>

1789
01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:41.990
<v Speaker 3>eight to 10 minutes I had a crowd who</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been spanning for three hours long</v>

1790
01:36:41.991 --> 01:36:45.080
<v Speaker 3>play crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting money in a bucket for what I</v>

1791
01:36:45.081 --> 01:36:47.240
<v Speaker 3>said to them and did it flawlessly every</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1792
01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:50.030
<v Speaker 3>And I did it for a whole summer in</v>
<v Speaker 3>London.</v>

1793
01:36:50.031 --> 01:36:55.031
<v Speaker 3>It was the most amazing experience to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand there and look out over this vista</v>

1794
01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:59.690
<v Speaker 3>of London after you did this amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing where people never expect that you</v>

1795
01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:02.300
<v Speaker 3>and you are nothing to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>theater.</v>

1796
01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:06.110
<v Speaker 3>You are just a human rights charity</v>
<v Speaker 3>chosen by the theater to come out and</v>

1797
01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:07.190
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1798
01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 3>I realized that that moment I had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>gift.</v>

1799
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:13.520
<v Speaker 3>If I could get people who have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing for three hours watching a play</v>

1800
01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.700
<v Speaker 3>to have wet tears in her eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting money,</v>

1801
01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:21.040
<v Speaker 3>shoving it into a bucket for me than I</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew I had some ability to finally</v>

1802
01:37:21.561 --> 01:37:25.220
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was no longer an aphasia effected,</v>

1803
01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.380
<v Speaker 3>destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>distorted mine,</v>

1804
01:37:27.650 --> 01:37:32.650
<v Speaker 3>addled by drugs and used beyond belief</v>
<v Speaker 3>to distortions of like I was so screwed</v>

1805
01:37:34.161 --> 01:37:37.820
<v Speaker 3>up to come back to do that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>days man.</v>

01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Cause it was in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This story monsters med mum was so</v>

1811
01:37:55.351 --> 01:37:58.290
<v Speaker 3>powerful that when I met Laura,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>

1812
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:59.161
<v Speaker 3>I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1813
01:37:59.161 --> 01:38:01.350
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a finally do it man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

1815
01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:06.780
<v Speaker 3>it just came out for two and a half</v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

1816
01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 3>I barely slept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ate,</v>

1817
01:38:08.251 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 3>did anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I did was make love to my wife on a</v>

1818
01:38:11.341 --> 01:38:14.850
<v Speaker 3>break or right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean poured it out and I poured</v>

1819
01:38:14.851 --> 01:38:18.750
<v Speaker 3>out the whole book and I've realized</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was needed to move on.</v>

1820
01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.230
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the best book I ever wrote my life.</v>

1821
01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 3>And I'm so proud that it's my last one</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't have to worry about no</v>

1822
01:38:25.981 --> 01:38:26.814
<v Speaker 3>more stories.</v>

1823
01:38:27.210 --> 01:38:28.790
<v Speaker 3>I did the thing that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1824
01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.540
<v Speaker 3>so this one changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really fear of 13 my countdown</v>

1825
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:34.710
<v Speaker 3>to execution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it went through hell.</v>

1826
01:38:35.010 --> 01:38:38.880
<v Speaker 3>It got canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's now fear of 13 then I wrote the</v>

1827
01:38:38.881 --> 01:38:41.490
<v Speaker 3>kindness approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did one called my journey through her</v>

1828
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:44.490
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't bring a copy as you,</v>

1829
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you not want to write?</v>

1830
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.790
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you say that?</v>

1831
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I hope it doesn't because I crafted my</v>
<v Speaker 3>series of books that create and</v>

1832
01:38:52.771 --> 01:38:55.370
<v Speaker 3>captivate my whole entire message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1833
01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And I want to leave it pure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to then go on and make up a</v>

1834
01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:03.840
<v Speaker 3>falsifications of things that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1835
01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 3>So all these are nonfiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these are nonfiction.</v>

1836
01:39:06.901 --> 01:39:11.490
<v Speaker 3>All these events are true and points in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life and I think that's the best</v>

1837
01:39:11.491 --> 01:39:13.170
<v Speaker 3>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stay true to who I am.</v>

1838
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I was going to tell one story called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's enough for me as a fictionalized</v>

1839
01:39:18.331 --> 01:39:22.500
<v Speaker 3>writer just to show everybody my talent</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people in the past that said,</v>

1840
01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:23.910
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can write anything.</v>

1841
01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:28.170
<v Speaker 3>So I was going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've held back because I thought I</v>

1842
01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:29.100
<v Speaker 3>want to leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

1843
01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:31.590
<v Speaker 3>I want to leave it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my series of work.</v>

1844
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:36.620
<v Speaker 3>My work is I wrote to prison books and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote two books that will guide people</v>

1845
01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:40.800
<v Speaker 3>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how not to be screwed up or bitter.</v>

1846
01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.420
<v Speaker 3>And I want to leave that as my message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go and do other things,</v>

1847
01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:48.030
<v Speaker 3>but those are my books and I'm proud of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the work I did.</v>

1848
01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.910
<v Speaker 3>I got it out of my system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a published author.</v>

1849
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:52.740
<v Speaker 3>I can go down in history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

1850
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really want to then push it and</v>

1851
01:39:57.001 --> 01:40:00.660
<v Speaker 3>think that I can then lower people into</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading more works than I'd can try</v>

1852
01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.190
<v Speaker 3>because that's not really fair to them.</v>

1853
01:40:02.570 --> 01:40:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1854
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I want to keep it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the things I want</v>

1855
01:40:06.631 --> 01:40:08.910
<v Speaker 3>to try and stay true to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1856
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:12.600
<v Speaker 3>speaking as my love now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>

1857
01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:15.720
<v Speaker 3>someone wants to hire you to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where would they go?</v>

1858
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Nick Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dot Org.</v>

1859
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:18.750
<v Speaker 3>So it's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1860
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:22.050
<v Speaker 3>everyone on the podcast can easily find</v>
<v Speaker 3>me on the other social medias.</v>

1861
01:40:22.051 --> 01:40:23.910
<v Speaker 3>But I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1862
01:40:23.911 --> 01:40:25.600
<v Speaker 3>my really close friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam,</v>

1863
01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:28.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Callahan and his wife just had a baby so</v>

1864
01:40:28.171 --> 01:40:31.710
<v Speaker 3>that everyone in my website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] dot org and a lot of people</v>

1865
01:40:31.711 --> 01:40:36.330
<v Speaker 3>can reach me for functions like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I really love the fact that I have a</v>

1866
01:40:36.331 --> 01:40:40.770
<v Speaker 3>chance to also with this my vs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dot com to go ahead and go into schools.</v>

1867
01:40:40.771 --> 01:40:43.020
<v Speaker 3>And there's a really cool thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1868
01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:47.130
<v Speaker 3>this x generation times three men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like so computer savvy,</v>

1869
01:40:47.131 --> 01:40:47.964
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1870
01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:51.300
<v Speaker 3>So much so that you actually are</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting a trend.</v>

1871
01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:56.710
<v Speaker 3>There's no longer 15 minutes of fame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the five second video clip of</v>

1872
01:40:56.711 --> 01:41:00.220
<v Speaker 3>fame now and has been reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like everything's five</v>

1873
01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:00.941
<v Speaker 3>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1874
01:41:00.941 --> 01:41:03.670
<v Speaker 3>It's no longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everything in the education field is</v>

1875
01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:07.480
<v Speaker 3>coming to us faster and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we need to use the analytics of</v>

1876
01:41:07.481 --> 01:41:11.110
<v Speaker 3>something like my verse to go ahead and</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a child to figure out who they can</v>

1877
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:14.530
<v Speaker 3>go and be in their careers and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow that correct path.</v>

1878
01:41:15.010 --> 01:41:16.910
<v Speaker 3>You can't just throw it against the wall</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

1879
01:41:16.911 --> 01:41:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to really work hard to get</v>

1880
01:41:18.791 --> 01:41:22.060
<v Speaker 3>children to feel good about being a taxi</v>
<v Speaker 3>driver,</v>

1881
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:24.040
<v Speaker 3>a painter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1882
01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:29.041
<v Speaker 3>it's not no shame to be a a person who</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes out and does a simple manual job,</v>

1883
01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:32.530
<v Speaker 3>if that makes you happy as a human</v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

1884
01:41:32.531 --> 01:41:34.390
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to do that without</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stigma,</v>

1885
01:41:34.391 --> 01:41:35.224
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1886
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:37.060
<v Speaker 3>But the school's not going to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1887
01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to tell you you could be</v>

1888
01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:42.700
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why wouldn't you want to find out</v>

1889
01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:45.160
<v Speaker 3>what would make you happy in life and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>that right?</v>

1890
01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:49.330
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not going to learn that from school.</v>

1891
01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Now learn that from people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from people,</v>

1892
01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 3>and you'll learn that from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from online more than anything today.</v>

1893
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I want to be involved in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the educational field.</v>

1894
01:41:58.450 --> 01:42:01.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that's my greatest gift of</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who went to prison,</v>

1895
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:05.770
<v Speaker 3>who hadn't ever read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who accomplished the things that he did.</v>

1896
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Then can share how the purpose of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>education was.</v>

1897
01:42:09.851 --> 01:42:12.880
<v Speaker 3>So did I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was able to process life enough to</v>

1898
01:42:12.881 --> 01:42:15.760
<v Speaker 3>handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To give myself enough separation to</v>

1899
01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:20.410
<v Speaker 3>realize who I was as a human being is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the sum total of my misery and that</v>

1900
01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:25.390
<v Speaker 3>I could then help others structured</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives through politeness to go and</v>

1901
01:42:25.391 --> 01:42:26.860
<v Speaker 3>get a good education.</v>

1902
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:31.960
<v Speaker 3>And I love that fact that I worked so</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard through all these different things</v>

1903
01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:34.240
<v Speaker 3>to not lose that message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men.</v>

1904
01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.970
<v Speaker 3>And it really does work for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>young people.</v>

1905
01:42:36.971 --> 01:42:39.540
<v Speaker 3>They find that there's self restrict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1906
01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.640
<v Speaker 3>respect really does grow when someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives them just a small little bit of a</v>

1907
01:42:45.191 --> 01:42:46.024
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1908
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:48.470
<v Speaker 3>they're so honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

1909
01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:51.490
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never tire of it in that one regard</v>

1910
01:42:51.491 --> 01:42:53.140
<v Speaker 3>because I've touched so many young</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's lives.</v>

1911
01:42:53.141 --> 01:42:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>

1912
01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.730
<v Speaker 3>That's a great message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1913
01:42:57.820 --> 01:42:59.500
<v Speaker 3>thanks for being here man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate it.</v>

1914
01:42:59.501 --> 01:43:00.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad we did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1915
01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:01.780
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

1916
01:43:01.781 --> 01:43:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Can I give a quick shot at this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got some good friends of mine.</v>

1917
01:43:05.201 --> 01:43:08.530
<v Speaker 3>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really messed up on Alex Ortiz and uh,</v>

1918
01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.050
<v Speaker 3>I like these young dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these fighters joke,</v>

1919
01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:13.420
<v Speaker 3>they're all mad about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I like it.</v>

1920
01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:15.100
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about the Bella tour</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway?</v>

1921
01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:16.090
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1922
01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.790
<v Speaker 3>we'll need more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need more organizations like that,</v>

1923
01:43:18.791 --> 01:43:20.290
<v Speaker 3>but I think Bella tours doing a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

1924
01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesse Casa Kosky.</v>

01:43:21.721 --> 01:43:25.210
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna fight this Mofo bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I like the fact that his father</v>

1926
01:43:25.211 --> 01:43:28.750
<v Speaker 3>teaches that coon Tao with that prison</v>
<v Speaker 3>style of martial arts.</v>

1927
01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1928
01:43:30.041 --> 01:43:31.930
<v Speaker 3>well it's the old style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1929
01:43:31.931 --> 01:43:36.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't like the martial arts that most</v>

1930
01:43:36.551 --> 01:43:40.600
<v Speaker 3>people would know because it's derived</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the Filipino prison systems.</v>

1931
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:44.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like really pure solves of quick</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks and stuff like that.</v>

1932
01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:47.890
