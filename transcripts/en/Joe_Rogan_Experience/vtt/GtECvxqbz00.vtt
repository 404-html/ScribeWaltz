12
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm left out of a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

13
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Those guys who think it's really cool to</v>
<v Speaker 1>relax with cigar smoking,</v>

14
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>it makes me nauseous.</v>

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make me relax.</v>

16
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to do it,</v>

17
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's a high ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're lying to themselves.</v>

18
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nicotine high,</v>

19
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>late course letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those guys were into the Hay.</v>

20
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>They get in there doing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drugs.</v>

21
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

22
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>That's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

23
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>God Damn drug den.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's hilarious?</v>

24
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Hepped up on something Chile tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's one of those things.</v>

25
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:06.441
<v Speaker 1>It's like so common and it's so part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture that we look at that as</v>

26
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.901
<v Speaker 1>being less ridiculous and more like</v>
<v Speaker 1>reserved and intelligent than if someone</v>

27
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>got together and in a little shack there</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a smoke shop and there was smoking</v>

28
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>pot together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Those people I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I get older.</v>

30
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I get more of a buzz from coffee than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do from Xanax.</v>

31
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>You do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck you.</v>

32
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Because annex just makes me feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think a normal person feels like,</v>

33
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the terrifying anxiety.</v>

34
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like when did you,</v>

35
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>when did you start getting anxiety?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A second grade.</v>

36
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

37
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second Grade,</v>

38
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really doing better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

39
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Dr Says in 10 years I should be ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

40
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>You never had anxiety of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely anxiety.</v>

41
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but about a specific thing.</v>

42
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing is just anxiety that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know what it's from.</v>

43
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the core of your being,</v>

44
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>so it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some sort of firing error or</v>

45
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>something in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a chemical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And does anything else help it?</v>

47
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Like exercise help it or like alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol helps.</v>

48
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about alcohol is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebound is worse than the high wire if</v>

49
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have three hours of a buzz for</v>

50
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a 12 hour hangover.</v>

51
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially as you get older.</v>

52
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hangovers get rougher and rougher</v>

53
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>for me pretty much every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>I never drank when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is all new to me the last few</v>

55
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.503
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many years?</v>

56
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 1>A eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know you,</v>

57
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:35.340

<v Speaker 1>you stopped for awhile.</v>

58
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.070

<v Speaker 1>He stopped for a while.</v>

59
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe how good it feels.</v>

60
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Not that big of a hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

62
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 1>But you like it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I like the whole unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they,</v>

64
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the unbeknownst to the score and the</v>

65

<v Speaker 1>I like that with alcohol,</v>

67
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>that whole social thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a drink with you too</v>

68
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>because it's like we're announcing</v>
<v Speaker 1>festivities,</v>

69
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.210
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

71
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:05.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 2>we both sort of agreed that we're off on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a alcohol filled,</v>

73
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Romp Chitchat and laughter.</v>

74
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 2>But no Duis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no Duis.</v>

75
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.200
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

76
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 2>that's where Uber came in and changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game.</v>

77
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 2>So I can't take it with the fucking uber</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

78
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Can't everybody's trying to convince me</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's something wrong with me.</v>

79
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 2>You kind of take Uber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

80
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get in the car with a</v>

81
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>strange guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get into his own car.</v>

82
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I wanna I want to either get a car</v>
<v Speaker 2>service or take a cab.</v>

83
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.850
<v Speaker 2>He's just an old school guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to.</v>

84
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's funny about Uber to</v>

85
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 2>me is the idea like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I used to drink maybe one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two drinks tonight,</v>

87
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.010
<v Speaker 2>but now say say I drink all day because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uber brings you got colic.</v>

88
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Now what's funny about Uber is they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the application connecting,</v>

89
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.040
<v Speaker 2>like connecting people to people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>want something and those people get all</v>

90
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 2>the money I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they pay the drivers,</v>

91
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not how it works because you it up.</v>

92
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Understand that when I moved to New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>

93
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 2>they had medallions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to spend thousands of dollars</v>

94
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 2>to get them a day and to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive a commercial vehicle here.</v>

95
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can drive an uber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

96
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they are independent contractors</v>

97
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 2>like in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be illegal.</v>

98
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Used to have these things called Gypsy</v>
<v Speaker 2>cabs.</v>

99
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 2>They still do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>

100
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 2>One year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

101
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say more than 40 gypsy cab</v>

102
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 2>drivers were murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

103
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But find this out.</v>

104
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Gypsy cab driver murders in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they would take them to like bad</v>

105
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods and shoot them and rob</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

106
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 2>So these cab drivers who are fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 2>they weren't making much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to take every fair they could</v>

108
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 2>and they would take these guys or one</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

109
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows how many people actually wound</v>

110
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 2>up being the people killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just say 1990.</v>

111
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 2>This story is from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds about right.</v>

112
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 2>That's when I was living there.</v>

113
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Gypsy cab driver was found shot dead in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bronx.</v>

114
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a k killings are related to</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

117
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I really think it was more than 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's 40.</v>

118
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 2>For some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cavities didn't get a fair shake.</v>

119
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 2>The oldest hookers got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a lot of press.</v>

120
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Well they got press in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is press in 1990 or 91 or</v>

121
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was where it got real bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the Internet.</v>

122
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a time before the Internet</v>

123
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

124
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

125
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>we became friends before the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

126
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 2>We even get ahold of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call each other on the phone.</v>

127
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 2>How to catch you when you're at home</v>
<v Speaker 2>like normally it's right up early.</v>

128
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Make phone calls before you leave the</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

129
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 2>You remember the first cell phones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They looked like it could use it as a</v>

130
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 2>billy club here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This right here.</v>

131
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Driving a gypsy cabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One the most dangerous jobs in New York</v>

132
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.480
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since 1990 180 drivers average of two a</v>

133
00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>month had been</v>

134
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 3>killed while on duty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

135
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.410
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't foreign and there's one 80.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe it was or not.</v>

136
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Not a 440,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that was one 80 when they</v>

137
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 3>stopped counting during the time this</v>
<v Speaker 3>article is written because this is,</v>

138
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about 1990.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was living in New York when this was</v>

139
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 3>happening and I kind of moved there</v>
<v Speaker 3>around then so it could have gotten even</v>

140
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever miss it?</v>

141
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Do me neither.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you get the guys from New York.</v>

142
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 3>I like the Kennedy's stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you could make it here.</v>

143
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong.</v>

144
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I think I could adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if I decided to live in New York</v>

145
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love it.</v>

146
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't miss your kids and the whole</v>

147
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 3>thing is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what man?</v>

148
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids can grow up anywhere.</v>

149
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 3>They really can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know if it's ideal when</v>

150
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 3>you're rather than being walking around</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you live.</v>

151
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Then honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think really it's better probably in a</v>

152
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 3>non showbiz related city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think just being in the city,</v>

153
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not healthy for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think kids are better off in places</v>

154
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 3>like Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even if it's showbiz related,</v>

155
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>film related.</v>

156
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like the television and film</v>
<v Speaker 3>world is filled with so many people out</v>

157
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 3>here and done me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's a bad business.</v>

158
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 3>I was in it for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I don't mean anything against</v>

159
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just think that the kind of people</v>

160
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 3>that it attracts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all of them,</v>

161
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.950
<v Speaker 3>but a good amount of them are really</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy and they're real needy and they</v>

162
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.660
<v Speaker 3>value the value of certain type of fame</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it gets.</v>

163
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 3>It gets really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets really crazy.</v>

164
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.970
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about last night with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the girls to come in the store and</v>

165
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Sophie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sophie or Sophia Africa.</v>

166
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 3>She said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't want to tell me she was an</v>

167
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 3>actress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was embarrassed.</v>

168
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Decision in funny because well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

169
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 3>it's like I was doing the thing on stage</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other night about we need more</v>

170
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 3>actors and actresses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know anybody back east that wants</v>

171
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 3>to be an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them to come out here.</v>

172
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 3>But it's sad when you're embarrassed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say what you want to be.</v>

173
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the problem.</v>

174
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Like do acting itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does nothing wrong with it.</v>

175
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 3>As long as the lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying something wrong with the</v>

176
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 3>profession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just there's a giant number of</v>

177
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 3>people who come out here that are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely bat shit crazy.</v>

178
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I know and they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want everybody to like us.</v>

179
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:15.970
<v Speaker 3>The other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a lack of a.</v>

180
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult when people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>judging you,</v>

181
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's a problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire design of the audition process</v>

182
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:29.390
<v Speaker 3>because you're creating people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be exactly what you want them</v>

183
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 3>to be because those are the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hire,</v>

184
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 3>so it becomes an incredibly left wing</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

185
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 3>It becomes real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great and a lot of ways it</v>

186
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 3>balances things out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But our culture is driven primarily from</v>

187
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 3>things from the left good things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate stuff like,</v>

188
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay rights and gay marriage and a lot of</v>

189
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 3>other like left wing type ideas that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with that I think are great.</v>

190
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 3>But it's 100 percent driven by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people,</v>

191
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 3>if they have different opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult for them to express</v>

192
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 3>it and still work like so you get a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that are terrified of stepping</v>

193
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 3>on anybody's toes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they say a bunch of nonsense.</v>

194
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Like you ever talk to people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>say nice to meet you because they're</v>

195
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:09.850
<v Speaker 3>worried they might have already met you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

196
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

197
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 3>you know what they say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say nice to see you.</v>

198
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I covered.</v>

199
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never did a people.</v>

200
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I never asked him what's up or what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

201
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I know that about here because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel guilty like they have to recite in</v>

202
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole resume.</v>

203
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'd rather them just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

204
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to see you.</v>

205
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's the end of the things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put.</v>

206
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of irons in the sound from</v>

207
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the impractical jokers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 1>He was out here one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

209
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 1>it's before they really hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

210
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing going on.</v>

211
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never say that in Hollywood.</v>

212
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking when we got here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you say.</v>

213
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of irons in the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to jinx it.</v>

214
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Taste better when it comes through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big plans in the works.</v>

215
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Check my instagram page for future</v>
<v Speaker 3>notifications.</v>

216
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.690
<v Speaker 1>When you said you're really not part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of the business anymore,</v>

217
00:09:56.691 --> 00:09:59.360
<v Speaker 1>it's funny that you're so busy you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have time to do a movie.</v>

218
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind.</v>

219
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only movies I've ever done it the</v>

220
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Kevin James Movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't have to audition.</v>

221
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

222
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Got Me Parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have addition edition</v>

223
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.550
<v Speaker 3>should if you want something good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the process itself is the problem</v>

224
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:15.890
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily for me who's a</v>

225
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.640
<v Speaker 3>financially independent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the process for a lot of people</v>

226
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.480
<v Speaker 3>aren't who are desperately needing</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to employ them.</v>

227
00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:26.230
<v Speaker 3>So they can apply their craft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't need anybody to employ me so</v>

228
00:10:26.231 --> 00:10:29.290
<v Speaker 3>that I could do standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neither do we just do it and we don't</v>

229
00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:31.660
<v Speaker 3>need anybody to employ us to do this</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

230
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.220
<v Speaker 3>We just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just do yours.</v>

231
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I just do my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all just do our own shit.</v>

232
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.260
<v Speaker 3>And because of that you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could be you.</v>

233
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.610
<v Speaker 3>You can actually be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

234
00:10:39.611 --> 00:10:41.980
<v Speaker 3>the suits have lost so much power in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last 10 years.</v>

235
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we're also starting to see like</v>

236
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:47.140
<v Speaker 3>what this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this world really about?</v>

237
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.850
<v Speaker 3>It's about generating income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

238
00:10:48.851 --> 00:10:51.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not about art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why reality shows took off like</v>

239
00:10:51.791 --> 00:10:52.610
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

240
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your generation is much better than mine</v>

241
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.260
<v Speaker 1>as far as business people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys,</v>

242
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>your group is smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:00.380
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

244
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:03.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to use social media to</v>

245
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:04.650
<v Speaker 1>your advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

246
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.311
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>

247
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it was luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it was locked.</v>

248
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Some of it was copying Dane Cook to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it was definitely that.</v>

249
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.590
<v Speaker 3>I was already doing stuff online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't doing stuff.</v>

250
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 3>I was writing blogs and I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things,</v>

251
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 3>so just as like a little exercise like</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just to come up with ideas and just</v>

252
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:23.970
<v Speaker 3>to get my writing flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I write a write a lot of blogs back</v>

253
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:27.980
<v Speaker 3>then and Dane Cook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have the mind space and you</v>

254
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 3>started using it to promote shows and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

255
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy how much it blew him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an early adopter and he was the</v>

256
00:11:34.351 --> 00:11:35.570
<v Speaker 3>perfect guy for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

257
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 3>cute high energy girls loved him and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like he was like one of the first</v>

258
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 3>comics that had like a bunch of girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>fans.</v>

259
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 3>It was like a rock and roll guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

260
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:47.230
<v Speaker 3>very interesting times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>

261
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I think it woke up everybody to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>power of social media and then twitter</v>

262
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 3>came along of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

263
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 2>the podcast thing was totally lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

264
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for just um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

265
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:00.070
<v Speaker 2>but you had to be good at a gentleman to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell it too much.</v>

266
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't good at in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go back and listen to some of</v>

267
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 2>those early ones are fucking terrible.</v>

268
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Well remember we were talking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv Cusco and I said to you,</v>

269
00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:10.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't want you to think I was</v>

270
00:12:10.281 --> 00:12:11.310
<v Speaker 1>hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting me,</v>

271
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.010
<v Speaker 1>hitting to get onto the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I said,</v>

272
00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

273
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.760
<v Speaker 1>if you do one of your shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better than doing all the late</v>

274
00:12:19.761 --> 00:12:21.440
<v Speaker 1>night shows in one week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

275
00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>as far as like the mosher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Australia tomorrow and</v>

277
00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>those people are going to be thrilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm going,</v>

278
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.150
<v Speaker 1>that I'm on the podcast because I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand and people listen to you</v>

279
00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.640
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>

281
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.520
<v Speaker 1>nobody watches the tonight show in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

282
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.800
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The could show.</v>

283
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Podcasts are nuts,</v>

284
00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:43.940
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

285
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 2>you can get them easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about it.</v>

286
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:48.060
<v Speaker 2>If you have to watch the tonight show to</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch you,</v>

287
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.300
<v Speaker 2>the odds of you actually being in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your television when that happens are</v>

288
00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:54.160
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The odds of you dvr in this night show</v>

289
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.710
<v Speaker 2>or also small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

290
00:12:55.711 --> 00:12:58.530
<v Speaker 2>it's usually one of those things where a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people look forward to it and</v>

291
00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:01.020
<v Speaker 2>they watched it before they go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a normal ritual.</v>

292
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I only use that as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't,</v>

293
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good example because that's what</v>

294
00:13:05.101 --> 00:13:05.980
<v Speaker 2>we always needed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

295
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean Carson was the thing back when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were coming up,</v>

296
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.010
<v Speaker 2>if you got on Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

297
00:13:11.011 --> 00:13:14.430
<v Speaker 2>you fucking made it and then you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>see a guy like Richard January 18</v>

298
00:13:14.431 --> 00:13:18.900
<v Speaker 2>carson's or something like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are brilliant and just such a great</v>

299
00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:19.500
<v Speaker 2>comic.</v>

300
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 2>And you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd see those,</v>

301
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.680
<v Speaker 2>those credits and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

302
00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I got did Carson 18 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you would go see him.</v>

303
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:30.240
<v Speaker 2>And of course he was at the time when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>first saw jenny was like in the</v>

304
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.790
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a master a master.</v>

305
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I remember just being in awe and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a bunch of other comedians that were</v>

306
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:36.990
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

307
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.780
<v Speaker 2>east side comedy club member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>east side in Long Island.</v>

308
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Richard Mediterranean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

309
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Richmond Vini,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and Kevin James,</v>

310
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.080
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting around after the show and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're shaking her head.</v>

311
00:13:46.081 --> 00:13:46.861
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

312
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:48.300
<v Speaker 2>he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

313
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.750
<v Speaker 2>He apparently did two different hours on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Friday night.</v>

314
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.500
<v Speaker 2>He did two shows and eight and 10 to two</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different hours,</v>

315
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.370
<v Speaker 2>completely top to bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like both of them or</v>

316
00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:01.830
<v Speaker 2>slaughtering his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a destroyer.</v>

317
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember feeling like when he.</v>

318
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.860
<v Speaker 2>He could take premises that you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think there was anything there and you</v>

319
00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:09.630
<v Speaker 2>can turn them into like one of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite bits,</v>

320
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.140
<v Speaker 2>like you did a premise about buying a</v>
<v Speaker 2>corvette and the guy trying to talk them</v>

321
00:14:13.141 --> 00:14:14.640
<v Speaker 2>into all sorts of stuff in the corvette.</v>

322
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.590
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking while he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>

323
00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:18.690
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's this guy going to make this funny?</v>

324
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking about buying an expensive sports</v>

325
00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:23.340
<v Speaker 2>car and he's gonna figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make this funny.</v>

326
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Remember the Rep thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

327
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know he had problems with him</v>

328
00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:31.680
<v Speaker 2>and I and it really was because of him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's say,</v>

329
00:14:31.681 --> 00:14:36.681
<v Speaker 2>and they couldn't because he's dead now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happened was we were like</v>

330
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.300
<v Speaker 2>getting different things at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

331
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>

332
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was competitive with me and I think</v>

333
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.260
<v Speaker 2>because people pitted us against each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other purely because we were short</v>

334
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the short Italian as well,</v>

335
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>but you've never been nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 2>supportive and nice</v>

336
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 1>to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>

337
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time I said to him,</v>

338
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.890
<v Speaker 1>because somebody was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

339
00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>why don't we go out on the road</v>
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

340
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll fill up theaters.</v>

341
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I want to do that?</v>

342
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

343
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Make money to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

344
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 1>he didn't understand the concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said to me one time,</v>

345
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:10.330
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This isn't fun.</v>

352
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just he was tortured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never enjoyed it.</v>

353
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the saddest part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was seeing never knew how good he was</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

359
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I met him in 94 just so we were both</v>
<v Speaker 1>passing each other and in the front</v>

378
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawthorne,</v>

379
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Hawthorne's friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would know them.</v>

380
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.110
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

381
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>he spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked back to say hi and he goes,</v>

382
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I usually play first myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm plying him.</v>

383
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

384
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 1>ABC flew me and he didn't like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

387
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking I didn't do that to rub it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

388
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I finally said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what do you want me to do?</v>

394
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.060

<v Speaker 1>It's a tough lesson for those guys that</v>

395
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 1>are super competitive and loaners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough lesson as you start getting</v>

00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:09.230
<v Speaker 1>older that none of this shit is fun if</v>

<v Speaker 1>We see each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hug each other,</v>

406
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I went to see the</v>

407
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 1>premiere of a Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very first one and Jack Nicholson</v>

408
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:40.930
<v Speaker 1>was in it and he was at the bar and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking drinking.</v>

409
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 1>It's cheers where everybody in prince</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there.</v>

410
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Just little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kind of faggoty.</v>

411
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Prince are you say faggoty shit</v>

412
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.953
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

413
00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 2>he's sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

414
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 2>he's got two body guards sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of me sitting there and he's not.</v>

415
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what fun is it?</v>

416
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you talk to somebody feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>like royalty though.</v>

417
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy named himself prints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How shocking is that?</v>

418
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:08.301
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be treated like royalty with</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant men guarding his flesh by the way.</v>

419
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.610
<v Speaker 2>He's got to get in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea.</v>

420
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.270
<v Speaker 2>He had some high heels on too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he wrote the music for that.</v>

421
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:18.270
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just struck me about here's Nicholson</v>

422
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 2>easily just as famous if not more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

423
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.430
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable,</v>

424
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Nicholson's all having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

425
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 2>some people don't know me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also part of what we were</v>

426
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were talking about Brian and you</v>

427
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:35.880
<v Speaker 2>were saying that a colby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he's gotten older,</v>

428
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:39.210
<v Speaker 2>it's become more humble and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>convenient then when he's not doing good</v>

429
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 2>and the legs and gaining their</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

430
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 2>But that could be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also could be the case,</v>

431
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 2>couldn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That he's maturing as a man and learning</v>

432
00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 2>and absolutely lies against mistakes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of his actions and</v>

433
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe reflecting on his behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 2>change who he is that's being alone with</v>

434
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:01.050
<v Speaker 2>all your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna do put your money in</v>

435
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:03.840
<v Speaker 2>your bed and lay on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those extreme winters,</v>

436
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 2>extreme winters are so fucking hyper</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy competitive.</v>

437
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

438
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 2>when I was talking to Lance Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really sinking in because I know</v>

439
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 2>guys like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know guys like him.</v>

440
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:16.104
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

441
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 2>fighters for the most part like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like I know guys from the UFC dark.</v>

442
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 2>They're extreme winters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know how to win.</v>

443
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways to know how to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to say fuck everybody else.</v>

444
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.110
<v Speaker 2>And those guys did say fuck everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else like that in the world of art,</v>

445
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy and things along those lines.</v>

446
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessary.</v>

447
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucks up.</v>

448
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to intimidate your opponent.</v>

449
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Like it's better for everybody if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to each other.</v>

450
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.530
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never felt that somebody else's</v>

451
00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.780
<v Speaker 2>success diminished me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

452
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Like when I first started out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Murphy was at the same time he was</v>

453
00:19:51.781 --> 00:19:53.520
<v Speaker 2>getting these movies and some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guido,</v>

454
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:54.560
<v Speaker 2>because there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

455
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.560
<v Speaker 2>don't bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any movers getting these movies and you</v>

456
00:19:57.561 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 2>were here at bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

457
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:00.930
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck does it have to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

458
00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you think if he didn't get 48 hours I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have gotten it.</v>

459
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

460
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 2>that mentality is just a loser</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality.</v>

461
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And it all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a pattern.</v>

462
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Speaker 2>You let your brain go down that path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a pattern of behavior,</v>

463
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.490
<v Speaker 2>like you recognize that somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 2>has something,</v>

464
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:16.290
<v Speaker 2>you want that something and then you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be upset.</v>

465
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.640
<v Speaker 2>That person has it and then you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it becomes this animal instinct</v>

466
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a jealousy.</v>

467
00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimpanzees Have Horrible Jealousy,</v>

468
00:20:24.811 --> 00:20:26.310
<v Speaker 2>dop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real horrible jealousy.</v>

469
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.300
<v Speaker 2>That guy that got his face bit off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult often.</v>

470
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Remember that guy I didn't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember a woman getting her face.</v>

471
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 2>There was a woman who did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before the woman who did see the</v>

472
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:39.921
<v Speaker 2>woman who did it was because her friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the champ and the woman who lived</v>

473
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 2>with the champ had some weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the champion.</v>

474
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 2>She slept with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She gave him a Xanax and she gave him</v>

475
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 2>red wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's fucking chimp was drunk and on</v>

476
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 2>pills</v>

477
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 3>and he ripped this lady's face off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one chimp or had been drunk</v>

478
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 3>and on pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one champ.</v>

479
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Speaker 3>But then there was another champ with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy had a pet chimp and he went to</v>

480
00:20:58.121 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 3>visit his pet chimp and the chimp got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a certain age.</v>

481
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:04.150
<v Speaker 3>They had to get rid of it cause it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>biting people and it was terrifying.</v>

482
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a bit someone's finger off so</v>

483
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what they do.</v>

484
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 3>The grab your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bite your finger off,</v>

485
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.360
<v Speaker 3>they tear your finger from your hand and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do it like almost instantly.</v>

486
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:14.920
<v Speaker 3>That's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

487
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.130
<v Speaker 3>if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't go for your face left</v>

488
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.450
<v Speaker 3>southern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lift me then with the squirrel monkey.</v>

489
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Once I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I was in first grade,</v>

490
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:25.470
<v Speaker 3>I was so kindergarten kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just me and this squirrel monkey started</v>

491
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Speaker 3>fucking hissing at me.</v>

492
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking terrified.</v>

493
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 3>My grandmother had a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandmother had a monkey.</v>

494
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:33.780
<v Speaker 3>They lived in a base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit a squirrel monkey.</v>

495
00:21:33.781 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 3>It was called Chichi gum chew gum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like open up gum wrappers and</v>

496
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 3>chew gum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets a monkey fucking out of their mind.</v>

497
00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.240
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people,</v>

498
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.480
<v Speaker 3>they went to visit their pet chimp at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sanctuary because they still loved</v>

499
00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:50.350
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a relationship with this champ,</v>

500
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.213
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

501
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.320
<v Speaker 3>we can't be with you anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're coming to visit.</v>

502
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.260
<v Speaker 3>And when they came to visit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dropped off cake.</v>

503
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.840
<v Speaker 3>They gave him a cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a birthday cake.</v>

504
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.200
<v Speaker 3>And the other chimps got furious that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chimp got cake and that they didn't</v>

505
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.080
<v Speaker 3>and someone fucked up and left something</v>
<v Speaker 3>open and they got out and when they got</v>

506
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 3>out they tore this guy apart just</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he gave cake to this one guy and</v>

507
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 3>he didn't give it to him.</v>

508
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 3>So they tore his dick off towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>fingers off.</v>

509
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:20.830
<v Speaker 3>But it's face off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just tear you apart.</v>

510
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bought all your fingers off.</v>

511
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:24.250
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're monsters.</v>

512
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.850
<v Speaker 3>I was on one of those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pet store or one.</v>

513
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way the judge,</v>

514
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 3>different animal tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

515
00:22:30.821 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 3>it's holding a baby gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean really young.</v>

516
00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:37.100
<v Speaker 3>But I mean I thought that this thing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be so fucking powerpoint.</v>

517
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 3>It was just like a baby put his head on</v>
<v Speaker 3>my shoulder and started making out with</v>

518
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nice.</v>

519
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gorillas are more peaceful,</v>

520
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 3>I think a real other than chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps are crazy serve way more violent.</v>

521
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all violent.</v>

522
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.031
<v Speaker 3>They're all vital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

523
00:22:49.031 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 3>gorillas are vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It pretty much exclusively.</v>

524
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So when you see a gorilla and those</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant fangs that they have,</v>

525
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.380
<v Speaker 3>that's just for fighting nothing else.</v>

526
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.710
<v Speaker 3>So they've definitely fight each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the males.</v>

527
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 3>There was a video of a zoo recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These two males beating the shit out of</v>

528
00:23:03.161 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 3>each other and some wildlife preserve</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

529
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 3>See how strong they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird that they're like our</v>

530
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 3>size but stronger tens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm stronger with every way.</v>

531
00:23:12.611 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Full grown grown like 500 pounds or</v>

532
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:17.680
<v Speaker 3>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that makes sense.</v>

533
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they get even bigger.</v>

534
00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Would it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big is the biggest silver back</v>

535
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 3>gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess,</v>

536
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.350
<v Speaker 3>would you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven hundred pounds.</v>

537
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sort of gets ruined by $400.</v>

538
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.140
<v Speaker 3>That's big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go with five,</v>

539
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 3>500 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the.</v>

540
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be right though.</v>

541
00:23:36.241 --> 00:23:38.350
<v Speaker 3>It might be like 800 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

542
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited to find the results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oddly that Jamie,</v>

543
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.040

<v Speaker 4>found a gorilla named titus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to find out if it's a</v>

545
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 4>documentary named titus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gorilla king.</v>

546
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:53.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to find the size.</v>

547
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.350
<v Speaker 1>This is not helping me.</v>

577
00:25:15.721 --> 00:25:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand miles.</v>

578
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Ten thousand miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far?</v>

579
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.890
<v Speaker 1>What's the circumference of the earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

580
00:25:22.891 --> 00:25:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple hundred thousand.</v>

581
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 24,000 miles.</v>

582
00:25:26.671 --> 00:25:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Something that they didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

583
00:25:28.471 --> 00:25:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

584

<v Speaker 1>going to take us,</v>

585
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these guys.</v>

586
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.720
<v Speaker 1>One Guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

587
00:25:33.721 --> 00:25:35.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far do you think the earth is from</v>

588
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the son?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Gun,</v>

589
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 4,000.</v>

590
00:25:36.991 --> 00:25:38.820
<v Speaker 1>5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

591
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:45.350
<v Speaker 1>the sun is 93 million miles and we still</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a sunburn like this wizard.</v>

592
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Carl Sagan all of a sudden.</v>

593
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:48.990
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

594
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.970
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple late years.</v>

595
00:25:56.971 --> 00:26:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't even consider the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're on a giant 24,000 mile ball</v>

596
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.600
<v Speaker 1>and we get cocky as if a kid just</v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed,</v>

597
00:26:04.601 --> 00:26:06.870
<v Speaker 1>but if it dropped two feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd all feel it.</v>

598
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.100
<v Speaker 1>We will if we get hit with something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the thing that gets me.</v>

599
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that recent impact they</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotted on Jupiter?</v>

600
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.240

<v Speaker 2>it was a benefit.</v>

623

<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

626
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:24.240
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's connected.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

641
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Brian is an hour that he does everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the road.</v>

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.390
<v Speaker 2>He's got it honed down to a science and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's ready to do and right</v>

643
00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:06.090
<v Speaker 2>before he's ready to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come to him and tell him to keep</v>

644
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You can be a little blue.</v>

647
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:13.710

649
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask him to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know what someone like,</v>

650
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 2>if you want to hire Gary Clark Jr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want to play the fiddle.</v>

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't play the fucking fiddle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

652
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.470
<v Speaker 2>He's a guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he probably does if he wants to.</v>

653
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.170
<v Speaker 2>If we want it to me.</v>

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't ask them to fucking sing like</v>
<v Speaker 2>adele.</v>

658
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.500
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid to try to get an r rated</v>
<v Speaker 2>comic like callan and tell him to be pg</v>

659
00:28:42.031 --> 00:28:43.830
<v Speaker 2>right before he goes on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's rude.</v>

660
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.350
<v Speaker 2>He's not even that dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's definitely not pg.</v>

661
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.450
<v Speaker 2>He Talks a lot about a lot of caulk.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's plays along with it,</v>

666
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.840

<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

667
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Speaker 2>It's still hurt his feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll play along with it.</v>

668
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Talk about himself and I'm built for</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

816
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Movie that they have the subtitles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they're all speaking english</v>

817
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:19.280
<v Speaker 2>through either a smart because it's hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand that for us.</v>

818
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do that a lot on like reality shows</v>

819
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:23.920
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>TheY'll put in subtitles.</v>

820
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 2>People are whispering about shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

821
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

822
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:31.790
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the slang or the waY they</v>

823
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 2>talk in northern Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their dialect is so much different than</v>

824
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:38.730
<v Speaker 2>american english,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can understand us.</v>

825
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm tAlking like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody can understand me.</v>

826
00:35:41.461 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they grew up on our media,</v>

827
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 2>but then talking to that and fashion is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thing that there's a difference</v>

828
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:47.360
<v Speaker 2>between the way the doctors are already.</v>

829
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I mushed together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good.</v>

830
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:53.790
<v Speaker 2>They're smushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

831
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're lazier with our words.</v>

832
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 2>But do you understand that they grew up</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching the sopranos and seinfeld,</v>

833
00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:03.500
<v Speaker 2>we didn't grow up watching father ted or</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those english or irish shows now.</v>

834
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>top gear,</v>

835
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.510
<v Speaker 2>top gear with jeremy clarkson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard hammered.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

837
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Richard hammond and something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James may.</v>

838
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

839
00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.340
<v Speaker 2>A great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I vaguely remember that.</v>

840
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:19.350
<v Speaker 2>But jeremy clarkson's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the funniest guys on tv in</v>

841
00:36:19.351 --> 00:36:21.480
<v Speaker 2>england who's hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious,</v>

842
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.980
<v Speaker 2>just a car reviewer and just as a writer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a guy reviewed cars,</v>

843
00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 2>love cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

844
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he punched his producer.</v>

845
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.810
<v Speaker 2>They canceled the show apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened.</v>

846
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy I've made up,</v>

847
00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 2>but they're already fired him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm now they're going to do it on</v>

848
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 2>amazon now than to do the same show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to come up with a new name</v>

849
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:44.160
<v Speaker 2>for it because jeremy clarkson has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it and it won't come out.</v>

850
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 2>It will be more than a year from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time they fired him before this new one</v>

851
00:36:49.141 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 2>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe contractual stuff.</v>

852
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.240
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that time they hired a whole new crew</v>

853
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:59.300

894
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I keeps saying chris</v>
<v Speaker 4>evans everywhere.</v>

895
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 4>Is that his name was chris harris?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

897
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Is it you show the same guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's chris evans and not chris</v>

898
00:38:43.011 --> 00:38:44.900
<v Speaker 3>harris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they probably know his name.</v>

899
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.090
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is obviously.</v>

900
00:38:51.091 --> 00:38:52.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a different guy.</v>

901
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.510
<v Speaker 3>WHo is this a?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just go to just google.</v>

902
00:38:57.511 --> 00:39:00.720
<v Speaker 3>Chris evans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what the fuck's going on here.</v>

903
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Get to the bottom of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>

904
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ our era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hardly remember that show.</v>

905
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 3>We'll get a photo of this gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll see.</v>

906
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.220
<v Speaker 4>It looks like chris evans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not chris harris.</v>

907
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.200
<v Speaker 4>So chris harris is the guy that was on</v>
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>

908
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.183
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

909
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Is he on this new show?</v>

910
00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.790
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're both on it and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm confused.</v>

911
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.610
<v Speaker 4>It looks like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's chris harris,</v>

912
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:23.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

913
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This must be confirmed.</v>

914
00:39:25.881 --> 00:39:27.980
<v Speaker 3>So he's one of the new top gear host.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aha.</v>

915
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.240
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

916
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's chris evans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the redheaded gentlemen.</v>

917
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:33.800
<v Speaker 3>And then there's chris harris who's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the show.</v>

918
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that might work.</v>

919
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:38.120
<v Speaker 3>That fucking guy's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris is hilarious.</v>

920
00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.800
<v Speaker 3>He's really funny,</v>

934
00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:22.960
<v Speaker 3>and knowledgeable about the inner</v>

<v Speaker 2>So they have a good room in vegas for</v>

1040
00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.410
<v Speaker 2>first time I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but brad garrets,</v>

<v Speaker 2>room with the mgm parents,</v>

1042
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 2>but political reasons I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a choice but like what you're doing</v>

1043
00:45:03.961 --> 00:45:06.060
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will just nod your head to the</v>

1044
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:11.061
<v Speaker 2>left if you think brad gets better or to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look to look at him.</v>

1045
00:45:11.681 --> 00:45:12.514
<v Speaker 2>Big folks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>inside,</v>

1048
00:45:16.471 --> 00:45:19.920
<v Speaker 2>either one of them is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to organize a time where we're</v>

1049

<v Speaker 2>both in vegas at the same time.</v>

1050
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Know I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often do you do that room?</v>

1051
00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it in july.</v>

<v Speaker 2>At nine.</v>

1055
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

1056
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 2>you could go to the ufc and still make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to your show.</v>

1057
00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:43.590

<v Speaker 2>I had so much fun and especially one of</v>

1058
00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:46.920
<v Speaker 2>the most compelling sam's they've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard of emotion.</v>

1059

<v Speaker 2>I was so glad he won.</v>

1064
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:03.210
<v Speaker 2>It would have been such a bummer with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that crowd like that,</v>

1065
00:46:03.211 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man in montreal and then I'm in toronto.</v>

1067
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Toronto is the biggest crowd we've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>had before.</v>

1068
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Australia for ufc event which you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shows you a.</v>

1069
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Well we've had them in sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the most recent one was in melbourne</v>

1070
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:20.940
<v Speaker 2>and it was this giant arena that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>

1071
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 2>It was more than 60,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was more than the rogers pLace in.</v>

1072
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Was it rod laver?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>

1073
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Rod labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tennis guy.</v>

1074
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.840
<v Speaker 2>But he has his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1075
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like a stadium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be,</v>

1076
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 2>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

1077
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I don't paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to the name of the place,</v>

1078
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.720
<v Speaker 2>but it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love melbourne,</v>

1079
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 2>melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what a goddamn city.</v>

1080
00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:49.200
<v Speaker 2>The and the restaurants are so good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't really smart too.</v>

1081
00:46:49.201 --> 00:46:50.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like someone described it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bath.</v>

1082
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.610
<v Speaker 2>They said it's like a san francisco of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

1083
00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it kind of feels like it is.</v>

1084
00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:56.064
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it there man.</v>

1086
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.380
<v Speaker 2>That's one place outside of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than like vancouver or toronto or</v>

1087
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 2>montreal where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1088
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I could live here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>montreal is cold as fuck.</v>

1089
00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:06.510
<v Speaker 2>So it was toronto in the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1090
00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.300
<v Speaker 2>the people are so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's almost worth the</v>

1091
00:47:09.301 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 2>trade off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1092
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happy.</v>

1093
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it is like they're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>far away from all the trouble.</v>

1094
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you invaded them,</v>

1095
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.450
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to stop to refuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ridiculously for.</v>

1096
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:23.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None amazing.</v>

1097
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:28.260
<v Speaker 2>He took an island and they filled it up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with criminals and it became an awesome</v>

1098
00:47:28.261 --> 00:47:29.094
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Then they got some really good lawyers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the in the aborigines cut a</v>

1100
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 1>really bad deal for the rate for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aborigines.</v>

1101
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will give me all this shit spots in</v>

1102
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:39.970
<v Speaker 1>the middle of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barren land.</v>

1103
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.100
<v Speaker 1>It will take the beaches and the clips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1104
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 1>We'll take all the beautiful area and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys can have where the spiders</v>

1105
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1106
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is definitely a shit deal.</v>

1107
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just a strange a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 20 million people in the entire</v>

1108
00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 1>island and the island where there's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in California are just as many.</v>

1109
00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:58.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>

1110
00:47:58.781 --> 00:48:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's cool about that</v>

1111
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.160
<v Speaker 1>is like your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that door opens,</v>

1112
00:48:03.161 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 1>you're in a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trees are different.</v>

1113
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Everything's dip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going into fall,</v>

1114
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:08.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1115
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever gone to africa?</v>

1116
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:14.230
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about going on one of</v>

1117
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:17.070
<v Speaker 1>those wildlife safari in Tanzania where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1118
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.920
<v Speaker 1>as long as I know that it's in some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a protected device.</v>

1119
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.620
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to any place where you've got</v>

1120
00:48:22.621 --> 00:48:25.310
<v Speaker 1>to get needles to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to go to get needles before</v>

1121
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get needles for south</v>

1122
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:31.920
<v Speaker 1>afriCa and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mom was positive.</v>

1123
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:32.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

1124
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.010
<v Speaker 3>so they have some places in africa we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to get needles and you have to get</v>

1125
00:48:36.011 --> 00:48:38.440
<v Speaker 3>malaria shots and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Tanzania is one of them.</v>

1126
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.900
<v Speaker 3>I would bet that in Zimbabwe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where should I go?</v>

1127
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Where's the spot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to.</v>

1128
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.720
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be cool to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

1129
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like those open jeeps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1130
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust those things I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people use those things.</v>

1131
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:56.140
<v Speaker 3>They say the cats don't jump inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's safe and he totally do it,</v>

1132
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:59.050
<v Speaker 3>but bullshit man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never did before.</v>

1133
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1134
00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess they do it every day and they</v>

1135
00:49:02.051 --> 00:49:03.160
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1136
00:49:03.161 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's probably saved 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the time or 99 percent of the time,</v>

1137
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.000
<v Speaker 3>but if I could be in something where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew that it was completely like closed</v>

1138
00:49:13.001 --> 00:49:15.820
<v Speaker 3>off to the outside world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can move around amongst them.</v>

1139
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I Would tell you that went to Australia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had.</v>

1140
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to see kangaroos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this,</v>

1141
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallabies,</v>

1142
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.330

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1144

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1145
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:29.170
<v Speaker 1>you throw the food at the animals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all happy that you go in there</v>

1146
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:30.800
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1147
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.020
<v Speaker 1>You're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

1148
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:34.060
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feed them fucking kangaroos when</v>

1149
00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 1>they get up there pretty big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 1>if they want kick you and fuck you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>break your back.</v>

1151
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:42.300
<v Speaker 1>And I had the punch and emo in the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1152
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but it was bothering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sophia kept nipping at,</v>

1153
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:49.510
<v Speaker 1>or when I hit that motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very funny because you hear it</v>

1154
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.930
<v Speaker 1>was when I hit him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really clocked him and</v>

1155
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 1>as he ran away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know that you just walked</v>

1156
00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 1>in with the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are dinosaurs,</v>

1157
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:00.910
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1158
00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:01.960
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1159
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:04.720
<v Speaker 1>they think that a good percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs had feathers now</v>

1160
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:11.290
<v Speaker 3>revamp their opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently there's a natural hIstory</v>

1161
00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:15.520
<v Speaker 3>museum now that actually has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's in New York that actually</v>

1162
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:20.521
<v Speaker 3>has a model of a tyrannosaurus with</v>
<v Speaker 3>feathers all over it because they think</v>

1163
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:24.880
<v Speaker 3>it might be what it looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you find that jamie,</v>

1164
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.930
<v Speaker 3>which kind of makes sense if you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about them,</v>

1165
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.340
<v Speaker 3>mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see turkeys,</v>

1166
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.820
<v Speaker 3>we see these bIg ostriches and he moves</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these fucking weird giant birds.</v>

1167
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all dinosaurs and they're</v>

1168
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:41.550
<v Speaker 3>covered with feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

1169
00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:46.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm a natural history museum in New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>city model something New York city model</v>

1170
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:53.320
<v Speaker 3>t rex feathers because they actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like a life size trx or a model of</v>

1171
00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.000
<v Speaker 3>tiera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Large model of tiera might not be life</v>

1172
00:50:57.001 --> 00:50:58.730
<v Speaker 3>size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but It's got feathers all over it.</v>

1173
00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm want to say that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1174
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to think that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starting to think that maybe a lot of</v>

1175
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 3>them had feathers.</v>

1176
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:08.070
<v Speaker 3>So how we would send the of the ocean or</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd descend this,</v>

1177
00:51:08.071 --> 00:51:10.250
<v Speaker 3>the land us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1178
00:51:10.251 --> 00:51:11.990
<v Speaker 3>it's all comes from the original</v>
<v Speaker 3>sources.</v>

1179
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Most likely the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that all that life came from</v>

1180
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:17.060
<v Speaker 3>moisture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1181
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.350
<v Speaker 3>In some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some weird interaction with proteins and</v>

1182
00:51:21.351 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 3>amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That radiation.</v>

1183
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:23.690
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that picture.</v>

1184
00:51:23.691 --> 00:51:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Dom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how crazy is that shit?</v>

1185
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:31.090
<v Speaker 3>What a insane photograph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that is Just insane.</v>

1186
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.160
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think this might be with t rex</v>

1187
00:51:34.161 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 3>looks like if you find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1188
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.090
<v Speaker 3>it looks like the craziest bird ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>

1189
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:46.550
<v Speaker 3>just a demonic bird and it looks fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>

1190
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Kinda looks like hair tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just like feathers.</v>

1191
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:50.864
<v Speaker 3>But you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1192
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.390
<v Speaker 3>you know there were non flight feathers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know</v>

1193
00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:57.260
<v Speaker 3>like some birds have different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>feathers.</v>

1194
00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.350
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that there was these things</v>

1195
00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:04.580
<v Speaker 3>called terror birds that lived in north</v>
<v Speaker 3>America that were enormous.</v>

1196
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.690
<v Speaker 3>They were like nine feet tall birds that</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't live that long ago,</v>

1197
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to say they lived like a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1198
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 3>that's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another different example of.</v>

1199
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.200
<v Speaker 3>That's like a more conservative estimate</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what the feathers looked light,</v>

1200
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:24.190
<v Speaker 3>but there's these comparisons of terror</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds and they put them alongside human</v>

1201
00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 3>beings and they lived right here to</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived in north America where they don't</v>

1202
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:30.410
<v Speaker 3>have any fossils of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

1203
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:34.310
<v Speaker 3>They do have fossils of them and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>were these enormous like nine foot tall</v>

1204
00:52:34.311 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 3>birds but it didn't fly and they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>jacked things,</v>

1205
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 3>killed things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had beaks like a bird,</v>

1206
00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:43.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so because they have beaks like a bird,</v>

1207
00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:47.390
<v Speaker 3>we look at that particular type of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a look at that thing.</v>

1208
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:52.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what these things look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these were real animals.</v>

1209
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:54.990
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the image that we're looking at as a</v>

1210
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.290
<v Speaker 3>drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an artist's rendition of a man looks</v>

1211
00:52:57.291 --> 00:53:01.550
<v Speaker 3>like a six foot tall man standing next</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a volkswagen with these things</v>

1212
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.400
<v Speaker 3>towering above him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you get to see how big these</v>

1213
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.950
<v Speaker 3>failures there were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So big.</v>

1214
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.030
<v Speaker 3>This one is three meters tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's nine feet tall.</v>

1215
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

1216
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Milligrams 400 kilos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousand pounds.</v>

1217
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Fifty cm centimeters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1218
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 3>because this is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A different countrY where they speak</v>

1219
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 3>some heathen language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're called the metric system.</v>

1220
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.000
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty centimeters.</v>

1221
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 3>That's not that very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried to pull it on us,</v>

1222
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 3>but we were two point three meters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four hundred kilograms.</v>

1223
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:41.550
<v Speaker 3>He's 50 centimeters the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1224
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.530
<v Speaker 3>that can't be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the man is out there?</v>

1225
00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1226
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:47.933
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1227
00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:51.980
<v Speaker 6>Hmm?</v>

1228
00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can be 50 centimeters.</v>

1229
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Centimeters like an inch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's less than niche,</v>

1230
00:53:55.101 --> 00:53:57.260
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be really short guy.</v>

1231
00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 3>He'd be a tiny bit below that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1232
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:01.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to a beatles,</v>

1233
00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:02.990
<v Speaker 3>beatles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not very tall.</v>

1234
00:54:02.991 --> 00:54:07.550
<v Speaker 3>So maybe he has a short guy maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but put is 50 centimeters as far as.</v>

1235
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Because 50 centimeters is above his</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

1236
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These two short guides to make a point,</v>

1237
00:54:12.741 --> 00:54:14.570
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>

1238
00:54:14.571 --> 00:54:16.460
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks short because look,</v>

1239
00:54:16.461 --> 00:54:18.950
<v Speaker 3>if it's nine feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only double his size.</v>

1240
00:54:18.951 --> 00:54:21.470
<v Speaker 3>He four and a half feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a child?</v>

1241
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Are they playing with our emotions here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck is going on.</v>

1242
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.380
<v Speaker 3>My point being that fucking thing was</v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

1243
00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Fiftieth centimeters is less than two</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>

1244
00:54:32.931 --> 00:54:34.490
<v Speaker 3>It's only 20 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little dude.</v>

1245
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:36.590
<v Speaker 3>That's not right because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1246
00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.720
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vw bugs,</v>

1247
00:54:38.721 --> 00:54:43.520
<v Speaker 3>definitely taller than that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what year did these things exist?</v>

1248
00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 3>These terrible words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it say what year?</v>

1249
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking weird world we have as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as the biological diversity,</v>

1250
00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is all new to me that we had</v>

1251
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.240
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought we were set on what the</v>

1252
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:02.160
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs looked like by their bone</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>

1253
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 3>This is not a dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one point 8 million years ago</v>

1254
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:09.000
<v Speaker 3>from 62 to one point 8 million years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1255
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:15.470
<v Speaker 3>So if it's from 62 to one point eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that new findings dating them</v>

1256
00:55:16.111 --> 00:55:19.080
<v Speaker 3>to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four hundred 50,000 and 17,000 years ago</v>

1257
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.800
<v Speaker 3>would imply that some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1258
00:55:22.801 --> 00:55:27.690
<v Speaker 3>how do you say that word for us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fat for us.</v>

1259
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Raw saids forest acids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest ras.</v>

1260
00:55:31.651 --> 00:55:36.651
<v Speaker 3>it's survived there until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I the late pleistocene.</v>

1261
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this claim is debated.</v>

1262
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:43.560
<v Speaker 3>So it's possible that it was 17,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1263
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:49.010
<v Speaker 3>it's likely that it's somewhere between</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and one point 8 million years ago,</v>

1264
00:55:50.281 --> 00:55:52.860
<v Speaker 3>which is like way later than dinosaurs.</v>

1265
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.430
<v Speaker 3>The dinosaurs 65 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the oldest date,</v>

1266
00:55:56.431 --> 00:56:00.030
<v Speaker 3>they have a 62 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's 3 million years newer than the</v>

1267
00:56:00.031 --> 00:56:02.640
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These monster,</v>

1268
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 3>as birds survive that impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they are.</v>

1269
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:09.710
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think it hit where they</v>

1270
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.660
<v Speaker 3>think it hit the yucatan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that killed the dinosaurs?</v>

1271
00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:16.080
<v Speaker 3>they pretty much know where it hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this whole push out of the</v>

1272
00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:17.730
<v Speaker 3>orbit a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1273
00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:20.280
<v Speaker 3>they think it did something to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere for sure.</v>

1274
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>They think it rained lava like literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>rained lava.</v>

1275
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 3>They think the impact from it clouded</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sky and cause nuclear winter.</v>

1276
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:32.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean the impact had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1277
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 3>the actual sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the globe.</v>

1278
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:39.580
<v Speaker 3>The earth itself was ringing a bell for</v>
<v Speaker 3>like years.</v>

1279
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the area.</v>

1280
00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 3>That's the area where it hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what?</v>

1281
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine how big that that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That 65 million years ago,</v>

1282
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:58.040
<v Speaker 3>that thing hit and everything started</v>
<v Speaker 3>from scratch.</v>

1283
00:56:58.041 --> 00:57:02.810
<v Speaker 3>The whole world got a whole new order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's different and that can</v>

1284
00:57:02.811 --> 00:57:05.660
<v Speaker 3>happen at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only can it happen at anytime,</v>

1285
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:09.020
<v Speaker 3>it's most likely going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we should ever get too cocky.</v>

1286
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.280
<v Speaker 3>Never get too cocky.</v>

1287
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.920
<v Speaker 3>You gotta take a leak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>

1288
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:15.343
<v Speaker 3>what are you showing me?</v>

1289
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:20.233
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1290
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:21.600
<v Speaker 3>we'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1291
00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Relax.</v>

<v Speaker 3>wrote down.</v>

1293

<v Speaker 3>I had to read his handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

1294
00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:32.320
<v Speaker 3>How long before people don't write</v>
<v Speaker 3>things anymore,</v>

1295
00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 3>but we write that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wrote those notes.</v>

1296

1299
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:46.540
<v Speaker 3>we see a chalkboard and the menus</v>
<v Speaker 3>written in chocolate.</v>

1300
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wrote it themselves.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't teach cursive anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I learned something new.</v>

1313
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 3>That was when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>

1314
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:22.750
<v Speaker 3>alligators were endangered and we would</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to this place called lake alice in</v>

1315
00:58:22.751 --> 00:58:25.120
<v Speaker 3>gainesville.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd feed the alligators marshmallows</v>

1316
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:27.460
<v Speaker 3>and it was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1317
00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't worry aBout allIgators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were around,</v>

1318
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:31.540
<v Speaker 3>there were always around and they really</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't bother.</v>

1319
00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 3>People know they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's just this agreement with</v>

1320
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:36.940
<v Speaker 3>people in algiers for whatever fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>stranger.</v>

1321
00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:38.050

<v Speaker 3>It didn't make any sense.</v>

1322
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:42.100
<v Speaker 3>It was almost like evolutionarily it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad idea for them to fuck with people,</v>

1323
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 3>so they Just don't bother me.</v>

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Seeing that thing in that mouth come up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Costa Rica and I saw some</v>

1353
01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.570
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went on this tour.</v>

1354
01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.370
<v Speaker 3>He'd get in a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh jesus.</v>

1355
01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:13.080
<v Speaker 3>You get in a boat and you see these</v>
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles like lounging themselves on</v>

1356
01:00:13.081 --> 01:00:14.850
<v Speaker 3>the border,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the banks of water,</v>

1357
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.420
<v Speaker 3>and then when you're passing by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just run and slither into the water</v>

1358
01:00:18.421 --> 01:00:20.820
<v Speaker 3>and go under the brown water and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't find them.</v>

1359
01:00:20.821 --> 01:00:22.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where the fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1360
01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 3>So eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference between the.</v>

1361
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:27.210
<v Speaker 3>An alligator crocodile is a way more</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>

1362
01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Way more aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1363
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Those are smaller crocodiles because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're south american crocodiles.</v>

1364
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.310
<v Speaker 3>They're not like nile crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there were nile crocodiles.</v>

1365
01:00:35.311 --> 01:00:36.990
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't even want to be in a boat</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1366
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.640
<v Speaker 3>You definitely wouldn't want to be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those boats.</v>

1367
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.380
<v Speaker 3>They'll knock it over now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll fuck you up.</v>

1368
01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:41.550
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1369
01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I forget what nature magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like national geographic or one of those</v>

1370
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.700
<v Speaker 3>types of magazines that had a story</v>
<v Speaker 3>about these kayakers that we're,</v>

1371
01:00:50.701 --> 01:00:54.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going down a river in the Congo,</v>

1372
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I forget what river it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were going down this river and</v>

1373
01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:04.140
<v Speaker 3>this one guy was behind this other guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a kayak and you watched the app.</v>

1374
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.600
<v Speaker 3>The croc come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snap a whole of its jaws,</v>

1375
01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.680
<v Speaker 3>snap as jaws down in the kayak and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull it under like a bobber and flipped</v>

1376
01:01:13.831 --> 01:01:16.170
<v Speaker 3>it over and he watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1377
01:01:16.171 --> 01:01:17.670
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kayaker,</v>

1378
01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:21.540
<v Speaker 3>kayakers recount deadly Congo crocodile</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack.</v>

1379
01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:26.930
<v Speaker 3>So he flipped over the kayak and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kayaks bouncing up and down because</v>

1380

<v Speaker 3>Like they don't have anybody to manage</v>

1398
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 3>the population and these lions are</v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating there undulates,</v>

1399
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:26.490
<v Speaker 3>although the antelopes and all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1402
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 3>what they in africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call them professional hunters.</v>

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:36.570
<v Speaker 3>They're like guides and he's just people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are hired by the government and</v>

1404
01:02:36.571 --> 01:02:38.340
<v Speaker 3>they're going in there and they had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill some lions,</v>

1405
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.490
<v Speaker 3>had killed lions that were encroaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>on people's property and killing</v>

1406
01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:45.360
<v Speaker 3>livestock and threatening people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IT's just so weird.</v>

1407
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I remember that discussion you had with</v>
<v Speaker 3>jenn that night in the bar.</v>

1408
01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killing deer and hill,</v>

1409
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.560
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to kill some where they'd all</v>
<v Speaker 3>be dead.</v>

1410
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about it here on the podcast</v>

1411
01:02:54.781 --> 01:02:55.614
<v Speaker 3>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1412
01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.900
<v Speaker 3>John Dudley was here and we found a</v>
<v Speaker 3>statistic that's unbelievably insane.</v>

1413
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.590
<v Speaker 3>And that statistic is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one point $5 million car</v>

1414
01:03:04.591 --> 01:03:07.750
<v Speaker 3>accidents a year where people hit deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>

1415
01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just in America we knew that it was</v>

1416
01:03:10.171 --> 01:03:12.600
<v Speaker 3>50,000 in Michigan where like how crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that?</v>

1417
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.310
<v Speaker 3>But then we found out about the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1418
01:03:14.311 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 3>We were lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

1419
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:18.720
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when my friend john lives like him</v>

1420
01:03:18.721 --> 01:03:20.430
<v Speaker 3>and his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they have conversations on the</v>

1421
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:22.320
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always like,</v>

1422
01:03:22.321 --> 01:03:24.330
<v Speaker 3>as they're talking about their drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>home from work,</v>

1423
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:24.991
<v Speaker 3>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1424
01:03:24.991 --> 01:03:25.980
<v Speaker 3>we almost hit a deer.</v>

1425
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.680
<v Speaker 3>I saw a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw five deer.</v>

1426
01:03:27.681 --> 01:03:31.800
<v Speaker 3>So I drive slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's the who you can they also</v>

1427
01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:35.610
<v Speaker 3>have these little whistles that you put</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the front of your car that lets the</v>

1428
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:36.091
<v Speaker 3>deer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1429
01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:37.980
<v Speaker 3>your comment and the deer were generally</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of the way.</v>

1430
01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:41.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like a high pissed pitched whistle</v>
<v Speaker 3>that only like the deer can here.</v>

1431
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 3>And then also a lot of guys they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm just going to get a battering</v>

1432
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:48.240
<v Speaker 3>ram and the front of my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they do is they get these deer</v>

1433
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:52.530
<v Speaker 3>guards and they put them on semis in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular because there's places where</v>

1434
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:55.970
<v Speaker 3>truckers are hauling goods in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the night.</v>

1435
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Even the day doesn't even have to be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the night,</v>

1436
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.830
<v Speaker 3>but they'll run into a truck and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>truck will get crippled by a deer.</v>

1437
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:06.660
<v Speaker 3>The deer will go into the gearing into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the engine bay and just destroy</v>

1438
01:04:06.661 --> 01:04:08.220
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tear out the radiator,</v>

1439
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:13.460
<v Speaker 3>so they had to develop these gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like mad max style bumpers that they put</v>

1440
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:19.590
<v Speaker 3>on the front of these semis just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect the truck itself from fucking</v>

1441
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:24.710
<v Speaker 3>killing things like deer slamming into</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and a lot of people get killed to 200</v>

1442
01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:26.030
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>

1443
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.060
<v Speaker 3>We'Ll look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1444
01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 3>We have this fucking picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at this picture of,</v>

1445
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:35.541
<v Speaker 3>this guy's got this gigantic metal</v>
<v Speaker 3>barrier in the front of his truck and</v>

1446
01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:39.210
<v Speaker 3>his deer just went into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crushed it,</v>

1447
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.690
<v Speaker 3>crushed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it spray painted the side of the</v>

1448
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:46.920
<v Speaker 3>truck red all the way up to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>windshield and the deer psych hanging</v>

1449
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.650
<v Speaker 3>from the front bumper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

1450
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.450

<v Speaker 3>Look at the size of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1453
01:04:55.081 --> 01:05:00.000
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're driving around a non</v>
<v Speaker 3>aerodynamic battering ram Just to</v>

1454
01:05:00.001 --> 01:05:05.001
<v Speaker 3>protect your car from slamming into</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1455
01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1456
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1457
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:15.500
<v Speaker 3>hitting a hundred 50 pound animal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going 70 miles an hour.</v>

1458
01:05:15.501 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that one with the cars.</v>

1459
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Get the deer hanging out of the front</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's inside the engine.</v>

1460
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:22.510
<v Speaker 3>Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1464
01:05:31.691 --> 01:05:33.220

<v Speaker 3>but this guy died because the man in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of him hit a deer.</v>

1466
01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:42.550
<v Speaker 3>The deer went flying over that person's</v>
<v Speaker 3>hood and through his windshield and kill</v>

1467
01:05:42.551 --> 01:05:43.510

1469
01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking blood and gore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.360
<v Speaker 3>Jamie bumming me out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1471
01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a deer in the front seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them.</v>

1472
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.710
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1473
01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.800
<v Speaker 3>she's a loving person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1474
01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.180
<v Speaker 3>that's why she has this distorted</v>
<v Speaker 3>perception of it.</v>

1475
01:05:58.540 --> 01:05:59.590
<v Speaker 3>She's a loving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loving,</v>

1476
01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.960
<v Speaker 3>forgetting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She says one of these animals to die.</v>

1477
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants him to die.</v>

1478
01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about this world that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in.</v>

1479
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.120
<v Speaker 3>It's very ambiguous and a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of.</v>

1480
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 3>There's not a clear right and a wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that seem like</v>

1481
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.710
<v Speaker 3>they're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't do them,</v>

1482
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:21.520
<v Speaker 3>everything's going to be way worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of those things is killing</v>

1483
01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 3>beautiful animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's wrong to kill deer.</v>

1484
01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.550
<v Speaker 3>If you don't kill deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way world.</v>

1485
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.390
<v Speaker 3>They're fucked and then we're fucked and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be diseases and there's</v>

1486
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:34.090
<v Speaker 3>going to be a lot of problems is also</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be a lot of predators.</v>

1487
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.480
<v Speaker 3>If you have a surplus of deer nature</v>
<v Speaker 3>finds a balance.</v>

1488
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.120
<v Speaker 3>If you have a surplus of deer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's any predators in the area,</v>

1489
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get a surplus of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators because it was predator is</v>

1490
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:44.770
<v Speaker 3>going to have way more food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to thrive.</v>

1491
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:46.480
<v Speaker 3>They're going to breed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they ain't going to have to figure</v>

1492
01:06:46.481 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 3>out how to manage not Just the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also going to have to manage</v>

1493
01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:51.370
<v Speaker 3>the predator population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're just going to have to.</v>

1494
01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't do it.</v>

1495
01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:54.250
<v Speaker 3>You've got real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1496
01:06:54.251 --> 01:06:57.460
<v Speaker 3>That's an 18 foot long alligator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shot what?</v>

1497
01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 3>Killing cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1498
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 3>This was in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he was killing cows.</v>

1499
01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>

1500
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:10.870
<v Speaker 3>So this is predator control and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that much of a problem with this</v>

1501
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:13.600
<v Speaker 3>kind of predator control because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking heartless,</v>

1502
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Speaker 3>cold blooded monster by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were trying.</v>

1503
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.400
<v Speaker 3>We still retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to figure out what the</v>

1504
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.190
<v Speaker 3>difference between a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can a komodo dragon to be the</v>

1505
01:07:21.191 --> 01:07:24.790
<v Speaker 3>biggest lizard and a crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not because it's bigger.</v>

1506
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a reptile.</v>

1507
01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:31.570
<v Speaker 3>That's how stupid we are is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different because lizards,</v>

1508
01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.430
<v Speaker 3>there's reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>google it.</v>

1509
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Some people are tweeting me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1510
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:40.070
<v Speaker 3>That's the extent I researched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:41.373
<v Speaker 3>Reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

1512
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:46.060
<v Speaker 3>Get together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch lizards are widespread group of</v>

1513
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.380
<v Speaker 3>squats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guamate reptiles.</v>

1514
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:51.420
<v Speaker 3>But a crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a lizard is a reptile to different</v>

1515
01:07:51.421 --> 01:07:52.240
<v Speaker 3>kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1516
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.330
<v Speaker 3>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like we're apes,</v>

1517
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 3>but we're not monkeys or apes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1518
01:07:57.701 --> 01:07:59.350
<v Speaker 3>All monkeys or apes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But not all.</v>

1519
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:02.980
<v Speaker 3>All apes or monkeys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1520
01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All monkeys or apes.</v>

1521
01:08:04.931 --> 01:08:07.650
<v Speaker 3>But not all apes or monkeys that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1523
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:13.630

<v Speaker 3>I think that's it.</v>

1524
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are simeon's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like an ape</v>

1525
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.270
<v Speaker 2>is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1526
01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Apes or chimps and gorillas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>orangutans and us.</v>

1527
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And baboons,</v>

1528
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:23.150
<v Speaker 2>ms dot babylonian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All mammals.</v>

1529
01:08:23.151 --> 01:08:24.860
<v Speaker 2>But we're not all the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammal.</v>

1530
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fish or are like seeing marsupial's,</v>

1531
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:31.090

<v Speaker 2>The ubc and the people,</v>

1532
01:08:31.091 --> 01:08:34.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a pouch is hardier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was an article recently that</v>

1533
01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:39.680
<v Speaker 2>this guy wrote the saying that the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey isn't like people criticized the</v>

1534
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>word monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the correct word to use.</v>

1535
01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:44.150
<v Speaker 2>And he said that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only is it not true,</v>

1536
01:08:44.151 --> 01:08:45.800
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all apes or monkeys,</v>

1537
01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 2>but not all monkeys or apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1538
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:52.541
<v Speaker 2>I think the title of this guy's paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>was really interesting because I always</v>

1539
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 2>thought that the word monkey was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a slang.</v>

1540
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:56.303
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1541
01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Know the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can actually use that word.</v>

1542
01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just a different species of</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've lost my patience with some.</v>

1607
01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Some people like looking for an easy way</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1608
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get it because people ask for you to</v>

1609
01:11:53.571 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always think like this club owner</v>

1614
01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1615
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:04.050
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some legitimate questions that</v>

1616
01:12:04.051 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Speaker 2>young comics was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does one go about getting a manager</v>

1617
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:09.030
<v Speaker 2>to get an agent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that kind of stuff.</v>

1618
01:12:09.031 --> 01:12:12.600
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's good for us to give advice to</v>

1619
01:12:12.601 --> 01:12:15.870
<v Speaker 2>young comics saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not get a manager because it's the</v>

1620
01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:19.340
<v Speaker 2>first manager that asks you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that are going</v>

1621
01:12:19.341 --> 01:12:21.960
<v Speaker 2>to be the first manager that asks you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>manage them and they might not be right</v>

1622
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:22.790
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

1623
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:25.490
<v Speaker 2>That's why you look at a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>like chapelle or you know,</v>

1624
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:27.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these guys that have left their</v>
<v Speaker 2>management,</v>

1625
01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:30.660
<v Speaker 2>like they started with one guy and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to be with them anymore and</v>

1626
01:12:30.661 --> 01:12:32.670
<v Speaker 2>they laughed and they left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe again,</v>

1627
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>time and I'll never forget the look was</v>

1642
01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.120
<v Speaker 2>dipping in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>management.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1645

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Kevin james,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kevin,</v>

1647
01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:22.980
<v Speaker 2>james,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good friend and one of his earlier</v>

1648
01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 2>managers was giving him fucking terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>advice,</v>

1649
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 2>including wanting them to stay fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin was trying to be healthy.</v>

1650
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>It was trying to Lose some weight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy literally said to them,</v>

1651
01:13:32.071 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 2>cover them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lose weight,</v>

1652
01:13:33.301 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna lose roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get cast lovable fat</v>

01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:40.140
<v Speaker 2>guy that's paying off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stick with it,</v>

1654
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:42.990
<v Speaker 2>stick with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was his real statement.</v>

1655
01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:44.760
<v Speaker 2>if you lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose roles.</v>

1656
01:13:44.761 --> 01:13:47.760
<v Speaker 2>and kevin came back to talk to me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and he was just really eaten up by</v>

1657
01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:48.630
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1658
01:13:48.631 --> 01:13:51.510
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's not what kevin wanted to</v>

1659
01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:54.750
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like kevin is a guy that works hard and</v>

1660
01:13:54.751 --> 01:13:58.430
<v Speaker 2>he's very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he like,</v>

1661
01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.470
<v Speaker 2>if you tell him that the sky is falling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll be like,</v>

1662
01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:03.570
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it showing the sky's falling?</v>

1663
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:06.360
<v Speaker 2>The sky's falling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he needs encouragement.</v>

1664
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Like when he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really funny.</v>

1665
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 2>When he's around his friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about Joey being</v>

1666
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:11.860
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by people like</v>

1667
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.480
<v Speaker 3>kevin operates kind of in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with what.</v>

1668
01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:18.340
<v Speaker 3>We had a great dinner when I remember I</v>
<v Speaker 3>came to see what the poem.</v>

1669
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1670
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:22.810
<v Speaker 3>It was fun to see him relaxed and was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he knows I love him,</v>

1671
01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.940
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why it was fun doing those</v>

1672
01:14:24.941 --> 01:14:27.070
<v Speaker 3>movies with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But kevin,</v>

1673
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.010
<v Speaker 3>when you're supporting them and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's around people that support</v>

1674
01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:31.870
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he can be himself and he can cut</v>

1675
01:14:31.871 --> 01:14:33.580
<v Speaker 3>louis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you got someone telling you,</v>

1676
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.280
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get healthy because if you get</v>

1677
01:14:36.281 --> 01:14:39.670
<v Speaker 3>healthy you won't be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to choose one or the other.</v>

1678
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:41.140
<v Speaker 3>and I go to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1679
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:44.350
<v Speaker 3>think about how many people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny that aren't fat telling me that</v>

1680
01:14:44.351 --> 01:14:46.690
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible for you to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hilarious.</v>

1681
01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:47.770
<v Speaker 3>His whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his whole,</v>

1682
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.770
<v Speaker 3>the act wasn't predicated on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at all,</v>

1683
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 3>but he felt in some weird way that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people loved him because he was a big</v>

1684
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:57.070
<v Speaker 3>jolly guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1685
01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.570
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking talented as hell and so it</v>
<v Speaker 3>angered me.</v>

1686
01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.690
<v Speaker 3>It angered me that someone would try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>limit him in that way,</v>

1687
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.860
<v Speaker 3>that someone would try to put him in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the problem with having a bad</v>

1688
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:12.760
<v Speaker 3>manager when you're a young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when everything is just starting out and</v>

1689
01:15:12.761 --> 01:15:15.040
<v Speaker 3>you know you're in your twenties and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all vulnerable and you only</v>

1690
01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:18.400
<v Speaker 3>started out just a few years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still getting your feet wet and</v>

1691
01:15:18.401 --> 01:15:19.930
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to do this</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1692
01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.080
<v Speaker 3>Know it's about juggling like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should I go like that and you know,</v>

1693
01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:27.220
<v Speaker 3>kevin would do this thing where he calls</v>
<v Speaker 3>going full shimmy and full.</v>

1694
01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Shelia was any fucking freaked out about</v>
<v Speaker 3>something because shimmy was his</v>

1695
01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:31.030
<v Speaker 3>nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We always call him shimmy.</v>

1696
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a full shimmy would be when he would</v>

1697
01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:39.760
<v Speaker 3>just go ballistic and like he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would be like,</v>

1698
01:15:39.761 --> 01:15:43.330
<v Speaker 3>one time we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were hanging out together and I went</v>

1699
01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:45.400
<v Speaker 3>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a gig and I just went with him to</v>

1700
01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:46.780
<v Speaker 3>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to laugh,</v>

1701
01:15:46.781 --> 01:15:47.650
<v Speaker 3>just to sit down and laugh.</v>

1702
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.310
<v Speaker 3>And because I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like having a great time because</v>

1703
01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:53.290
<v Speaker 3>he knew he'd hear me laugh showing off</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

1704
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:57.450
<v Speaker 3>He said he got into it because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1705
01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I swear to god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't know how good Kevin James</v>

1706
01:15:59.981 --> 01:16:01.900
<v Speaker 3>was at one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one point in his career.</v>

1707
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm assuming he's just as good</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1708
01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:05.350
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't seen him do standup in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

1709
01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.760
<v Speaker 3>But when he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going off and,</v>

1710
01:16:08.761 --> 01:16:09.480
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1711
01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.900
<v Speaker 3>he like was faces red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was spitting and it was just going</v>

1712
01:16:13.901 --> 01:16:16.210
<v Speaker 3>off about something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was what we would call going</v>

1713
01:16:16.211 --> 01:16:18.600
<v Speaker 3>full shimmy and like be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1714
01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to do that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>worried about people not liking you.</v>

1715
01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:24.730
<v Speaker 3>If you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be free to go off.</v>

1716
01:16:25.050 --> 01:16:26.800
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're a guy like joey,</v>

1717
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:29.260
<v Speaker 3>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be free to be able to just</v>

1718
01:16:29.261 --> 01:16:33.160
<v Speaker 3>cut loose and those bad managers are</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking terrible for that because</v>

1719
01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:34.450
<v Speaker 3>they've never done stand up.</v>

1720
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.860
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

1721
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:37.990
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't grasped the concept that</v>

1722
01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 3>each individual has to find their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>

1723
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:45.070
<v Speaker 3>All they're thinking about it as how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>mold someone into some bullshit persona</v>

1724
01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.740
<v Speaker 3>from marketing for a marketing point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>

1725
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Know for marketing purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're thinking.</v>

1726
01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:52.380
<v Speaker 3>How can I sell this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

1729
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:58.510
<v Speaker 3>just take your own path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people make it in two years.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like there's a whole process to it.</v>

1759
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:18.680
<v Speaker 2>You take some air out of your tires and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's places where you're allowed to</v>

1760
01:18:18.681 --> 01:18:22.220
<v Speaker 2>drive onto the sand and you pull up on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sand.</v>

1761
01:18:22.221 --> 01:18:25.360
<v Speaker 2>These are like fairly remote areas in</v>
<v Speaker 2>long island and these guys cotu</v>

1762
01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:28.460

<v Speaker 2>striped bass.</v>

1763

<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody wants to catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to catch stripers and casting</v>

1767
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:40.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't catch them that often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you run into a whole</v>

1768
01:18:40.431 --> 01:18:43.490
<v Speaker 2>school level them and everybody catches</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and those are like these magical</v>

1769
01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:45.110
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'S an interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>FisHing is like an interesting</v>

1776
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever caught a fish and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooked it and ate it?</v>

1777

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pescatarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of these people that say</v>

1780
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:20.900
<v Speaker 2>they only meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they fish like as if that's humane</v>

1781
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.900
<v Speaker 2>is a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have feelings.</v>

1782
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't take care of the children.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What fish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know this shit out.</v>

1784
01:19:27.231 --> 01:19:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Some eggs and the mail comes over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes on him like a freak show.</v>

1785
01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very rude.</v>

1786
01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:35.810
<v Speaker 2>That's how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who we talk about this later.</v>

1787
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I saw a guy on instagram bragging about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he's 90 percent vegetarian.</v>

1788
01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 2>He was talking shit about people who eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat and hunters in particular.</v>

1789
01:19:47.151 --> 01:19:48.860
<v Speaker 2>You're talking shit about hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying,</v>

1790
01:19:48.861 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1791
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm 90 percent vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what you people are doing.</v>

1792
01:19:52.881 --> 01:19:56.720
<v Speaker 2>It's awful like fuck bacon because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>delicious.</v>

1793
01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.990
<v Speaker 2>How funny is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're someone who can attest that he</v>

1794
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.900
<v Speaker 2>fucking bacon ham sandwiches</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburgers.</v>

1795
01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then he goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's tryIng to say that he's got some</v>

1796
01:20:05.991 --> 01:20:10.230
<v Speaker 2>moral right to complain about someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who hunts because he's 90 percent</v>

1797
01:20:10.231 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian and vegan either by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means milk,</v>

1798
01:20:13.321 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 2>animal products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs.</v>

1799
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough particulate fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous dummy,</v>

1800
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:23.070
<v Speaker 2>but that that taking the moral high</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground from saying I killed less animals</v>

1801
01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:28.190
<v Speaker 2>per year than most men most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not killing anything.</v>

1802
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:32.370
<v Speaker 2>People are so goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent vegetarian.</v>

1803
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.690
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you would write that down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

1804
01:20:33.691 --> 01:20:36.860
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it posted.</v>

1805
01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will I let this motherfucker?</v>

1806
01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:42.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard that.</v>

1807
01:20:42.061 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 2>That'S the most ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever heard a lot of</v>

1808
01:20:44.581 --> 01:20:47.400
<v Speaker 2>rationalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's so many dummies out there,</v>

1809
01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:51.600
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that like if you did go catch a</v>

1810
01:20:51.601 --> 01:20:53.940
<v Speaker 2>fish once and then cook it and eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get it.</v>

1811
01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:56.910
<v Speaker 2>You definitely get a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

1812
01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.420
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to catch them and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>taste so good.</v>

1813
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:05.070
<v Speaker 2>If you can catch a fish and then have it</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooked or you cook it within a few hours</v>

1814
01:21:05.071 --> 01:21:07.350
<v Speaker 2>of pulling it out of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>

1815
01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something happens to fish when it sits</v>

1816
01:21:10.921 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 2>around for too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when it's frozen and thawed out,</v>

1817
01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.580
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't retain the same quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it has when you pull it right out</v>

1818
01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:18.331
<v Speaker 2>of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1819
01:21:18.331 --> 01:21:21.340
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at honolulu and they had a,</v>

1820
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:23.190
<v Speaker 2>a place where you cook your own fish.</v>

1821
01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll fish</v>

1822
01:21:26.710 --> 01:21:29.120
<v Speaker 2>to wash my own dishes to what the book</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a restaurant.</v>

1823
01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 2>We don't like go to those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1824
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:33.420
<v Speaker 2>those grill places where you lay the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat out.</v>

1825
01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:36.870
<v Speaker 2>They have like a japanese place near me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I was like these little grills in</v>

1826
01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:38.850
<v Speaker 2>front of the bace yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1827
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:40.890
<v Speaker 2>And you lay the meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cook it right in front of you.</v>

1828
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.110
<v Speaker 2>You seen that show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Korean barbecue.</v>

1829
01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Korean barbecue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've also seen a japanese one,</v>

1830
01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably ripped it off froM the</v>

1831
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:48.990
<v Speaker 2>kranz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>

1832

<v Speaker 2>It's still a controversy over the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cook.</v>

1833
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.950
<v Speaker 2>You cook it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kinD of weird.</v>

1834
01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:57.170
<v Speaker 2>You're cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1835

<v Speaker 2>but I've seen them on tv probably</v>

1838
01:22:03.721 --> 01:22:05.390
<v Speaker 2>because there's only one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1839
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.210
<v Speaker 2>You go pick up your meat like a butcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the front of the store is at</v>

1840
01:22:08.211 --> 01:22:11.010
<v Speaker 2>butcher type place in the back is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of grills and you hang out with</v>

1841
01:22:11.011 --> 01:22:13.320
<v Speaker 2>your friends and grill your own steaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that the puzzle was too difficult for</v>

2084
01:32:47.701 --> 01:32:50.790
<v Speaker 3>them to solve for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they never got there.</v>

2085
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:54.330
<v Speaker 3>They never got there and then they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck and they would do these sets of</v>

2086
01:32:54.331 --> 01:32:57.470
<v Speaker 3>the store and they would do the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>material and you knew the jokes.</v>

01:32:57.471 --> 01:33:01.380
<v Speaker 3>You knew the punchline because they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been doing them for 15 years and we all</v>

2122
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:33.820

<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a long time ago.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like it was like all of a sudden these</v>

2127
01:34:43.381 --> 01:34:45.410

<v Speaker 1>it wasn't happening for you tonight.</v>

2128
01:34:45.411 --> 01:34:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Daymond let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I Just felt so rodney comes up to</v>

<v Speaker 1>then I got it,</v>

2133
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my introduction</v>

<v Speaker 2>at barry's?</v>

2136
01:35:03.721 --> 01:35:05.400
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was upset about both of them.</v>

2137
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Just a daymond happened to be the one</v>
<v Speaker 2>right on before me was well farm or</v>

2138
01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was now they were really tanking and</v>

2139
01:35:13.101 --> 01:35:16.670
<v Speaker 2>both of them are very effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and I was just pissed up</v>

2140
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.890
<v Speaker 2>because my thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2141
01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.550
<v Speaker 2>it's 10 minute addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do it,</v>

2142
01:35:19.551 --> 01:35:22.880
<v Speaker 2>do the best you can and get off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't keep going because you're not</v>

2143
01:35:22.881 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 2>doing well or don't keep going because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing well.</v>

2144
01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that like if you are</v>

2145
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:31.580
<v Speaker 2>the audition for the comedy store and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you one of those five minutes</v>

2146
01:35:31.581 --> 01:35:33.470
<v Speaker 2>bots or three minutes or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell it is.</v>

2147
01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:36.950
<v Speaker 2>How many minutes is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's three and when they come</v>

2148
01:35:36.951 --> 01:35:40.070
<v Speaker 2>see you though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring somebody in special showcase.</v>

2149
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.700
<v Speaker 2>This seems like 10 minutes each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you bring somebody in,</v>

2150
01:35:43.701 --> 01:35:47.270
<v Speaker 2>if someone auditions for the talent</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordinator was how many minutes do they</v>

2151
01:35:47.271 --> 01:35:49.460
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a pro comes in and they do</v>

2152
01:35:49.461 --> 01:35:51.140
<v Speaker 2>a set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do 10 minutes.</v>

2153
01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it is,</v>

2154
01:35:52.881 --> 01:35:54.950
<v Speaker 2>if you go over that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want to ask you.</v>

2155
01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this won't.</v>

2156
01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't need this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2157
01:35:58.650 --> 01:36:02.110
<v Speaker 2>We don't need some person who can't find</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend that.</v>

2158
01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

2159
01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just respect other people's time and</v>

2160
01:36:08.151 --> 01:36:10.580
<v Speaker 2>let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I told fucking thing about going on</v>

2161
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:14.150
<v Speaker 2>when eddie griffin and those guys and</v>
<v Speaker 2>never had a problem with eddie,</v>

2162
01:36:14.151 --> 01:36:16.700
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that he will go on for hours.</v>

2163
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It would close the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd go on at nine and stay on 1:00 in</v>

2164
01:36:20.631 --> 01:36:24.470
<v Speaker 2>the morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wasn't even supposed to be like</v>

2165
01:36:24.471 --> 01:36:25.070
<v Speaker 2>on the lineup.</v>

2166
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:28.340
<v Speaker 2>He would just show up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was when he was a huge star.</v>

2167
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:30.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place has always been weird with</v>

2168
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:33.200
<v Speaker 2>when people are huge stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could just come in like damon needs</v>

2169
01:36:33.201 --> 01:36:36.650
<v Speaker 2>to be able to come in anytime he wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would go on stage and do 45</v>

2170
01:36:36.651 --> 01:36:38.420
<v Speaker 2>minutes or whatever he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2171
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:40.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you allowed tHem,</v>

2172
01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed them that moment with</v>

2173
01:36:43.581 --> 01:36:44.600
<v Speaker 2>some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2174
01:36:44.601 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 2>my thing is like one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had anything to anybody younger than</v>

2175
01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:53.930
<v Speaker 2>me that was my friend was to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was not to abuse your power or be</v>

2176
01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:55.820
<v Speaker 2>a jerk off about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody,</v>

2177
01:36:55.821 --> 01:36:57.980
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to bump somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up to them and say,</v>

2178
01:36:57.981 --> 01:37:00.080
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do 10 minutes.</v>

2179
01:37:00.081 --> 01:37:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Are you cool with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they say,</v>

2180
01:37:01.491 --> 01:37:03.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't wait.</v>

2181
01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of us have a real problem with it.</v>

2182
01:37:05.151 --> 01:37:07.880
<v Speaker 2>We don't like it and we don't do it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't done it,</v>

2183
01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:10.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big believer in it.</v>

2184
01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not that hard to call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never bumped people.</v>

2185
01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's hard to call.</v>

2186
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:18.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard to call in and get on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule and just,</v>

2187
01:37:18.621 --> 01:37:19.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to figure it out.</v>

2188
01:37:19.551 --> 01:37:22.520
<v Speaker 2>And if you do show up and they asked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put you on,</v>

2189
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's bumping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you show up in the club,</v>

2190
01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:28.670
<v Speaker 2>asks you to go on and do a study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie shore's okay.</v>

2191
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:31.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't say hey I want to go on after</v>

2192
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I rare I'll put me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the thing that like,</v>

2193
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who used to like to do,</v>

2194
01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:38.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to,</v>

2195
01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:39.200
<v Speaker 2>not really mexican.</v>

2196
01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:42.980
<v Speaker 2>He used to like to show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of it?</v>

2197
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Don't say his name is like candy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people like to do it as like a power</v>

2198
01:37:48.241 --> 01:37:49.100
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2199
01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:51.530
<v Speaker 2>And they like to do it in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say if they didn't like you,</v>

2200
01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.780
<v Speaker 2>they will go up in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go on after.</v>

2201
01:37:53.781 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 2>I really like say if someone was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you and he didn't like them,</v>

2202
01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:00.540
<v Speaker 2>he'd go on right after you say I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on next and then just go in there and</v>

2203
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:03.660
<v Speaker 2>just crush for 40 minutes and do half</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shit.</v>

2204
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.460
<v Speaker 2>But that was a different scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2205
01:38:07.461 --> 01:38:09.570
<v Speaker 2>it was like a vampire and an artist's</v>
<v Speaker 2>colony.</v>

2206
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Red band said that he saw somebody do</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my jokes.</v>

2207
01:38:14.970 --> 01:38:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

2208
01:38:16.150 --> 01:38:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I think he said then the guy they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like on a tv thing and the guy</v>

2209
01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:22.890
<v Speaker 2>hollered out that maria is joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>

2210
01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He because he told me he was going to</v>

2211
01:38:25.081 --> 01:38:26.580
<v Speaker 2>text you with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he forgot.</v>

2212
01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:29.350
<v Speaker 2>That's unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw a thing.</v>

2213
01:38:30.130 --> 01:38:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Killing prime forgets everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2214
01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.270
<v Speaker 2>does he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partying.</v>

2215
01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Seventh grade time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids squeezing an Orange.</v>

2216
01:38:37.210 --> 01:38:39.310
<v Speaker 2>he's getting the juices out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2217
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:40.830
<v Speaker 2>He smoked A little weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dom.</v>

2218
01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:43.570
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he does anything?</v>

2219
01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:45.300
<v Speaker 2>All things in moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph.</v>

2220
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.700
<v Speaker 2>So your xanax thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it puts you.</v>

2221
01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:50.700
<v Speaker 2>You were saying at the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast puts you like in a like a level</v>

2222
01:38:50.701 --> 01:38:52.860
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any downside to it?</v>

2223
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drowsiness,</v>

2224
01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.760
<v Speaker 2>drowsiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the drowsiness probably calms you</v>

2225
01:38:56.761 --> 01:38:58.250
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you like maybe a little bit</v>

2226
01:38:58.251 --> 01:38:59.850
<v Speaker 2>more hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean I don't get nervous for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

2228
01:39:01.771 --> 01:39:05.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't get nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get nervous for just being the ent</v>

2229
01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:10.650
<v Speaker 2>existential angst of being or like were</v>
<v Speaker 2>you worried about mortality?</v>

2230
01:39:10.651 --> 01:39:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Worry about death or just on the hip on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2231
01:39:14.071 --> 01:39:15.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was,</v>

2232
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:21.310
<v Speaker 2>I was a stupid joke about we have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a finite number of loads left</v>

2233
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:26.550
<v Speaker 2>that we have enough just to shoot a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>

2234
01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.860
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking it's kind of sad but</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2235
01:39:29.861 --> 01:39:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many loads I have left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2236
01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:34.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of how much your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>

2237
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine if you spit in a bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body would be forced to produce</v>

2238
01:39:40.231 --> 01:39:42.060
<v Speaker 2>more spit because you're constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>spitting.</v>

2239
01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2240
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:44.790
<v Speaker 2>like if you decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2241
01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:47.630
<v Speaker 2>today is april,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2242
01:39:47.631 --> 01:39:50.880
<v Speaker 2>team 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next 30 years.</v>

2243
01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to see how much spit I can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my spare time so I'm to get a vat,</v>

2244
01:39:56.370 --> 01:40:01.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to dig a hole in my backyard</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have some glass makers make this</v>

2245
01:40:02.221 --> 01:40:06.000
<v Speaker 2>gigantic vat on my lift up the lid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to spit in it every day and</v>

2246
01:40:06.001 --> 01:40:09.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to fill that glass up</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I die here.</v>

2247
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a good answer out of you.</v>

2248
01:40:13.291 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 2>If you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to Like the thing like you</v>

2249
01:40:15.511 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 2>know like the lid of a fucking hot tub</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you lift it up and there's only got</v>

2250
01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:23.700
<v Speaker 2>seven foot deep that it's made out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>glass and you're Just chucking louise in</v>

2251
01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:27.210
<v Speaker 2>there and closing it up every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much spit would you actually be able</v>

2252
01:40:27.211 --> 01:40:29.640
<v Speaker 2>to create?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prevent evaporation,</v>

2253
01:40:29.641 --> 01:40:33.150
<v Speaker 2>so you would probably create life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can probably some new fucking</v>

2254
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:35.820
<v Speaker 2>organism that grow out a thing and kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fucking neighbors.</v>

2255
01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cleans up a bit with spit that,</v>

2256
01:40:37.931 --> 01:40:41.760
<v Speaker 2>so I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little classier level spit.</v>

2257
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would sAy calm.</v>

2258
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:46.110
<v Speaker 2>You could do it with two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't be able to measure it</v>

2259
01:40:46.111 --> 01:40:47.880
<v Speaker 2>because hopefully you're coming into</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody</v>

2260
01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 2>or in the back of her head</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hard to scrape</v>

2261
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.150
<v Speaker 3>it off and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2262
01:40:55.450 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 3>But if you spit into a vat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have like a control.</v>

2263
01:40:59.010 --> 01:41:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Have the that you have a nice seal air</v>
<v Speaker 3>tight seal so it's not going to</v>

2264
01:41:03.251 --> 01:41:05.290
<v Speaker 3>evaporate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2265
01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Lift it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Close it down.</v>

2266
01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:08.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2267
01:41:08.670 --> 01:41:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean hoW much come would be lost in</v>

2268
01:41:11.051 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 3>their hair alone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would never get an accurate</v>

2269
01:41:13.601 --> 01:41:15.850
<v Speaker 3>measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have to like adjust for hair</v>

2270
01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:16.721
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2271
01:41:16.721 --> 01:41:20.320
<v Speaker 3>How much did you end up scraping off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My got about a half an ounce,</v>

2272
01:41:20.321 --> 01:41:22.300
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's another quarter in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hair.</v>

2273
01:41:22.690 --> 01:41:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to like put an asterisk next</v>

2274
01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:31.330
<v Speaker 3>to how much come did he come today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I definitely have the thing of how</v>

2275
01:41:31.331 --> 01:41:34.090
<v Speaker 3>many times left in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when I was a kid,</v>

2276
01:41:34.690 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I rememBer being four years old and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the mirror and going,</v>

2277
01:41:37.961 --> 01:41:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I'm going to die some</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and I'm so fucking cute.</v>

2278
01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I remember a conversation to have with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my stepdad when I was seven and it was</v>

2279
01:41:49.601 --> 01:41:52.520
<v Speaker 3>right when I had lost my religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost my religion one.</v>

2280
01:41:52.521 --> 01:41:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

2281
01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.870
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2282
01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:56.980
<v Speaker 3>I went to see age of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic school,</v>

2283
01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.220
<v Speaker 3>catholic school did me in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just realized it was bullshit and my</v>

2284
01:42:00.221 --> 01:42:02.800
<v Speaker 3>parents were kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My stepdad was a hippie and my,</v>

2285
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:07.000
<v Speaker 3>my parents were kind of becoming hippies</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my mom was becoming a hippie,</v>

2286
01:42:07.001 --> 01:42:08.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out my step dad.</v>

2287
01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 3>But when I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2288
01:42:11.021 --> 01:42:12.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>

2289
01:42:12.971 --> 01:42:14.590
<v Speaker 3>if there's no heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no god,</v>

2290
01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:17.650
<v Speaker 3>what happens to you when you die?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He's like,</v>

2291
01:42:18.010 --> 01:42:20.380
<v Speaker 3>probably nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably just use aren't here anymore.</v>

2292
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I started crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started crying.</v>

2293
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was just so scared.</v>

2294
01:42:26.370 --> 01:42:28.930
<v Speaker 3>I was just a natural instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to end.</v>

2295
01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:33.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all have it and it's part of the,</v>

2296
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:38.550
<v Speaker 3>the management of life is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>decide which way you allow your brain to</v>

2297
01:42:42.191 --> 01:42:42.490
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2298
01:42:42.490 --> 01:42:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Not just today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but forever.</v>

2299
01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.880
<v Speaker 3>For as long as you're conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be certain roads.</v>

2300
01:42:48.881 --> 01:42:52.660
<v Speaker 3>You don't go down and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do,</v>

2301
01:42:53.050 --> 01:42:56.800
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to look at those</v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects or whatever those roads are</v>

2302
01:42:56.830 --> 01:43:01.000
<v Speaker 3>rationally because if you just want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>freak out and sit here and freak out</v>

2303
01:43:01.001 --> 01:43:04.120
<v Speaker 3>about death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to enjoy this moment</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is what you've got.</v>

2307
01:43:13.631 --> 01:43:14.940
<v Speaker 3>You've got right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do you mean?</v>

2308
01:43:14.941 --> 01:43:16.870
<v Speaker 3>When is it going to be over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

2309
01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:19.540
<v Speaker 3>It literally does not matter for this</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment right now,</v>

2310
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 3>for this moment right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to do because got enjoy this</v>

2311

<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to dwell on that.</v>

2312

<v Speaker 3>Just leave that knowledge in your head</v>
<v Speaker 3>and enjoy this [inaudible].</v>

2313
01:43:31.451 --> 01:43:36.451

<v Speaker 3>thing was temporary and the whole time</v>

2314
01:43:37.301 --> 01:43:38.980
<v Speaker 3>you could enjoy it because you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>worried.</v>

2315
01:43:38.981 --> 01:43:42.580
<v Speaker 3>When was it going to end and there were</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many cool aspects of it and so many</v>

2316
01:43:42.581 --> 01:43:45.340
<v Speaker 3>fun things to do.</v>

01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.870
<v Speaker 2>didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do it because you are</v>

2320
01:43:53.871 --> 01:43:57.800
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed by the fear of this thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even experiencing to the</v>

2321
01:43:57.801 --> 01:44:01.970
<v Speaker 2>fullest ending and also by the seeking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reward at the end.</v>

2322
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Like as if this time isn't a reward in</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:05.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking time to cement that into my</v>

2326
01:44:09.951 --> 01:44:12.220
<v Speaker 2>stupid ed and that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:30.030
<v Speaker 2>not sick anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a flourishing.</v>

2396
01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally different.</v>

2397
01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:34.560
<v Speaker 2>It was on the ropes for three years</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I think it was going to stay open.</v>

2398
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I came back with,</v>

2399
01:47:35.731 --> 01:47:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I watched already do a special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

2400
01:47:37.921 --> 01:47:40.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you watch the podcast with ari and</v>

2401
01:47:40.651 --> 01:47:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you notice that I almost cried like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

2402
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:46.360
<v Speaker 2>You'd be correct when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I left it or no,</v>

2403
01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I almost cried because we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about me coming back to the store and</v>

2404
01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it goes again.</v>

2405
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been my friend since he was a</v>

2406
01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 2>doorman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:59.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were buddies when he was an amateur,</v>

2408
01:47:59.610 --> 01:48:04.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just starting out and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to be on a hiatus from the store,</v>

2409
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:06.031
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

2410
01:48:06.031 --> 01:48:08.940
<v Speaker 2>didn't perform there for seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one of the main,</v>

2411
01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:11.310
<v Speaker 2>the main motivating factor was two</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2412
01:48:11.311 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 2>One that I'm adam egot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It came,</v>

2413
01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:19.040
<v Speaker 2>came to see me at the improv and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to me and told me he's running it</v>

2414
01:48:19.261 --> 01:48:22.260
<v Speaker 2>now and I knew adam from phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix,</v>

2415
01:48:22.261 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was big.</v>

2416
01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:24.840
<v Speaker 2>That was big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the biggest one was</v>

2417
01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:27.930
<v Speaker 2>that a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or he was doing his special.</v>

2418
01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.370
<v Speaker 2>They're just no way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2419
01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:32.570
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I was going to miss that.</v>

2420
01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:33.211
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2421
01:48:33.211 --> 01:48:34.560
<v Speaker 2>do you remember me telling you to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>back?</v>

2422
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I said to you,</v>

2423
01:48:36.571 --> 01:48:38.490
<v Speaker 2>I remember exactly the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2424
01:48:38.491 --> 01:48:40.590
<v Speaker 2>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that past is over.</v>

2425
01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:43.560
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got a bunch of your friends are</v>

2426
01:48:43.561 --> 01:48:46.650
<v Speaker 2>over there and we would love you to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2427
01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:50.100
<v Speaker 2>It was like going to because they bet on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong horse.</v>

2428
01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that whole thing went down.</v>

2429
01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:57.480
<v Speaker 2>It was just so many crazy things going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on at that place was running it before</v>

2430
01:48:57.481 --> 01:49:00.360
<v Speaker 2>it was out of his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has nothing to do with the past.</v>

2431
01:49:00.361 --> 01:49:02.430
<v Speaker 2>That's why it was so great that you came</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2432
01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody loves you there.</v>

2436
01:49:09.861 --> 01:49:11.730
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about people's</v>

2437

2439
01:49:17.821 --> 01:49:18.750
<v Speaker 2>twice a week there.</v>

2440
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:20.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you were to places that I didn't</v>

2441
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:24.320
<v Speaker 2>feel like driving to the ice house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2442
01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear you brother.</v>

2443
01:49:26.641 --> 01:49:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way,</v>

2444
01:49:27.630 --> 01:49:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy.</v>

2445
01:49:28.861 --> 01:49:30.540
<v Speaker 2>But I still like doing the ice house to</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2446
01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying weekend there soon.</v>

2447
01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I like iT too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking place is awesome.</v>

2448
01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:36.990
<v Speaker 2>This is the greatest time ever for</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

2449
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.050
<v Speaker 2>This is the greatest spot to la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I didn't live in la,</v>

2450
01:49:40.051 --> 01:49:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really would like.</v>

2451
01:49:42.241 --> 01:49:45.120
<v Speaker 2>There's so much good comedy on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a lot of good writing going on.</v>

2452
01:49:45.121 --> 01:49:46.320
<v Speaker 2>It's competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2453
01:49:46.410 --> 01:49:47.970
<v Speaker 2>it's competitive and it's also</v>

2454
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:52.810
<v Speaker 3>healthy supportive way more than it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 20 years ago.</v>

2455
01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Like when we first came here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were here before me,</v>

2456
01:49:55.841 --> 01:49:57.490
<v Speaker 3>but when I first came here in</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 94,</v>

2457
01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:01.660
<v Speaker 3>it just was fucking real shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't supportive.</v>

2458
01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:03.700
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was out for themselves.</v>

2459
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:07.080
<v Speaker 3>it was tainted also by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what this is.</v>

2460
01:50:07.081 --> 01:50:11.260
<v Speaker 3>I have this theory and I'm pretty pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure there's some validity to it.</v>

2461
01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:16.150
<v Speaker 3>I think that the standup comedy of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties and the nineties that we knew</v>

2462
01:50:16.151 --> 01:50:21.151
<v Speaker 3>of this was also tainted by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>television business because everybody</v>

2463
01:50:21.911 --> 01:50:23.710
<v Speaker 3>was trying to get a tv deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2464
01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:28.030
<v Speaker 3>so the guys who came out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was trying to do showcase sets</v>

2465
01:50:28.031 --> 01:50:33.031
<v Speaker 3>for executives and for writers and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were trying to get a set together so</v>

2466
01:50:33.401 --> 01:50:38.320
<v Speaker 3>they could cash in like roseanne and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>their cells that fat seinfeld money or</v>

2467
01:50:38.321 --> 01:50:42.550
<v Speaker 3>then rhett butler money get the long</v>
<v Speaker 3>cash that will come with being the star</v>

2468
01:50:42.551 --> 01:50:43.300
<v Speaker 3>of a sitcom.</v>

2469
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.390
<v Speaker 3>That was the goal of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we.</v>

2470
01:50:45.490 --> 01:50:50.490
<v Speaker 3>We had this sort of actory thing going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on in comedy and it was weird,</v>

2471
01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:54.280
<v Speaker 3>it was weird for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when the sitcoms started drying up</v>

2472
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:58.480
<v Speaker 3>because of the reality shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of comics got resentful because</v>

2473
01:50:58.481 --> 01:51:03.481
<v Speaker 3>like even marin got resentful with me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my show in his mind was taking</v>

2474
01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:08.491
<v Speaker 3>up a slot that could have been filled by</v>
<v Speaker 3>comics that were working as writers,</v>

2475
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:10.360
<v Speaker 3>but my point was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2476
01:51:10.361 --> 01:51:13.510
<v Speaker 3>but the comments work and his writers</v>
<v Speaker 3>know this fear factor.</v>

2477
01:51:13.530 --> 01:51:14.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear effect,</v>

2478
01:51:14.170 --> 01:51:18.280
<v Speaker 3>but my point was at is writers are still</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even doing standup.</v>

2479
01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.650
<v Speaker 3>I guess not taking anything away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the art of standup.</v>

2480
01:51:20.970 --> 01:51:23.080
<v Speaker 3>It's just a slot on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately,</v>

2481
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:27.820
<v Speaker 3>those shows all the brutal and weird and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that they just sort of decimated</v>

2482
01:51:27.821 --> 01:51:29.080
<v Speaker 3>the sitcom landscape.</v>

2483
01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:32.290
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them that there's not even</v>
<v Speaker 3>nearly as many sitcoms as there used to</v>

2484
01:51:32.291 --> 01:51:34.170
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember how many goddamn sitcoms there</v>

2485
01:51:34.171 --> 01:51:35.810
<v Speaker 3>were at one time I met with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2486
01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:39.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of fucking reality shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of weirdness in these,</v>

2487
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:45.030
<v Speaker 3>but what that forced everyone to do was</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go online and then stand up right now</v>

2488
01:51:46.061 --> 01:51:47.750
<v Speaker 3>is just about standup again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2489
01:51:47.890 --> 01:51:51.280
<v Speaker 3>so like the goal is now not to get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitcom,</v>

2490
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 3>which is still awesome if you're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone like dalea,</v>

2491
01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:57.570
<v Speaker 3>but the goal is instead to get netflix</v>
<v Speaker 3>specials like so gura,</v>

2492
01:51:58.150 --> 01:52:02.900
<v Speaker 3>so garage has no tv to speak of and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling out big ass theaters.</v>

2493
01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:05.950
<v Speaker 3>He's killing it and it's just from</v>
<v Speaker 3>netflix specials.</v>

2494
01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:08.980
<v Speaker 3>So the whole thing changed from his</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

2495
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:12.220
<v Speaker 3>from other people's podcasts where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to know him and then from netflix</v>

2496
01:52:12.221 --> 01:52:15.220
<v Speaker 3>specials the whole thing changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the goal now.</v>

2497
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:19.630
<v Speaker 3>So I think like the level of comedy is</v>
<v Speaker 3>really high now because everybody's like</v>

2498
01:52:19.631 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 3>in the comedy again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of guys that are into</v>

2499
01:52:22.211 --> 01:52:26.500
<v Speaker 3>doing it for the sake of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>JuSt the fun of going out there and</v>

2500
01:52:26.501 --> 01:52:27.760
<v Speaker 3>putting on a live show.</v>

2501
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:30.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked me to go,</v>

2502
01:52:30.231 --> 01:52:33.850
<v Speaker 1>what do you still do it so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go because I love it and I'm trying to</v>

2503
01:52:33.851 --> 01:52:36.790
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will improve how you're going to</v>

2504
01:52:36.791 --> 01:52:39.520
<v Speaker 1>improve and like basically your agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2505
01:52:39.521 --> 01:52:42.400
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to try to fucking give up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

2506
01:52:42.401 --> 01:52:43.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2507
01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I know I'll do this bit that I did 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years</v>

2508
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.360
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be new to them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2510
01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:50.450

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2511

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talia said you're not an older guy like</v>

2512
01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:55.460

<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

2513
01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that applies to everything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2514
01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:59.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you got a guy who's a,</v>

2515
01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:04.280

<v Speaker 2>laurels or a guy who was an old author</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to.</v>

2520
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:18.560
<v Speaker 2>He could still do it and you'll feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>better if you do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Instagram is great.</v>

2548
01:54:18.831 --> 01:54:20.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never been on facebook.</v>

2549
01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:21.800
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

2550
01:54:21.850 --> 01:54:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hired two girls to help me with that.</v>

2551
01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:25.910
<v Speaker 2>They sent dick pics to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Whose idea was that first idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that somebody this year?</v>

2553
01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:34.340
<v Speaker 2>The dick pic guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2554
01:54:34.341 --> 01:54:36.200
<v Speaker 2>no dick pics are probably like</v>
<v Speaker 2>polaroids.</v>

2555
01:54:36.201 --> 01:54:39.390
<v Speaker 2>They probably drew my cave walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably dudes trace the outline of</v>

2556
01:54:39.391 --> 01:54:41.950
<v Speaker 2>their deck and threw rocks at women</v>
<v Speaker 2>common.</v>

2557
01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:46.300
<v Speaker 2>We'll go look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been ticked.</v>

2558
01:54:46.301 --> 01:54:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Pigs had been around as long as cameras</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been around.</v>

2559
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:51.980
<v Speaker 2>How long did the camera existed before</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first dude took a picture of his</v>

2560
01:54:51.981 --> 01:54:54.140
<v Speaker 2>dick with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long a week?</v>

2561
01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:55.920
<v Speaker 2>How long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first degree.</v>

2562
01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I bet the first dick pic was to answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2563
01:54:58.670 --> 01:55:02.720
<v Speaker 2>I honestly believe that if cameras are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't have to be operated by</v>

2564
01:55:02.721 --> 01:55:04.640
<v Speaker 2>more than one person at the time they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>created,</v>

2565
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't give it more than a month</v>
<v Speaker 2>before a guy took a picture of his dick</v>

2566
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:11.870
<v Speaker 2>from the making of the very first camera</v>
<v Speaker 2>to taking a photo of his dick.</v>

2567
01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I would say one month because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how else you gotta look at your dick.</v>

2568
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:18.290
<v Speaker 2>You have to use a mirror and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>mirrors back then were like looking into</v>

2569
01:55:18.291 --> 01:55:20.750
<v Speaker 2>a pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you barely see what you look like.</v>

2570
01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:26.000
<v Speaker 2>You know you'll get your reflection in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>car mirror like a car window.</v>

2571
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:28.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice storage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting hungry now.</v>

2572
01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand five year old erotic,</v>

2573
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:37.930
<v Speaker 2>2,500 year old erotic graffiti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Found an unlikely setting on the age g</v>

2574
01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.340
<v Speaker 2>and island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2575
01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>what's erotic about it as a dick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys got a weird dick though.</v>

2576
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I think you should go to an ancient dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Throwing balls with the little squares</v>

2577
01:55:49.471 --> 01:55:51.780
<v Speaker 3>in his looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His balls with a grenade.</v>

2578
01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:53.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's has it?</v>

2579
01:55:53.221 --> 01:55:56.130
<v Speaker 3>That's a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can be a cactus over here.</v>

2580
01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:57.500
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Archeologists.</v>

2581
01:55:58.430 --> 01:56:03.430
<v Speaker 3>TiNa's art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they don't know shit that in a dick,</v>

2582
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.230
<v Speaker 3>if that's a dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are dicks have evolved?</v>

2583
01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if we found out the dicks used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look different.</v>

2584
01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:10.800
<v Speaker 3>They've changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've changed shape like we find like</v>

2585
01:56:10.801 --> 01:56:14.460
<v Speaker 3>a petrified frozen dick from like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>million years ago and we.</v>

2586
01:56:14.461 --> 01:56:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would it look like a million years</v>

2587
01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:19.800
<v Speaker 3>ago we'll look for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has changed,</v>

2588
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:21.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neanderthals had those giant ass fucking</v>

2589
01:56:21.721 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 3>foreheads to look like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a forearm was growing off the top</v>

2590
01:56:24.961 --> 01:56:27.330
<v Speaker 3>of your brows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2591
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:31.080
<v Speaker 3>This big thing at the end of the faces</v>
<v Speaker 3>were different.</v>

2592
01:56:31.081 --> 01:56:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Their build were different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are their dicks were different that</v>

2593
01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.190
<v Speaker 3>you could actually eat with it?</v>

2594
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Put your hands exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Push food and the amount that was</v>

2595
01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:48.900
<v Speaker 3>watching an elephant eat bamboo ones and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elephant.</v>

2596
01:56:48.930 --> 01:56:51.210
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting to see like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

2597
01:56:51.570 --> 01:56:54.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I realized until I saw an</v>
<v Speaker 3>elephant eat at the zoo,</v>

2598
01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:58.020
<v Speaker 3>how much dexterity they have in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>trunk,</v>

2599
01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:03.090
<v Speaker 3>but he's stepping on this bamboo and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just tearing the leaves off like really</v>

2600
01:57:03.091 --> 01:57:06.750
<v Speaker 3>like unbelievably powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just rips them off with no effort at</v>

2601
01:57:06.751 --> 01:57:08.910
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bundles it up and then he was stuffing</v>

2602
01:57:08.911 --> 01:57:11.520
<v Speaker 3>it in his mouth and I was watching the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing play out.</v>

2603
01:57:11.521 --> 01:57:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2604
01:57:12.451 --> 01:57:15.750
<v Speaker 3>what an interesting body part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That trunk is.</v>

2605
01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:19.530
<v Speaker 3>What other animal can feed itself with</v>
<v Speaker 3>his nose?</v>

2606
01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Wrap its nose around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaves hold branches down with its feet</v>

2607
01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:27.480
<v Speaker 3>and pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just strip the leaves off,</v>

2608
01:57:27.481 --> 01:57:30.300
<v Speaker 3>roll it up in a ball with its nose</v>
<v Speaker 3>already can do it.</v>

2609
01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:31.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it anymore.</v>

2610
01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:35.550
<v Speaker 3>They don't try to think of an answer to</v>
<v Speaker 3>his question with me.</v>

2611
01:57:36.710 --> 01:57:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>religious past.</v>

2615

02:07:24.821 --> 02:07:29.821
<v Speaker 3>this really weird interview man where he</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about like the importance of not</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was so awkward and goofY because you</v>

2838
02:07:45.101 --> 02:07:46.060
<v Speaker 3>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2851
02:08:31.961 --> 02:08:36.420
<v Speaker 3>match is he wanted to wrestle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Told that to andy cohen.</v>

2852
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:37.420
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hm,</v>

2853
02:08:38.150 --> 02:08:40.420
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop these some gay stuff there.</v>

2854
02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Why do you want to wrestle a guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get on top you and</v>

2855
02:08:44.210 --> 02:08:47.210
<v Speaker 3>doMinated you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call me glib about you.</v>

2856
02:08:47.211 --> 02:08:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Choke on my dick.</v>

2857
02:08:52.420 --> 02:08:55.600
<v Speaker 3>The moment he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I take him in a wrestling match?</v>

2858
02:08:55.601 --> 02:08:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Could I tackle him on the set?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you imagine how dumb you have to</v>

2859
02:08:59.351 --> 02:09:01.660
<v Speaker 3>be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy calls you glib and your reaction</v>

2860
02:09:01.661 --> 02:09:04.390
<v Speaker 3>is you want to attack him that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>

2861
02:09:04.391 --> 02:09:07.720
<v Speaker 3>can I take him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I take him male posturing?</v>

2862
02:09:07.721 --> 02:09:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Dom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very dangerous.</v>

2863
02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:11.380
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine doing that to matt</v>
<v Speaker 3>lauer.</v>

2864
02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:14.040
<v Speaker 3>I would love matt lauer just tackling</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone on show and just ground and</v>

2865
02:09:14.050 --> 02:09:16.670
<v Speaker 3>pound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see that matt lauer just</v>

2866
02:09:16.930 --> 02:09:18.490
<v Speaker 3>passes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God moves to full mount,</v>

2867
02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:21.730
<v Speaker 3>starts dropping elbows on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think of him as a tough guy.</v>

2868
02:09:22.410 --> 02:09:24.660
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked with him a lot of times when he</v>

2869
02:09:24.661 --> 02:09:27.260
<v Speaker 3>used to be a guy in philly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hAve the news guy and billy,</v>

2870
02:09:27.450 --> 02:09:29.590
<v Speaker 3>it might be a tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I just don't think of him as</v>

2871
02:09:29.591 --> 02:09:31.840
<v Speaker 3>a guy who had assault someone for</v>
<v Speaker 3>calling them glib.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm a scientologist.</v>

2876
02:09:37.331 --> 02:09:38.164
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2877
02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:41.500
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck these science psychologists,</v>

2878
02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.550
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology's all you need.</v>

2879
02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brooke shields,</v>

2880
02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:50.500
<v Speaker 3>puerco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tom cruise.</v>

2881
02:09:50.650 --> 02:09:54.010
<v Speaker 3>But it's amazing that he has stayed</v>
<v Speaker 3>relevant.</v>

2882
02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was that big drop off after</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2883
02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:58.240
<v Speaker 3>but then his talent pulled them through</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2884
02:09:58.241 --> 02:10:00.520
<v Speaker 3>He did a bunch of good movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's because he does his own</v>

2885
02:10:00.521 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 3>stunts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's just a crazy motherfucker and</v>

2886
02:10:03.071 --> 02:10:05.380
<v Speaker 3>people like them because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely does and he does</v>

2887
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:07.390
<v Speaker 3>motorcycles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stents does some dangerous shift,</v>

2888
02:10:07.391 --> 02:10:10.840
<v Speaker 3>the playing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those mission impossible movies done</v>

2889
02:10:10.841 --> 02:10:13.120
<v Speaker 3>a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of stuff.</v>

2890
02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:14.890
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2891
02:10:15.190 --> 02:10:17.530
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2892
02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:20.020
<v Speaker 3>You can be both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was.</v>

2893
02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:21.970
<v Speaker 3>He started in taps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was.</v>

2894
02:10:21.971 --> 02:10:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2895
02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been in a bunch of movies,</v>

2896
02:10:25.631 --> 02:10:28.700
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in That movie with ralph macho.</v>

2897
02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.930
<v Speaker 3>What was that fucking movie where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all like greasers and shit.</v>

2898
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 3>The law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god dammit.</v>

2899
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Outsiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outsiders.</v>

2900
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:38.360
<v Speaker 2>He was great in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always great.</v>

2901
02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking great actor is greater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you that edge of</v>

2902
02:10:41.691 --> 02:10:45.080
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow movie is bad ass is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best science fiction movies I've seen in</v>

2903
02:10:45.081 --> 02:10:49.460
<v Speaker 2>a long time and I think a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scifi geeks might have ignored it a</v>

2904
02:10:49.461 --> 02:10:53.030
<v Speaker 2>little bit because it's a tom cruise</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie because I think if it was just</v>

2905
02:10:53.031 --> 02:10:57.110
<v Speaker 2>like some really respected guy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe people didn't know about,</v>

2906
02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:58.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2907
02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.680
<v Speaker 2>would be appreciated more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that.</v>

2908
02:11:00.681 --> 02:11:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that sometimes a guy like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost hurts a movie that's that good.</v>

2909
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:07.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expect him in like a blockbuster,</v>

2910
02:11:07.251 --> 02:11:09.350
<v Speaker 2>like a mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impossible one of those action movies</v>

2911
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:12.440
<v Speaker 2>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's so god damn good in this movie.</v>

2912
02:11:12.441 --> 02:11:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people give them the</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit that he deserves.</v>

2913
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a good movie if you're into those</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of movies.</v>

2914
02:11:17.391 --> 02:11:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Like I love a good scifi movie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2915
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:22.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a great one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best scifi movies over</v>

2916
02:11:22.791 --> 02:11:25.240
<v Speaker 2>the last few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say so jeremy?</v>
