<v Speaker 1>John John Speakers and he.</v>

16
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.850
<v Speaker 1>John Anthony West is trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out his phone.</v>

17
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Please.</v>

18
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Did we lose the skype connection?</v>

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

20
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Did we lose a skype connection with him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't hear us.</v>

22
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 4>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one I.</v>

23
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 2>something is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 2>he turns the volume off on his computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you listening to us through your </v>

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 2>computer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Through your phone?</v>

26
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 2>You need to turn the volume off on </v>
<v Speaker 2>ustream page.</v>

27
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 2>So there should be on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're looking at Ustream,</v>

28
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 2>there should be a mute button on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual video that you're watching.</v>

29
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 2>What I'm guessing is is that you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>using a skype phone and so when you </v>

30
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 2>muted your computer it probably needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

31
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sir,</v>

<v Speaker 1>little volume icon.</v>

36
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>If you just killed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should fix everything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Corner low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower,</v>

<v Speaker 1>honored to get to talk to a man named </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Anthony West.</v>

72
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.360
<v Speaker 1>John is an egyptologist,</v>

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.861
<v Speaker 1>comment about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said that you're more of a proof </v>

76
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:49.861
<v Speaker 1>reader for history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>

77
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>you're more than an egyptologist.</v>

78
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.690
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>

79
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 5>School,</v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on my audience,</v>

80
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 5>I sometimes call myself a rogue </v>
<v Speaker 5>egyptologist,</v>

81
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>a rogue egyptologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you folks who aren't seeing </v>

82
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening to this,</v>

83
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.891
<v Speaker 1>only on Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John has an office that is exactly what </v>

84
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I would hope and pray his office would </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like,</v>

85
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>just filled with documents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and books.</v>

86
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

87
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Look at all that information behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look like a mad scientist.</v>

88
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>You look like Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this car.</v>

89
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

90
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>you're a mad scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

91
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 5>People have called me that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

92
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I first was turned onto your work by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NBC special on the Sphinx that was </v>

93
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>hosted by Charlton Heston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a very controversial thing </v>

94
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.120
<v Speaker 1>that NBC aired right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a special on the mysteries of</v>

95
00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:49.121
<v Speaker 1>the dating of the Sphinx and became </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely fascinated by the compelling </v>

96
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:54.701
<v Speaker 1>evidence that you and Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schoch presented to all these </v>

97
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:58.481
<v Speaker 1>traditional egyptologists that the rain </v>
<v Speaker 1>erosion on this function closure had to </v>

98
00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:03.110
<v Speaker 1>have come from literally the seven or </v>
<v Speaker 1>8,000</v>

99
00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:06.680
<v Speaker 1>years earlier than they were predated </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they were dating this finks</v>

100
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably more than that Gel and we'll </v>

101
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 5>get into that if we want to discuss it </v>
<v Speaker 5>further,</v>

102
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 5>but that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the most conservative date.</v>

103
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.540
<v Speaker 5>That shock as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

104
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.660
<v Speaker 5>as a bonafide phd geologist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's sort of constrained to take the </v>

105
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 5>most conservative view,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even had doubts about it when he was</v>

106
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:29.580
<v Speaker 5>saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now he's,</v>

107
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 5>he's loosening up by a lot and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically on,</v>

108
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 5>on the same car as me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

109
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:41.431
<v Speaker 5>holding open the possibility that it may</v>
<v Speaker 5>be as old as actually as $36,000</v>

110
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:48.141
<v Speaker 5>bc or even older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason for that is not Santa </v>

111
00:05:48.141 --> 00:05:51.841
<v Speaker 5>sizing or anything of the sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Egyptians themselves in several in </v>

112
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 5>London,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a tablet,</v>

113
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 5>a stele coal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Palermo stone because not because it</v>

114
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 5>has anything to do with land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because that's where it is.</v>

115
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 5>And another virus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very fragmentary,</v>

116
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 5>called the turn for Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the Egyptians themselves,</v>

117
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:13.541
<v Speaker 5>ancient Egyptians talk about long </v>
<v Speaker 5>periods prior to the beginning of what </v>

118
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:16.750
<v Speaker 5>we call dynastic Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt,</v>

119
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 5>that begins around 3,500</v>
<v Speaker 5>BC where Egypt is room for thousands and</v>

120
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.760
<v Speaker 5>thousands and thousands of years like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the natural,</v>

121
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.800
<v Speaker 5>which means the gods themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which actually means I take to mean </v>

122
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 5>enlightened or divinely enlightened </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings.</v>

123
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.230
<v Speaker 5>And then another long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long period where Egypt is ruled by the </v>

124
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.011
<v Speaker 5>ship so far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means the companions or the </v>

125
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 5>followers of forest and the retinal that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the names of these kings are given and </v>

126
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.010
<v Speaker 5>the dates of these kings are given them </v>
<v Speaker 5>dope boats.</v>

127
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 5>The stone is damaged on the powers and </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhat fragmentary.</v>

128
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800
<v Speaker 5>If you compute the years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you end up with something like 36,000</v>

129
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 5>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which in fact is not.</v>

130
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.230
<v Speaker 5>There's not a casually chosen date </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the Sphinx itself,</v>

131
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.260
<v Speaker 5>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the going to actually as we go along </v>

132
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 5>somewhere along the line to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

133
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 5>because I can send you all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting texts,</v>

134
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 5>illustrations where maybe you can on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your end,</v>

135
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm intersperse them into collate them </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the actual video broadcast,</v>

136
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
<v Speaker 5>I guess you'd call it so that viewers </v>
<v Speaker 5>can see what we're talking about as </v>

137
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

138
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.520
<v Speaker 5>if you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Greg bootcamp.</v>

139
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

140
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 6>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can definitely do that,</v>

141
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:40.391
<v Speaker 6>but for the audio only people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a fascinating conversation </v>

142
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 6>either way with or without pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How did you get on this path?</v>

143
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 6>How did you.</v>

144
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 5>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you in two seconds,</v>

145
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:51.131
<v Speaker 5>but first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me just say the reason why the city </v>

146
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:54.281
<v Speaker 5>$6,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>date is not as outrageous as it might </v>

147
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:57.791
<v Speaker 5>sound is a because the Egyptians </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves are talking about that sort </v>

148
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:01.841
<v Speaker 5>of date and also because the strengths </v>
<v Speaker 5>with this lion's body and human head </v>

149
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.330
<v Speaker 5>screams out as an astronomical </v>
<v Speaker 5>astrological marker and the it's meant </v>

150
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:12.911
<v Speaker 5>to commemorate the age of Leo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last age of Leo is where the links </v>

151
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:18.941
<v Speaker 5>in the relationship is that the Sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 5>is cited so that it looks duties and so </v>

152
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:24.581
<v Speaker 5>the last time the Sphinx looked at its </v>
<v Speaker 5>own image in the sky before the sun </v>

153
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.140
<v Speaker 5>rose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's other.</v>

154
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Talk about the processional ages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to get into that,</v>

155
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 5>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not complex astronomy,</v>

156
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 5>but it's astronomy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>

157
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 5>The last time the strengths looked at </v>
<v Speaker 5>its own image in the sky,</v>

158
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 5>but at sunrise on the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Equinox would have been about 10,000,</v>

159
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:44.030
<v Speaker 5>10,500</v>
<v Speaker 5>BC.</v>

160
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 5>There are good reasons why 10,500</v>
<v Speaker 5>BC is not satisfactory and the the the </v>

161
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:57.311
<v Speaker 5>age before that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the age of Leo before that is another </v>

162
00:08:57.311 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 5>26,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>deals earlier.</v>

163
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 5>It's the cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so called procession of the economic </v>

164
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 5>cycle takes 20 roughly 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>26,000</v>

165
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so 36,000</v>

166
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:11.781
<v Speaker 5>years would have been another time when </v>
<v Speaker 5>this links looked at its at its own </v>

167
00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 5>image in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I brought up the spring equinox,</v>

168
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 5>so there are reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

169
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

170
00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 5>it's not just fantasizing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's backed up,</v>

171
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.710
<v Speaker 5>it's conjectural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course we can improve it as at the </v>

172
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.291
<v Speaker 5>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are good reasons why it could </v>

173
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:30.291
<v Speaker 5>be as old as that</v>

174
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:33.560
<v Speaker 6>conventional wisdom is that human </v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization and the,</v>

175
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the form of cities and such that,</v>

176
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.560
<v Speaker 6>that didn't exist before 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

177
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:38.830
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

178
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was conventional wisdom until very </v>

179
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.230
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the battles that we've had.</v>

180
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.850
<v Speaker 5>We've had to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you see long story,</v>

181
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 5>Shaka and I are writing a book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you more about this as we go </v>

182
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 5>along,</v>
<v Speaker 5>telling the story of this whole strength</v>

183
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.860
<v Speaker 5>thing because we presented.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a geological argument.</v>

184
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.690
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's about the water,</v>

185
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:07.691
<v Speaker 5>weathering to the sprinkle the </v>
<v Speaker 5>weathering to the sex with shock as a </v>

186
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:08.060
<v Speaker 5>geologist in the specialist in these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

187
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.480
<v Speaker 5>It took a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot to get him on board.</v>

188
00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:12.680
<v Speaker 5>Mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a long.</v>

189
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.520
<v Speaker 5>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>

190
00:10:13.521 --> 00:10:18.521
<v Speaker 5>funny story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I won't get into necessarily right now </v>

191
00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:18.980
<v Speaker 5>here though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>since we have an open ended,</v>

192
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:25.090
<v Speaker 5>we have an open end show and I have </v>
<v Speaker 5>plenty of block in the freezer and we </v>

193
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.750
<v Speaker 5>might go on for quite awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

194
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.320
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

195
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

196
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.210
<v Speaker 5>the point is that it's a geological </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument.</v>

197
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:43.210
<v Speaker 5>And when I got shocked on board,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he took him awhile before he </v>

198
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.960
<v Speaker 5>acknowledged that it had to be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

199
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.750
<v Speaker 5>he was putting scene for me to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>heretic is easy.</v>

200
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:52.751
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't like these people and I </v>

201
00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:53.270
<v Speaker 5>don't respect their intelligence or </v>
<v Speaker 5>their integrity.</v>

202
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.340
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I have nothing to lose,</v>

203
00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shock as a tenured associate professor </v>

204
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.970
<v Speaker 5>of geology at Boston University.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he has,</v>

205
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
<v Speaker 5>he puts his neck on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means something eventually took a </v>

206
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.000
<v Speaker 5>bit of dual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody he did it.</v>

207
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.790
<v Speaker 5>And then we presented this evidence </v>
<v Speaker 5>first at the,</v>

208
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.500
<v Speaker 5>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might call it the super bowl </v>

209
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:16.500
<v Speaker 5>geology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called the,</v>

210
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:16.570
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

211
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the annual meeting of the Geological </v>

212
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.400
<v Speaker 5>Society of America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was in 1991.</v>

213
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 5>We were the stars of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

214
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:29.321
<v Speaker 5>they recognize the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>logical society recognize that this was </v>

215
00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 5>a dynamite presentation.</v>

216
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.560
<v Speaker 5>And so all the precedents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have the science for us at the </v>

217
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:35.560
<v Speaker 5>girls and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was that,</v>

218
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:41.260
<v Speaker 5>that actually allowed us to get this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing passed secretary is it NBC and </v>

219
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.190
<v Speaker 5>then put it out in prime time with </v>
<v Speaker 5>sweeps week and the 1 million man it was</v>

220
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.560
<v Speaker 5>nominated for best documentary of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>year,</v>

221
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.450
<v Speaker 5>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Etc.</v>

222
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.090
<v Speaker 5>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was that,</v>

223
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.100
<v Speaker 5>that brought it to the florist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crack academics to pay attention to </v>

224
00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm,</v>

225
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.410
<v Speaker 5>thE battle has been going on ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And actually funny story because I can </v>

226
00:12:04.521 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 5>say it here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but normally I can't.</v>

227
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:06.960
<v Speaker 5>Then I'm on a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a,</v>

228
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.260
<v Speaker 5>on a normal reSpectable deliveries yet </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've watched a couple of years shows I </v>

229
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:17.790
<v Speaker 5>know I can get away with it here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we,</v>

230
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.330
<v Speaker 5>when we gave this presentation initially</v>
<v Speaker 5>in 1991,</v>

231
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.190
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the geologists were unanimously in favor</v>

232
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:28.910
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They came to our presentation,</v>

233
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 5>they walked to our display and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

234
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

235
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:37.501
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how could anybody have the most as well </v>

236
00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 5>as another bit of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so.</v>

237
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 5>But the egyptologist and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>archaeologist absolutely incensed by the</v>

238
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:47.791
<v Speaker 5>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were calling us all kinds of </v>

239
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:50.461
<v Speaker 5>names and there was one woman who will </v>
<v Speaker 5>go nameless here,</v>

240
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:53.750
<v Speaker 5>but so coming up in a book somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So who is a,</v>

241
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.670
<v Speaker 5>an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an egyptologist at boston university was</v>

242
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.270
<v Speaker 5>shocked potentials and oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm earlier.</v>

243
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 5>So we were being interviewed chunk and </v>
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>

244
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm black,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world press really.</v>

245
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:10.791
<v Speaker 5>And so this is 1991 and at one point we </v>
<v Speaker 5>were being interviewed by the guy who </v>

246
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 5>was the science editor of the boston </v>
<v Speaker 5>globe and shock teachers in boston.</v>

247
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 5>So it means a hometown boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so shop gave his,</v>

248
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 5>his interview and chalk is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

249
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 5>We're a good duo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's exactly good cop,</v>

250
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 5>bad cop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no shockers,</v>

251
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:34.051
<v Speaker 5>always civil and bill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Always professional and always polite.</v>

252
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 5>Really even when it shouldn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>worry about these things.</v>

253
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.720
<v Speaker 5>I can say whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Write down please.</v>

254
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.200
<v Speaker 5>So I guess name the channel with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>science editor of.</v>

255
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 7>We should explain before we go any </v>
<v Speaker 7>further,</v>

256
00:13:50.021 --> 00:13:52.780
<v Speaker 7>we should explain the argument for </v>
<v Speaker 7>people that don't understand it.</v>

257
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the water erosion argument.</v>

258
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:57.640
<v Speaker 7>This is what people are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 7>ignore.</v>

259
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.470
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

260
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.620
<v Speaker 7>there's people that are still arguing </v>
<v Speaker 7>that somehow or another that could have </v>

261
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 7>been created by sand and wind and that </v>
<v Speaker 7>this erosion,</v>

262
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>according to most geologists,</v>

263
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.050
<v Speaker 7>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most geologists are stating that it had </v>

264
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:16.050
<v Speaker 7>to be water correctly.</v>

265
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.510
<v Speaker 5>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now they've,</v>

266
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.580
<v Speaker 5>now they've actually gone off the sand </v>
<v Speaker 5>and wind thing and now it's supposed to </v>

267
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.561
<v Speaker 5>be what's called salt crystallization in</v>
<v Speaker 5>which the water water soaks through the </v>

268
00:14:27.381 --> 00:14:32.381
<v Speaker 5>limestone and creates chemical reactions</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the rock and that weather is off </v>

269
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 5>and creates the weathering that we say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is actually a nonsensical argument </v>

270
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.050
<v Speaker 5>which we will be addressing very </v>
<v Speaker 5>shortly.</v>

271
00:14:42.051 --> 00:14:42.370
<v Speaker 5>I'll take that</v>

272
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.710
<v Speaker 7>and there's an incredible amount of </v>
<v Speaker 7>resistance to this idea.</v>

273
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.620
<v Speaker 7>Even though the geological science there</v>
<v Speaker 7>are,</v>

274
00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.540
<v Speaker 7>they in agreement on this,</v>

275
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 5>almost most</v>

276
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 8>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There were a few who aren't,</v>

277
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.420
<v Speaker 8>and I'll get into this too as we go </v>
<v Speaker 8>along.</v>

278
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 8>It saved the point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's at stake here was not,</v>

279
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.610
<v Speaker 8>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is not just a scholarly quibbled </v>

280
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.000
<v Speaker 8>because for the strings to be watered,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether then specifically by rainwater </v>

281
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.420
<v Speaker 8>means that it has to have been there </v>
<v Speaker 8>when it was raining needs for you.</v>

282
00:15:09.421 --> 00:15:11.660
<v Speaker 8>See,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's almost no rain there now an inch</v>

283
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.680
<v Speaker 8>or so a year,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the sahara desert formed around 10,000.</v>

284
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.200
<v Speaker 8>They sAy before ground was fertIle </v>
<v Speaker 8>savannah,</v>

285
00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 8>sort of like modern day kenyon,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe even wetter than that.</v>

286
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 8>So for the swings to be weathered by,</v>
<v Speaker 8>by,</v>

287
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.920
<v Speaker 8>by rainwater means means that it has to </v>
<v Speaker 8>have been there before,</v>

288
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 8>before or during the time that lots and </v>
<v Speaker 8>lots of rain was swelling.</v>

289
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.280
<v Speaker 8>Now what's at stake there?</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you were saying before the </v>

290
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 8>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 8>according to the standard scenario,</v>

291
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.440
<v Speaker 8>civilization begins around 3000,</v>
<v Speaker 8>3,500</v>

292
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:49.460
<v Speaker 8>bc,</v>
<v Speaker 8>more or less simultaneously in Egypt in </v>

293
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 8>scenario in China and India,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but all of it is around that day,</v>

294
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.450
<v Speaker 8>but the strengths you see as really as </v>
<v Speaker 8>the most spectacular sculpture on earth,</v>

295
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:02.210
<v Speaker 8>it's 240 feet long and 66 feet high and </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a magnificent,</v>

296
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:07.270
<v Speaker 8>absolutely breathtaking sculpture even </v>
<v Speaker 8>in ruins and the temples around it,</v>

297
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 8>which we'll get into somewhere along the</v>
<v Speaker 8>line,</v>

298
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.930
<v Speaker 8>but ideally I'll send you pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

299
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.220
<v Speaker 8>The temples around them are powerful </v>
<v Speaker 8>stone limestone buildings faced with </v>

300
00:16:21.751 --> 00:16:25.110
<v Speaker 8>granted,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but what's interesting about them is not</v>

301
00:16:25.111 --> 00:16:28.740
<v Speaker 8>the size of the templates themselves by </v>
<v Speaker 8>egyptian standards metal that big,</v>

302
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:34.430
<v Speaker 8>but the stones that they're better that </v>
<v Speaker 8>comprise them weigh somewhere between 50</v>

303
00:16:35.251 --> 00:16:40.251
<v Speaker 8>and 150 pounds each and the setup in </v>
<v Speaker 8>such a way that slotted into places into</v>

304
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.880
<v Speaker 8>place like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We can't do that today.</v>

305
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 8>Do you still have the old,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the charlton heston video?</v>

306
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:53.951
<v Speaker 8>It's evident evidently have seen we have</v>
<v Speaker 8>this guy jesse water and lose the </v>

307
00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:58.521
<v Speaker 8>project manager of when they're building</v>
<v Speaker 8>a cogeneration plant out in long island </v>

308
00:16:58.521 --> 00:17:01.890
<v Speaker 8>and he's acknowledging he's fascinated </v>
<v Speaker 8>by this because he says,</v>

309
00:17:01.891 --> 00:17:06.891
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>our biggest cranes are biggest landing </v>

310
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:07.170
<v Speaker 8>bags.</v>
<v Speaker 8>PAins could lift these rocks,</v>

311
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.010
<v Speaker 8>but we wouldn't know how to rig them so </v>
<v Speaker 8>that we could get them into place.</v>

312
00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.360
<v Speaker 8>So this means is that not just at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>snakes is fabulous.</v>

313
00:17:15.361 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Speaker 8>Statute is much,</v>
<v Speaker 8>much older.</v>

314
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:20.880
<v Speaker 8>It was built before this supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>any civilization at all,</v>

315
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.910
<v Speaker 8>but it means that there's a technology </v>
<v Speaker 8>in place that we,</v>

316
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.950
<v Speaker 8>with our brilliant science,</v>
<v Speaker 8>have produced hydrogen bombs and labile </v>

317
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.610
<v Speaker 8>had donald's and nerve gas in mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These wonderful new developments.</v>

318
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.940
<v Speaker 8>We couldn't build the temples around </v>
<v Speaker 8>swings,</v>

319
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.450
<v Speaker 8>so that's why they're all so incensed </v>
<v Speaker 8>that absolutely.</v>

320
00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:43.260
<v Speaker 8>The whole idea is we.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If this is finally acknowledged,</v>

321
00:17:43.261 --> 00:17:48.261
<v Speaker 8>that means that everything,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that everything that these people have </v>

322
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 8>believed about ancient,</v>

323
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:56.090
<v Speaker 5>about the onset of human cIvilization is</v>
<v Speaker 5>completely dead wrong.</v>

324
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 5>so that that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why there is angry as they are in</v>

325
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 5>the air force sent because a good line </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the flack is always happiest when </v>

326
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 5>you're right over the target.</v>

327
00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:13.420
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things I learned from </v>

328
00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.891
<v Speaker 6>watching your documentary is I really </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought that scientists and people that </v>

329
00:18:14.891 --> 00:18:18.851
<v Speaker 6>were studying the history of something </v>
<v Speaker 6>as important as Egypt that they would </v>

330
00:18:18.851 --> 00:18:20.600
<v Speaker 6>be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll just leave that sound on brian.</v>

331
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:21.590
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess john,</v>

332
00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:23.300
<v Speaker 6>you have a fan going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>background.</v>

333
00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:24.260
<v Speaker 6>Is that your computer fan?</v>

334
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's thing</v>

335
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:33.910
<v Speaker 6>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how you would think that these people </v>

336
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:33.910
<v Speaker 6>would be scientific in their approach to</v>
<v Speaker 6>evidence.</v>

337
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.410
<v Speaker 6>When you guys presented thIs evidence </v>
<v Speaker 6>that there was massive amounts of water </v>

338
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.011
<v Speaker 6>erosion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The one of the things the guy said that </v>

339
00:18:42.011 --> 00:18:43.760
<v Speaker 6>really disturbed me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about a civilization from</v>

340
00:18:43.761 --> 00:18:44.710
<v Speaker 6>10,500</v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

341
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.460
<v Speaker 6>He was mocking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was saying,</v>

342
00:18:46.461 --> 00:18:48.140
<v Speaker 6>where's The evidence of thIs </v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization?</v>

343
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 6>Like what at?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What other evidence do you have of this </v>

344
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 6>civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's the way he sang.</v>

345
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.110
<v Speaker 6>It is so ridiculous and arrogant and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was so.</v>

346
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.140
<v Speaker 6>There was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was so soaked in ego because the </v>

347
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.811
<v Speaker 6>reality is we don't really know how much</v>
<v Speaker 6>evidence there would be left from 10,500</v>

348
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.850
<v Speaker 6>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a long,</v>

349
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.880
<v Speaker 6>long,</v>
<v Speaker 6>long time ago and it might very well be </v>

350
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.331
<v Speaker 6>that the only things that remain are </v>
<v Speaker 6>things like this face and this function </v>

351
00:19:16.331 --> 00:19:16.331
<v Speaker 6>closure.</v>

352
00:19:16.331 --> 00:19:16.350
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's.</v>

353
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.660
<v Speaker 5>There's a good reason for that to </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually shaka and I are about to set </v>

354
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.541
<v Speaker 5>off on on a new book between us called </v>
<v Speaker 5>dancing down the breeds of syrah and </v>

355
00:19:26.391 --> 00:19:31.391
<v Speaker 5>then the subtitle is a scholar and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists send gloss the unicorns and </v>

356
00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:36.520
<v Speaker 5>take on the paradigm police because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>printers that a sufi and it's.</v>

357
00:19:36.521 --> 00:19:37.190
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so busy.</v>

358
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.630
<v Speaker 5>That's the mystical aspect of islam and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a metric.</v>

359
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.640
<v Speaker 5>It's a metaphor and sufi doctrine and in</v>
<v Speaker 5>order to get to the truth,</v>

360
00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:52.961
<v Speaker 5>in order to get to enlightenment on the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say the seeker must must cross the</v>

361
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:59.651
<v Speaker 5>bridge of sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is described as narrow as a </v>

362
00:19:59.651 --> 00:20:02.890
<v Speaker 5>razor's edge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And on one side is the chasm of cruelty.</v>

363
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.010
<v Speaker 5>And then the other side is the is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>abyss of skepticism.</v>

364
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.980
<v Speaker 5>So to do this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really have to have,</v>

365
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to say you have an open mind,</v>

366
00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:16.310
<v Speaker 5>but you'd be surprIsed how few people </v>
<v Speaker 5>have an open mind.</v>

367
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.600
<v Speaker 5>We got some experience with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves and when you say,</v>

368
00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:22.370
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would expect that from science,</v>

369
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.080
<v Speaker 5>they should be open to evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in fact are not.</v>

370
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
<v Speaker 6>And so what is their issue?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to admit that they're </v>

371
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.701
<v Speaker 6>wrong and that everything that had been </v>
<v Speaker 6>teaching for decades was incorrect and </v>

372
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:36.820
<v Speaker 6>it's proven so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they hold onto the old truth.</v>

373
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.670
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly,</v>

374
00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:43.671
<v Speaker 5>but I mean in the way I have a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit of sympathy for them even because </v>

375
00:20:43.921 --> 00:20:48.921
<v Speaker 5>they put in all of these years and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>get somebody who comes from out </v>

376
00:20:48.921 --> 00:20:53.030
<v Speaker 5>absolutely out of left field me and who </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't come out of left field?</v>

377
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.160
<v Speaker 5>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're a phd geologist and highly </v>

378
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.231
<v Speaker 5>respected and the number of geological </v>
<v Speaker 5>solid scientific was published to say </v>

379
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 5>you guys have it all wrong and</v>

380
00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.220
<v Speaker 7>well explain to folks what your </v>
<v Speaker 7>background is and why your,</v>

381
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.220
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>such a,</v>

382
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.770
<v Speaker 7>a rebel in this field.</v>

383
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

384
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 5>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to lose thIs thread because</v>

385
00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.120
<v Speaker 5>I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's okay,</v>

386
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.280
<v Speaker 5>but when I'm on my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I do,</v>

387
00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Speaker 5>when I'm on my trips,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people always ask,</v>

388
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 5>we are going through the evidence and </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of taking half an hour of the </v>

389
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.090
<v Speaker 5>way we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been ours down.</v>

390
00:21:27.091 --> 00:21:31.280
<v Speaker 5>Liz links studying every aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>geology and so someone,</v>

391
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.710
<v Speaker 5>and they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

392
00:21:33.711 --> 00:21:37.100
<v Speaker 5>how they seek leave whitney said that </v>
<v Speaker 5>has the evidence,</v>

393
00:21:37.101 --> 00:21:39.260
<v Speaker 5>how can they denied?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's.</v>

394
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.900
<v Speaker 5>I always were cans and anecdote that </v>
<v Speaker 5>funny when I was a kid,</v>

395
00:21:45.351 --> 00:21:48.470
<v Speaker 5>I read this long before I was even </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in this stuff,</v>

396
00:21:48.471 --> 00:21:53.471
<v Speaker 5>but it was a teaching tail supposedly a </v>
<v Speaker 5>proven that this was the 19 forties.</v>

397
00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:00.190
<v Speaker 5>ReAder's digest an anecdote in there </v>
<v Speaker 5>that when you actually have the asha </v>

398
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.130
<v Speaker 5>heifetz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the great violinist gables,</v>

399
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.720
<v Speaker 5>debbie bill at carnegie hall at the age </v>
<v Speaker 5>of 11,</v>

400
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.720
<v Speaker 5>I think this must have been for 43,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

401
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.600
<v Speaker 5>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

402
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.030
<v Speaker 5>and at the concert was the then reigning</v>
<v Speaker 5>violin,</v>

403
00:22:17.031 --> 00:22:20.630
<v Speaker 5>virtuoso dynamic mischa elman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear much of these days,</v>

404
00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:25.631
<v Speaker 5>but he was sort of tinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look them up today and with him was our </v>

405
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.320
<v Speaker 5>to rubinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the great pianist and about halfway </v>

406
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.670
<v Speaker 5>through the concert element turn to elmo</v>
<v Speaker 5>term to rubinstein and he said,</v>

407
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:43.750
<v Speaker 5>hot in here isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we're going to start and said not </v>

408
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.430
<v Speaker 5>for pianists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

409
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.160
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so with our,</v>

410
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.460
<v Speaker 5>with our science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the geologists have no problem with it </v>

411
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.700
<v Speaker 5>or the micro biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the astrophysicists,</v>

412
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.600
<v Speaker 5>the egyptologist and the archaeologist </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's hot.</v>

413
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.130
<v Speaker 7>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what can be done?</v>

414
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.770
<v Speaker 7>I mean what you guys are presented this </v>
<v Speaker 7>evidence,</v>

415
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:05.340
<v Speaker 7>they've tried to ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but more things pop up that show that we</v>

416
00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:07.170
<v Speaker 7>might be wrong about the history of </v>
<v Speaker 7>humanity.</v>

417
00:23:07.171 --> 00:23:09.420
<v Speaker 7>like go back like tappy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

418
00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:09.790
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

419
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.790
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We now have the smoking guns at our </v>

420
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.670
<v Speaker 5>disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have an arsenal of smoking guns and </v>

421
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.080
<v Speaker 5>you see we have even more of an instant </v>
<v Speaker 5>was in that video we presented.</v>

422
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:25.081
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot more evidence just from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt that we presented in another csa </v>

423
00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 5>conference in $2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

424
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 5>with the almost unanimous ascent of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>attending geologists,</v>

425
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.390
<v Speaker 5>but that one unfortunately didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>much press there,</v>

426
00:23:34.391 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 5>so it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't get a lot of press.</v>

427
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 5>The geologists were impressed but it </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't go anywhere,</v>

428
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:45.931
<v Speaker 5>but we now have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've had for a while all of the </v>

429
00:23:45.931 --> 00:23:46.080
<v Speaker 5>evidence at our disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the</v>

430
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 8>template which you mentioned and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 8>know how many of your audience will know</v>

431
00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:52.310
<v Speaker 8>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's serious.</v>

432
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:57.340
<v Speaker 8>That's the smoking gun because here's </v>
<v Speaker 8>this incredible site in Turkey and chalk</v>

433
00:23:57.411 --> 00:24:02.411
<v Speaker 8>and I have visited there and spent about</v>
<v Speaker 8>a week there that was discovered in 1994</v>

434
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 8>and I hope we'll get pictures of this up</v>
<v Speaker 8>there,</v>

435
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 8>but it was discovered in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>

436
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:10.820
<v Speaker 8>By accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Looks like a big hill.</v>

437
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 8>I mean it is a big hill and you'd never </v>
<v Speaker 8>know that there was anything there.</v>

438
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:20.310
<v Speaker 8>And in [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 8>94 farmer was plowing the top of the </v>

439
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:25.570
<v Speaker 8>hill and he hit what he thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A boulder and plow hit the boulder and </v>

440
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 8>he ran the plow back over the to try to </v>
<v Speaker 8>dislodge it and it wouldn't just lodge.</v>

441
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:36.310
<v Speaker 8>And I tried a couple of times and </v>
<v Speaker 8>nothing happened except they've met </v>

442
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.050
<v Speaker 8>their cloud and so they dug around it </v>
<v Speaker 8>and they discovered that it wasn't a </v>

443
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.630
<v Speaker 8>boulder after ella was the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>stone column,</v>

444
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:47.230
<v Speaker 8>so they started digging some more and </v>
<v Speaker 8>then finally they called them the </v>

445
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:51.670
<v Speaker 8>archeologists,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which now they're sorry about because </v>

446
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.930
<v Speaker 8>they commandeered the site and these </v>
<v Speaker 8>guys 20 years,</v>

447
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:58.931
<v Speaker 8>15 years later fighting the turkish </v>
<v Speaker 8>government is get some kind of financial</v>

448
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:01.400
<v Speaker 8>redress from stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>stealing their help.</v>

449
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 8>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 8>once once they got excavating,</v>

450
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:11.050
<v Speaker 8>they discovered that this was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 8>greatest archeological discoveries </v>

451
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 8>probably of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean from,</v>

452
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.580
<v Speaker 8>from a hisTorical point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's even more significant and it looks </v>

453
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.050
<v Speaker 8>like two comments treasure because once </v>
<v Speaker 8>they stopped,</v>

454
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.140
<v Speaker 8>they dug up the first of these and they </v>
<v Speaker 8>found they did ground penetrating radar </v>

455
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 8>or maybe seismograph.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I'm not sure.</v>

456
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:35.441
<v Speaker 8>But certainly radar.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And this huge hill has at least 22 </v>

457
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 8>closely packed stone circles like minnie</v>
<v Speaker 8>stone hinges,</v>

458
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:46.901
<v Speaker 8>but not so many central columns.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There are central columns to central </v>

459
00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:52.121
<v Speaker 8>columns in each of these stone circles </v>
<v Speaker 8>and then ring the round with other </v>

460
00:25:52.121 --> 00:25:54.430
<v Speaker 8>funds.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean everybody listening to this who's</v>

461
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.390
<v Speaker 8>watching this will have an image of a </v>
<v Speaker 8>stonehenge and in their heads,</v>

462
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.440
<v Speaker 8>so it's like that except not as not as </v>
<v Speaker 8>massive,</v>

463
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.370
<v Speaker 8>but then further further as they were </v>
<v Speaker 8>digging,</v>

464
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.880
<v Speaker 8>they realized that this entire hill,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which had been at one point or another,</v>

465
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.600
<v Speaker 8>exposed to the elements of course had </v>
<v Speaker 8>been deliberately filled in.</v>

466
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.030
<v Speaker 8>what reason?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nobody knows,</v>

467
00:26:20.031 --> 00:26:25.031
<v Speaker 8>I mean is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is acres of land and the thing had </v>

468
00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:28.061
<v Speaker 8>been completely covered and they were </v>
<v Speaker 8>able to date the film because the film </v>

469
00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:32.590
<v Speaker 8>has all kinds of organic material in it </v>
<v Speaker 8>and so the film they dated to $8,000.</v>

470
00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:38.091
<v Speaker 8>They see things that they go back to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The temple itself is incredible site.</v>

471
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:43.400
<v Speaker 8>Nobody knows what the air for who did it</v>
<v Speaker 8>or anything is at least 10,000</v>

472
00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 8>bc and the central columns that I was </v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about,</v>

473
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.900
<v Speaker 8>our 10 to 15 tons.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They know that the law,</v>

474
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.060
<v Speaker 8>I think we limestone,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the stones come from a quarry about </v>

475
00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.770
<v Speaker 8>three quarters of a mile downhill,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so they have to drag these up.</v>

476
00:26:57.771 --> 00:26:59.380
<v Speaker 8>Now we're talking about 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>bc.</v>

477
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:05.140
<v Speaker 8>Has to be any civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 8>much less tools or anything of that </v>

478
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.671
<v Speaker 8>sort.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So here are these under 22 of these </v>

479
00:27:08.671 --> 00:27:11.880
<v Speaker 8>stone circles.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Only four have been partially excavated </v>

480
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.660
<v Speaker 8>and not only on the four.</v>

481
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.270
<v Speaker 8>Out of 22,</v>
<v Speaker 8>pardon?</v>

482
00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 8>I said only four out of 22 have been </v>
<v Speaker 8>activated and oldest time archeology is </v>

483
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.850
<v Speaker 8>an unbelievably.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's done.</v>

484
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 8>It's done meticulously and nowadays it </v>
<v Speaker 8>tends to bed and not so long ago it's </v>

485
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.690
<v Speaker 8>just grave robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but now it's really meticulous.</v>

486
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 8>They going at this stuff with teaspoons,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it takes them years and years and </v>

487
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.750
<v Speaker 8>years to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then I guess there isn't a gigantic </v>

488
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.750
<v Speaker 8>amount of funding available.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know who's funding it.</v>

489
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.790
<v Speaker 8>It's a german team that's doing it with </v>
<v Speaker 8>a really nice,</v>

490
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.620
<v Speaker 8>really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Klaus schmIdt,</v>

491
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.320
<v Speaker 8>german archaeologist who was in charge </v>
<v Speaker 8>there,</v>

492
00:27:47.321 --> 00:27:48.790
<v Speaker 8>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

493
00:27:48.791 --> 00:27:50.890
<v Speaker 8>he's not into the esoteric side of </v>
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>

494
00:27:50.891 --> 00:27:53.770
<v Speaker 8>It's shocking irr,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but because he's a solid guy,</v>

495
00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.950
<v Speaker 8>he's pretty good and a nice man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so anyway,</v>

496
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 8>the apart from the size of these stones </v>
<v Speaker 8>and the finesse that they had that then </v>

497
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.930
<v Speaker 8>it goes into creating them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're also elaborately decorated and </v>

498
00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:13.930
<v Speaker 8>they're high relief.</v>

499
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.490
<v Speaker 8>What's called high relief.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In other words,</v>

500
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.760
<v Speaker 8>let's say you want to do what you want </v>
<v Speaker 8>to carve in a wild boar or bird or in </v>

501
00:28:20.831 --> 00:28:25.831
<v Speaker 8>one case a lion or some sort of a line.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You cut the back.</v>

502
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:32.320
<v Speaker 8>We cut the stone away so that the image </v>
<v Speaker 8>springs out of the stone.</v>

503
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:37.590
<v Speaker 8>This is 10 times more work than carving </v>
<v Speaker 8>something into the stone and this is all</v>

504
00:28:38.141 --> 00:28:40.330
<v Speaker 8>we got.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Any tunes as far as anyone knows.</v>

505
00:28:40.331 --> 00:28:45.331
<v Speaker 8>Certainly any metal tools.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm with flint somehow or another and </v>

506
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:49.111
<v Speaker 8>you got acres of these things and they.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The archeologists do not dispute the </v>

507
00:28:50.801 --> 00:28:52.960
<v Speaker 8>dating of 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>bc earlier.</v>

508
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:58.260
<v Speaker 8>So that's our smoking gun.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean we've been looking at this for a </v>

509
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 8>long time and all kinds of evidence and </v>
<v Speaker 8>some of the.</v>

510
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:04.390
<v Speaker 8>A lot of the evidence is really </v>
<v Speaker 8>commanding,</v>

511
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.970
<v Speaker 8>but it's not spectacular looking now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's spectacular.</v>

512
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 7>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I found amazing about it was that </v>

513
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.080
<v Speaker 7>they were trying to attribute these </v>
<v Speaker 7>constructions to hunter and gatherers.</v>

514
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.060
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mayBe they are hunters and gatherErs.</v>

515
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:26.330
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have to be a fool if there's plenty </v>

516
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.450
<v Speaker 8>of animals and stuff around there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Plenty of things around to eat.</v>

517
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:32.310
<v Speaker 8>Why should you go to the backbreaking </v>
<v Speaker 8>job of farming is legible.</v>

518
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.000
<v Speaker 8>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have in my first non fiction book,</v>

519
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:38.220
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I started out as a novelist,</v>

520
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.140
<v Speaker 8>playwright,</v>
<v Speaker 8>screenwriter,</v>

521
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:45.230
<v Speaker 8>and I had a lot of things done that will</v>
<v Speaker 8>make me money was probably a good thing </v>

522
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.700
<v Speaker 8>for egyptology black.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

523
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.460
<v Speaker 8>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

524
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:54.470
<v Speaker 8>if you ever heard of him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but in the first book was called the </v>

525
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.470
<v Speaker 8>case for astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is out of print now,</v>

526
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:59.071
<v Speaker 8>but let's put together all of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>scientific evidence that says it's </v>

527
00:29:59.071 --> 00:30:01.060
<v Speaker 8>actually something behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not just what's a good day to buy a</v>

528
00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 8>poodle.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So the,</v>

529
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.350
<v Speaker 8>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in that book,</v>

530
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:11.630
<v Speaker 8>that's my first nonfiction book,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I quote a is a wonderful </v>

531
00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.080
<v Speaker 8>ethnologists conrad lawrence who was </v>
<v Speaker 8>brought up in South Africa.</v>

532
00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:22.420
<v Speaker 8>You wrote a wonderful book.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bush probably still around bushman are </v>

533
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.010
<v Speaker 8>about his own experience and he relates </v>
<v Speaker 8>how the bushman of South Africa,</v>

534
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:32.420
<v Speaker 8>the missionaries are trying to teach </v>
<v Speaker 8>them how to farm and the machine looks </v>

535
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:33.330
<v Speaker 8>at him and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

536
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 8>why should we farm when there were so </v>
<v Speaker 8>many mongo,</v>

537
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 8>mongo nuts in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Whatever that is,</v>

538
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.710
<v Speaker 8>why would anybody in their right mind </v>
<v Speaker 8>boggling the plow the land and cut </v>

539
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:46.560
<v Speaker 8>everything down when they go outside?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I feel hurt,</v>

540
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:47.810
<v Speaker 8>efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 8>untitled.</v>

541
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
<v Speaker 1>So just because they were hunter </v>
<v Speaker 1>gatherers doesn't mean they hadn't </v>

542
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.421
<v Speaker 1>figured out amazing constructions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to make these huge cities </v>

543
00:30:56.421 --> 00:30:56.421
<v Speaker 1>and these just</v>

544
00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:01.520
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And in this last couple of decades,</v>

545
00:31:01.521 --> 00:31:03.260
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've been on this quest for what?</v>

546
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.920
<v Speaker 8>All to swallowed the little bit in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>late sixties.</v>

547
00:31:06.921 --> 00:31:11.810
<v Speaker 8>So that's when I said something like </v>
<v Speaker 8>that close to it.</v>

548
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.760
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

549
00:31:13.761 --> 00:31:18.761
<v Speaker 8>but in the last 10 or 12,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a whole lot of really interesting work </v>

550
00:31:18.891 --> 00:31:22.720
<v Speaker 8>has come to the fore proving that not </v>
<v Speaker 8>only that,</v>

551
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.840
<v Speaker 8>these in these so called primitive </v>
<v Speaker 8>societies that maybe we're not </v>

552
00:31:28.341 --> 00:31:31.730
<v Speaker 8>intellectually sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They nevertheless had,</v>

553
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.530
<v Speaker 8>they had a precise cosmological science </v>
<v Speaker 8>and actually some,</v>

554
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.530
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some of them like pals involved in this,</v>

555
00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:41.300
<v Speaker 8>you may know some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you may not know.</v>

556
00:31:41.301 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 8>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they might be interesting guests for you</v>

557
00:31:44.141 --> 00:31:47.540
<v Speaker 8>in an upcoming shows.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If people know people will really,</v>

558
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.490
<v Speaker 8>really get tuned into this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>

559
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.880
<v Speaker 8>So it's becoming quite cleAr that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that the knowledge was all there.</v>

560
00:31:55.341 --> 00:31:56.420
<v Speaker 8>I mean the knowledge is there.</v>

561
00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.330
<v Speaker 8>The groundbreaking book,</v>
<v Speaker 8>was he making them about it?</v>

562
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.750
<v Speaker 8>What it's called hamlet's mill.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you know that?</v>

563
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.020
<v Speaker 8>Discuss that one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've heard you discuss it.</v>

564
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.990
<v Speaker 8>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

565
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
<v Speaker 8>it's georgiadis.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean these are two impeccable </v>

566
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.200
<v Speaker 8>historians of science at mit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Georgia,</v>

567
00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:18.580
<v Speaker 8>this santiana and carrots up on deck </v>
<v Speaker 8>hand and in the book as I think </v>

568
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.630
<v Speaker 8>published in 68.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But again,</v>

569
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.270
<v Speaker 8>this is the thing you have to go through</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you're,</v>

570
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.070
<v Speaker 8>when you're dealing with these heretical</v>
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>

571
00:32:25.071 --> 00:32:27.350
<v Speaker 8>I mean these guys with all the right </v>
<v Speaker 8>credentials,</v>

572
00:32:27.351 --> 00:32:32.330
<v Speaker 8>not like may not come from out of left </v>
<v Speaker 8>field and they manage the stonewall them</v>

573
00:32:32.331 --> 00:32:37.331
<v Speaker 8>and try to and try to ignore their </v>
<v Speaker 8>evidence that underlying the world's </v>

574
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:45.161
<v Speaker 8>mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of these strange stories that we </v>

575
00:32:45.161 --> 00:32:47.411
<v Speaker 8>know incestuous gods and all of this </v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of thing was astronomy and </v>

576
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:53.170
<v Speaker 8>astronomy presupposes the santiana and </v>
<v Speaker 8>can go into that much because they were </v>

577
00:32:55.191 --> 00:33:00.191
<v Speaker 8>in enough water as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there is absolutely no point to a </v>

578
00:33:00.191 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 8>sophisticated astronomy unless there's </v>
<v Speaker 8>an astrology behind it.</v>

579
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:09.280
<v Speaker 8>At least in the old days.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nowadays they're busy looking for </v>

580
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:09.560
<v Speaker 8>quasars and black holes and all that </v>
<v Speaker 8>sort of thing,</v>

581
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.760
<v Speaker 8>which have no meaning at least let's </v>
<v Speaker 8>say,</v>

582
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:16.220
<v Speaker 8>at least in the emotional and </v>
<v Speaker 8>philosophical sense,</v>

583
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 8>but in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whole civilizations,</v>

584
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:25.061
<v Speaker 8>Egypt included,</v>
<v Speaker 8>were attuned to the emotions of the </v>

585
00:33:25.061 --> 00:33:25.760
<v Speaker 8>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In other words,</v>

586
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of literature on this,</v>

587
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why do you think that this culture that </v>

588
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.481
<v Speaker 7>we live in right now is so reluctant to </v>
<v Speaker 7>accept anything like astrology?</v>

589
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.390
<v Speaker 7>Why do you think they would like to </v>
<v Speaker 7>dismiss it so quickly?</v>

590
00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.730
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because,</v>

591
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.520
<v Speaker 8>because,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because this is a materialistic,</v>

592
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:49.530
<v Speaker 8>this is a materialist culture that </v>
<v Speaker 8>denies anything that has any meaning,</v>

593
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.450
<v Speaker 8>I mean material materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is the reigning philosophy.</v>

594
00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:59.451
<v Speaker 8>This is what everybody learns in school </v>
<v Speaker 8>certainly get nothing esoteric and </v>

595
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:03.120
<v Speaker 8>school,</v>
<v Speaker 8>nothing mystical and unfortunately the,</v>

596
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the skeptic,</v>

597
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:10.770
<v Speaker 8>the skeptic's of basically rationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>materialism.</v>

598
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.980
<v Speaker 8>Atheism basically is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

599
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:21.820
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's basically the religion of the </v>

600
00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.680
<v Speaker 8>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 8>defective and spiritually dyslexic,</v>

601
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:28.100
<v Speaker 8>and then contemporary,</v>
<v Speaker 8>materialistic science value does not </v>

602
00:34:29.821 --> 00:34:30.720
<v Speaker 8>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In other words,</v>

603
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:35.740
<v Speaker 8>it's value is by definition subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so these people are ermine because they </v>

604
00:34:38.371 --> 00:34:42.300
<v Speaker 8>can't find the meaning in their own </v>
<v Speaker 8>lives and the wrong existence to,</v>

605
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 8>to foist that emptiness that neil ism </v>
<v Speaker 8>upon everyone else,</v>

606
00:34:48.151 --> 00:34:53.151
<v Speaker 8>but they call it rationalism or reason.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's nothing of the sort because it is </v>

607
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:54.570
<v Speaker 8>nothing but nothing.</v>

608
00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.160
<v Speaker 7>It just seems to reason that our bodies </v>
<v Speaker 7>are affected by the moons and the tides </v>

609
00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:02.150
<v Speaker 7>and women's periods are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

610
00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.710
<v Speaker 7>people behave differently during </v>
<v Speaker 7>different moon cycles.</v>

611
00:35:05.711 --> 00:35:08.530
<v Speaker 7>The oceans there are affected by the </v>
<v Speaker 7>tides.</v>

612
00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:13.531
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's affected by the fact that the </v>

613
00:35:13.531 --> 00:35:15.331
<v Speaker 7>moon can affect the oceans and we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>mostly water when we just assume that </v>

614
00:35:15.331 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 7>planets are having some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 7>effect on tubal.</v>

615
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.440
<v Speaker 7>That'S right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where did it all come from?</v>

616
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.260
<v Speaker 7>where did astrology originate from?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what is the,</v>

617
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.810
<v Speaker 7>what is the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is at the end of it?</v>

618
00:35:25.811 --> 00:35:26.590
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who invented it?</v>

619
00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:32.340
<v Speaker 8>We know what we can say is that if,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if going back into the paleolithic now </v>

620
00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:41.610
<v Speaker 8>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when we think actually those figures </v>

621
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.170
<v Speaker 8>shock and I think that the figures in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the paleolithic in the beckley tapio </v>

622
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:49.080
<v Speaker 8>probably cosmological and astronomical </v>
<v Speaker 8>and can prove it yet.</v>

623
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.530
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the santiago that can do a very good job</v>

624
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.920
<v Speaker 8>of showing that that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that astronomy under underpins the most </v>

625
00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:04.080
<v Speaker 8>ancient mythologies that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And since these guys,</v>

626
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:09.770
<v Speaker 8>since the ancients I'm not just </v>
<v Speaker 8>interested in quasars and pulse and all </v>

627
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.950
<v Speaker 8>of these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It presupposes and astrology and in fact</v>

628
00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:18.951
<v Speaker 8>in Egypt and Egypt was once one society </v>
<v Speaker 8>that I know the most aBout it,</v>

629
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 8>but the same I'm sure applies to ancient</v>
<v Speaker 8>China and India and mayans and so on,</v>

630
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:29.120
<v Speaker 8>that the entire society is orchestrated </v>
<v Speaker 8>in sUch a way that,</v>

631
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:36.720
<v Speaker 8>that it is tuned to these cosmic cycles </v>
<v Speaker 8>and we still have,</v>

632
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:42.020
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a reason why christmas is the </v>

633
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.900
<v Speaker 8>day that it is and there's a reason why </v>
<v Speaker 8>easter is the day that it is supposed </v>

634
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.781
<v Speaker 8>to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to commemorate historically in certain </v>

635
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:50.000
<v Speaker 8>certain elements in the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

636
00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 8>in the life of jesus christ.</v>

637
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.890
<v Speaker 8>But actually that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's much older than that and,</v>

638
00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:01.610
<v Speaker 8>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the ancient societies knew what they </v>

639
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:02.940
<v Speaker 8>were doing and when you get deep into </v>
<v Speaker 8>Egypt,</v>

640
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.360
<v Speaker 8>you see that there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That life itself was a kind of a </v>

641
00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.771
<v Speaker 8>magical.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like a magical recreation of the </v>

642
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:18.591
<v Speaker 8>genesis of the universe in which by </v>
<v Speaker 8>celebrating it in certain ways and </v>

643
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.400
<v Speaker 8>certain kinds Of ceremonies and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>human beings are reliving the cosmic </v>

644
00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:30.651
<v Speaker 8>process and thereby accessing the </v>
<v Speaker 8>divinity that is responsible for us </v>

645
00:37:31.261 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 8>being here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whIch is not supposed to,</v>

646
00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.740
<v Speaker 8>which is not creationism.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Music.</v>

647
00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 8>Anytime you tried to say to a rational </v>
<v Speaker 8>of scientists that,</v>

648
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there really is a meaningful life.</v>

649
00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:43.650
<v Speaker 8>There's all your creation was you think </v>
<v Speaker 8>the world was greater than seven days?</v>

650
00:37:43.651 --> 00:37:48.651
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's the name that you know god with </v>

651
00:37:48.651 --> 00:37:48.750
<v Speaker 8>big white beard was up there and this </v>
<v Speaker 8>guy's angle today.</v>

652
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:52.140
<v Speaker 8>I think it'll create mosquitoes and </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's nothing to do with that.</v>

653
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:57.590
<v Speaker 8>If it'S a much more profound philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but if it is not amendable to study by a</v>

654
00:38:02.821 --> 00:38:07.821
<v Speaker 8>materialist science,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but who sat and materialist science is </v>

655
00:38:07.821 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 8>the be all and end all and the answer to</v>
<v Speaker 8>everything.</v>

656
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.350
<v Speaker 8>Only the material is to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they've got everybody,</v>

657
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:17.130
<v Speaker 8>including the people who when we put the</v>
<v Speaker 8>educational system together,</v>

658
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 8>conned into believing that their science</v>
<v Speaker 8>is the only signs.</v>

659
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:26.650
<v Speaker 8>The engines new,</v>
<v Speaker 8>new much better and they did much </v>

660
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.210
<v Speaker 8>better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean all you have to do is go to Egypt</v>

661
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.480
<v Speaker 8>to experience these unbelievable temples</v>
<v Speaker 8>in this fabulous art to understand that </v>

662
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.620
<v Speaker 8>something is going on that isn't going </v>
<v Speaker 8>on now.</v>

663
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.190
<v Speaker 8>This is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's a big subject.</v>

664
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 8>We won't even get into it in an open </v>
<v Speaker 8>ended,</v>

665
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.300
<v Speaker 8>in an open ended talk like this black </v>
<v Speaker 8>chalk and I will be talking about in the</v>

666
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:53.341
<v Speaker 8>booklet where we're planning this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>dancing down the bridge of sarah and um,</v>

667
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.890
<v Speaker 8>and in the video,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the big followup to the mystery of the </v>

668
00:38:58.890 --> 00:38:59.320
<v Speaker 8>strengths that we're hoping to put </v>
<v Speaker 8>together,</v>

669
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 8>funding for,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which we hope to go as a theatrical </v>

670
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.350
<v Speaker 8>release,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not just on television.</v>

671
00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 8>Some get sales first and then onto the </v>
<v Speaker 8>videos and theaters and tb and all that </v>

672
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:13.870
<v Speaker 8>sort of stuff.</v>

673
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:19.510
<v Speaker 1>You have to have lIke an animated dog or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to go with you to Egypt if you</v>

674
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Speaker 1>want to get it into theaters to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to really get a interested in the</v>

675
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:25.450
<v Speaker 1>history of the banks and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be difficult to get into</v>

676
00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:26.970
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

677
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.560
<v Speaker 1>it's silly people we have in this world.</v>

678
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.330
<v Speaker 8>See,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean we had our show that mr.</v>

679
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:39.680
<v Speaker 8>banks was a huge success.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Unfortunately my ex partner now </v>

680
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.731
<v Speaker 8>deceased,</v>
<v Speaker 8>stole a whole lot to 150 grand from the </v>

681
00:39:43.731 --> 00:39:44.190
<v Speaker 8>till so he never made any money out of </v>
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

682
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.010
<v Speaker 8>but he was an interesting guy and </v>
<v Speaker 8>without going without him,</v>

683
00:39:50.011 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 8>that never would have happened because </v>
<v Speaker 8>he had the energy in the eye.</v>

684
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:59.900
<v Speaker 8>I can sink but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not a manifestor and he got the </v>

685
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 8>whole thing going so I don't know</v>

686
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.420
<v Speaker 1>if you had a penguin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a penguin,</v>

687
00:40:03.421 --> 00:40:06.630
<v Speaker 1>the travels to Egypt and you get morgan </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeman to narrate it.</v>

688
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:12.270
<v Speaker 8>No jail.</v>
<v Speaker 8>we don't need it actually is that video </v>

689
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.860
<v Speaker 8>had was on sweeps week and had it had a </v>
<v Speaker 8>huge audience over the course of its </v>

690
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:20.571
<v Speaker 8>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It still gets you on every once and it </v>

691
00:40:20.571 --> 00:40:20.571
<v Speaker 8>was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was probably seen by.</v>

692
00:40:20.571 --> 00:40:25.310
<v Speaker 8>I tried to figure it out one day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was probably seen by at least 250 </v>

693
00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:30.770
<v Speaker 8>million people over over the number of </v>
<v Speaker 8>years that it was being shown </v>

694
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:34.160
<v Speaker 8>internationally and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People Are really interested in this </v>

695
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.671
<v Speaker 8>stuff and still express it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We don't need any penguins which is </v>

696
00:40:37.671 --> 00:40:38.550
<v Speaker 8>paid.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In this case.</v>

697
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:43.910
<v Speaker 8>We just need the science because I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 8>see the material is is glamorous in its </v>

698
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:47.100
<v Speaker 8>own right now we have all of this other </v>
<v Speaker 8>stuff.</v>

699
00:40:47.101 --> 00:40:48.840
<v Speaker 8>It's not just the Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have Turkey.</v>

700
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:50.940
<v Speaker 8>There are these.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if you've seen this,</v>

701
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:55.200
<v Speaker 8>the truck shop very fascinated like </v>
<v Speaker 8>easter island,</v>

702
00:40:55.201 --> 00:40:57.060
<v Speaker 8>which may be connected with these </v>
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>

703
00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.520
<v Speaker 8>You know the more I have easter island,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

704
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:05.720
<v Speaker 8>Did you know that up until quite </v>
<v Speaker 8>recently it looks like they're just kind</v>

705
00:41:05.721 --> 00:41:09.600
<v Speaker 8>of these big figures that are their </v>
<v Speaker 8>heads basically heads into ourselves,</v>

706
00:41:09.601 --> 00:41:10.900
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're alone.</v>

707
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.460
<v Speaker 8>I can't imagine them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I took them onto just 200 years to </v>

708
00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.480
<v Speaker 8>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They started excavating these things and</v>

709
00:41:18.481 --> 00:41:21.660
<v Speaker 8>they're finding that their full full </v>
<v Speaker 8>length statute.</v>

710
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:26.690
<v Speaker 8>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they have built up around them maybe 25 </v>

711
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.190
<v Speaker 8>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 8>30 feet of silt,</v>

712
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 8>and now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and this should be relatively easy to </v>

713
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 8>determine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this</v>

714
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:39.070
<v Speaker 5>is part of our big project and will when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you except that the in the dome and </v>

715
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:39.070
<v Speaker 5>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The followup,</v>

716
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:44.100
<v Speaker 5>the mystery of the strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it should be possible to carbon </v>

717
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.921
<v Speaker 5>date the lower layers of the sill and </v>
<v Speaker 5>our conviction is that these things may </v>

718
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.700
<v Speaker 5>take back again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thousands and thousands and thousands.</v>

719
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Have they done this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

720
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the excavations</v>

721
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.210
<v Speaker 5>not well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're excavating,</v>

722
00:41:58.211 --> 00:42:03.211
<v Speaker 5>but we don't have any carbon dating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Suck as a bloody.</v>

723
00:42:03.281 --> 00:42:07.630
<v Speaker 5>It's julian who is the ambassador </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere or another.</v>

724
00:42:07.631 --> 00:42:10.310
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's connected to easter island.</v>

725
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.870
<v Speaker 5>You should be able to find out in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Florida and then not only as you see,</v>

726
00:42:13.871 --> 00:42:16.480
<v Speaker 5>we've got to hold this stuff now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really exciting.</v>

727
00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

728
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:23.250
<v Speaker 5>not only go back leads happy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but have you heard about the bracelet </v>

729
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.630
<v Speaker 5>that was found fairly recently in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Turkey?</v>

730
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.310
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you on.</v>

731
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.640
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know graham hancock's been on your </v>

732
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.040
<v Speaker 5>show or are you on his mailing list that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has?</v>

733
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:38.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure he sends out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

734
00:42:40.551 --> 00:42:45.551
<v Speaker 5>that's his whole job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he does and sends out this </v>

735
00:42:45.551 --> 00:42:48.630
<v Speaker 5>enormously comprehensive list of </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything that's interesting happening </v>

736
00:42:49.841 --> 00:42:54.841
<v Speaker 5>in science that either directly or </v>
<v Speaker 5>tangentially affects this whole lost </v>

737
00:42:55.661 --> 00:42:58.270
<v Speaker 5>civilization hypothesis anyway.</v>

738
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Are you familiar with the oBject that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they found?</v>

739
00:43:00.451 --> 00:43:05.360
<v Speaker 1>The bottom of the baltic sea recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very recently,</v>

740
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a millennium falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like,</v>

741
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few took the star wars spaceship,</v>

742
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:15.500
<v Speaker 1>millennium falcon and put it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean.</v>

743
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what it is,</v>

744
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 1>but they're sendinG divers down like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it's this week.</v>

745
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.390
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard about that.</v>

746
00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:25.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's somebody that will say when see</v>

747
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.600
<v Speaker 5>will see when they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they figure it out because it has </v>

748
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:30.880
<v Speaker 5>to be seriously careful about that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

749
00:43:30.881 --> 00:43:33.250
<v Speaker 5>You know about soccer and myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dive,</v>

750
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:34.910
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

751
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:40.230
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're convinced graeme thinks </v>

752
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.230
<v Speaker 5>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're shocking myself.</v>

753
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:45.041
<v Speaker 5>Convinced that this is amazing looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>place is in fact perfectly natural.</v>

754
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.550
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really explain.</v>

755
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can explore.</v>

756
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.480
<v Speaker 5>We can pretty well explained how it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>done and we didn't want to think that </v>

757
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 5>that would have Been a smoking gun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're.</v>

758
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.580
<v Speaker 5>We're convinced that it's natural.</v>

759
00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 1>You saw those two giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Saw those two giant pizza box </v>

760
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:04.811
<v Speaker 1>looking pieces of rock that were stacked</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to each other side by side and you </v>

761
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:05.980
<v Speaker 1>that look natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

762
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

763
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:10.150
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to describe,</v>

764
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.990
<v Speaker 5>just know without having the pictures </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

765
00:44:14.991 --> 00:44:17.390
<v Speaker 5>but more time and I had the big thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>with me.</v>

766
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.760
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could show you why we're convinced </v>

767
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:22.760
<v Speaker 5>that it is indeed completely</v>

768
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.480
<v Speaker 1>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen all the images on graham </v>

769
00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:27.480
<v Speaker 1>hancock site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming.</v>

770
00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Did you do any diving yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A yana goes,</v>

771
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:29.780
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

772
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 5>We were there for a week and then there </v>
<v Speaker 5>are a couple</v>

773
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 8>of times and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as I said,</v>

774
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:39.081
<v Speaker 8>it's in our own interest.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This as to see this is the evidence </v>

775
00:44:39.081 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 8>we're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we don't think it is.</v>

776
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 8>We think graham was making a big mistake</v>
<v Speaker 8>and insisting that it is</v>

777
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 7>dr schoch the geologist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What was his explanation for how it was </v>

778
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 7>created?</v>

779
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:53.380
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you see if you go because the people who</v>

780
00:44:53.381 --> 00:44:56.560
<v Speaker 8>are taking the pictures initially and </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's they're not trying to fool anyone,</v>

781
00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:59.830
<v Speaker 8>they're just taking the cool,</v>
<v Speaker 8>exciting looking pictures,</v>

782
00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:05.130
<v Speaker 8>but if you follow some of those ridges,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it looks so perfectly vertical and so </v>

783
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:09.001
<v Speaker 8>perfectly horizontal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'll see them just kind of tAper into </v>

784
00:45:09.001 --> 00:45:12.430
<v Speaker 8>disappearance living rock face and when </v>
<v Speaker 8>you get really down in your notes to the</v>

785
00:45:12.581 --> 00:45:14.080
<v Speaker 8>rock,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you see the,</v>

786
00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the corners aren't finished.</v>

787
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:20.830
<v Speaker 8>You see that the rocks have been </v>
<v Speaker 8>wrenched out of their place.</v>

788
00:45:20.831 --> 00:45:22.750
<v Speaker 8>It's place,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's dangerous diving there.</v>

789
00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 8>and I'm not a diver.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm very,</v>

790
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:30.960
<v Speaker 8>very strong currents and I mean I have a</v>
<v Speaker 8>master diver glued to me,</v>

791
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 8>so,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

792
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:39.150
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but when you go down the shore,</v>

793
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:43.910
<v Speaker 8>I'm in shock and I went there on this </v>
<v Speaker 8>very nice japanese in their finance.</v>

794
00:45:43.911 --> 00:45:45.970
<v Speaker 8>The whole thing was really interested in</v>
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

795
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:51.530
<v Speaker 8>We do it to be wet blankets,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I'm the last day that we were there </v>

796
00:45:53.261 --> 00:45:58.261
<v Speaker 8>we went,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we went looking around the island and </v>

797
00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:01.430
<v Speaker 8>looking at other stuff when we went to a</v>
<v Speaker 8>place about a couple of miles from the </v>

798
00:46:02.381 --> 00:46:07.381
<v Speaker 8>actual yoga goonie site and they're at </v>
<v Speaker 8>the water's edge and it's a certain kind</v>

799
00:46:07.541 --> 00:46:11.560
<v Speaker 8>of shale.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a very hard shale formation that is</v>

800
00:46:11.561 --> 00:46:16.561
<v Speaker 8>laid down in very regular horizontals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But that is cross cut by,</v>

801
00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:21.580
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fault lines.</v>

802
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.120
<v Speaker 8>And it's like if you imagine a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 8>stone layer cake that's already cut into</v>

803
00:46:28.001 --> 00:46:33.001
<v Speaker 8>pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they have the pieces haven't been </v>

804
00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:35.070
<v Speaker 8>served.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so what happens is that by the </v>

805
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:37.090
<v Speaker 8>action of the winds and the waves,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because the southern formation,</v>

806
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:42.150
<v Speaker 8>similar inflammation was right at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>water's edge and he could watch the </v>

807
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.600
<v Speaker 8>waves pounding up against the current </v>
<v Speaker 8>running.</v>

808
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.540
<v Speaker 8>And What would happen is that eventually</v>
<v Speaker 8>the water,</v>

809
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.720
<v Speaker 8>the running water and the waves and </v>
<v Speaker 8>tides,</v>

810
00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:54.930
<v Speaker 8>unos,</v>
<v Speaker 8>typhoons and all the rest sort of work </v>

811
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.570
<v Speaker 8>into the fault lines which are softer </v>
<v Speaker 8>rock.</v>

812
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:03.310
<v Speaker 8>And eventually they get it to the point </v>
<v Speaker 8>that the action of the waves pulls away </v>

813
00:47:06.461 --> 00:47:09.280
<v Speaker 8>a big chunk of rock.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is all set down and layers.</v>

814
00:47:09.281 --> 00:47:11.890
<v Speaker 8>So that falls into the water.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And again,</v>

815
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.140
<v Speaker 8>we're talking about thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 8>thousands of years.</v>

816
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:19.650
<v Speaker 8>Gradually the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the whole pIece of brought disappears </v>

817
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:23.281
<v Speaker 8>because it's all laid down on these kind</v>
<v Speaker 8>of layer cake layer cake levels.</v>

818
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:29.370
<v Speaker 8>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we saw this with because we had our own </v>

819
00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 8>skins over the course of the.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was the last thing in the world.</v>

820
00:47:32.231 --> 00:47:37.231
<v Speaker 8>We wanted to be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you believed that it was an ancient </v>

821
00:47:37.231 --> 00:47:39.120
<v Speaker 8>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well we had it all planned.</v>

822
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:43.330
<v Speaker 8>I was going to write it up to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>national geographic or sony or something</v>

823
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 8>like that and scott was going to write </v>
<v Speaker 8>it up that they for the geological,</v>

824
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.360
<v Speaker 8>the geological journals and all of that </v>
<v Speaker 8>sort of stuff.</v>

825
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 8>And I'm young and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

826
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:57.020
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Did you see the stone circle?</v>

827
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.600
<v Speaker 8>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's like pillars arranged in a </v>

828
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:03.600
<v Speaker 8>circle,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you see that no.</v>

829
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.840
<v Speaker 8>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're convinced that there's no context </v>

830
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.590
<v Speaker 8>for anything there and things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>not.</v>

831
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 8>Things that are manmade have a context.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And as I said,</v>

832
00:48:14.981 --> 00:48:17.390
<v Speaker 8>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when we saw we would sit,</v>

833
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:22.410
<v Speaker 8>we would still be uncertain about it if </v>
<v Speaker 8>we did not go a couple of miles down and</v>

834
00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:28.021
<v Speaker 8>watched a similar sort of thing being </v>
<v Speaker 8>formed right in front of our eyes and go</v>

835
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.650
<v Speaker 8>back there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When we do this,</v>

836
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:32.650
<v Speaker 8>our next,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this next element that makes you want to</v>

837
00:48:32.651 --> 00:48:37.651
<v Speaker 8>do one will be one of our,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of our sites that assuming we can </v>

838
00:48:37.651 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 8>get the funding together,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we will be,</v>

839
00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:45.850
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>will be concentrating upon because it's </v>

840
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:49.741
<v Speaker 8>an object lesson both in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in how careful you have to be when </v>

841
00:48:49.901 --> 00:48:50.590
<v Speaker 8>you're looking.</v>

842
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.740
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean we have a stake in this too and </v>

843
00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:00.100
<v Speaker 8>that where we have to give up on this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had a moment,</v>

844
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.940
<v Speaker 8>a slight pang not much because I really </v>
<v Speaker 8>liked the core academics,</v>

845
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.360
<v Speaker 8>but he had a slight pang of compassion </v>
<v Speaker 8>for them when somebody comes along and </v>

846
00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.500
<v Speaker 8>destroys their paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is us.</v>

847
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:14.540
<v Speaker 8>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so young.</v>

848
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:19.150
<v Speaker 8>That's the only goonie and um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but anyway.</v>

849
00:49:19.151 --> 00:49:24.151
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>back to back to this incredible </v>

850
00:49:24.151 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 8>bracelet.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This was just a couple of months ago.</v>

851
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:28.960
<v Speaker 8>They found a bracelet somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 8>Turkey.</v>

852
00:49:28.961 --> 00:49:31.510
<v Speaker 8>Turkey is turning out to be more and </v>
<v Speaker 8>more interesting.</v>

853
00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.540
<v Speaker 8>There are all kinds of great places in </v>
<v Speaker 8>Turkey and the just around bracelet made</v>

854
00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:44.560
<v Speaker 8>of obsidian.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Obsidian is an incredibly hard stone and</v>

855
00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:47.260
<v Speaker 8>very difficult to work.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And like dated,</v>

856
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:49.510
<v Speaker 8>I'm not exactly sure how their data </v>
<v Speaker 8>might be in the,</v>

857
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 8>where it was found the strada where it </v>
<v Speaker 8>was found.</v>

858
00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 8>They dated it to around 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>bc,</v>

859
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:59.250
<v Speaker 8>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

860
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:02.350
<v Speaker 8>it's a very elegant little,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean didn't look like that much.</v>

861
00:50:02.351 --> 00:50:07.351
<v Speaker 8>It's just elegant and beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the archeologists realized when they</v>

862
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:13.201
<v Speaker 8>studied it that the finish on it was </v>
<v Speaker 8>something that nowadays you could only </v>

863
00:50:13.571 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 8>do with the most sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 8>instruments,</v>

864
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:22.230
<v Speaker 8>lasers or something of the sort and </v>
<v Speaker 8>moreover that it had a very complex and </v>

865
00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:27.320
<v Speaker 8>subtle geometrical shape.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So in other words,</v>

866
00:50:27.321 --> 00:50:32.321
<v Speaker 8>you cAn't do a thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's very hard to imagine doing some </v>

867
00:50:32.321 --> 00:50:36.550
<v Speaker 8>something of that nature that's really </v>
<v Speaker 8>rigorously geometrical without having </v>

868
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:38.540
<v Speaker 8>the geometry at your fingertips.</v>

869
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 7>So you'd have to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>computer,</v>

870
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:42.860
<v Speaker 7>a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>something has to.</v>

871
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:46.730
<v Speaker 7>You have to have something that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you built to construct this,</v>

872
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:47.840
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that what you're saying?</v>

873
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.330
<v Speaker 8>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is,</v>

874
00:50:49.331 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 8>this is the contention of chris </v>
<v Speaker 8>christopher done.</v>

875
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.080
<v Speaker 8>They know chris knows he's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well he's,</v>

876
00:50:56.170 --> 00:51:01.170
<v Speaker 8>he's a high tech guy and he designs </v>
<v Speaker 8>engineer.</v>

877
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:07.430
<v Speaker 8>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he's the guy who designs the </v>

878
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:11.340
<v Speaker 8>instruments,</v>
<v Speaker 8>really precise instruments that do </v>

879
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.510
<v Speaker 8>things like make pieces for the space </v>
<v Speaker 8>shuttle and stuff,</v>

880
00:51:13.511 --> 00:51:18.511
<v Speaker 8>their instruments that are calibrated to</v>
<v Speaker 8>10 thousands of thousands of an inch and</v>

881
00:51:19.211 --> 00:51:23.470
<v Speaker 8>he's done studies in Egypt and finds </v>
<v Speaker 8>that that's what you'll see all over the</v>

882
00:51:23.471 --> 00:51:26.770
<v Speaker 8>place that there a monstrous pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 8>granite.</v>

883
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.950
<v Speaker 8>let me put this [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's been on a couple of trips with me.</v>

884
00:51:29.951 --> 00:51:34.951
<v Speaker 8>He's a good guy and he,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he has his flying special instRuments </v>

885
00:51:35.591 --> 00:51:40.591
<v Speaker 8>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a calibrated to a 10 thousands of an </v>

886
00:51:40.591 --> 00:51:43.621
<v Speaker 8>inch and the places that some piece of </v>
<v Speaker 8>granite and old kingdom granite and </v>

887
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.820
<v Speaker 8>granted is 100 percent completely true.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

888
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.300
<v Speaker 8>and chris as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is,</v>

889
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:56.390
<v Speaker 8>is fairly adamant that in order to do </v>
<v Speaker 8>this they had to have had some sort of </v>

890
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:03.080
<v Speaker 8>technology that would allow them to do </v>
<v Speaker 8>that shotgun.</v>

891
00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:08.820
<v Speaker 8>I'm not so sure because technology is </v>
<v Speaker 8>technology and mostly they have some </v>

892
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:14.430
<v Speaker 8>miraculous realm of technology that we </v>
<v Speaker 8>can't even imagine because you would </v>

893
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:18.781
<v Speaker 8>have expected,</v>
<v Speaker 8>particularly in a place like Egypt so </v>

894
00:52:18.781 --> 00:52:22.021
<v Speaker 8>much from the past times.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Somewhere along the line you need to </v>

895
00:52:22.271 --> 00:52:25.470
<v Speaker 8>have some evidence of this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>technology and the dump.</v>

896
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.350
<v Speaker 7>You mean by saying technology,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you mean something that cuts the,</v>

897
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.360
<v Speaker 7>like a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>something that can cut the marble and </v>

898
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.140
<v Speaker 7>polish it down to be 100 percent flat?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

899
00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.620
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is the conventional?</v>

900
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.520
<v Speaker 7>What is the conventional egyptologists?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do they say they built it?</v>

901
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:48.930
<v Speaker 8>They don't address the question of being</v>
<v Speaker 8>since there is no.</v>

902
00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:54.290
<v Speaker 8>Since there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there is no evidence for that </v>

903
00:52:54.841 --> 00:52:59.841
<v Speaker 8>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They just assume that they did it by </v>

904
00:52:59.841 --> 00:53:00.060
<v Speaker 8>hand somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and maybe they did,</v>

905
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:05.300
<v Speaker 8>but when you realize the level of </v>
<v Speaker 8>perfection of these things and how </v>

906
00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.210
<v Speaker 8>impossible it would be today to do them </v>
<v Speaker 8>by hand.</v>

907
00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:10.990
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean they're just say,</v>

908
00:53:10.991 --> 00:53:12.960
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well in those days everybody had lots of</v>

909
00:53:12.961 --> 00:53:17.961
<v Speaker 8>time and time was no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was not of any concern that it could </v>

910
00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:18.240
<v Speaker 8>work on it until I got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

911
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:23.600
<v Speaker 8>that's the sort of a fudge hands.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't legitimately postulates and </v>

912
00:53:25.731 --> 00:53:28.250
<v Speaker 8>advanced technology when you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 8>any evidence for it.</v>

913
00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.920
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was another issue with the vases,</v>

914
00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:35.980
<v Speaker 7>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The stone vases that were made that we </v>

915
00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:35.980
<v Speaker 7>can't duplicate today.</v>

916
00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.000
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

917
00:53:37.001 --> 00:53:38.680
<v Speaker 8>maybe we could,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we'd have to go.</v>

918
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 8>We got to use a lot of very special </v>
<v Speaker 8>machinery to do it and since there's no </v>

919
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:44.980
<v Speaker 8>evidence that he had this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>machinery,</v>

920
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.820
<v Speaker 8>these rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no clauses that are,</v>

921
00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.600
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the shape like this and they have a </v>

922
00:53:54.641 --> 00:53:58.380
<v Speaker 8>narrow neck and the hollow on the inside</v>
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

923
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.270
<v Speaker 8>and they're perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean they can know,</v>

924
00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:06.271
<v Speaker 8>they can tap into the inside and see </v>
<v Speaker 8>that the inside is hollowed out </v>

925
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 8>perfectly and we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we don't know how they could possibly </v>

926
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:13.771
<v Speaker 8>have had what kind of a drill or </v>
<v Speaker 8>anything they could have had to do this </v>

927
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:16.630
<v Speaker 8>in a very hard stone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Vases and they date from a very early</v>

928
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 8>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not I'm not a later period.</v>

929
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:26.720
<v Speaker 8>They lost the ability.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is one of the strains and some of </v>

930
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.490
<v Speaker 8>the most spectacular stuff comes from </v>
<v Speaker 8>the earliest periods contract right now.</v>

931
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:33.360
<v Speaker 8>There's a terrific,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a terrific show.</v>

932
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:34.870
<v Speaker 8>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

933
00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:40.110
<v Speaker 8>the metropolitan museum of art,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think the dawn of the egyptian art and</v>

934
00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:44.290
<v Speaker 8>it's all the preterm nastic work force </v>
<v Speaker 8>housing five,</v>

935
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.110
<v Speaker 8>three,</v>
<v Speaker 8>four or 5,000</v>

936
00:54:46.111 --> 00:54:48.330
<v Speaker 8>bc and they're collected.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not,</v>

937
00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.600
<v Speaker 8>it's not because they do a </v>
<v Speaker 8>retrospective,</v>

938
00:54:51.601 --> 00:54:56.601
<v Speaker 8>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 8>gets from here and bits in there and so </v>

939
00:54:56.601 --> 00:54:59.271
<v Speaker 8>on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So they put together this really </v>

940
00:54:59.271 --> 00:55:01.070
<v Speaker 8>fabulous shoW because normally you don't</v>
<v Speaker 8>see much treated nastic art together in </v>

941
00:55:01.201 --> 00:55:06.201
<v Speaker 8>one place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And when you look carefully and you see </v>

942
00:55:06.201 --> 00:55:06.201
<v Speaker 8>what's going on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what you,</v>

943
00:55:06.201 --> 00:55:06.900
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what you're looking at,</v>

944
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 8>I mean if it was somebody who not spent </v>
<v Speaker 8>30 years studying Egypt,</v>

945
00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:16.840
<v Speaker 8>you don't look really impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That'S in pieces.</v>

946
00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:22.251
<v Speaker 8>They're mostly quIte small.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But if you have an eye for this and </v>

947
00:55:22.251 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 8>you've done a lot of study and ask a lot</v>
<v Speaker 8>of questions,</v>

948
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.740
<v Speaker 8>you see how spectacularly beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 8>these things are.</v>

949
00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:31.680
<v Speaker 8>Zoned shows on till august.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So anybody in the neighborhood make sure</v>

950
00:55:31.681 --> 00:55:33.440
<v Speaker 8>you get to the mat.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How does it happen?</v>

951
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:34.740
<v Speaker 8>an awful lot of press,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's,</v>

952
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.030
<v Speaker 8>it's a terrific show.</v>

953
00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:41.820
<v Speaker 7>So you guys want to put a date of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization of Egypt to somewhere </v>

954
00:55:41.951 --> 00:55:43.630
<v Speaker 7>around $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>pc.</v>

955
00:55:43.631 --> 00:55:44.890
<v Speaker 7>That's your idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

956
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:46.090
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

957
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.610
<v Speaker 8>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It could even be earlier.</v>

958
00:55:47.611 --> 00:55:52.611
<v Speaker 8>We don't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're me backtrack a little bit.</v>

959
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.760
<v Speaker 7>My.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My question is how did one civilization </v>

960
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.281
<v Speaker 7>like Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how did that one thing rises up and it </v>

961
00:56:02.281 --> 00:56:05.530
<v Speaker 7>seems so much more advanced than any </v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization anywhere,</v>

962
00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:10.740
<v Speaker 7>anywhere around it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how did that take place so long </v>

963
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:10.740
<v Speaker 7>ago?</v>

964
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:14.950
<v Speaker 8>A little bit different than see this </v>
<v Speaker 8>physical situation of Egypt is such as </v>

965
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:19.840
<v Speaker 8>bone guys this nowadays since,</v>

966
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.980
<v Speaker 7>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>

967
00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 7>your theory.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry.</v>

968
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:28.621
<v Speaker 7>Your theory puts it in a time where it </v>
<v Speaker 7>wasn't though your theory puts the </v>

969
00:56:28.621 --> 00:56:30.310
<v Speaker 7>creation of Egypt at the time where it </v>
<v Speaker 7>was lush and rained all the time.</v>

970
00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 7>It was essentially a rainforest.</v>

971
00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.100
<v Speaker 8>Well that takes it way back further,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but then we go back,</v>

972
00:56:35.101 --> 00:56:37.020
<v Speaker 8>we accept that and now we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 8>10,000</v>

973
00:56:37.021 --> 00:56:39.450
<v Speaker 8>bc and who's to say what they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 8>discovered yet?</v>

974
00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:44.570
<v Speaker 8>What was the climate?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I find so and the other </v>

975
00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:47.100
<v Speaker 8>civilizations you see he has this </v>
<v Speaker 8>physically,</v>

976
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.810
<v Speaker 8>physically unique situation where things</v>
<v Speaker 8>don't.</v>

977
00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:53.370
<v Speaker 8>Whether away.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

978
00:56:53.371 --> 00:56:57.930
<v Speaker 8>once they get covered up with sand just </v>
<v Speaker 8>there and plus the fact that,</v>

979
00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.310
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in the old days this was a,</v>

980
00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:04.780
<v Speaker 8>this was a kind of blessing civilization</v>
<v Speaker 8>in which we hardly have to do any work </v>

981
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:08.931
<v Speaker 8>to get fed either the nile would flood </v>
<v Speaker 8>and we planted some seeds and I grew up </v>

982
00:57:08.931 --> 00:57:11.340
<v Speaker 8>when the windows,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when the flood season game again,</v>

983
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.180
<v Speaker 8>we had a fairly populous,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

984
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.720
<v Speaker 8>that was a substantial population there </v>
<v Speaker 8>with nothing to do.</v>

985
00:57:18.721 --> 00:57:23.721
<v Speaker 8>No television,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no american idol and nothing to do all </v>

986
00:57:23.721 --> 00:57:23.721
<v Speaker 8>day long,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all night long.</v>

987
00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:24.930
<v Speaker 8>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

988
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:25.990
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

989
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.290
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the whole,</v>

990
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:33.560
<v Speaker 8>the entire society was put to work </v>
<v Speaker 8>building these fabulous,</v>

991
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:37.530
<v Speaker 8>fabulous temples and monuments and doing</v>
<v Speaker 8>the artwork and so on.</v>

992
00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:41.670
<v Speaker 8>So the other places,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean I'm pretty well convinced because</v>

993
00:57:41.671 --> 00:57:46.080
<v Speaker 8>the doctrine in all of this work in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>last decade or so,</v>

994
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.570
<v Speaker 8>proving that the cosmology,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in other words,</v>

995
00:57:48.571 --> 00:57:53.571
<v Speaker 8>the sophisticated understanding of life </v>
<v Speaker 8>and significant significance of live in </v>

996
00:57:54.481 --> 00:57:58.500
<v Speaker 8>the geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 8>astronomy and so on was all,</v>

997
00:57:58.501 --> 00:58:03.501
<v Speaker 8>they're universally India and China and </v>
<v Speaker 8>the other places just didn't have the </v>

998
00:58:03.501 --> 00:58:03.570
<v Speaker 8>physical</v>

999
00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:10.420
<v Speaker 8>capacity to build on that scale or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 8>they just play to do it anyway.</v>

1000
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:17.480
<v Speaker 8>They had other ways of manifesting this </v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of,</v>

1001
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:22.970
<v Speaker 8>let's say this kind of understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And this is another thing that just not </v>

1002
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.380
<v Speaker 8>even taking into consideration by the </v>
<v Speaker 8>academics.</v>

1003
00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:29.250
<v Speaker 8>You don't need sacred architects,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1004
00:58:29.251 --> 00:58:32.370
<v Speaker 8>magnificent sacred architecture to </v>
<v Speaker 8>express</v>

1005
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:38.990
<v Speaker 8>spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We could have a society and they </v>

1006
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:41.880
<v Speaker 8>probably are some express their,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's say their,</v>

1007
00:58:41.881 --> 00:58:43.590
<v Speaker 8>their,</v>
<v Speaker 8>their spiritual longings.</v>

1008
00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:48.940
<v Speaker 8>It's only in danced and at the end you </v>
<v Speaker 8>would have known even the society,</v>

1009
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:56.310
<v Speaker 8>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there are sacred dances in the gurdjieff</v>

1010
00:58:56.311 --> 00:59:01.311
<v Speaker 8>work that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They have what are called the movements </v>

1011
00:59:01.311 --> 00:59:01.470
<v Speaker 8>and boy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're getting into these things.</v>

1012
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:06.450
<v Speaker 8>I mean they're pretty amazing and yet we</v>
<v Speaker 8>do them today,</v>

1013
00:59:06.451 --> 00:59:11.451
<v Speaker 8>but because he,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they sacred dance exists in lots of </v>

1014
00:59:11.641 --> 00:59:16.641
<v Speaker 8>different societies,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you don't need to build temples in </v>

1015
00:59:16.641 --> 00:59:18.210
<v Speaker 8>order to express it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The egyptians done it that way.</v>

1016
00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Speaker 8>I'm the chinese and the indians did too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but not that early and there was no,</v>

1017
00:59:23.061 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 8>it's less than that.</v>

1018
00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:29.090
<v Speaker 9>what,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how did the civilization just spring up </v>

1019
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.710
<v Speaker 9>like this though?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Created such incredible works of art and</v>

1020
00:59:30.711 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 9>incredible work.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know the,</v>

1021
00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 9>the architectural designs of these,</v>
<v Speaker 9>these buildings,</v>

1022
00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:36.720
<v Speaker 8>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1023
00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.810
<v Speaker 8>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But when you see that,</v>

1024
00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:45.030
<v Speaker 8>see that's one of the eye openers of </v>
<v Speaker 8>this very interesting don and </v>

1025
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:50.750
<v Speaker 8>civilization exhibit at the met because </v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't have temples and you don't </v>

1026
00:59:52.831 --> 00:59:57.831
<v Speaker 8>have to have big buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you have very many instances of very</v>

1027
00:59:58.621 --> 01:00:03.240
<v Speaker 8>sophisticated sculptured done.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Very hard stones.</v>

1028
01:00:03.241 --> 01:00:06.450
<v Speaker 8>I mean beautifully finished.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So they had it.</v>

1029
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:11.510
<v Speaker 8>They could do it and as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we've got build beckley company that is </v>

1030
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:15.080
<v Speaker 8>not an argument for that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Go back to the topic of easter island.</v>

1031
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:19.020
<v Speaker 8>Turn out to be ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well then they are.</v>

1032
01:00:19.021 --> 01:00:19.650
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if it's,</v>

1033
01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.360
<v Speaker 8>if,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you can date,</v>

1034
01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:27.440
<v Speaker 8>it's sort of amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they haven't done it or maybe they have </v>

1035
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:27.440
<v Speaker 8>an,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know about it,</v>

1036
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.610
<v Speaker 8>but if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can show them that the earliest </v>

1037
01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:37.610
<v Speaker 8>levels of filled that had buried them up</v>
<v Speaker 8>to their chests goes back to let's say </v>

1038
01:00:38.281 --> 01:00:43.281
<v Speaker 8>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have templates on rather than we've </v>

1039
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:45.351
<v Speaker 8>got another instance of spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 8>artwork at the time when there's not </v>

1040
01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:47.550
<v Speaker 8>supposed to do such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1041
01:00:47.551 --> 01:00:50.970
<v Speaker 8>the whole thing is in the process of </v>
<v Speaker 8>being turned upside down,</v>

1042
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:52.830
<v Speaker 8>ideally by us.</v>

1043
01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:59.030
<v Speaker 9>It's an incredibly fascinating subject </v>
<v Speaker 9>and one that it drives me crazy.</v>

1044
01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.280
<v Speaker 9>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

1045
01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the timeline is such a fascinating </v>

1046
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.650
<v Speaker 9>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like where did civilization emerged from</v>

1047
01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:07.030
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when,</v>

1048
01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:11.590
<v Speaker 9>how did it get so incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 9>sophisticated at one point in time,</v>

1049
01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:13.690
<v Speaker 9>ancient Egypt and then somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 9>another,</v>

1050
01:01:13.691 --> 01:01:15.790
<v Speaker 9>all that stuff was lost,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1051
01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:20.791
<v Speaker 9>somehow or another through the burning </v>
<v Speaker 9>of the library of alexandria and the </v>

1052
01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:21.940
<v Speaker 9>romans and the greeks and everything </v>
<v Speaker 9>throughout history up until today.</v>

1053
01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.120
<v Speaker 9>So much informaTion has been lost is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is there a natural disaster in the </v>

1054
01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.550
<v Speaker 9>middle of there somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Did something happen to the human race,</v>

1055
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.770
<v Speaker 9>were wiped out a significant number of </v>
<v Speaker 9>us.</v>

1056
01:01:32.771 --> 01:01:35.140
<v Speaker 9>And then we had to refigure things out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Is that what happened?</v>

1057
01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:40.590
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>could be or it stayed there and sort of </v>

1058
01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:43.180
<v Speaker 8>a dormant state until it was time to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to reinvented.</v>

1059
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:46.450
<v Speaker 8>And acTually it does go for the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that for example,</v>

1060
01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:50.170
<v Speaker 8>you see when you're dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 8>academia,</v>

1061
01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:51.560
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

1062
01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 8>they're very resistant to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to interpreting their own data in any </v>

1063
01:01:58.751 --> 01:02:01.270
<v Speaker 8>way that disagrees with their </v>
<v Speaker 8>preconceptions.</v>

1064
01:02:01.271 --> 01:02:04.930
<v Speaker 8>But you're familiar for sure with the </v>
<v Speaker 8>paleolithic caves,</v>

1065
01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:06.670
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Grants.</v>

1066
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.040
<v Speaker 8>Olesko.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you know the one?</v>

1067
01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:13.270
<v Speaker 8>I'm the most recent one discovered in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the early nineties?</v>

1068
01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:15.970
<v Speaker 8>Close show today.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hold on the same area.</v>

1069
01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:16.900
<v Speaker 8>You know that one?</v>

1070
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know that one.</v>

1071
01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 8>C,</v>
<v Speaker 8>h a l v,</v>

1072
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:24.801
<v Speaker 8>e t,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think I must of what's going on in </v>

1073
01:02:24.801 --> 01:02:25.170
<v Speaker 8>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

1074
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:29.300
<v Speaker 8>and this was discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's named after the guy who discovered,</v>

1075
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:34.910
<v Speaker 8>and this is up up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the most spectacular,</v>

1076
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:39.540
<v Speaker 8>the most spectacular of the caves was </v>
<v Speaker 8>the one that lost.</v>

1077
01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:42.690
<v Speaker 8>Go with the famoUs all of bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the other one,</v>

1078
01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:47.730
<v Speaker 8>that place called alta mira,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which again is a very high level of </v>

1079
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:51.340
<v Speaker 8>artwork and both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 8>both of those caves of dated to around </v>

1080
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.270
<v Speaker 8>17,</v>
<v Speaker 8>18,000</v>

1081
01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:59.271
<v Speaker 8>bc and the basis of evidence in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>caves will show that it has the most </v>

1082
01:02:59.271 --> 01:03:00.570
<v Speaker 8>spectacular art.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The law.</v>

1083
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:04.220
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's as though it were designed by drawn</v>

1084
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:08.460
<v Speaker 8>by a whole bunch of paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 8>picasso's coming spectacular stuff.</v>

1085
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:13.461
<v Speaker 8>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you pull it up online will say it </v>

1086
01:03:13.461 --> 01:03:14.620
<v Speaker 8>and spell it again please.</v>
<v Speaker 8>C h a,</v>

1087
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.760
<v Speaker 8>v e t or b,</v>
<v Speaker 8>e z.</v>

1088
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.650
<v Speaker 8>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wow,</v>

1089
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.180
<v Speaker 8>this is amazing stuff.</v>

1090
01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:29.620
<v Speaker 8>He got it up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You see this day date to 31,000</v>

1091
01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:36.741
<v Speaker 8>bc bright,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they don't see.</v>

1092
01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:41.781
<v Speaker 8>They don't put two and two together.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They can't do higher mathematics and </v>

1093
01:03:41.781 --> 01:03:45.171
<v Speaker 8>academia because two and two tells you </v>
<v Speaker 8>that artwork at this level.</v>

1094
01:03:45.211 --> 01:03:47.440
<v Speaker 8>And I mean where are they getting the </v>
<v Speaker 8>paint from?</v>

1095
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.460
<v Speaker 8>What are they doing with their fingers?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Presumably we can't go into the local </v>

1096
01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.181
<v Speaker 8>art supply shop and get know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>get acrylic paints the painting that's </v>

1097
01:03:56.181 --> 01:04:00.590
<v Speaker 8>on the inside of the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's got to be pitch black and when you </v>

1098
01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:05.151
<v Speaker 8>look at the level of artwork,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you realize that this is not done by </v>

1099
01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:09.390
<v Speaker 8>primitives.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In order to to do art of that,</v>

1100
01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.600
<v Speaker 8>on that level,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have to have your act together.</v>

1101
01:04:12.601 --> 01:04:14.740
<v Speaker 8>Even if you're wearing bear skins,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1102
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.160
<v Speaker 8>it really does look like the animals </v>
<v Speaker 8>they're chasing and it's all done from </v>

1103
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 8>memory.</v>

1104
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.160
<v Speaker 8>that's very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1105
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:28.490
<v Speaker 8>we were shocked and I think that because</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's been a very good guy minutes for</v>

1106
01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:32.440
<v Speaker 8>it forever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for a long time.</v>

1107
01:04:32.441 --> 01:04:36.120
<v Speaker 8>He was at a conference that we did named</v>
<v Speaker 8>frank ed to interpret it,</v>

1108
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:41.510
<v Speaker 8>the hall of bulls lasko as an </v>
<v Speaker 8>astronomical basically as not having an </v>

1109
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:47.420
<v Speaker 8>astronomical significance of dots and </v>
<v Speaker 8>dogs on the wall that represented the </v>

1110
01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:52.390
<v Speaker 8>pleiades and other constellations and I </v>
<v Speaker 8>think he's probably correct and it </v>

1111
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:54.330
<v Speaker 8>wouldn't have surprised me to see.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The usual explanation is,</v>

1112
01:04:54.331 --> 01:04:56.610
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well that's magic because of my paint,</v>

1113
01:04:56.611 --> 01:04:58.610
<v Speaker 8>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 8>these animals on the wall,</v>

1114
01:04:58.611 --> 01:05:03.270
<v Speaker 8>they'll be able to hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not so sure I'm.</v>

1115
01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:08.310
<v Speaker 8>I'm more inclined to think that it may </v>
<v Speaker 8>be in some in some way or another star </v>

1116
01:05:11.791 --> 01:05:16.791
<v Speaker 8>map or have some sort of cosmological </v>
<v Speaker 8>significance and it does a book for </v>

1117
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.400
<v Speaker 8>french member of the academy actually </v>
<v Speaker 8>going to go the sacred geography of </v>

1118
01:05:24.071 --> 01:05:25.300
<v Speaker 8>ancient Greece?</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1119
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 8>it's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a different moment.</v>

1120
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:31.450
<v Speaker 8>That's one book.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's another one by amateurs.</v>

1121
01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 8>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not credentialed.</v>

1122
01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:36.330
<v Speaker 8>Whatever enough,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if that means anything close.</v>

1123
01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 8>Plato's secret elliot's in which they </v>
<v Speaker 8>show that the iliad,</v>

1124
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:45.520
<v Speaker 8>which is the most boring book ever </v>
<v Speaker 8>written,</v>

1125
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:50.910
<v Speaker 8>is actually a gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like a planetarium and all of this so </v>

1126
01:05:51.371 --> 01:05:52.540
<v Speaker 8>and so's being killed.</v>

1127
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:55.220
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the the,</v>

1128
01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:55.630
<v Speaker 10>the</v>

1129
01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.120
<v Speaker 8>heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rosa here and the armies of doing all of</v>

1130
01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.280
<v Speaker 8>this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a terrible board read,</v>

1131
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:06.670
<v Speaker 8>but if it's decoding as a star map,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like as like a planetarium and the </v>

1132
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:11.251
<v Speaker 8>action from about 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 8>bc on the whole thing makes all of a </v>

1133
01:06:12.651 --> 01:06:17.651
<v Speaker 8>sudden made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is why they go into all of that </v>

1134
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:20.030
<v Speaker 8>trouble to do all of this work decoded </v>
<v Speaker 8>as a sky map.</v>

1135
01:06:20.031 --> 01:06:22.730
<v Speaker 8>How?</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do you decode it as a sky map?</v>

1136
01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.770
<v Speaker 8>He has to read the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's complicated because the stars,</v>

1137
01:06:27.771 --> 01:06:32.600
<v Speaker 8>let me see if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the army's represent constellations,</v>

1138
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:36.290
<v Speaker 8>the heroes of the particular bright </v>
<v Speaker 8>stars in the,</v>

1139
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:39.620
<v Speaker 8>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in the particular constellation,</v>

1140
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.960
<v Speaker 8>and the elliot is all about this army is</v>
<v Speaker 8>going here and that ami is going here </v>

1141
01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.460
<v Speaker 8>and this one is over powering this one </v>
<v Speaker 8>and if you're decoding astronomically,</v>

1142
01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:52.290
<v Speaker 8>if it's tracking the constellations </v>
<v Speaker 8>across the sky because the,</v>

1143
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:56.030
<v Speaker 8>the relationships of the stars and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>constellations to each other,</v>

1144
01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:57.590
<v Speaker 8>change over time.</v>

1145
01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:01.040
<v Speaker 8>So as everybody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why should they do that?</v>

1146
01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:07.070
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The astronomy and this is now even </v>

1147
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:11.300
<v Speaker 8>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even the academics,</v>

1148
01:07:11.301 --> 01:07:16.301
<v Speaker 8>there's a realizing that that astronomy </v>
<v Speaker 8>plays a huge role in very ancient </v>

1149
01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.810
<v Speaker 8>civilizations and the only reason as far</v>
<v Speaker 8>as I'm concerned,</v>

1150
01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:28.811
<v Speaker 8>but I can't prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We only reason it has to be not only is </v>

1151
01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.980
<v Speaker 8>astrologically significant because </v>
<v Speaker 8>otherwise we would care.</v>

1152
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.060
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for example,</v>

1153
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:35.240
<v Speaker 8>hamlet's mill,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1154
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.560
<v Speaker 8>something that can go to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 8>trouble to show that very ancient myths </v>

1155
01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.210
<v Speaker 8>as far back as you go know about the </v>
<v Speaker 8>procession of the equinoxes.</v>

1156
01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.140
<v Speaker 8>I was just about to ask you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said I was just about to ask you about</v>

1157
01:07:48.141 --> 01:07:48.850
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's it.</v>

1158
01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.260
<v Speaker 8>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Explain that to people.</v>

1159
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>the possession of the equinox is there </v>

1160
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.701
<v Speaker 8>is because supposedly because of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>level of the earth with their other </v>

1161
01:07:58.701 --> 01:08:03.010
<v Speaker 8>other explanations that I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 8>ben made the whole solar system that's </v>

1162
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:04.880
<v Speaker 8>turning around a binary star.</v>

1163
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:06.830
<v Speaker 8>UM.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Anyway.</v>

1164
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.290
<v Speaker 8>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The act is that,</v>

1165
01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:14.960
<v Speaker 8>let's say if you look the way that this </v>
<v Speaker 8>now we're still in the.</v>

1166
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:20.260
<v Speaker 8>Let's say we're in the age of pisces,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which means that if you look at the </v>

1167
01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:24.620
<v Speaker 8>spring equinox,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you watched wait for the sun to rise,</v>

1168
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.660
<v Speaker 8>it's rising an hour before the sunrise </v>
<v Speaker 8>is.</v>

1169
01:08:28.661 --> 01:08:33.661
<v Speaker 8>You'll see the sun coming up and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>constellation behind the sunrise is the </v>

1170
01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:40.241
<v Speaker 8>very last degrees of pisces.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And pretty soon you can't synthesize.</v>

1171
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.760
<v Speaker 8>They pretty soon it will be aquarius.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So the age of aquarius for musical was </v>

1172
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:52.200
<v Speaker 8>now very gradually.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's cool.</v>

1173
01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.930
<v Speaker 8>The precession,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1174
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:59.290
<v Speaker 8>the entire zodiac precesses against the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the sun.</v>

1175
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:07.541
<v Speaker 8>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't go and you look at astrology </v>

1176
01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:07.541
<v Speaker 8>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as you know,</v>

1177
01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:08.260
<v Speaker 8>is whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>April 20th,</v>

1178
01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.440
<v Speaker 8>march,</v>
<v Speaker 8>22nd,</v>

1179
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 8>and then it goes because aries,</v>
<v Speaker 8>taurus,</v>

1180
01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:15.650
<v Speaker 8>gemini cancer and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Precesses means it goes backwards.</v>

1181
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.800
<v Speaker 8>So it's in pisces now and it'll soon be </v>
<v Speaker 8>in aquarius.</v>

1182
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:24.730
<v Speaker 8>Now that the rate at which that cycle </v>
<v Speaker 8>takes canonically exactly,</v>

1183
01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.730
<v Speaker 8>exactly that 25,920</v>
<v Speaker 8>years.</v>

1184
01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.120
<v Speaker 8>So what this means is that for the sun </v>
<v Speaker 8>to precess one degree takes 72 years.</v>

1185
01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.000
<v Speaker 8>Now how do they figure that out and why </v>
<v Speaker 8>should it be important to you?</v>

1186
01:09:41.001 --> 01:09:46.001
<v Speaker 8>Imagine looking at the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don'T want people to be looking at </v>

1187
01:09:46.001 --> 01:09:49.481
<v Speaker 8>this guy for some reason or another and </v>
<v Speaker 8>realize that the sun takes 72 years to </v>

1188
01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 8>go one degree.</v>

1189
01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.550
<v Speaker 9>There was a book that graham hancock had</v>
<v Speaker 9>discussed once on an interview.</v>

1190
01:09:57.551 --> 01:10:00.240
<v Speaker 9>I wish I could remember the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it was discussing this,</v>

1191
01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:05.280
<v Speaker 9>this number 72,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and that this knowledge of the </v>

1192
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.330
<v Speaker 9>procession of the equinoxes has been </v>
<v Speaker 9>installed in many,</v>

1193
01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:09.430
<v Speaker 9>many ancient cultures and religions.</v>

1194
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:11.870
<v Speaker 8>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It has met.</v>

1195
01:10:11.871 --> 01:10:15.410
<v Speaker 8>That gets you into numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>symbolism and got gets you into sacred,</v>

1196
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:20.770
<v Speaker 9>so it lets us know that they knew a lot </v>
<v Speaker 9>more than we thought they knew just </v>

1197
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:23.280
<v Speaker 9>about the universe itself,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the constellations themselves,</v>

1198
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:25.980
<v Speaker 9>the wobble of the earth's axis,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a 26,000</v>

1199
01:10:25.981 --> 01:10:30.981
<v Speaker 9>year cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They knew about this somehow or another </v>

1200
01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:30.981
<v Speaker 9>10,</v>
<v Speaker 9>15,000</v>

1201
01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:31.490
<v Speaker 9>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's really.</v>

1202
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:32.940
<v Speaker 9>That's incredible.</v>

1203
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:38.410
<v Speaker 8>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And you see it's this kind of thing that</v>

1204
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:43.910
<v Speaker 8>is rigorously excluded from any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>academic discussions until it's stuffed </v>

1205
01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:48.650
<v Speaker 8>down their throats.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is exactly what we plan to do.</v>

1206
01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:49.650
<v Speaker 9>The current,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

1207
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:54.750
<v Speaker 9>the conventional egyptologists date,</v>
<v Speaker 9>their construction of the pyramids to </v>

1208
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:55.790
<v Speaker 9>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 9>Bc,</v>

1209
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.750
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Is it correct?</v>

1210
01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:58.760
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1211
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:59.420
<v Speaker 9>What?</v>
<v Speaker 9>What's that?</v>

1212
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:00.350
<v Speaker 9>What's that based on?</v>

1213
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's based on the.</v>

1214
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:09.110
<v Speaker 8>It's based on the reigns of key ops,</v>
<v Speaker 8>kafra of friend and so on.</v>

1215
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:14.580
<v Speaker 8>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is very complicated</v>

1216
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:19.580
<v Speaker 5>because we're chunking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Myself and my colleagues think that in </v>

1217
01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:27.231
<v Speaker 5>all likelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pyramids that we see today are doing</v>

1218
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:30.990
<v Speaker 5>deed date from that period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

1219
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.110
<v Speaker 5>and this is again formally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>easily provable.</v>

1220
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.800
<v Speaker 5>They are built,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are super imposed or replace </v>

1221
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 5>structures that were there earlier and </v>
<v Speaker 5>even the academics acknowledged that the</v>

1222
01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:51.531
<v Speaker 5>giza plateau was was a single template </v>
<v Speaker 5>to some very interesting work coming up </v>

1223
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 5>soon proving that that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so whenever the sphinx was built,</v>

1224
01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 5>they were also structures that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know if there are pyramids or not,</v>

1225
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:04.070
<v Speaker 5>but in the paramedics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly the second pyramid,</v>

1226
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.260
<v Speaker 5>the pyramid that's associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>spanx,</v>

1227
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:10.230
<v Speaker 5>you can see that there are two different</v>
<v Speaker 5>styles,</v>

1228
01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.600
<v Speaker 5>two radically different styles of </v>
<v Speaker 5>masonry and the lower the lower courses </v>

1229
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:20.460
<v Speaker 5>have built these gigantic blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>the size of practically the size of this</v>

1230
01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:21.390
<v Speaker 5>room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not quite,</v>

1231
01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:25.470
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>massive maybe 8,000</v>

1232
01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:30.471
<v Speaker 5>ton blocks and then piled on top of them</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the much and very finely finished on </v>

1233
01:12:31.341 --> 01:12:36.341
<v Speaker 5>a much lesser smaller cruder masonry.</v>

1234
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:40.350
<v Speaker 5>That's rather typical of of the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>kingdom.</v>

1235
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.410
<v Speaker 5>now whenever I'm in architectural </v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

1236
01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:48.411
<v Speaker 5>no architectural historian would not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Contextual historian knows instantly </v>

1237
01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:53.991
<v Speaker 5>that when you see two different styles </v>
<v Speaker 5>of architecture in the same building,</v>

1238
01:12:55.021 --> 01:12:58.080
<v Speaker 5>you know you're looking at two different</v>
<v Speaker 5>periods of building.</v>

1239
01:12:58.081 --> 01:13:01.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean this as a rough example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>suppose you have a victorian house,</v>

1240
01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:05.280
<v Speaker 5>but you've got a modern kitchen in it </v>
<v Speaker 5>100 years from now,</v>

1241
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.760
<v Speaker 5>with 500 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the archeologists come and discover that</v>

1242
01:13:08.761 --> 01:13:13.761
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They will know in two seconds that the </v>

1243
01:13:13.761 --> 01:13:14.430
<v Speaker 5>houses built in the 19 hundreds or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>$1,800</v>

1244
01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:18.930
<v Speaker 5>rather than the kitchen is built in 2005</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something of that sort.</v>

1245
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:24.350
<v Speaker 5>So this is a given.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you see two different radically </v>

1246
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:25.190
<v Speaker 5>different styles of architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1247
01:13:25.191 --> 01:13:27.030
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with two different </v>
<v Speaker 5>periods,</v>

1248
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:29.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two different periods of construction.</v>

1249
01:13:29.611 --> 01:13:31.780
<v Speaker 5>And then there are other factors in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1250
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:36.790
<v Speaker 5>This so called red pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm about 20 miles away where the whole </v>

1251
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:42.480
<v Speaker 5>pyramid is built and the interior </v>
<v Speaker 5>chambers are in perfect condition,</v>

1252
01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:47.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>built over a ruinous legalistic chamber </v>

1253
01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.360
<v Speaker 5>that they called a plunder tomb chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not a plum.</v>

1254
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:55.510
<v Speaker 5>The tomb chamber goes the stones in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been exposed to the weather for a </v>

1255
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.830
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long time.</v>

1256
01:13:56.250 --> 01:14:00.240
<v Speaker 5>It's an earlier megalithic construction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what the dating is,</v>

1257
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:05.370
<v Speaker 5>but all of this you see is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is evidence that we will be using in our</v>

1258
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:08.730
<v Speaker 5>september one if we managed to flip for </v>
<v Speaker 5>budget together and do it,</v>

1259
01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 5>and there's a great history of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>building on top</v>

1260
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.790
<v Speaker 9>of ancient structures that the parthenon</v>
<v Speaker 9>and the acropolis,</v>

1261
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.490
<v Speaker 9>which doesn't get explained that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1262
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 9>nobody explains where those gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 9>stones came from and why they,</v>

1263
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:24.670
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how they got into place.</v>

1264
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 9>Massive,</v>
<v Speaker 9>monstrous stones.</v>

1265
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:32.430
<v Speaker 9>And so the other thing that you guys had</v>
<v Speaker 9>shown that I thought was really </v>

1266
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:35.551
<v Speaker 9>fascinating was that below ground when </v>
<v Speaker 9>you showed the really ancient </v>

1267
01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:38.680
<v Speaker 9>constructions,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a lot of them were uncovered.</v>

1268
01:14:38.681 --> 01:14:41.530
<v Speaker 9>A lot of them had to be dug out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They were,</v>

1269
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:45.730
<v Speaker 9>they were actually the ones that were </v>
<v Speaker 9>under the ground under the sand were the</v>

1270
01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.950
<v Speaker 9>ones that showed the earlier </v>
<v Speaker 9>construction methods,</v>

1271
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.560
<v Speaker 9>which is pretty obvious that much like </v>
<v Speaker 9>the sphinx,</v>

1272
01:14:50.561 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 9>when they first discovered it had been </v>
<v Speaker 9>taken over by saying this is.</v>

1273
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:56.320
<v Speaker 9>You're talking about really,</v>
<v Speaker 9>really ancient stuff.</v>

1274
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:57.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1275
01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this drinks is a bit different because </v>

1276
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 5>it's cut into a hollow in order to </v>
<v Speaker 5>produce this drinks.</v>

1277
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:06.250
<v Speaker 5>They had to carve clari the stone around</v>
<v Speaker 5>from it,</v>

1278
01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:09.730
<v Speaker 5>so once it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why they did that first place,</v>

1279
01:15:09.731 --> 01:15:12.100
<v Speaker 5>nobody really knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But once they did it,</v>

1280
01:15:12.101 --> 01:15:16.000
<v Speaker 5>once he turned too soon to desert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll leave it the 20,</v>

1281
01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:21.001
<v Speaker 5>25 years without sweeping it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it goes 30 right up to the neck </v>

1282
01:15:21.001 --> 01:15:21.001
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

1283
01:15:21.001 --> 01:15:21.170
<v Speaker 9>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1284
01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.130
<v Speaker 9>what,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who was responsible for cutting the face</v>

1285
01:15:24.131 --> 01:15:25.030
<v Speaker 9>into the sphinx?</v>

1286
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:26.390
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know.</v>

1287
01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.720
<v Speaker 5>We're convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're convinced that it was required </v>

1288
01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.330
<v Speaker 5>because it's much too small for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

1289
01:15:32.331 --> 01:15:36.170
<v Speaker 5>It's disproportionate to the body and </v>
<v Speaker 5>some way,</v>

1290
01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:41.770
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks in better shape for two </v>

1291
01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:41.770
<v Speaker 5>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

1292
01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:42.980
<v Speaker 5>it's a much harder outcrop of stone and </v>
<v Speaker 5>b,</v>

1293
01:15:42.981 --> 01:15:45.130
<v Speaker 5>it's been restored.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The head dresses and all of that.</v>

1294
01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.180
<v Speaker 5>If you look at old photos of the site </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken around 1900,</v>

1295
01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.970
<v Speaker 5>so you see that it's really much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>weather than it's looked,</v>

1296
01:15:52.971 --> 01:15:57.470
<v Speaker 5>but they prepared the face and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

1297
01:15:57.471 --> 01:16:00.620
<v Speaker 5>this has all kinds of repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

1298
01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:03.350
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the story,</v>

1299
01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:05.700
<v Speaker 10>the</v>

1300
01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:10.190
<v Speaker 5>we're doing the video Mark Lane or was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1301
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:13.960
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the loyal opposition as it were in the,</v>

1302
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:19.050
<v Speaker 5>in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the sphinx is supposed to look </v>

1303
01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:21.121
<v Speaker 5>like the pharaoh kopra.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's hadn't looked at least like the </v>

1304
01:16:21.121 --> 01:16:24.060
<v Speaker 5>federal kopra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but lana did an early computer study </v>

1305
01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.661
<v Speaker 5>when back in the eighties when computers</v>
<v Speaker 5>were still pretty primitive in which he </v>

1306
01:16:27.661 --> 01:16:31.741
<v Speaker 5>said kafra data into the paramed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry into the computer and then </v>

1307
01:16:32.891 --> 01:16:35.950
<v Speaker 5>superimposed the results upon the head </v>
<v Speaker 5>of this length and said,</v>

1308
01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:37.930
<v Speaker 5>well blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The swing says conference.</v>

1309
01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>last,</v>

1310
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.420
<v Speaker 5>this was sort of silly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it got a lot of press was in the New</v>

1311
01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.850
<v Speaker 5>York times and I think the smithsonian </v>
<v Speaker 5>all over the place.</v>

1312
01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:51.320
<v Speaker 5>So when we finally got the funding </v>
<v Speaker 5>together to do our mystery of the </v>

1313
01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.150
<v Speaker 5>swings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we really had to address that because it</v>

1314
01:16:52.151 --> 01:16:53.680
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1315
01:16:53.681 --> 01:16:56.940
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was well known and you know,</v>

1316
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.880
<v Speaker 5>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1317
01:16:57.881 --> 01:17:02.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been proved that this links is the </v>

1318
01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:02.881
<v Speaker 5>face of contra.</v>

1319
01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:02.881
<v Speaker 5>So how do you disprove it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1320
01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:07.350
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to actually use exactly the </v>

1321
01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:14.711
<v Speaker 5>same message of that lane or years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but seed elvis data into the computer </v>

1322
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:18.980
<v Speaker 5>and proved slinks was really meant to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>elvis.</v>

1323
01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.970
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we thought that was a cool idea.</v>

1324
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:28.420
<v Speaker 5>But what happened was that the elvis </v>
<v Speaker 5>foundation wouldn't let us use the </v>

1325
01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 5>king's emits in that context and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>elvis would have been furious.</v>

1326
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:36.860
<v Speaker 5>He would love to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what happened then was my,</v>

1327
01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:38.830
<v Speaker 5>my criminal partner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boris,</v>

1328
01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:41.360
<v Speaker 5>who was an interesting guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was an ex ex,</v>

1329
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:44.710
<v Speaker 5>a race driver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He drove for ferrari for years and lived</v>

1330
01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:46.700
<v Speaker 5>here for porsche.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was an interesting character.</v>

1331
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:48.790
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he came up with the idea of,</v>

1332
01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:53.791
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get a forensic detective to go </v>

1333
01:17:53.791 --> 01:17:54.990
<v Speaker 5>with us to Egypt to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1334
01:17:54.991 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 5>do a study of these places and see if </v>
<v Speaker 5>they really could be the same model,</v>

1335
01:17:58.521 --> 01:18:02.110
<v Speaker 5>the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same human being and so song.</v>

1336
01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:07.130
<v Speaker 5>Couple of phone calls and we got in </v>
<v Speaker 5>touch with a guy named frank domingo is </v>

1337
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:11.470
<v Speaker 5>the senior forensic detective from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>nyp ed and he came to Egypt with us and </v>

1338
01:18:11.931 --> 01:18:16.931
<v Speaker 5>this is more long story about how he got</v>
<v Speaker 5>frank to agree to go and he did his </v>

1339
01:18:16.931 --> 01:18:21.071
<v Speaker 5>study and charlotte unquestionably that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the toothpaste is could not possibly </v>

1340
01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.520
<v Speaker 5>have been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the question came up because when </v>

1341
01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.611
<v Speaker 5>you look at the profile of the strings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though it's pretty ruined us </v>

1342
01:18:30.611 --> 01:18:34.781
<v Speaker 5>because it's been severely damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though it was damaged,</v>

1343
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.390
<v Speaker 5>it's quite clear that not only is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>different face than that,</v>

1344
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 5>but it's probably a different race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

1345
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:46.240
<v Speaker 5>it really looks like the sub saharan </v>
<v Speaker 5>african place,</v>

1346
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:48.170
<v Speaker 5>not even like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not like an egyptian nice.</v>

1347
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:53.290
<v Speaker 5>Which would mean it was done by the new </v>
<v Speaker 5>orleans who took over Egypt libyans </v>

1348
01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:53.630
<v Speaker 5>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1349
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 5>from your spouse was the new orleans.</v>

1350
01:18:56.270 --> 01:19:01.270
<v Speaker 5>New orleans don't look like don't look </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same light as the sub saharan </v>

1351
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:06.670
<v Speaker 5>africans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So and in fact they leave Egypt taller.</v>

1352
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:10.520
<v Speaker 5>These jips egyptologists or prejudice </v>
<v Speaker 5>does everyone else.</v>

1353
01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 5>The last thing they want to know is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>notice that the snakes as,</v>

1354
01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:14.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

1355
01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:15.690
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

1356
01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:18.740
<v Speaker 5>as an african african and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in,</v>

1357
01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:21.620
<v Speaker 5>in the earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the 19th century,</v>

1358
01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.900
<v Speaker 5>lots of people just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1359
01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:28.901
<v Speaker 5>there was no egyptology then lots of </v>
<v Speaker 5>travelers because stuff's labelle and </v>

1360
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:36.430
<v Speaker 5>florence nightingale and all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who wrote very beautifully about </v>

1361
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:38.840
<v Speaker 5>Egypt traveling in Egypt than that in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the 19th century.</v>

1362
01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:39.950
<v Speaker 5>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1363
01:19:39.951 --> 01:19:44.951
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a negro I face and the leads of </v>

1364
01:19:44.951 --> 01:19:46.460
<v Speaker 5>tolerances to simply ignored that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1365
01:19:46.461 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with frank.</v>

1366
01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:52.160
<v Speaker 5>So he did this careful forensic study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's on my website.</v>

1367
01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:54.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually I should tell you something.</v>

1368
01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.540
<v Speaker 5>My website's [inaudible] dot com or.net</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1369
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.830
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in there somewhere.</v>

1370
01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:06.020
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we asked him about it that,</v>

1371
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:07.860
<v Speaker 5>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>know what do you think is,</v>

1372
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:12.240
<v Speaker 5>can this be an african place?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And domingo is a cautious.</v>

1373
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:13.230
<v Speaker 5>But he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1374
01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:18.231
<v Speaker 5>he said you can't prove that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is consistent with subsaharan </v>

1375
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:23.480
<v Speaker 5>subsaharan physiognomy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I'll actually with that was </v>

1376
01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:30.060
<v Speaker 5>actually my son's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1377
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.240
<v Speaker 5>my partner was very funny when he said </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's in like,</v>

1378
01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:37.800
<v Speaker 5>this is bad news for the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the academics is that not only.</v>

1379
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.390
<v Speaker 5>First of all it means that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1380
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:45.470
<v Speaker 5>there is an atlantis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't atlantis and second of all </v>

1381
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.470
<v Speaker 5>they will black.</v>

1382
01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:49.740
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

1383
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:55.100
<v Speaker 5>subsequently I did an op ed piece for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the New York times and I carefully left </v>

1384
01:20:55.711 --> 01:20:57.360
<v Speaker 5>out this old because this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1385
01:20:57.361 --> 01:21:01.140
<v Speaker 5>we want to go back there and do some </v>
<v Speaker 5>more work and I was in enough water with</v>

1386
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:06.141
<v Speaker 5>the academics to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't mention anything about this </v>

1387
01:21:06.141 --> 01:21:09.660
<v Speaker 5>sub saharan african swank's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a few weeks later the New York times</v>

1388
01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:14.720
<v Speaker 5>published a letter from a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an orthodontist and Massachusetts </v>

1389
01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:19.551
<v Speaker 5>orthodontist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the orthodontist is another expert </v>

1390
01:21:19.551 --> 01:21:19.860
<v Speaker 5>in facial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1391
01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.710
<v Speaker 5>in places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he came up with it,</v>

1392
01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 5>not as he came up with it and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1393
01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:26.430
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is an african face.</v>

1394
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.710
<v Speaker 5>So that was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now when we,</v>

1395
01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:33.770
<v Speaker 5>when we write our book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we write the shock and I get </v>

1396
01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:37.460
<v Speaker 5>cracking on the bridge of syrah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we will go into that and actually </v>

1397
01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:38.320
<v Speaker 5>interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1398
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:39.880
<v Speaker 5>track him down.</v>

1399
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:41.790
<v Speaker 5>I lives in newton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts,</v>

1400
01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:42.810
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1401
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:47.580
<v Speaker 5>the orthodontist who wrote that letter </v>
<v Speaker 5>and see what he has to say about it.</v>

1402
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:48.540
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>

1403
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:53.020
<v Speaker 5>that was an interesting thing about the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the head of the sinks,</v>

1404
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:58.030
<v Speaker 5>that it's not original to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the fates of the spanx because it's </v>

1405
01:21:58.711 --> 01:22:03.711
<v Speaker 5>much too small proportion of the body </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it seems to be a subsaharan african </v>

1406
01:22:04.981 --> 01:22:07.200
<v Speaker 5>phase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know when it was required.</v>

1407
01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:12.540
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the strengths snakes and we think </v>
<v Speaker 5>over 30,000</v>

1408
01:22:12.541 --> 01:22:17.541
<v Speaker 5>years old and it has to be required in </v>
<v Speaker 5>some period of time in between.</v>

1409
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:24.140
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it may be that that's like living in </v>

1410
01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:27.351
<v Speaker 5>Egypt at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the civilization of ease of </v>

1411
01:22:27.351 --> 01:22:27.351
<v Speaker 5>use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you get back far enough,</v>

1412
01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.240
<v Speaker 5>there's not much less than.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is why,</v>

1413
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the paleolithic caves,</v>

1414
01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:37.660
<v Speaker 5>he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll live with a bunch of caves but </v>

1415
01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.381
<v Speaker 5>nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know what anybody else was </v>

1416
01:22:39.381 --> 01:22:39.381
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Along comes,</v>

1417
01:22:39.381 --> 01:22:42.831
<v Speaker 5>go back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>locked up and suddenly the whole </v>

1418
01:22:42.831 --> 01:22:45.740
<v Speaker 5>everything changes because you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have this extraordinary structure that </v>

1419
01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:45.740
<v Speaker 5>they take the 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>bc,</v>

1420
01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:50.720
<v Speaker 5>so this comes up and it's very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 5>to create a detailed picture of what was</v>

1421
01:22:54.831 --> 01:22:55.700
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then</v>

1422
01:22:55.910 --> 01:23:00.910
<v Speaker 1>why are they doing work on the sphinx?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they like fixing the pause and </v>

1423
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 1>fixing the ears and are fixing the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>dress and all the different things that </v>

1424
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 1>they've done</v>

1425
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:09.040
<v Speaker 9>to the sphinx?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That seems to me to be very confusing.</v>

1426
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:14.041
<v Speaker 9>I mean you have this amazing ancient </v>
<v Speaker 9>structure and they're building on it to </v>

1427
01:23:14.041 --> 01:23:16.990
<v Speaker 9>like recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The toes of the lion and just seems very</v>

1428
01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:17.590
<v Speaker 9>odd to me.</v>

1429
01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:20.330
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is actually very odd.</v>

1430
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you get up next to it,</v>

1431
01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:26.120
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty crumbly and so and but </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1432
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:31.290
<v Speaker 5>the jury is still out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the repairing repairs are not </v>

1433
01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:35.291
<v Speaker 5>actually doing more damage than would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>done if they just left it to the </v>

1434
01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:37.190
<v Speaker 5>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what they are doing it and</v>

1435
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm very often they're doing it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a pretty botched up job.</v>

1436
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.710
<v Speaker 5>It looks terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1437
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:46.770
<v Speaker 5>it does mostly look pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like little pregnancy pregnancy </v>

1438
01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:48.130
<v Speaker 5>from the toes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1439
01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really.</v>

1440
01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.520
<v Speaker 5>It's really quite horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you see it's been repaired.</v>

1441
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:55.310
<v Speaker 5>The repair campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not just modern.</v>

1442
01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:59.900
<v Speaker 5>The earliest repair campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is another piece of the big puzzle.</v>

1443
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.260
<v Speaker 5>The earliest repair campaigns are old </v>
<v Speaker 5>kingdom.</v>

1444
01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.050
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time that the sphinx was,</v>

1445
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:11.350
<v Speaker 5>the time that the swing was supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 5>built,</v>

1446
01:24:11.351 --> 01:24:12.580
<v Speaker 5>it was already weathered.</v>

1447
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:17.950
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>isn't that part of the hieroglyphs </v>

1448
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.990
<v Speaker 9>involved in attributed to one particular</v>
<v Speaker 9>pharaoh's name,</v>

1449
01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:21.500
<v Speaker 9>that he fell asleep and he had a dream </v>
<v Speaker 9>that if he uncovered the sphinx,</v>

1450
01:24:21.501 --> 01:24:22.640
<v Speaker 9>he would control Egypt?</v>

1451
01:24:23.190 --> 01:24:24.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's tucked moses.</v>

1452
01:24:24.711 --> 01:24:25.990
<v Speaker 5>The third,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fourth,</v>

1453
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:32.630
<v Speaker 5>and in that tablet that stele there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>subsequently flaked off the first </v>

1454
01:24:35.361 --> 01:24:40.361
<v Speaker 5>syllable of kartra cop named cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And from that they,</v>

1455
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:46.470
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they reduced the extrapolated rather </v>

1456
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:48.260
<v Speaker 5>instead of will come from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>must've been the builder of the spanx.</v>

1457
01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.850
<v Speaker 5>But there's nothing that says that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1458
01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:54.851
<v Speaker 5>we think is that comfort was the repair </v>
<v Speaker 5>of this banks because even,</v>

1459
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:56.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mark laners,</v>

1460
01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.010
<v Speaker 5>the loyal opposition notes that when the</v>
<v Speaker 5>strengths was first repaired,</v>

1461
01:25:01.011 --> 01:25:04.130
<v Speaker 5>it was already,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's to its present condition.</v>

1462
01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.080
<v Speaker 5>and he nevertheless says that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1463
01:25:06.081 --> 01:25:07.570
<v Speaker 5>well the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1464
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:08.320
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1465
01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 5>the old kingdom blocks that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>repetitive.</v>

1466
01:25:11.621 --> 01:25:15.950
<v Speaker 5>It cannibalize from somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really a cockamamie explanation.</v>

1467
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:18.530
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>

1468
01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:23.620
<v Speaker 5>when you were playing in their arena and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't like what the evidence is,</v>

1469
01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:30.041
<v Speaker 5>they moved the goal posts and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't work well then they changed the </v>

1470
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:30.041
<v Speaker 5>rules of the game.</v>

1471
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:34.820
<v Speaker 9>Is it their contention?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Is the conventional contention that the </v>

1472
01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:37.350
<v Speaker 9>sphinx was carved with that face </v>
<v Speaker 9>originally?</v>

1473
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's even though it's way out of.</v>

1474
01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:46.010
<v Speaker 5>Even though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though it's even though it's much </v>

1475
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 5>too small proportionately and the rest </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the snakes is spectacularly accurate </v>

1476
01:25:50.881 --> 01:25:53.370
<v Speaker 5>proportionally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well not only that,</v>

1477
01:25:53.371 --> 01:25:58.371
<v Speaker 5>we're masters of proportion that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>stick with that because it's too </v>

1478
01:25:58.371 --> 01:26:03.081
<v Speaker 5>inconvenient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't until you've dealt with these </v>

1479
01:26:03.081 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 5>guys in other fields of science and </v>
<v Speaker 5>scholarship,</v>

1480
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:08.990
<v Speaker 5>but not much different people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly.</v>

1481
01:26:08.991 --> 01:26:11.520
<v Speaker 5>Men get very stubborn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

1482
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:12.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1483
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:17.510
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're upsetting the apple cart and they </v>

1484
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.510
<v Speaker 5>make a living selling apples.</v>

1485
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:21.380
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't make any sense to me is that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's completely discounting the actual</v>

1486
01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:26.381
<v Speaker 9>hard evidence of erosion.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's a very different level of </v>

1487
01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 9>erosion on the face than there is on the</v>
<v Speaker 9>rest of the body.</v>

1488
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:28.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's okay.</v>

1489
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.400
<v Speaker 5>Because that's a much harder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a much harder outcrop of </v>

1490
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.060
<v Speaker 5>limestone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's been fully exposed whenever it</v>

1491
01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:36.680
<v Speaker 5>was carved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fully exposed,</v>

1492
01:26:36.681 --> 01:26:39.760
<v Speaker 5>and it's not really whether that much </v>
<v Speaker 5>but more than it looks.</v>

1493
01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.380
<v Speaker 5>You look aT the old photographs you see </v>
<v Speaker 5>the back of the head.</v>

1494
01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.300
<v Speaker 5>it had been fairly severely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether,</v>

1495
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:46.730
<v Speaker 5>but nothing like the body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1496
01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:48.040
<v Speaker 5>That seems crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1497
01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:48.950
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1498
01:26:48.951 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 5>You have to go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got to come to Egypt with us.</v>

1499
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:53.140
<v Speaker 9>I would love to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm scared though.</v>

1500
01:26:53.170 --> 01:26:55.630
<v Speaker 9>It was scary right now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It wasn't a dangerous.</v>

1501
01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1502
01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.840
<v Speaker 5>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only if you're like trying to run it.</v>

1503
01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:01.890
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1504
01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.670
<v Speaker 5>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the prestitutes.</v>

1505
01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:09.671
<v Speaker 5>So it's not that they're lying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but only unrest is news.</v>

1506
01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.170
<v Speaker 5>So even under the worst of circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the revolution was going on,</v>

1507
01:27:15.171 --> 01:27:20.171
<v Speaker 5>I was after the entire revolution and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>refused to leave with the group that I </v>

1508
01:27:20.171 --> 01:27:21.050
<v Speaker 5>was with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lead through the aids,</v>

1509
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:23.030
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1510
01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.760
<v Speaker 9>why did you refuse to leave?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why did you refuse to leave?</v>

1511
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:31.130
<v Speaker 5>Because the government said we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to leave.</v>

1512
01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:33.030
<v Speaker 5>We said the hell with this wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

1513
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:35.930
<v Speaker 5>They're not after us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's see what happens.</v>

1514
01:27:35.931 --> 01:27:40.931
<v Speaker 5>So we waited a few days and the attacker</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the streets and little of that sort </v>

1515
01:27:40.931 --> 01:27:41.780
<v Speaker 5>of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's spelled the tear gas but nobody was</v>

1516
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 5>after us so we were a few places we </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't get to,</v>

1517
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.960
<v Speaker 5>but for the rest we have the time of our</v>
<v Speaker 5>lives because we were the only green </v>

1518
01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:55.250
<v Speaker 5>ngos in Egypt and it was quite an </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience when you used the crowds like</v>

1519
01:27:55.611 --> 01:27:59.840
<v Speaker 5>the superbowl to be there when the place</v>
<v Speaker 5>was empty and we didn't miss a couple of</v>

1520
01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:01.760
<v Speaker 5>places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we had this fantastic time.</v>

1521
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:06.820
<v Speaker 9>So many in the middle of the revolution </v>
<v Speaker 9>you're taking tours on and through the </v>

1522
01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:08.930
<v Speaker 9>sphinx and the temple man and all that.</v>

1523
01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't let him out after us.</v>

1524
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.830
<v Speaker 5>Happy to have us there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And wow,</v>

1525
01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:18.520
<v Speaker 9>that's a dude who's dedicated to Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 9>technology.</v>

1526
01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.970
<v Speaker 5>When you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again see at the,</v>

1527
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:26.980
<v Speaker 5>at the worst and the revolution that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about this,</v>

1528
01:28:26.981 --> 01:28:30.430
<v Speaker 5>there were a million people protesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a couple of different cities,</v>

1529
01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.650
<v Speaker 5>but if there are million people </v>
<v Speaker 5>protesting,</v>

1530
01:28:32.651 --> 01:28:34.960
<v Speaker 5>it means that there are 82 million </v>
<v Speaker 5>lawrence.</v>

1531
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:39.340
<v Speaker 5>so I have to do is not beat on tahrir </v>
<v Speaker 5>square.</v>

1532
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:42.760
<v Speaker 5>What was the protest going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's nowadays with cell phones,</v>

1533
01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:45.340
<v Speaker 5>it's very easy to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god,</v>

1534
01:28:45.341 --> 01:28:47.230
<v Speaker 5>that's hIlarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For us,</v>

1535
01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.680
<v Speaker 5>they like having us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were very sort were a source of </v>

1536
01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.470
<v Speaker 5>income themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still doing my trips actually and,</v>

1537
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:59.950
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not as easy to get them together </v>

1538
01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:00.010
<v Speaker 5>because I have to go through this </v>
<v Speaker 5>explanation all the time,</v>

1539
01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:03.570
<v Speaker 5>but this is the time to go there as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>running at about 20 percent.</v>

1540
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:08.190
<v Speaker 5>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Revolution is good for business.</v>

1541
01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:09.870
<v Speaker 5>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's terrible.</v>

1542
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:13.230
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible for business but for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good for the experience.</v>

1543
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:16.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And actually I um,</v>

1544
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:21.120
<v Speaker 5>in fact instead the next trip is in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next step is in october.</v>

1545
01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:23.360
<v Speaker 5>And I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1546
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:24.720
<v Speaker 5>you with your interest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1547
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:26.820
<v Speaker 5>you owe it to yourselves to get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt.</v>

1548
01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's the only ancient </v>

1549
01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:32.240
<v Speaker 1>ruins I've ever seen were mayan ruins </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cheech and eatsa.</v>

1550
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about as far as I've seen.</v>

1551
01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:39.850
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty impressive that Egypt is a </v>

1552
01:29:39.850 --> 01:29:41.270
<v Speaker 5>different kettle of civilization because</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know so much about it.</v>

1553
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well usually,</v>

1554

<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

1555

<v Speaker 1>I would unquestionably go with you a </v>

<v Speaker 1>my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All time.</v>

1558
01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:55.460
<v Speaker 1>My wife would come into the room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at me and go fucking Egypt again </v>

1559
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:58.380
<v Speaker 1>because I'd be sitting there watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this dvd series.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1564

<v Speaker 1>I just go back and watch it over again.</v>

1565

<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got to,</v>

1566
01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.000
<v Speaker 1>she got a little pissed off at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like enough stupid because I was</v>

1567
01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:17.010
<v Speaker 1>watching it in the bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1568
01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:20.160
<v Speaker 1>like she would come in and have to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>sphinxes and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>not to the extent.</v>

1571
01:30:25.231 --> 01:30:30.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very obsessive person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I first watched this </v>

<v Speaker 1>it's like disneyland.</v>

1600
01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.440
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean depends on the kids,</v>

1601
01:31:52.441 --> 01:31:57.340
<v Speaker 5>but that's not going to get anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's spelled 14.</v>

1602
01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.060
<v Speaker 5>They do get something out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can do is,</v>

1603
01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:02.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the egyptians love kids,</v>

1604
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 5>so you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wherever your hotel is,</v>

1605
01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:09.260
<v Speaker 5>you hire a nanny who plays with the kids</v>
<v Speaker 5>while we go out and looking.</v>

1606
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:13.600
<v Speaker 7>That's never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>

1607
01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:20.080
<v Speaker 7>let's talk about the temple and man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because that was one of the most </v>

1608
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.480
<v Speaker 7>fascinating things of that magical Egypt</v>
<v Speaker 7>series was how the egyptians,</v>

1609
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:28.770
<v Speaker 7>the construction wasn't just beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>IT wasn't just a functional art there,</v>

1610
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:34.320
<v Speaker 7>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a methodology to what they </v>

1611
01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.260
<v Speaker 7>were making were they were literally in </v>
<v Speaker 7>that one temple.</v>

1612
01:32:36.261 --> 01:32:41.261
<v Speaker 7>They neared the human body and explain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Explain that because it's really a </v>

1613
01:32:41.601 --> 01:32:46.601
<v Speaker 7>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like a tribute to the human </v>

1614
01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:46.601
<v Speaker 7>anatomy.</v>

1615
01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not only as a tribute to the human </v>

1616
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.880
<v Speaker 5>anatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's stronger de lubicz.</v>

1617
01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:58.010
<v Speaker 5>The great genius with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>unpronounceable name mean names mean a </v>

1618
01:32:58.101 --> 01:32:58.850
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

1619
01:32:58.851 --> 01:33:00.840
<v Speaker 5>einstein is a great name for a genius </v>
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

1620
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:05.870
<v Speaker 5>His name was manny plotnik.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one ever would have heard of a lot </v>

1621
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:09.890
<v Speaker 5>smaller and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The luggage was a genius scholar and he </v>

1622
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:14.030
<v Speaker 5>really was brilliant and he realized </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a gun.</v>

1623
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:16.910
<v Speaker 5>More long story if you're a serpent in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the sky and read my book.</v>

1624
01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:17.870
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have not.</v>

1625
01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:18.860
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1626
01:33:18.861 --> 01:33:20.500
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>start putting the sky.</v>

1627
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:23.570
<v Speaker 5>What's called In the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called surfing in the sky,</v>

1628
01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:26.360
<v Speaker 5>the high wisdom of ancient Egypt at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>center of copy.</v>

1629
01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:28.390
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1630
01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:33.530
<v Speaker 5>he realized as he was doing the work on </v>
<v Speaker 5>this on,</v>

1631
01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:35.750
<v Speaker 5>on Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the temple of luxor.</v>

1632
01:33:35.751 --> 01:33:38.810
<v Speaker 5>He had actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went to Egypt.</v>

1633
01:33:38.811 --> 01:33:43.811
<v Speaker 5>He was a very interesting men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>died in the early sixties and never met </v>

1634
01:33:43.811 --> 01:33:43.811
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

1635
01:33:43.811 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was a practicing alchemists,</v>

1636
01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:47.630
<v Speaker 5>many of those floating around these </v>
<v Speaker 5>days,</v>

1637
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:51.770
<v Speaker 5>but he went to Egypt because according </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the,</v>

1638
01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 5>and I only realized this quite recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought the opposite until quite </v>

1639
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.060
<v Speaker 5>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but see the,</v>

1640
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 5>the egyptian tradition percolated down </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the west and what are called the </v>

1641
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:10.460
<v Speaker 5>hermetic tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is astrology and magic and number </v>

1642
01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:13.460
<v Speaker 5>symbolism and neoplatonism and all bunch</v>
<v Speaker 5>of these other disciplines.</v>

1643
01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.640
<v Speaker 5>Never coherence as It needs it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and schwaller went to Egypt and 37 in </v>

1644
01:34:20.001 --> 01:34:25.001
<v Speaker 5>order to see if because they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the renaissance scholars,</v>

1645
01:34:26.601 --> 01:34:28.720
<v Speaker 5>people like jeff dunham,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brunello and capital,</v>

1646
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:33.750
<v Speaker 5>and all of them were convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they took it on trust that Egypt </v>

1647
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Was the founder of of wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The greeks agreed with that,</v>

1648
01:34:37.570 --> 01:34:42.570
<v Speaker 5>but nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see this stuff's supposed to </v>

1649
01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 5>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's supposed to have started with the </v>

1650
01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 5>greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but great stock,</v>

1651
01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:48.760
<v Speaker 5>most of what was consequential and more </v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate in their on their own </v>

1652
01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.620
<v Speaker 5>civilization from the egyptians and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're very open about it.</v>

1653
01:34:51.621 --> 01:34:56.621
<v Speaker 5>It's the modern day quack academics that</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to understand that because very </v>

1654
01:34:56.621 --> 01:34:59.300
<v Speaker 5>interesting book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>black asina,</v>

1655
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:05.290
<v Speaker 5>the aphrodisiac roots of greek </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization by a very fine cornell </v>

1656
01:35:05.971 --> 01:35:10.971
<v Speaker 5>scholar called martin burnout and </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically he proves that what we call </v>

1657
01:35:12.801 --> 01:35:17.801
<v Speaker 5>history is really a white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 5>eurocentric invention put together by </v>

1658
01:35:23.381 --> 01:35:24.850
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the ninth,</v>

1659
01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:29.860
<v Speaker 5>mainly by the 19th and early 20th </v>
<v Speaker 5>century historians because they were </v>

1660
01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:33.530
<v Speaker 5>determined to prove that real </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization began with the greeks.</v>

1661
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:36.530
<v Speaker 5>Because the greeks were swarthy little </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

1662
01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:41.531
<v Speaker 5>but light enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't egyptian or submitted or </v>

1663
01:35:41.531 --> 01:35:42.980
<v Speaker 5>black or anything like that.</v>

1664
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:45.160
<v Speaker 7>Or subsaharan african,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the spanx,</v>

1665
01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:48.730
<v Speaker 5>certainly not so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So really history as it's taught even to</v>

1666
01:35:48.731 --> 01:35:51.880
<v Speaker 5>this day is really a white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 5>con job.</v>

1667
01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.670
<v Speaker 7>So it really is possible that sub </v>
<v Speaker 7>saharan africans might've built all that</v>

1668
01:35:55.671 --> 01:35:56.060
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>

1669
01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.050
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1670
01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:58.820
<v Speaker 5>that could be.</v>

1671
01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:02.250
<v Speaker 7>They obviously built that face or or </v>
<v Speaker 7>likely built that thing.</v>

1672
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.550
<v Speaker 5>That's very likely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1673
01:36:04.551 --> 01:36:05.500
<v Speaker 5>can I take a break?</v>

1696
01:37:10.061 --> 01:37:15.061

<v Speaker 7>do with so much of why Egypt is so,</v>

1697
01:37:16.810 --> 01:37:19.540
<v Speaker 7>such a fascinating and mysterious </v>
<v Speaker 7>culture.</v>

<v Speaker 7>dvd series you can get and it's at no </v>

1699
01:37:25.241 --> 01:37:30.241
<v Speaker 7>one,</v>

1700
01:37:30.241 --> 01:37:31.150
<v Speaker 7>spent his whole life being obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 7>Egypt to produce something like this.</v>

1701
01:37:31.151 --> 01:37:34.630
<v Speaker 7>It's a real work of a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of passion and interest.</v>

1702
01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.180
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I've watched it like 100 times.</v>

1710
01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.840
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>

<v Speaker 7>amazon.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Sometimes they do that.</v>

1715
01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:06.120

<v Speaker 7>john,</v>

1749
01:39:30.571 --> 01:39:35.571
<v Speaker 7>when you went to get your vodka,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's one of my favorite all time dvd </v>

1750
01:39:35.571 --> 01:39:38.631
<v Speaker 7>series and it would take a guy like you </v>
<v Speaker 7>to put something like that together who </v>

1751
01:39:38.631 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 7>was such a work of passion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like very few people are going to put </v>

1752
01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 7>together eight dvds.</v>

1753
01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:44.380
<v Speaker 5>Who did that really see?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he,</v>

1754
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:47.770
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got it going and I supplied obviously</v>

1755
01:39:47.771 --> 01:39:51.610
<v Speaker 5>I supplied the egyptology and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>conferred on how to do it,</v>

1756
01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:55.910
<v Speaker 5>but he's single handedly produced it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shot it.</v>

1757
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:59.070
<v Speaker 5>It's really brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1758
01:39:59.290 --> 01:40:04.290
<v Speaker 5>as soon as it's done on a shoestring so </v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't look like a glossy nbc </v>

1759
01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:04.900
<v Speaker 5>production.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's beautiful.</v>

1760
01:40:04.930 --> 01:40:07.450
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm proud to have been a part of that,</v>

1761
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.880
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're partners,</v>

1762
01:40:09.881 --> 01:40:13.030
<v Speaker 5>but credit where credit is due.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean left to my own devices.</v>

1763
01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.490
<v Speaker 5>I know I could write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could write the script,</v>

1764
01:40:15.491 --> 01:40:17.440
<v Speaker 5>but I couldn't do the production.</v>

1765
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:20.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's really an amazing piece of work.</v>

1766
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:24.240
<v Speaker 5>Says well worth getting hold of and </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually on,</v>

1767
01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:27.360
<v Speaker 5>on the subject of putting this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

1768
01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:32.361
<v Speaker 5>I've been talking in any number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>occasions about us doing this.</v>

1769
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:37.570
<v Speaker 5>The next video they zipped happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dawn of civilization.</v>

1770
01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.050
<v Speaker 5>And actually I should mention this </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I,</v>

1771
01:40:42.051 --> 01:40:47.051
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a nonprofit foundation that we </v>

1772
01:40:48.121 --> 01:40:52.530
<v Speaker 5>set up with that 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the ancient wisdom foundation,</v>

1773
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.740
<v Speaker 5>but it's been since most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1774
01:40:56.741 --> 01:41:01.741
<v Speaker 5>people would contribute now and again we</v>
<v Speaker 5>use it for travel and research and that </v>

1775
01:41:01.741 --> 01:41:05.251
<v Speaker 5>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now we've got a really bright guy </v>

1776
01:41:05.251 --> 01:41:07.750
<v Speaker 5>contacted me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of the whole work and fascinated by</v>

1777
01:41:07.751 --> 01:41:12.220
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing and he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got the smarts and the drive to put</v>

1778
01:41:12.221 --> 01:41:15.970
<v Speaker 5>it all together and rebid the fly it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's now,</v>

1779
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:19.630
<v Speaker 5>it's now the website is under </v>
<v Speaker 5>construction,</v>

1780
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:25.110
<v Speaker 5>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're now looking to both micro finance </v>

1781
01:41:25.241 --> 01:41:27.880
<v Speaker 5>and macro finance this show.</v>

1782
01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.880
<v Speaker 5>And it's funny because it's been an idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>of mine for decades and now it's become </v>

1783
01:41:36.731 --> 01:41:38.830
<v Speaker 5>a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean years ago.</v>

1784
01:41:38.831 --> 01:41:42.790
<v Speaker 5>So I haven't devoted my entire life </v>
<v Speaker 5>through Egypt and these things because I</v>

1785
01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:47.350
<v Speaker 5>started out as a novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a playwright and a screenwriter and have</v>

1786
01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 5>a lot of things done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And actually,</v>

1787
01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:52.630
<v Speaker 5>I think you asked me this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I wandered off from the subject,</v>

1788
01:41:52.631 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 5>but as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a young kid,</v>

1789
01:41:54.521 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 5>how did I get into this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started out,</v>

1790
01:41:58.590 --> 01:42:03.590
<v Speaker 5>I realized what about the age of 12 or </v>
<v Speaker 5>13 that I was living in a lunatic </v>

1791
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:04.930
<v Speaker 5>asylum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone else called progress.</v>

1792
01:42:04.931 --> 01:42:09.100
<v Speaker 5>But I mean I knew it was madness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I couldn't put it together.</v>

1793
01:42:09.101 --> 01:42:12.970
<v Speaker 5>But by the time I was 19 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew what I wanted to do.</v>

1794
01:42:12.971 --> 01:42:17.460
<v Speaker 5>I knew I was in a lunatic asylum and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I wanted to be was I wanted to be a</v>

1795
01:42:17.461 --> 01:42:22.461
<v Speaker 5>little boy at the emperor has no clothes</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's what I started out writing </v>

1796
01:42:22.461 --> 01:42:22.461
<v Speaker 5>satire.</v>

1797
01:42:22.461 --> 01:42:24.580
<v Speaker 5>It's brutal satire plays and things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were done.</v>

1798
01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:29.840
<v Speaker 5>There might be money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to resuscitate some of that </v>

1799
01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:30.670
<v Speaker 5>stuff now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

1800
01:42:30.671 --> 01:42:31.930
<v Speaker 5>and then gradually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gradually,</v>

1801
01:42:31.931 --> 01:42:34.480
<v Speaker 5>gradually I understood that there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>another.</v>

1802
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:38.590
<v Speaker 5>The human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not always insane.</v>

1803
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:41.230
<v Speaker 5>And one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one music,</v>

1804
01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.680
<v Speaker 5>classical music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beethoven's quartets and month of these </v>

1805
01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:49.900
<v Speaker 5>vessels of 16 it's 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when I was in the army in </v>

1806
01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:49.900
<v Speaker 5>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 5>needless to say,</v>

1807
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:54.190
<v Speaker 5>list drafted my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I had a great time.</v>

1808
01:42:54.191 --> 01:42:58.850
<v Speaker 5>I was in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my one and only porsche for $2,400</v>

1809
01:42:58.851 --> 01:43:01.810
<v Speaker 5>from the factory talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1810
01:43:01.811 --> 01:43:03.040
<v Speaker 5>well that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those was.</v>

1811
01:43:03.850 --> 01:43:08.850
<v Speaker 5>And I remember driving as I was driving </v>
<v Speaker 5>to France and early,</v>

1812
01:43:09.851 --> 01:43:14.260
<v Speaker 5>it was a november all by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm early in the morning,</v>

1813
01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:18.310
<v Speaker 5>went to the cathedral of shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was absolutely empty.</v>

1814
01:43:18.311 --> 01:43:21.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is before there was any </v>
<v Speaker 5>traveled to europe and,</v>

1815
01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:24.190
<v Speaker 5>and I realized that it was an epiphany </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1816
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:29.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>however monstrous the church was and is </v>

1817
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:32.080
<v Speaker 5>somebody geniuses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>built this incredible structure.</v>

1818
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:37.590
<v Speaker 5>And then it took another few.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still didn't put it all together and </v>

1819
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:40.410
<v Speaker 5>took another few years before and by </v>
<v Speaker 5>this time I'd had my first short story </v>

1820
01:43:40.410 --> 01:43:41.880
<v Speaker 5>published and I was living in Spain on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the island,</v>

1821
01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:46.000
<v Speaker 5>but visa and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and gradually gradually understood,</v>

1822
01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:51.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was another side to this and then </v>

1823
01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:51.400
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1824
01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.320
<v Speaker 5>more complicated story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I got interested in the gurdjieff </v>

1825
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.681
<v Speaker 5>work and be so it would become old </v>
<v Speaker 5>touristed up and connected with my first</v>

1826
01:44:02.781 --> 01:44:05.450
<v Speaker 5>wife and we moved to england.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was an actress,</v>

1827
01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.220
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to get into the gurdjieff work </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're the first,</v>

1828
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.520
<v Speaker 5>the first nonfiction book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the case for astrology showed up and </v>

1829
01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.701
<v Speaker 5>that's how I got into smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's about the late sixties when I </v>

1830
01:44:18.701 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 5>got interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1831
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:23.921
<v Speaker 5>when I really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I really got interested in all of </v>

1832
01:44:23.921 --> 01:44:23.921
<v Speaker 5>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>

1833
01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:28.030
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1834
01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.060
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I always had this idea because I had</v>

1835
01:44:33.670 --> 01:44:36.500
<v Speaker 5>enough experiences with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1836
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:41.510
<v Speaker 5>with hollywood and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1837
01:44:41.631 --> 01:44:43.870
<v Speaker 5>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the film industry and,</v>

1838
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:48.170
<v Speaker 5>and even the apical side of things and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you know,</v>

1839
01:44:48.171 --> 01:44:53.171
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the producer's own you and to get </v>

1840
01:44:53.171 --> 01:44:56.861
<v Speaker 5>anything that's really original,</v>
<v Speaker 5>done the way that you wanted done is </v>

1841
01:44:56.861 --> 01:45:00.971
<v Speaker 5>next to impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I had this idea that somehow or </v>

1842
01:45:00.971 --> 01:45:03.260
<v Speaker 5>another micro financing projects of you </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't do it in those days.</v>

1843
01:45:03.261 --> 01:45:08.261
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are you going to send out a billion </v>

1844
01:45:08.261 --> 01:45:08.480
<v Speaker 5>mailings or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now with the,</v>

1845
01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:12.170
<v Speaker 5>with the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get to these huge databases.</v>

1846
01:45:12.710 --> 01:45:17.710
<v Speaker 5>And so and so now we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're putting in place a and micro </v>

1847
01:45:20.181 --> 01:45:24.500
<v Speaker 5>financing aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And actually I have,</v>

1848
01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.520
<v Speaker 5>I've always been good at thinking up </v>
<v Speaker 5>good marketing ideas and just never do </v>

1849
01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:29.520
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1850
01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.820
<v Speaker 2>well john just get on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to get on twitter and then get </v>

1851
01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:33.820
<v Speaker 2>a kickstarter accounts.</v>

1852
01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:35.210
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what we're doing,</v>

1853
01:45:35.290 --> 01:45:40.290
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to talk about it now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not yet a promise because we have </v>

1854
01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:42.170
<v Speaker 5>to make sure the lawyers that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>

1855
01:45:42.171 --> 01:45:45.440
<v Speaker 5>but we think it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We pretty sure it couldn't be illegal,</v>

1856
01:45:45.441 --> 01:45:50.441
<v Speaker 5>but we have a cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I came up with a really cool incentive </v>

1857
01:45:50.441 --> 01:45:53.780
<v Speaker 5>offer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is that if you put in,</v>

1858
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:58.490
<v Speaker 5>if you get on it for a $50 donation and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can split it,</v>

1859
01:45:58.491 --> 01:46:00.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys can put it in five each and one</v>

1860
01:46:00.831 --> 01:46:05.180
<v Speaker 5>of them is going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'S what you put in 50 bucks and that</v>

1861
01:46:05.181 --> 01:46:10.181
<v Speaker 5>buys you a ticket to effectively a </v>
<v Speaker 5>raffle.</v>

1862
01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.350
<v Speaker 5>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we get up to 50,000,</v>

1863
01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:17.860
<v Speaker 5>we got up to $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have the drawing and somebody wins a </v>

1864
01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:21.911
<v Speaker 5>free trip to Egypt with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we think that that's because I'm very</v>

1865
01:46:22.191 --> 01:46:23.960
<v Speaker 5>interested in getting to the young </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1866
01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.140
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1867
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:28.070
<v Speaker 5>people my age will mostly people my age </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

1868
01:46:28.071 --> 01:46:29.570
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

1869
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:34.570
<v Speaker 5>but I'm particularly interested in </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting this message to young people and</v>

1870
01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:36.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>50 bucks for some people is,</v>

1871
01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:42.340
<v Speaker 5>is a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it isn't really a lot of figure it </v>

1872
01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:42.340
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1873
01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:43.550
<v Speaker 5>what's 50 bucks?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's 10 beers that are not very good bar</v>

1874
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:45.430
<v Speaker 5>or a meal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The tool,</v>

1875
01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:47.960
<v Speaker 5>they're not very good restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1876
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:51.030
<v Speaker 5>anybody can figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't afford 60 bucks.</v>

1877
01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:55.260
<v Speaker 5>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're putting this into place and if you</v>

1878
01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:58.200
<v Speaker 5>do go online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the website is up already.</v>

1879
01:46:58.201 --> 01:47:00.840
<v Speaker 5>It's ancient wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient wisdom,</v>

1880
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:04.290
<v Speaker 5>ancient wisdom foundation.org.</v>

1881
01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Now when you go on these egyptian trips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long did they take</v>

1882
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:13.300
<v Speaker 5>the standard is now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's 15 or 16 days.</v>

1883
01:47:13.301 --> 01:47:14.580
<v Speaker 5>Door to door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1884
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:16.980
<v Speaker 5>That was really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm,</v>

1885
01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:20.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking what's going on now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those aren't all day long.</v>

1886
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:23.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talking for 15,</v>

1887
01:47:23.421 --> 01:47:25.340
<v Speaker 1>16 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1888
01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.890
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be exhauSting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1889
01:47:29.630 --> 01:47:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but it must keep you pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty sharp on egyptian history.</v>

1890
01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:39.640
<v Speaker 5>Will we?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only that actually gets that.</v>

1891
01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.320
<v Speaker 5>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see Egypt,</v>

1892
01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:49.850
<v Speaker 5>nobody in America has ever experienced </v>
<v Speaker 5>the real civilization,</v>

1893
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:55.390
<v Speaker 5>what we have progress,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we call it progress is the </v>

1894
01:47:55.390 --> 01:47:56.810
<v Speaker 5>antithesis of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is shiny barbarism.</v>

1895
01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.660
<v Speaker 5>And so Egypt is an eye opener and as I </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

1896
01:47:59.661 --> 01:48:01.110
<v Speaker 5>I came to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1897
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:06.310
<v Speaker 5>through arts and great sacred music and </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the shop.</v>

1898
01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:11.630
<v Speaker 5>and then suddenly I realized how </v>
<v Speaker 5>important this loves and along came </v>

1899
01:48:11.630 --> 01:48:15.580
<v Speaker 5>smaller and all of the study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what Egypt does is that it </v>

1900
01:48:18.021 --> 01:48:23.021
<v Speaker 5>introduced to them through the symbolist</v>
<v Speaker 5>symbolist interpretation which was </v>

1901
01:48:23.021 --> 01:48:27.880
<v Speaker 5>smaller de lubicz put together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>OTherwise it's just academic egyptology </v>

1902
01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:31.970
<v Speaker 5>kind of like angry actually because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've experienced this fabulous art.</v>

1903
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:37.310
<v Speaker 5>you get listened to all this bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's telling you that has no </v>

1904
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:38.120
<v Speaker 5>connection with what you've actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced.</v>

1905
01:48:38.650 --> 01:48:40.370
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so Egypt,</v>

1906
01:48:40.371 --> 01:48:45.371
<v Speaker 5>as I often start lectins all by saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt is like sex that gets everybody's </v>

1907
01:48:46.191 --> 01:48:47.960
<v Speaker 5>attention lives these like sex.</v>

1908
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:53.290
<v Speaker 5>Now you can read all about it and I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinda been fussing and you can look at </v>

1909
01:48:53.290 --> 01:48:54.200
<v Speaker 5>pictures and that's kind of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

1910
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:56.420
<v Speaker 5>Like until you've actually experienced </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1911
01:48:56.421 --> 01:49:01.421
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he ends up is like that once you're </v>

1912
01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.220
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it hits,</v>

1913
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:06.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's no mistaking about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1914
01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:12.120
<v Speaker 5>and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's to me it's very gratifying to be </v>

1915
01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:16.601
<v Speaker 5>able to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be the agency for allowing people to </v>

1916
01:49:16.671 --> 01:49:21.671
<v Speaker 5>have that experience and unfortunately I</v>
<v Speaker 5>had originally hoped to have a little </v>

1917
01:49:22.461 --> 01:49:27.461
<v Speaker 5>business where there are a handful of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who understand symbolist Egypt </v>

1918
01:49:27.461 --> 01:49:32.350
<v Speaker 5>well enough to retranSmit it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but actually I'm the only one who does </v>

1919
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:33.800
<v Speaker 5>these trips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one other person could.</v>

1920
01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:36.320
<v Speaker 5>very brilliant lady called normandy </v>
<v Speaker 5>ellis,</v>

1921
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:39.290
<v Speaker 5>but even that doesn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>intellectual rigor,</v>

1922
01:49:39.291 --> 01:49:40.940
<v Speaker 5>the mine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my stuff does.</v>

1923
01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:46.180
<v Speaker 5>So I'm almost the only show in town,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's very satisfying to me to be </v>

1924
01:49:47.951 --> 01:49:48.310
<v Speaker 5>able</v>

1925
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:52.660
<v Speaker 7>to be able to open this experience to </v>
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

1926
01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:57.900
<v Speaker 7>And also invariably the trips have very </v>
<v Speaker 7>interesting people on them with </v>

1927
01:49:59.081 --> 01:50:04.081
<v Speaker 7>expertise in a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of disciplines that are relevant to </v>

1928
01:50:04.081 --> 01:50:05.560
<v Speaker 7>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So no trip goes,</v>

1929
01:50:05.650 --> 01:50:10.650
<v Speaker 7>goes by without me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>without me learning a lot myself.</v>

1930
01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:16.860
<v Speaker 7>I mean I send sometimes very important </v>
<v Speaker 7>things so it doesn't get tiring and </v>

1931
01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:18.650
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a lot.</v>

1932
01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 7>It's physically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a lot of work,</v>

1933
01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.220
<v Speaker 7>but now I'm in pretty good shape for my </v>
<v Speaker 7>age.</v>

1934
01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:25.990
<v Speaker 7>John,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wanted to ask you a question about the</v>

1935
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.760
<v Speaker 7>more recent idea that perhaps the blocks</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the pyramid.</v>

1936
01:50:30.761 --> 01:50:35.761
<v Speaker 7>We're not cut from stone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but rather made out of a limestone </v>

1937
01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.480
<v Speaker 7>concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you?</v>

1938
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:39.100
<v Speaker 7>Are you familiar with these theories?</v>

1939
01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the video that's and that's been </v>

1940
01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.771
<v Speaker 5>looKed into like geologists and and it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's completely untenable and the video </v>

1941
01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:52.460
<v Speaker 5>should know better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a polymer scientist or something of</v>

1942
01:50:52.461 --> 01:50:56.330
<v Speaker 5>the sort.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shock has looked at this very carefully.</v>

1943
01:50:56.750 --> 01:51:01.750
<v Speaker 5>It would be as much work to pound the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stone into into powder and then put it </v>

1944
01:51:04.131 --> 01:51:09.131
<v Speaker 5>into molds and you see the stones are </v>
<v Speaker 5>all different sizes so you can't do it </v>

1945
01:51:09.131 --> 01:51:13.080
<v Speaker 5>that way and when you look at the stones</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see at the,</v>

1946
01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:16.610
<v Speaker 5>at the blocks that what's called a new </v>
<v Speaker 5>analytic limestone,</v>

1947
01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.460
<v Speaker 5>which has lots of little seashells in </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1948
01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:24.700
<v Speaker 5>Looking like the shelves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to let cockle shells and </v>

1949
01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:24.700
<v Speaker 5>they're all intact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's.</v>

1950
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:30.550
<v Speaker 5>It's a silly theory and on the surface </v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't sound on the surface.</v>

1951
01:51:32.190 --> 01:51:34.210
<v Speaker 5>It sounds as though it might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>convincing,</v>

1952
01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:35.920
<v Speaker 5>it was convincing enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody,</v>

1953
01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:40.921
<v Speaker 5>a friend of mine put together a panel of</v>
<v Speaker 5>geologists who don't have an ax to </v>

1954
01:51:40.921 --> 01:51:42.040
<v Speaker 5>grind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not as though there,</v>

1955
01:51:42.330 --> 01:51:46.310
<v Speaker 5>it's not as though they're egyptologists</v>
<v Speaker 5>are archeologists who have,</v>

1956
01:51:46.311 --> 01:51:46.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1957
01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:51.900
<v Speaker 5>have a stake in the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go there with an open mind to look </v>

1958
01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:51.900
<v Speaker 5>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And shock certainly does.</v>

1959
01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:52.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1960
01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:53.690
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not.</v>

1961
01:51:53.691 --> 01:51:56.060
<v Speaker 5>And it wouldn't be juSt as much work to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it when they're good,</v>

1962
01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:01.080
<v Speaker 5>it's the self says it will take a month </v>
<v Speaker 5>to produce a limestone blocks and cure </v>

1963
01:52:03.291 --> 01:52:05.600
<v Speaker 5>it well enough so that you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually use it.</v>

1964
01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:07.850
<v Speaker 5>so no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

1965
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:09.570
<v Speaker 7>So it's just silliness.</v>

1966
01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:12.350
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's incorrect and correct.</v>

1967
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:17.670
<v Speaker 5>Some things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some things as silly and then see the,</v>

1968
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.800
<v Speaker 5>the alternative side of the argument is </v>
<v Speaker 5>as irresponsible as the academic side,</v>

1969
01:52:24.981 --> 01:52:29.981
<v Speaker 5>because people get notions in their head</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's all built by alien could be </v>

1970
01:52:29.981 --> 01:52:30.280
<v Speaker 5>built.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My audience.</v>

1971
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:35.290
<v Speaker 5>I can't disprove that but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there is unwilling to let go of </v>

1972
01:52:36.531 --> 01:52:41.531
<v Speaker 5>their fantasies as the academics are </v>
<v Speaker 5>unwilling to let go of what are not </v>

1973
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:44.940
<v Speaker 5>fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But other times when they're incorrect,</v>

1974
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:50.770
<v Speaker 5>incorrectly develop theories has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>that all being in I've been round,</v>

1975
01:52:52.701 --> 01:52:57.140
<v Speaker 5>solidly disproved like people like </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves.</v>

1976
01:52:57.330 --> 01:52:57.910
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>john,</v>

1977
01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:00.850
<v Speaker 7>there's also an issue with the area </v>
<v Speaker 7>underneath.</v>

1978
01:53:00.851 --> 01:53:05.851
<v Speaker 7>One of the sphinx is pause that a </v>
<v Speaker 7>seismic charting has revealed that </v>

1979
01:53:07.481 --> 01:53:09.020
<v Speaker 7>there's some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1980
01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.570
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a room down there,</v>

1981
01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:11.460
<v Speaker 7>some sort of a,</v>

1982
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:15.870
<v Speaker 5>there is some sort of in the cavity or </v>
<v Speaker 5>chamber we don't know.</v>

1983
01:53:16.110 --> 01:53:17.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and edgar casey,</v>

1984
01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:20.190
<v Speaker 5>one of his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of his channels,</v>

1985
01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:22.560
<v Speaker 5>sessions of transits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever he called him,</v>

1986
01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:24.920
<v Speaker 5>said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the,</v>

1987
01:53:25.490 --> 01:53:30.490
<v Speaker 5>it was a chamber beneath this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the eight different descriptions </v>

1988
01:53:30.490 --> 01:53:34.701
<v Speaker 5>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but basically underneath one of the </v>

1989
01:53:34.701 --> 01:53:35.610
<v Speaker 5>flaws of the strengths that contained </v>
<v Speaker 5>the secrets of atlantis.</v>

1990
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.230
<v Speaker 5>Now our seismograph tells us that there </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1991
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:42.720
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a cavity there.</v>

1992
01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:45.180
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a question that comes up all</v>

1993
01:53:45.181 --> 01:53:47.250
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1994
01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:50.100
<v Speaker 5>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why can't they excavate?</v>

1995
01:53:50.101 --> 01:53:55.101
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're the geophysicists to did this work</v>

1996
01:53:56.081 --> 01:54:01.081
<v Speaker 5>of in shock was there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't get named becky who's a </v>

1997
01:54:01.081 --> 01:54:01.240
<v Speaker 5>geophysicist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1998
01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:04.210
<v Speaker 5>who does the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like an underground radiologists,</v>

1999
01:54:04.230 --> 01:54:04.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2000
01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:09.760
<v Speaker 5>the seismograph reading that to you or </v>
<v Speaker 5>me would be completely meaningless,</v>

2001
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:12.990
<v Speaker 5>like an x ray was meaningless to you or </v>
<v Speaker 5>made,</v>

2002
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:18.350
<v Speaker 5>but the radiologist continue a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>very precise information from an x ray.</v>

2003
01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:22.110
<v Speaker 5>So with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2004
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:25.700
<v Speaker 5>with a readout from the seismograph and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2005
01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:27.690
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2006
01:54:27.691 --> 01:54:30.840
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tom to becky sent from this,</v>

2007
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:34.080
<v Speaker 5>from the shape of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the read out.</v>

2008
01:54:34.890 --> 01:54:39.540
<v Speaker 5>It looks as though it is a chamber more </v>
<v Speaker 5>or less rectangular.</v>

2009
01:54:39.541 --> 01:54:43.300
<v Speaker 5>It's under about 15 feet of bedrock on </v>
<v Speaker 5>top of that.</v>

2010
01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:46.920
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there is actually a chamber with tom</v>

2011
01:54:46.921 --> 01:54:50.520
<v Speaker 5>didn't even know about behind the spanx,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a rough cut chamber.</v>

2012
01:54:50.521 --> 01:54:55.470
<v Speaker 5>There's a block and you pull a block </v>
<v Speaker 5>away and a little rope ladder.</v>

2013
01:54:55.471 --> 01:54:59.100
<v Speaker 5>You can go down into this rough cut </v>
<v Speaker 5>chamber where there's nothing and nobody</v>

2014
01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:02.430
<v Speaker 5>had been able to figure out who caught </v>
<v Speaker 5>it or why or when.</v>

2015
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:05.850
<v Speaker 5>But there is such chamber there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And on the,</v>

2016
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:11.870
<v Speaker 5>on the seismograph readout,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the this looks the same.</v>

2017
01:55:13.111 --> 01:55:18.111
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get certain colors and stuff like </v>

2018
01:55:18.111 --> 01:55:20.001
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks the same as what you get under </v>

2019
01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:22.290
<v Speaker 5>the sink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the becky who put his neck on the </v>

2020
01:55:22.290 --> 01:55:22.290
<v Speaker 5>line said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2021
01:55:22.290 --> 01:55:26.511
<v Speaker 5>this looks like consciously like there </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a chamber there.</v>

2022
01:55:26.791 --> 01:55:31.791
<v Speaker 5>The problem is getting in there because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's below what's now the water level,</v>

2023
01:55:34.711 --> 01:55:39.711
<v Speaker 5>the water table level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can't really excavate or you </v>

2024
01:55:39.711 --> 01:55:40.490
<v Speaker 5>would be an enormously difficult.</v>

2025
01:55:40.570 --> 01:55:43.710
<v Speaker 7>I go under water actually.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You go under water,</v>

2026
01:55:43.711 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 7>you mean</v>

2027
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.840
<v Speaker 6>as you drill?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do a dig into it.</v>

2028
01:55:45.841 --> 01:55:47.070
<v Speaker 6>You would actually go under water.</v>

2029
01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:51.720
<v Speaker 5>In theory you could flip down one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those little fiber optic cameras,</v>

2030
01:55:51.721 --> 01:55:56.721
<v Speaker 5>but if it's all water in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to see anything anyway </v>

2031
01:55:56.721 --> 01:56:00.300
<v Speaker 5>to actually excavate it would mean going</v>
<v Speaker 5>in there with,</v>

2032
01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:02.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with huge pumps pulling the water out as</v>

2033
01:56:02.611 --> 01:56:06.790
<v Speaker 5>fast as it came in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this thing says the stinks</v>

2034
01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:08.500
<v Speaker 6>be almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2035
01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:11.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm the sphinx is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be possible,</v>

2036
01:56:11.471 --> 01:56:13.450
<v Speaker 5>but it would be dangerous because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sinks,</v>

2037
01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:16.150
<v Speaker 5>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was in pretty rough shape as it is.</v>

2038
01:56:16.151 --> 01:56:18.270
<v Speaker 5>I meaN,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces fall off that all the time,</v>

2039
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:22.570
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it may be one of these days who knows</v>

2040
01:56:22.571 --> 01:56:27.571
<v Speaker 5>if the theory takes it takes root and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2041
01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:32.770
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2042
01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:37.800
<v Speaker 5>the powers that they realize that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not good pr among other things to try to</v>

2043
01:56:39.671 --> 01:56:42.070
<v Speaker 5>excavate it and see if there is anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2044
01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:47.820
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll stick with the geology and the </v>

2045
01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:47.820
<v Speaker 5>other pieces of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2046
01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:50.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't give an awful lot of thought to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2047
01:56:50.441 --> 01:56:53.260
<v Speaker 5>but the seismograph says there is </v>
<v Speaker 5>something there.</v>

2048
01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:53.680
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2049
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:57.920
<v Speaker 6>Have they detected any other </v>
<v Speaker 6>undiscovered ruins or any undiscovered?</v>

2050
01:56:57.921 --> 01:56:58.480
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2051
01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.890
<v Speaker 6>areas that they Would like to explore in</v>
<v Speaker 6>Egypt.</v>

2052
01:57:01.891 --> 01:57:04.380
<v Speaker 6>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do they pretty much have the entire area</v>

2053
01:57:04.381 --> 01:57:05.130
<v Speaker 6>mapped out?</v>

2054
01:57:08.370 --> 01:57:13.000
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a complex question.</v>

2055
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:17.730
<v Speaker 5>I haven't pretty well mapped out because</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I recently,</v>

2056
01:57:17.731 --> 01:57:19.800
<v Speaker 5>I forget the woman's name very </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

2057
01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:26.900
<v Speaker 5>The satellites flying over a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if it's infrared or </v>

2058
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:32.360
<v Speaker 5>something that gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's infrared photography </v>

2059
01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:35.130
<v Speaker 5>without that tells you if there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something underground,</v>

2060
01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:40.700
<v Speaker 5>but the photography only goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't go that deep,</v>

2061
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:42.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it goes 10,</v>

2062
01:57:42.031 --> 01:57:44.600
<v Speaker 5>15 feet something I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2063
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:47.700
<v Speaker 5>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we're correct,</v>

2064
01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:51.810
<v Speaker 5>if there is anything that's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely buried,</v>

2065
01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:56.240
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will be deeper than that and,</v>

2066
01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.560
<v Speaker 5>and celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the photographer,</v>

2067
01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:00.840
<v Speaker 5>the infrared,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>

2068
01:58:00.841 --> 01:58:04.950
<v Speaker 5>I think in the infrared,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't let him know about that,</v>

2069
01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:06.310
<v Speaker 5>but it ought to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2070
01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:08.190
<v Speaker 5>look what the spanx.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

2071
01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:11.340
<v Speaker 5>if the head we're not sticking above the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ground,</v>

2072
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:13.920
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't even know about it to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

2073
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:16.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's true,</v>

2074
01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:17.060
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2075
01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:18.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you wouldn't know.</v>

2076
01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:21.400
<v Speaker 5>It was just being sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then why would anyone bother?</v>

2077
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:23.700
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

2078
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:28.830
<v Speaker 5>with these different new technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>certainly ground penetrating radar and </v>

2079
01:58:28.830 --> 01:58:30.670
<v Speaker 5>seismographs will tell you if there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything there,</v>

2080
01:58:30.710 --> 01:58:35.710
<v Speaker 5>but they're expensive and not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got thousands of miles of desert </v>

2081
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:40.750
<v Speaker 5>and this is a slow process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas a flyover tells you a lot.</v>

2082
01:58:40.751 --> 01:58:42.670
<v Speaker 5>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know that there's,</v>

2083
01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:44.500
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's that,</v>

2084
01:58:44.501 --> 01:58:49.501
<v Speaker 5>there are lots of varied sites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if they're that close to the </v>

2085
01:58:49.501 --> 01:58:50.560
<v Speaker 5>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the chances that they,</v>

2086
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:55.660
<v Speaker 5>that they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to support the ancient,</v>

2087
01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:57.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we call it,</v>

2088
01:58:57.161 --> 01:59:02.161
<v Speaker 5>a lost civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hypothesis was not necessarily </v>

2089
01:59:02.621 --> 01:59:06.700
<v Speaker 5>commanding and from art for our </v>
<v Speaker 5>purposes,</v>

2090
01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't even matter because we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have enough to go by anyway.</v>

2091
01:59:11.741 --> 01:59:16.741
<v Speaker 5>I mean go back tap night and probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>this easter island stuff and the magical</v>

2092
01:59:17.411 --> 01:59:20.010
<v Speaker 5>bracelet and certain of the other things</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

2093
01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:25.140
<v Speaker 5>a megalithic sites in sardinia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I'm not to be believed and nobody </v>

2094
01:59:25.301 --> 01:59:26.540
<v Speaker 5>even knows about this.</v>

2095
01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:32.150
<v Speaker 5>A treasure trove of megalithic sites.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't,</v>

2096
01:59:32.151 --> 01:59:32.680
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2097
01:59:32.690 --> 01:59:37.690
<v Speaker 5>they didn't just invent sardines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This as this wonderful architecture </v>

2098
01:59:37.811 --> 01:59:42.811
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these huge beehive shaped stone </v>

2099
01:59:42.811 --> 01:59:44.890
<v Speaker 5>buildings that are really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we don't need that.</v>

2100
01:59:44.891 --> 01:59:47.140
<v Speaker 5>All we need is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all we need is the,</v>

2101
01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:51.780
<v Speaker 5>is the financing to do our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2102
01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:52.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do our,</v>

2103
01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:53.790
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

2104
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:58.930
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our followup to the mystery of the </v>

2105
01:59:58.930 --> 01:59:58.930
<v Speaker 5>slangs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And ideally what we want to do really is</v>

2106
01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:02.860
<v Speaker 5>to get it into the theaters and then go </v>
<v Speaker 5>into tv.</v>

2107
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:04.990
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

2108
02:00:05.630 --> 02:00:07.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the web and all of that stuff,</v>

2109
02:00:07.930 --> 02:00:08.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2110
02:00:08.110 --> 02:00:11.530
<v Speaker 6>Well you see if something has a high </v>
<v Speaker 6>impact,</v>

2111
02:00:11.531 --> 02:00:16.531
<v Speaker 6>but if you see a lot of the video,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like viral videos that have been </v>

2112
02:00:16.531 --> 02:00:21.001
<v Speaker 6>released online that have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 6>millions and millions and millions of </v>

2113
02:00:21.001 --> 02:00:25.530
<v Speaker 6>viewers just by word of mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really think that video on demand as </v>

2114
02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:26.950
<v Speaker 6>well as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as another great option.</v>

2115
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:31.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a great option.</v>

2116
02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:34.610
<v Speaker 5>The problem of course is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you must know this,</v>

2117
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:36.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you have ads on,</v>

2118
02:00:36.590 --> 02:00:37.190
<v Speaker 5>on the show?</v>

2119
02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:38.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we do.</v>

2120
02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The ones that we know,</v>

2121
02:00:40.930 --> 02:00:45.930
<v Speaker 6>you don't see any ads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we just do them at the beginning of the </v>

2122
02:00:45.930 --> 02:00:45.930
<v Speaker 6>broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the fleshlight add on the,</v>

2123
02:00:45.930 --> 02:00:48.890
<v Speaker 6>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the nootropics ad does.</v>

2124
02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:51.090
<v Speaker 6>Those are the ones that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We do those and that's it.</v>

2125
02:00:51.091 --> 02:00:56.091
<v Speaker 6>And then we have some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's some other sponsors that we're </v>

2126
02:00:56.091 --> 02:00:56.760
<v Speaker 6>working with in the near future,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're all done just by me talking.</v>

2127
02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:58.170
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2128
02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean because I'm blabbering on here </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever and there's no ads.</v>

2129
02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:02.290
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't have to have ads.</v>

2130
02:01:02.291 --> 02:01:03.820
<v Speaker 6>We don't have to break any of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation now.</v>

2131
02:01:03.850 --> 02:01:06.460
<v Speaker 6>That's the beautiful thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We get it over with him beginning.</v>

2132
02:01:06.670 --> 02:01:11.670
<v Speaker 6>We mentioned the the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We thank the sponsors again at the end </v>

2133
02:01:11.670 --> 02:01:14.281
<v Speaker 6>and it'll allows a full two hour </v>
<v Speaker 6>intensive conversation and especially </v>

2134
02:01:14.281 --> 02:01:17.260
<v Speaker 6>something about ancient Egypt I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>demands that it's such a.</v>

2135
02:01:17.261 --> 02:01:22.261
<v Speaker 6>It's such a complex sort of a situation </v>
<v Speaker 6>to try to figure out how the </v>

2136
02:01:22.261 --> 02:01:25.630
<v Speaker 6>conventional wisdom is saying that when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when did they believe languages invented</v>

2137
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:26.770
<v Speaker 6>about 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago,</v>

2138
02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:28.000
<v Speaker 6>something along those lines.</v>

2139
02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:30.210
<v Speaker 5>They don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just guesswork.</v>

2140
02:01:30.211 --> 02:01:35.211
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really is guesswork when you get </v>

2141
02:01:35.211 --> 02:01:37.851
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the only thing that you couldn't </v>

2142
02:01:37.851 --> 02:01:40.191
<v Speaker 5>see couldn't say as a trend is that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>more they study,</v>

2143
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:48.040
<v Speaker 5>the further back everything goes and not</v>
<v Speaker 5>only the further back in terms of time </v>

2144
02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:52.980
<v Speaker 5>with a further back in time in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sophistication and see.</v>

2145
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:57.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean actually look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go beckley cafe,</v>

2146
02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:59.720
<v Speaker 5>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I hope,</v>

2147
02:02:00.110 --> 02:02:05.110
<v Speaker 5>I hope you find some photos to or I'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>send them to you so to intersperse with </v>

2148
02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:10.570
<v Speaker 5>with this talk so that people can </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually see what else?</v>

2149
02:02:10.630 --> 02:02:15.630
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of people google along </v>

2150
02:02:15.630 --> 02:02:17.531
<v Speaker 6>with the show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's probably what a lot of people </v>

2151
02:02:17.531 --> 02:02:17.531
<v Speaker 6>are doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but go back</v>

2152
02:02:17.531 --> 02:02:17.531
<v Speaker 5>still if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2153
02:02:17.531 --> 02:02:18.670
<v Speaker 5>that's fine too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2154
02:02:19.090 --> 02:02:22.930
<v Speaker 5>so I mean with god beckley tat they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about 10,000</v>

2155
02:02:22.931 --> 02:02:27.931
<v Speaker 5>bc now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's five times the span of time from </v>

2156
02:02:28.661 --> 02:02:32.270
<v Speaker 5>jesus and julius caesar to us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty crazy.</v>

2157
02:02:33.850 --> 02:02:35.680
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wrap your head around that</v>

2158
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:36.850
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Day.</v>

2159
02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:40.510
<v Speaker 5>The cave that she'll bang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's $30,000.</v>

2160
02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:44.830
<v Speaker 5>That's three times the time from going </v>
<v Speaker 5>back from attempt.</v>

2161
02:02:45.730 --> 02:02:50.730
<v Speaker 5>So you'll see it means that we have this</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally skewed vision of our human </v>

2162
02:02:53.321 --> 02:02:56.370
<v Speaker 5>civilization and of ourselves basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2163
02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:59.080
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Asylum is not,</v>

2164
02:02:59.410 --> 02:03:02.980
<v Speaker 5>it's not civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who in their right mind would invent the</v>

2165
02:03:02.981 --> 02:03:07.981
<v Speaker 5>bobble head doll put on american idol or</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality shows this is insanity.</v>

2166
02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:17.190
<v Speaker 6>It isn't insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a channel a division achieved </v>

2167
02:03:17.190 --> 02:03:17.800
<v Speaker 6>and incredibly high technological level </v>
<v Speaker 6>of success.</v>

2168
02:03:18.490 --> 02:03:23.490
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems to be a technology of a </v>

2169
02:03:23.490 --> 02:03:24.280
<v Speaker 6>civilization as opposed to what Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

2170
02:03:24.610 --> 02:03:26.980
<v Speaker 6>which was we don't know.</v>

2171
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:32.550
<v Speaker 5>That's what makes traveling there so </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting because they also had a </v>

2172
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:37.411
<v Speaker 5>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean in certain cases we couldn't </v>

2173
02:03:37.411 --> 02:03:41.160
<v Speaker 5>build the pyramids or maybe we could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it would would probably be more </v>

2174
02:03:43.001 --> 02:03:48.001
<v Speaker 5>expensive than a than a space program </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they did it evidently with these</v>

2175
02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:55.560
<v Speaker 6>and they did it in an era where we don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>even attribute them to having metal </v>

2176
02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:58.951
<v Speaker 6>tools.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had bras that are not even the </v>

2177
02:03:58.951 --> 02:03:58.951
<v Speaker 6>hopper</v>

2178
02:03:58.951 --> 02:04:00.830
<v Speaker 5>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2179
02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:06.350
<v Speaker 5>to me there's not much emotional impact </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the bottle.</v>

2180
02:04:06.351 --> 02:04:11.351
<v Speaker 5>Had dull where disney land for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter and if you walk into the egyptian</v>

2181
02:04:14.481 --> 02:04:19.481
<v Speaker 5>temples and then this happens on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>trips all the time because I just said </v>

2182
02:04:19.481 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 5>it's like sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't tell you the experience that </v>

2183
02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 5>you really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let us,</v>

2184
02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:27.491
<v Speaker 5>like we go into these temples and on my </v>
<v Speaker 5>trips now it's easy business practically</v>

2185
02:04:28.791 --> 02:04:33.791
<v Speaker 5>notes or isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But otherwise I go to a lot of trouble </v>

2186
02:04:33.791 --> 02:04:36.941
<v Speaker 5>to figure out when to go to places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the relatively people in there,</v>

2187
02:04:38.650 --> 02:04:39.820
<v Speaker 5>because it's important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2188
02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:44.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like trying to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 5>beethoven's ninth symphony and in the </v>

2189
02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.390
<v Speaker 5>super bowl you can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2190
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:49.770
<v Speaker 5>so if you get there and you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>replaced more or less to yourself,</v>

2191
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:55.310
<v Speaker 5>the emotional impact of these things is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is Breathtaking and I felt bad.</v>

2192
02:04:56.810 --> 02:05:00.300
<v Speaker 5>You don't get that from walmart's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2193
02:05:00.330 --> 02:05:05.330
<v Speaker 5>obviously not just garbage that goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a faCt that are obsessed with </v>

2194
02:05:07.561 --> 02:05:12.270
<v Speaker 5>technological rubbish and violence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So of course we stupid vitamins.</v>

2195
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:16.010
<v Speaker 6>Our setup is obviously very different </v>
<v Speaker 6>than theirs,</v>

2196
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:18.540
<v Speaker 6>but we imagine ourselves to be the more </v>
<v Speaker 6>advanced.</v>

2197
02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:21.690
<v Speaker 6>It just that they don't have tv.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we were like,</v>

2198
02:05:21.691 --> 02:05:23.010
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were fucking idiots,</v>

2199
02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't have the internet were like,</v>

2200
02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:30.051
<v Speaker 6>well they were an advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but meanwhile they're capable of these </v>

2201
02:05:30.051 --> 02:05:33.920
<v Speaker 6>massive constructions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to ask you about the </v>

2202
02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:34.110
<v Speaker 6>sarcophagus in the king's chamber and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2203
02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:39.111
<v Speaker 6>the evidence that it had been made with </v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a high speed diamond bit </v>

2204
02:05:39.111 --> 02:05:39.120
<v Speaker 6>drill.</v>

2205
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:41.160
<v Speaker 5>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2206
02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:45.210
<v Speaker 5>that's kristen's theory that we talked </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

2207
02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:48.420
<v Speaker 5>I mentioned kristen before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well we don't know.</v>

2208
02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:51.480
<v Speaker 5>Chris has seen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chris has to be,</v>

2209
02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:57.570
<v Speaker 5>he's not a new age for my his stepson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's talk to that.</v>

2210
02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:02.580
<v Speaker 5>It's very good composer and he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about all of the new age music </v>

2211
02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:07.050
<v Speaker 5>and and the the album covers and he said</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all a bunch of airbrushed unicorns </v>

2212
02:06:07.050 --> 02:06:12.020
<v Speaker 5>and that's become a metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have to the far out new </v>

2213
02:06:13.021 --> 02:06:16.230
<v Speaker 5>age kind of way of looking at bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

2214
02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:21.680
<v Speaker 5>but chris is not a nEw age kind of guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's his field and he know he </v>

2215
02:06:26.551 --> 02:06:31.551
<v Speaker 5>interprets it that way except as no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With all of the stuff that we've </v>

2216
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:36.240
<v Speaker 5>discovered in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no evidence whatsoever of having</v>

2217
02:06:36.241 --> 02:06:37.950
<v Speaker 5>that kind of technology.</v>

2218
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:41.810
<v Speaker 6>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of the lost civilization is the</v>

2219
02:06:41.811 --> 02:06:44.820
<v Speaker 6>idea that graham hanCock's idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

2220
02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:49.900
<v Speaker 6>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a missing error that we can't </v>

2221
02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:49.900
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When.</v>

2222
02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:52.520
<v Speaker 6>When do you belIeve that took place in </v>
<v Speaker 6>relation to the timeline of Egypt?</v>

2223
02:06:52.730 --> 02:06:57.730
<v Speaker 6>When was all the information or a good </v>
<v Speaker 6>chunk of it last and they had to start </v>

2224
02:06:57.730 --> 02:06:57.860
<v Speaker 6>from scratch?</v>

2225
02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:03.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know because you see there's </v>

2226
02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:04.860
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not lots with scattered around </v>

2227
02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.750
<v Speaker 5>so that you can say maybe it was never </v>
<v Speaker 5>lost.</v>

2228
02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:11.430
<v Speaker 5>The was never manifested in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>spectacular architecture.</v>

2229
02:07:11.730 --> 02:07:15.120
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was telling me before about the,</v>

2230
02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:20.160
<v Speaker 5>the red pyramid of does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure that's built over a ruinous </v>

2231
02:07:20.190 --> 02:07:25.190
<v Speaker 5>negativistic structure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that megalithic structure is pretty </v>

2232
02:07:25.190 --> 02:07:26.220
<v Speaker 5>considerable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of like new grange and certain</v>

2233
02:07:26.221 --> 02:07:27.210
<v Speaker 5>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the,</v>

2234
02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:31.680
<v Speaker 5>of the megalithic structures in england </v>
<v Speaker 5>and scotland and wales,</v>

2235
02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:33.990
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not nothing.</v>

2236
02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:39.380
<v Speaker 5>and then this strange stone circle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty ruinous called supplier and a b </v>

2237
02:07:44.311 --> 02:07:47.180
<v Speaker 5>t,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a p l a y in,</v>

2238
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:52.750
<v Speaker 5>in south western Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>west of abu simbel.</v>

2239
02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:56.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm not far from the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the Sudan border.</v>

2240
02:07:57.190 --> 02:08:00.340
<v Speaker 5>Now this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't look like much,</v>

2241
02:08:00.730 --> 02:08:05.730
<v Speaker 5>but even the academics acknowledged that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's astronomically oriented and there's</v>

2242
02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:08.830
<v Speaker 5>a lot about it that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2243
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:10.150
<v Speaker 5>that puts his date.</v>

2244
02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:14.350
<v Speaker 5>They dated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they academics data to about 6,000</v>

2245
02:08:14.351 --> 02:08:15.550
<v Speaker 5>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2246
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:21.000
<v Speaker 5>astronomically oriented in 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>bc means already that it's investigated.</v>

2247
02:08:22.070 --> 02:08:25.900
<v Speaker 5>That's astronomy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not supposed to have this fun of me back</v>

2248
02:08:25.901 --> 02:08:28.520
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then is an interesting guy.</v>

2249
02:08:28.521 --> 02:08:31.230
<v Speaker 5>He's a friend of mine and physicists </v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2250
02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:36.360
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>archeo astronomer who looks at the </v>

2251
02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:39.841
<v Speaker 5>evidence and interpret it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>interprets it in a much more </v>

2252
02:08:39.841 --> 02:08:42.821
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated ignatian that there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are indications there were at </v>

2253
02:08:42.821 --> 02:08:47.341
<v Speaker 5>least there they are referring back to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>time of about $16,000</v>

2254
02:08:49.551 --> 02:08:50.320
<v Speaker 5>or so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bc,</v>

2255
02:08:50.321 --> 02:08:55.321
<v Speaker 5>even though the sun circle itself </v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfactorily dates to about 6,000</v>

2256
02:08:56.351 --> 02:08:57.820
<v Speaker 5>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we go to the,</v>

2257
02:08:57.821 --> 02:09:01.300
<v Speaker 5>go back leads epi and we'd go to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bracelet and I were talking 10,000</v>

2258
02:09:01.301 --> 02:09:03.910
<v Speaker 5>bc and the bracelet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking 8,000</v>

2259
02:09:03.911 --> 02:09:05.710
<v Speaker 5>bc and it shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2260
02:09:05.711 --> 02:09:09.020
<v Speaker 5>these fabulous paintings of horses and </v>
<v Speaker 5>rhinoceros.</v>

2261
02:09:09.021 --> 02:09:13.000
<v Speaker 5>This isn't a bears and lions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's 31,000</v>

2262
02:09:13.001 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 5>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how much do you need?</v>

2263
02:09:16.331 --> 02:09:18.040
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're probably living in tents.</v>

2264
02:09:18.041 --> 02:09:23.041
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they certainly weren't living in </v>

2265
02:09:23.041 --> 02:09:25.381
<v Speaker 5>condos but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they had this knowledge and this </v>

2266
02:09:25.381 --> 02:09:29.750
<v Speaker 5>artistry at their disposal and they had </v>
<v Speaker 5>it out a fantastically early time.</v>

2267
02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:33.300
<v Speaker 9>So we just don't know when they lost all</v>
<v Speaker 9>this stuff.</v>

2268
02:09:33.330 --> 02:09:36.060
<v Speaker 9>We don't know when the egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 9>civilization either,</v>

2269
02:09:36.061 --> 02:09:41.061
<v Speaker 9>whether it was a slow erosion,</v>
<v Speaker 9>whether it was a massive decline and </v>

2270
02:09:41.061 --> 02:09:43.170
<v Speaker 9>somehow or another it sort of coincides </v>
<v Speaker 9>with the end of the last ice age.</v>

2271
02:09:43.171 --> 02:09:44.670
<v Speaker 9>Is that a.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Is that a fact as well?</v>

2272
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:48.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well we think yes.</v>

2273
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:53.700
<v Speaker 5>Because that's when the sea levels rose </v>
<v Speaker 5>300 seat and I mean it's,</v>

2274
02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:58.740
<v Speaker 5>it's a chaotic time then that's when all</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the madness and the will he run our </v>

2275
02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:00.640
<v Speaker 5>services and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have that go extinct.</v>

2276
02:10:00.970 --> 02:10:05.970
<v Speaker 5>So and shark actually have some very </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting,</v>

2277
02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:11.400
<v Speaker 5>very interesting theories about not just</v>
<v Speaker 5>shot and other people about what made it</v>

2278
02:10:11.621 --> 02:10:14.620
<v Speaker 5>go extinct and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe some sort of a plasma strike,</v>

2279
02:10:14.621 --> 02:10:19.621
<v Speaker 5>like a gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some type of event is pretty good </v>

2280
02:10:19.621 --> 02:10:20.510
<v Speaker 5>evidence for this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

2281
02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:24.800
<v Speaker 5>it disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sinks,</v>

2282
02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:28.150
<v Speaker 5>the sinks and go back to happy maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>after that.</v>

2283
02:10:28.151 --> 02:10:32.650
<v Speaker 5>But if this links is earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the,</v>

2284
02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.740
<v Speaker 5>one of the objections we always had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice,</v>

2285
02:10:36.741 --> 02:10:41.741
<v Speaker 5>well how could this be the evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this amazing early civilization and </v>

2286
02:10:41.741 --> 02:10:42.410
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2287
02:10:42.411 --> 02:10:44.960
<v Speaker 5>there is something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's lots of other stuff.</v>

2288
02:10:45.110 --> 02:10:47.290
<v Speaker 5>A lot of weathering and things of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature and nature,</v>

2289
02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:48.960
<v Speaker 5>but not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not much of it.</v>

2290
02:10:48.970 --> 02:10:51.520
<v Speaker 5>Spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go back to the tap tap.</v>

2291
02:10:51.890 --> 02:10:54.710
<v Speaker 11>That's spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So we don't know.</v>

2292
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:59.830
<v Speaker 11>Are there hieroglyphs that detail?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Any of the construction methods that </v>

2293
02:10:59.830 --> 02:11:00.200
<v Speaker 11>were used</v>

2294
02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.680
<v Speaker 5>a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2295
02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:04.840
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's one,</v>

2296
02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:10.680
<v Speaker 5>there's one wall reliefs in nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do with pyramids.</v>

2297
02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:14.890
<v Speaker 5>Know absolutely nothing and nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do with these things.</v>

2298
02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:18.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean the egyptians disks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are blessed.</v>

2299
02:11:20.210 --> 02:11:25.210
<v Speaker 11>Nothing spectacular too.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's something a lot of people aren't </v>

2300
02:11:25.210 --> 02:11:25.360
<v Speaker 11>even aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 11>How spectacular those are.</v>

2301
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:27.490
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there are plenty of spectacular.</v>

2302
02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.040
<v Speaker 5>There's one relief in the temple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eventful,</v>

2303
02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:37.230
<v Speaker 5>which is a very late ptolemaic sample of</v>
<v Speaker 5>between 250 vc,</v>

2304
02:11:37.950 --> 02:11:39.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into roman times,</v>

2305
02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:44.840
<v Speaker 5>built in stages that shows the pharaoh </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a rope around an obelisk sort of </v>

2306
02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:51.920
<v Speaker 5>pulling it up into position by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not meant to be taken literally,</v>

2307
02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:56.840
<v Speaker 5>unless it's a very small obsolescence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it needs to say is like it gets.</v>

2308
02:11:56.841 --> 02:12:01.841
<v Speaker 5>So when you see evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't necessarily like stare in there </v>

2309
02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:07.050
<v Speaker 5>on the temple walls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Love.</v>

2310
02:12:07.051 --> 02:12:12.051
<v Speaker 5>You can't really ignore it just because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to believe that the aliens </v>

2311
02:12:12.051 --> 02:12:15.561
<v Speaker 5>built everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's the pharaoh pulling the </v>

2312
02:12:15.821 --> 02:12:18.390
<v Speaker 5>obelisk up when there's a theory </v>
<v Speaker 5>developed.</v>

2313
02:12:18.570 --> 02:12:21.180
<v Speaker 5>It's the one favored by the politics at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the moment.</v>

2314
02:12:21.181 --> 02:12:23.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean even they can't be wrong all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2315
02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:29.180
<v Speaker 5>And a bio needs of technologists named a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lobbying.</v>

2316
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:31.740
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2317
02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:36.780
<v Speaker 5>which talks about how they take these </v>
<v Speaker 5>obelisks which way?</v>

2318
02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:40.080
<v Speaker 5>Hundreds of tons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They somehow get them out of the quarry.</v>

2319
02:12:40.290 --> 02:12:43.290
<v Speaker 5>This is really in words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

2320
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:45.840
<v Speaker 5>When we were in Egypt and you're at </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's called,</v>

2321
02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:49.800
<v Speaker 5>it's called the unfinished obelisk in </v>
<v Speaker 5>aswan,</v>

2322
02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:55.100
<v Speaker 5>and here's this block of stone that were</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulling out of the rock and they didn't </v>

2323
02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.240
<v Speaker 5>make it for interesting reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 5>develop the fault line,</v>

2324
02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:01.380
<v Speaker 5>but had they got this block of stone out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the bedrock,</v>

2325
02:13:01.710 --> 02:13:05.790
<v Speaker 5>it would've weighed 1200 tons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big stone.</v>

2326
02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:11.180
<v Speaker 5>And somehow in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've got an out of the quarry and </v>

2327
02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:14.660
<v Speaker 5>onto rafts or boats probably in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>flood season and drifted down.</v>

2328
02:13:16.501 --> 02:13:18.540
<v Speaker 5>Denial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the luxor,</v>

2329
02:13:18.541 --> 02:13:23.541
<v Speaker 5>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know where it was intended to </v>

2330
02:13:23.541 --> 02:13:25.761
<v Speaker 5>go and then they would have somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 5>another had to get it up into position </v>

2331
02:13:26.430 --> 02:13:30.990
<v Speaker 5>and according to the lobbying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did this by pulling it up,</v>

2332
02:13:31.070 --> 02:13:36.070
<v Speaker 5>gigantic ramp and it was set up in such </v>
<v Speaker 5>a way that with a kind of a no,</v>

2333
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:44.950
<v Speaker 5>the up the ramp that would come up to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ramp with the with this bottom at </v>

2334
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:49.821
<v Speaker 5>the top part and then gradually with </v>
<v Speaker 5>lots of people with ropes and you'd be </v>

2335
02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:55.130
<v Speaker 5>surprised how how precise you can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>with lots of trained men with ropes and </v>

2336
02:13:57.061 --> 02:14:01.260
<v Speaker 5>they would gradually pull it up and and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it would go.</v>

2337
02:14:02.580 --> 02:14:07.580
<v Speaker 5>There was a kind of a deep shaft that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was constructed that was full of sand </v>

2338
02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:11.070
<v Speaker 5>and they'd gradually pull the sand up </v>
<v Speaker 5>from under and all of these guys pulling</v>

2339
02:14:11.230 --> 02:14:14.850
<v Speaker 5>the ropes gradually leave your up into </v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

2340
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:20.550
<v Speaker 5>Very exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Place it down on his base,</v>

2341
02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.550
<v Speaker 5>but how they get the sand out the last </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>

2342
02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:25.920
<v Speaker 5>When you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of this makes sense,</v>

2343
02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:30.270
<v Speaker 5>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating to try to figure out if</v>

2344
02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:32.930
<v Speaker 5>this is how it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know,</v>

2345
02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:38.370
<v Speaker 5>but the whole be concise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like did it and it's pretty damn </v>

2346
02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:38.370
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

2347
02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:42.170
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the things I thought was really </v>

2348
02:14:42.170 --> 02:14:43.611
<v Speaker 7>fascinating was when they had to move </v>
<v Speaker 7>some gigantic statues,</v>

2349
02:14:44.101 --> 02:14:48.030
<v Speaker 7>they had to cut them up and then replace</v>
<v Speaker 7>them in a new area.</v>

2350
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.900
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2351
02:14:48.901 --> 02:14:52.050
<v Speaker 7>they had to like cut giant statues in </v>
<v Speaker 7>half.</v>

2352
02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:57.080
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>talk about that in incredible project </v>

2353
02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:58.440
<v Speaker 7>and what you thought about that just </v>
<v Speaker 7>from an archaeological standpoint.</v>

2354
02:14:58.540 --> 02:14:59.920
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's abu simbel.</v>

2355
02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:02.020
<v Speaker 5>and it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was statues.</v>

2356
02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.440
<v Speaker 5>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a temple cut into the rock face </v>

2357
02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:11.730
<v Speaker 5>and the four statues of ramesses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the second were sculpted into the rock </v>

2358
02:15:13.481 --> 02:15:14.800
<v Speaker 5>face itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

2359
02:15:14.801 --> 02:15:17.320
<v Speaker 5>they were integral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will not freestanding statutes.</v>

2360
02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:22.680
<v Speaker 5>So when they built the aswan dam and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they would have flooded this fabulous </v>

2361
02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:26.140
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got together a whole bunch of money</v>

2362
02:15:26.141 --> 02:15:27.190
<v Speaker 5>and $90,</v>
<v Speaker 5>million dollars,</v>

2363
02:15:27.191 --> 02:15:32.191
<v Speaker 5>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unesco got it together and they got all </v>

2364
02:15:32.191 --> 02:15:36.160
<v Speaker 5>of the engineers and what they to do is </v>
<v Speaker 5>they had to basically,</v>

2365
02:15:36.161 --> 02:15:41.161
<v Speaker 5>they had to move a whole so they have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>cut around the temple and then they have</v>

2366
02:15:43.001 --> 02:15:45.710
<v Speaker 5>to cut because the scratches enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sixty,</v>

2367
02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:50.760
<v Speaker 5>65 feet high and then they had to cut </v>
<v Speaker 5>them into four and move the blocks </v>

2368
02:15:51.041 --> 02:15:56.041
<v Speaker 5>because they moved the entire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They moved the whole up to the top of </v>

2369
02:15:56.041 --> 02:15:56.380
<v Speaker 5>the hill.</v>

2370
02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:01.800
<v Speaker 5>Where were they were they were built </v>
<v Speaker 5>into because the water would have </v>

2371
02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:06.810
<v Speaker 5>covered where they were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's,</v>

2372
02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.740
<v Speaker 5>that's abu simbel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so yeah,</v>

2373
02:16:08.741 --> 02:16:10.850
<v Speaker 5>they have to cut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they weren't freestanding.</v>

2374
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:12.480
<v Speaker 5>snatches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still it was a modern,</v>

2375
02:16:12.481 --> 02:16:17.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a pretty considerable modern </v>

2376
02:16:17.481 --> 02:16:17.481
<v Speaker 5>engineering thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise.</v>

2377
02:16:17.481 --> 02:16:18.340
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an example,</v>

2378
02:16:18.341 --> 02:16:23.341
<v Speaker 5>there's the statue of the colossal </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure of abram says that's the basis of</v>

2379
02:16:24.071 --> 02:16:29.071
<v Speaker 5>shelly's famous poem ozymandias no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I met a traveler from an land,</v>

2380
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:30.430
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah blah.</v>

2381
02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:34.750
<v Speaker 5>And this is the statute that ways it </v>
<v Speaker 5>ruined.</v>

2382
02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:41.180
<v Speaker 5>It exploded in an earthquake somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 5>around julius caesar talk.</v>

2383
02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:45.670
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this,</v>

2384
02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:50.730
<v Speaker 5>this originally weighed about 2000 tons </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they got it down the river somehow.</v>

2385
02:16:52.090 --> 02:16:56.980
<v Speaker 5>And that's amazing enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then I didn't get it off the boat.</v>

2386
02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:00.850
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>assuming that they're moving it in flood</v>

2387
02:17:00.851 --> 02:17:05.851
<v Speaker 5>season on giant rats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they've got to get the rafts.</v>

2388
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:09.580
<v Speaker 5>We've got to get this thousand ton block</v>
<v Speaker 5>off the raft.</v>

2389
02:17:10.090 --> 02:17:13.930
<v Speaker 5>Move it into place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well the actual moving it on the flat.</v>

2390
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:16.000
<v Speaker 5>There are when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>

2391
02:17:16.001 --> 02:17:21.001
<v Speaker 5>what evidence is there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's one or two months from the tomb </v>

2392
02:17:21.001 --> 02:17:25.890
<v Speaker 5>relief showing viewed sledge with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>giant colossal statue of feral on it and</v>

2393
02:17:29.171 --> 02:17:34.171
<v Speaker 5>then lots and lots of men pulling the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sledge over the over the land.</v>

2394
02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:37.360
<v Speaker 5>When somebody in the front pouring </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

2395
02:17:37.361 --> 02:17:42.361
<v Speaker 5>maybe some water cause slick mud </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually is remarkably slippery and you </v>

2396
02:17:42.461 --> 02:17:44.500
<v Speaker 5>can pull things up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As I said earlier,</v>

2397
02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:49.590
<v Speaker 5>what you see is what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't deny that evidence when you </v>

2398
02:17:49.590 --> 02:17:50.720
<v Speaker 5>see the evidence in front of your nose </v>
<v Speaker 5>and say,</v>

2399
02:17:50.721 --> 02:17:54.980
<v Speaker 5>oh well let's aliens dropping things </v>
<v Speaker 5>from helicopters and stuff.</v>

2400
02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:59.080
<v Speaker 5>Then the evidence is there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the evidence.</v>

2401
02:17:59.470 --> 02:18:04.470
<v Speaker 5>But you've got to be careful about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence of there are seeing symbols,</v>

2402
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:08.650
<v Speaker 5>but look like alec up their template.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bobby does,</v>

2403
02:18:08.651 --> 02:18:11.800
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not this complicated subject.</v>

2404
02:18:13.290 --> 02:18:16.330
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an incredibly complicated subject now,</v>

2405
02:18:16.331 --> 02:18:21.331
<v Speaker 7>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no subject of ancient civilizations </v>

2406
02:18:21.331 --> 02:18:24.300
<v Speaker 7>would be complete without a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 7>of ancient sumeria and,</v>

2407
02:18:24.301 --> 02:18:24.870
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2408
02:18:24.871 --> 02:18:28.500
<v Speaker 7>the fantastical work of zachariah </v>
<v Speaker 7>switching.</v>

2409
02:18:28.501 --> 02:18:30.240
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure you're familiar with all that </v>
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>

2410
02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:35.270
<v Speaker 7>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's your take on zacharias hitchins </v>

2411
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.270
<v Speaker 7>ideas that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2412
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:37.920
<v Speaker 7>the annunaki came from another planet </v>
<v Speaker 7>for a lot of people don't know.</v>

2413
02:18:37.921 --> 02:18:42.921
<v Speaker 7>it's some pretty crazy stuff that states</v>
<v Speaker 7>that human beings were created through </v>

2414
02:18:42.921 --> 02:18:44.340
<v Speaker 7>genetic engineering and.</v>

2415
02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2416
02:18:45.771 --> 02:18:49.480
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think actually I'm not and,</v>

2417
02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:54.060
<v Speaker 5>and I find when wouldn't sits in I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2418
02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:58.530
<v Speaker 5>I can't challenge his translations from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2419
02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:00.850
<v Speaker 5>from the sumerian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2420
02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:02.090
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't,</v>

2421
02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:07.600
<v Speaker 5>but they're his translations and </v>
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately are the best of my </v>

2422
02:19:08.421 --> 02:19:13.421
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know of any of the sumerian </v>

2423
02:19:13.421 --> 02:19:15.590
<v Speaker 5>experts who bothered to take a look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>his work,</v>

2424
02:19:15.591 --> 02:19:16.700
<v Speaker 5>which is too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2425
02:19:16.701 --> 02:19:21.701
<v Speaker 5>it's irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do know that when he's talking </v>

2426
02:19:21.701 --> 02:19:22.880
<v Speaker 5>about Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's totally off the wall.</v>

2427
02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:28.000
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And from that I extrapolate and do not </v>

2428
02:19:28.581 --> 02:19:33.581
<v Speaker 5>much care for his work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when he gets into explaining who the</v>

2429
02:19:34.071 --> 02:19:35.980
<v Speaker 5>gods were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2430
02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:39.410
<v Speaker 5>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're alien,</v>

2431
02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:43.310
<v Speaker 5>they're aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as malignant is ourselves,</v>

2432
02:19:43.311 --> 02:19:48.311
<v Speaker 5>who enslaved the a primitive human </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights created the gods of Egypt and </v>

2433
02:19:49.731 --> 02:19:54.731
<v Speaker 5>everywhere else are really just aliens </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have been misunderstood by </v>

2434
02:19:55.110 --> 02:20:00.110
<v Speaker 5>primitive imaginations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is really stupid and malignant </v>

2435
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.110
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

2436
02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:06.360
<v Speaker 5>Here's a bit of evidence that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>egyptian creation myths concerns that </v>

2437
02:20:07.570 --> 02:20:10.850
<v Speaker 5>the god before there were any gods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the god called attune,</v>

2438
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:15.740
<v Speaker 5>who exists before there is existence as </v>
<v Speaker 5>it were,</v>

2439
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:20.480
<v Speaker 5>and he creates existence through an act </v>
<v Speaker 5>of masturbation.</v>

2440
02:20:21.390 --> 02:20:25.790
<v Speaker 5>He creates the first poll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first polarization,</v>

2441
02:20:25.791 --> 02:20:29.780
<v Speaker 5>the first female,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the male is the biblical vests.</v>

2442
02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:34.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now This is an ancient alien,</v>

2443
02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:40.100
<v Speaker 5>and this is a suction suction esque </v>
<v Speaker 5>interpretation.</v>

2444
02:20:40.430 --> 02:20:45.430
<v Speaker 5>What is it that the primitives saw?</v>
<v Speaker 5>An ancient alien whacking off behind the</v>

2445
02:20:47.871 --> 02:20:51.860
<v Speaker 5>trade and decided that this was how the </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe was created.</v>

2446
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:55.310
<v Speaker 5>It has absolutely nothing to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's another words,</v>

2447
02:20:55.670 --> 02:21:00.670
<v Speaker 5>the gods of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the gods of all other </v>

2448
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:03.011
<v Speaker 5>civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including those in sometimes think </v>

2449
02:21:03.011 --> 02:21:03.440
<v Speaker 5>primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>represent cosmic principles.</v>

2450
02:21:03.770 --> 02:21:06.590
<v Speaker 5>They are not people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are not aliens.</v>

2451
02:21:06.591 --> 02:21:11.591
<v Speaker 5>They are principles and they are </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific scientists don't like this </v>

2452
02:21:11.591 --> 02:21:11.591
<v Speaker 5>either,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2453
02:21:11.591 --> 02:21:16.360
<v Speaker 5>but when you look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you look at egyptian mythology and </v>

2454
02:21:17.151 --> 02:21:21.980
<v Speaker 5>try to and try to historicize it as it </v>
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>

2455
02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:26.300
<v Speaker 5>you flying the urine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the urine,</v>

2456
02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:30.980
<v Speaker 5>this is a ludicrous exercise and as far </v>
<v Speaker 5>as I'm concerned,</v>

2457
02:21:30.981 --> 02:21:35.450
<v Speaker 5>the whole notion that we human beings to</v>
<v Speaker 5>creators,</v>

2458
02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:38.730
<v Speaker 5>not searching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some others did create the cathedral</v>

2459
02:21:38.731 --> 02:21:43.731
<v Speaker 5>of shotgun and the builders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the temples of Egypt and so on or </v>

2460
02:21:43.731 --> 02:21:46.070
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another diluted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>diluted,</v>

2461
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:52.030
<v Speaker 5>primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so were who were enslaved by aliens and </v>

2462
02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:56.450
<v Speaker 5>who then found a way to set themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>free,</v>

2463
02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:00.350
<v Speaker 5>but remember they're alien backgrounds </v>
<v Speaker 5>and commemorated them,</v>

2464
02:22:00.351 --> 02:22:05.351
<v Speaker 5>and all of this wonderful law contacted </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is really stupid and not only is </v>

2465
02:22:05.351 --> 02:22:05.750
<v Speaker 5>it's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2466
02:22:05.770 --> 02:22:08.870
<v Speaker 5>it's malignant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's malignant in the same way,</v>

2467
02:22:08.871 --> 02:22:11.870
<v Speaker 5>it's the opposite of that sale.</v>

2468
02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:15.200
<v Speaker 5>Darwinian evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you know in other words,</v>

2469
02:22:15.450 --> 02:22:20.450
<v Speaker 5>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It deprives human existence of all </v>

2470
02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:26.320
<v Speaker 5>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's in fact what modern science </v>

2471
02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:28.931
<v Speaker 5>does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Modern rational as science deprives us </v>

2472
02:22:28.931 --> 02:22:29.370
<v Speaker 5>of any meaning in life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in fact,</v>

2473
02:22:29.371 --> 02:22:31.080
<v Speaker 5>they're very proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should read some of this.</v>

2474
02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:36.340
<v Speaker 6>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you contemplate how we were created </v>

2475
02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:39.331
<v Speaker 6>or how we burst out from the lower </v>
<v Speaker 6>hominids how there's all these other </v>

2476
02:22:39.331 --> 02:22:41.320
<v Speaker 6>primates running around that we did not </v>
<v Speaker 6>sure that we did.</v>

2477
02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:45.800
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's no evidence for that.</v>

2478
02:22:45.801 --> 02:22:50.801
<v Speaker 5>There are lower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were hominids and then there's us </v>

2479
02:22:50.801 --> 02:22:53.060
<v Speaker 5>and the further back you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There we are again.</v>

2480
02:22:53.090 --> 02:22:57.980
<v Speaker 5>This is a situation ask stuff except </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's called science that we have to have</v>

2481
02:22:57.981 --> 02:23:02.981
<v Speaker 5>had that we have to have had more and </v>
<v Speaker 5>more primitive beings that were </v>

2482
02:23:04.011 --> 02:23:05.060
<v Speaker 5>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2483
02:23:05.061 --> 02:23:09.320
<v Speaker 5>that gradually became us being apes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>became people.</v>

2484
02:23:09.321 --> 02:23:12.750
<v Speaker 5>And what do you think happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are doing show day and go directly to</v>

2485
02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:15.290
<v Speaker 5>epic and the snakes and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't live that.</v>

2486
02:23:15.310 --> 02:23:17.890
<v Speaker 5>Put two seconds actually actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>shotgun.</v>

2487
02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:21.550
<v Speaker 5>I high up on our list.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2488
02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:23.700
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons I got,</v>

2489
02:23:24.470 --> 02:23:27.710
<v Speaker 5>I got onto the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did a lot of times.</v>

2490
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:33.110
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>funny story that call I got hold of </v>

2491
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:36.641
<v Speaker 5>shock because I developed the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I developed the strength theory all on </v>

2492
02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:36.860
<v Speaker 5>my own.</v>

2493
02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:41.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a geologist and several months </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the in the library's working out the </v>

2494
02:23:43.011 --> 02:23:48.011
<v Speaker 5>geology and convinced myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's put together the whole theory of </v>

2495
02:23:48.011 --> 02:23:51.881
<v Speaker 5>the water weathering and then it just </v>
<v Speaker 5>sat there for 10 years a serpent and </v>

2496
02:23:51.881 --> 02:23:55.790
<v Speaker 5>this guy was published and whenever it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was when 79,</v>

2497
02:23:55.791 --> 02:24:00.680
<v Speaker 5>something like that and nobody paid any </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention to it.</v>

2498
02:24:00.681 --> 02:24:05.681
<v Speaker 5>And then I had a friend who'd been </v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching english at cairo and american </v>

2499
02:24:05.781 --> 02:24:08.270
<v Speaker 5>university in cairo and he was very </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested.</v>

2500
02:24:08.271 --> 02:24:13.271
<v Speaker 5>he got ahold of my work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was very interested and one day we were </v>

2501
02:24:13.271 --> 02:24:17.510
<v Speaker 5>having not taught at boston university </v>
<v Speaker 5>and one day we're having a dinner and he</v>

2502
02:24:17.511 --> 02:24:17.990
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2503
02:24:17.991 --> 02:24:22.991
<v Speaker 5>this symbolist Egypt stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your instance I think really important </v>

2504
02:24:22.991 --> 02:24:25.250
<v Speaker 5>as I said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he said,</v>

2505
02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:26.180
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do we,</v>

2506
02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:31.720
<v Speaker 5>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what can I do as an academic to help </v>

2507
02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:31.830
<v Speaker 5>healthier?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

2508
02:24:31.831 --> 02:24:32.510
<v Speaker 5>they're instantly.</v>

2509
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:33.300
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

2510
02:24:33.301 --> 02:24:37.820
<v Speaker 5>The geologist to look into the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the water weathering of the spanx.</v>

2511
02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:40.880
<v Speaker 5>And I laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2512
02:24:40.881 --> 02:24:45.881
<v Speaker 5>I knew from lots of experience that </v>
<v Speaker 5>finding an open minded scientists and </v>

2513
02:24:45.881 --> 02:24:48.560
<v Speaker 5>it's like finding a fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 5>christian who loves his enemies.</v>

2514
02:24:48.910 --> 02:24:50.720
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

2515
02:24:50.721 --> 02:24:51.530
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

2516
02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:57.020
<v Speaker 5>it seems with me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one thing or another lead to robert </v>

2517
02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:57.020
<v Speaker 5>chalk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And gradually,</v>

2518
02:24:57.021 --> 02:24:58.250
<v Speaker 5>gradually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at first he did,</v>

2519
02:24:58.310 --> 02:25:00.260
<v Speaker 5>he was interested in the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't let,</v>

2520
02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:04.160
<v Speaker 5>he didn't want to even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't even supposed to know his name.</v>

2521
02:25:04.161 --> 02:25:06.640
<v Speaker 5>And finally because he was up for tenure</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was,</v>

2522
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:08.870
<v Speaker 5>anybody thinks they're looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lost civilization.</v>

2523
02:25:08.871 --> 02:25:11.660
<v Speaker 5>And up here we were up for tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not going to get your tenure.</v>

2524
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:17.230
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually chalk and I met and as I </v>

2525
02:25:17.230 --> 02:25:17.230
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been,</v>

2526
02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:17.870
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2527
02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:21.910
<v Speaker 5>I find not evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Evolution is a plaque with our windy and</v>

2528
02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:26.920
<v Speaker 5>evolution by natural selection is </v>
<v Speaker 5>arguably the greatest superstition ever </v>

2529
02:25:27.821 --> 02:25:29.380
<v Speaker 5>foisted upon the human race.</v>

2530
02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you believe that human beings </v>

2531
02:25:34.650 --> 02:25:34.650
<v Speaker 1>came to be?</v>

2532
02:25:34.650 --> 02:25:39.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know how mosquitoes came to </v>

2533
02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:39.460
<v Speaker 5>be there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

2534
02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:43.200
<v Speaker 5>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the darwinian explanation is so </v>

2535
02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.400
<v Speaker 5>explanation is completely untenable.</v>

2536
02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:50.970
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's our song is that a human beings </v>

2537
02:25:50.970 --> 02:25:52.560
<v Speaker 1>would evolve through net or progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>through natural selection that's on top.</v>

2538
02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:53.330
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2539
02:25:53.370 --> 02:25:55.020
<v Speaker 5>that's a lot of the key.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

2540
02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:56.490
<v Speaker 5>when we shock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2541
02:25:57.710 --> 02:26:02.710
<v Speaker 5>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me go backtrack to when I met up </v>

2542
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:03.650
<v Speaker 5>with shock and so it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2543
02:26:03.690 --> 02:26:07.860
<v Speaker 5>cautious mEeting and mean he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved with this loony heretic,</v>

2544
02:26:07.861 --> 02:26:12.861
<v Speaker 5>me and we were getting on pretty well </v>
<v Speaker 5>and having a discussion and I gave a </v>

2545
02:26:13.621 --> 02:26:18.621
<v Speaker 5>lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He organized a lecture for me plus the </v>

2546
02:26:18.621 --> 02:26:20.931
<v Speaker 5>universities to the faculty and </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested students and that went quite </v>

2547
02:26:20.931 --> 02:26:21.750
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what we're talking now,</v>

2548
02:26:21.751 --> 02:26:26.751
<v Speaker 5>89.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I went back to [inaudible] </v>

2549
02:26:26.751 --> 02:26:29.751
<v Speaker 5>house for dinner and I'm as a subject of</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution came up and he's not just a </v>

2550
02:26:31.021 --> 02:26:34.560
<v Speaker 5>geologists and geophysicists but </v>
<v Speaker 5>paleontologist as well.</v>

2551
02:26:34.830 --> 02:26:38.730
<v Speaker 5>So he was very into the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary hypothesis.</v>

2552
02:26:39.060 --> 02:26:43.350
<v Speaker 5>And I mentioned the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know who stephen jay gould was?</v>

2553
02:26:44.190 --> 02:26:45.880
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not ltl low lee.</v>

2554
02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:49.590
<v Speaker 5>They died not too long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was everybody's favorite.</v>

2555
02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:55.220
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was everybody's favorite sharpies </v>

2556
02:26:55.220 --> 02:26:58.620
<v Speaker 5>geologist or biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was sort of like the equivalent of </v>

2557
02:26:58.620 --> 02:26:58.620
<v Speaker 5>carl sagan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2558
02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:00.240
<v Speaker 5>he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2559
02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:02.940
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was sort of the carl sagan of geology</v>

2560
02:27:02.941 --> 02:27:07.941
<v Speaker 5>and evolutionary biology and using the </v>
<v Speaker 5>new yorker all the time and all that </v>

2561
02:27:07.941 --> 02:27:09.580
<v Speaker 5>sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said the shotgun,</v>

2562
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:15.550
<v Speaker 5>we got into carefully answer the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>question of evolution and um,</v>

2563
02:27:18.390 --> 02:27:18.930
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2564
02:27:18.931 --> 02:27:22.590
<v Speaker 5>what do you think of stephen jay gould?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's always a bozo.</v>

2565
02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:28.220
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that somebody I could talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>to realize that this guy wasn't deemed </v>

2566
02:27:28.890 --> 02:27:30.150
<v Speaker 5>literate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a bozo.</v>

2567
02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:33.780
<v Speaker 5>And actually without getting deep into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2568
02:27:33.781 --> 02:27:38.781
<v Speaker 5>because this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is our next book after we were at </v>

2569
02:27:38.781 --> 02:27:39.440
<v Speaker 5>the bridge of sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chuck has really into this,</v>

2570
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:43.650
<v Speaker 5>I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the definitive anti darwin book,</v>

2571
02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:48.800
<v Speaker 5>not anti evolution anti darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And let me just give you a little clue.</v>

2572
02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:53.700
<v Speaker 5>Use the language yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody does natural selection.</v>

2573
02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:58.430
<v Speaker 5>A lot of this is not science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the,</v>

2574
02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:03.580
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the equivalent of george orwell's </v>

2575
02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:04.910
<v Speaker 5>newspeak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's science fake.</v>

2576
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:09.240
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the two words themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>natural selection is,</v>

2577
02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:14.360
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is promoted as the means whereby sings </v>

2578
02:28:16.411 --> 02:28:21.411
<v Speaker 5>automatically by a series.</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a quote from a very famous </v>

2579
02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:25.310
<v Speaker 5>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>darwinian daniel dennett.</v>

2580
02:28:25.530 --> 02:28:30.530
<v Speaker 5>A series of lucky coincidence is </v>
<v Speaker 5>produces mosquitoes and us and all the </v>

2581
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:35.231
<v Speaker 5>rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is supposed to be the agency </v>

2582
02:28:35.231 --> 02:28:37.550
<v Speaker 5>for this is natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether we look at the word natural,</v>

2583
02:28:37.551 --> 02:28:42.551
<v Speaker 5>if you go to the dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even the great big oxford english </v>

2584
02:28:42.551 --> 02:28:44.300
<v Speaker 5>dictionary that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and look up the word natural,</v>

2585
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:48.350
<v Speaker 5>nowhere does natural mean accidental or </v>
<v Speaker 5>fortuitous.</v>

2586
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:50.720
<v Speaker 5>Natural simply means of the natural </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

2587
02:28:51.050 --> 02:28:54.230
<v Speaker 5>so to say that it's natural means that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's accidental,</v>

2588
02:28:55.130 --> 02:28:56.210
<v Speaker 5>has nothing to do with the word.</v>

2589
02:28:56.210 --> 02:29:01.210
<v Speaker 5>Natural doesn't describe accidental,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has no nowhere does it come out or </v>

2590
02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:07.280
<v Speaker 5>suggest fortuitousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you look at selection.</v>

2591
02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:12.700
<v Speaker 5>This is also selection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Selection presupposes choice and </v>

2592
02:29:13.821 --> 02:29:18.821
<v Speaker 5>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The roulette wheel does not select the </v>

2593
02:29:18.821 --> 02:29:21.140
<v Speaker 5>number that the ball is going to fall </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

2594
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:27.490
<v Speaker 5>People are selected for the nba.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Draft candidates are selected for </v>

2595
02:29:28.970 --> 02:29:32.210
<v Speaker 5>running for office.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It suggests choice.</v>

2596
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:37.570
<v Speaker 5>Natural suggests hierarchical order of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the most sophisticated purpose,</v>

2597
02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:42.880
<v Speaker 5>so to call an accidental process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Natural selection is a con job.</v>

2598
02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:45.890
<v Speaker 5>If they wanted to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually.</v>

2599
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:49.010
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>daniel dennett does a very good job.</v>

2600
02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:54.040
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution is nothing but a series of </v>

2601
02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:55.130
<v Speaker 5>lucky coincidences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they call the whole theory,</v>

2602
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:59.240
<v Speaker 5>the siri of lucky coincidences would </v>
<v Speaker 5>stop sounding scientific.</v>

2603
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:04.600
<v Speaker 5>We don't know how any of these things </v>
<v Speaker 5>developed and the,</v>

2604
02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:09.800
<v Speaker 5>the much derided,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do they call themselves,</v>

2605
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:14.830
<v Speaker 5>the intelligent design people also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they use the wrong a bit.</v>

2606
02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:20.080
<v Speaker 5>They use the wrong language because </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligent design suggests a designer </v>

2607
02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:21.780
<v Speaker 5>and then you're talking about god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and of course they're not,</v>

2608
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:27.320
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>god and getting away with it in academic</v>

2609
02:30:27.321 --> 02:30:28.860
<v Speaker 5>circles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in fact,</v>

2610
02:30:28.861 --> 02:30:31.040
<v Speaker 5>if they called it intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity,</v>

2611
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:36.550
<v Speaker 5>that'd be closer to the mark.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Creativity is built into the universal </v>

2612
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:37.320
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2613
02:30:37.350 --> 02:30:41.120
<v Speaker 5>it's creativity itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're in the middle of creativity,</v>

2614
02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:44.630
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves.</v>

2615
02:30:44.690 --> 02:30:49.690
<v Speaker 5>So it's very difficult to discuss this </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly because we've been brought </v>

2616
02:30:49.690 --> 02:30:52.790
<v Speaker 5>up in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this paradigm of,</v>

2617
02:30:52.860 --> 02:30:57.860
<v Speaker 5>of science speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And actually after the bridge of sarah </v>

2618
02:30:57.860 --> 02:30:58.400
<v Speaker 5>and shotguns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much into this as I am,</v>

2619
02:30:58.401 --> 02:30:59.000
<v Speaker 5>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2620
02:30:59.001 --> 02:31:00.830
<v Speaker 5>he's got all the credentials behind </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2621
02:31:01.370 --> 02:31:04.010
<v Speaker 5>We're going to do a book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think called.</v>

2622
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:10.070
<v Speaker 5>It's like if I have my wife darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>darwin,</v>

2623
02:31:10.410 --> 02:31:15.160
<v Speaker 5>suddenly cycle dddd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>edd darwin debunked darwin declawed,</v>

2624
02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:20.860
<v Speaker 5>darwin dethroned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a scientist and a scholar deconstruct </v>

2625
02:31:21.001 --> 02:31:25.050
<v Speaker 5>the cargo cult of the west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a fraud from beginning to end.</v>

2626
02:31:25.051 --> 02:31:29.010
<v Speaker 5>It is not science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Evolution is a process.</v>

2627
02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:31.110
<v Speaker 5>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is demonstrable.</v>

2628
02:31:31.470 --> 02:31:36.470
<v Speaker 5>The manner in which it manifests through</v>
<v Speaker 5>supposedly natural selection is a total </v>

2629
02:31:36.841 --> 02:31:37.320
<v Speaker 5>fraud.</v>

2630
02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:42.320
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to clarify is that evolution is </v>

2631
02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:42.930
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the process of natural selection due</v>

2632
02:31:42.931 --> 02:31:45.600
<v Speaker 1>to random mutations and something you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't buy,</v>

2633
02:31:45.601 --> 02:31:50.601
<v Speaker 1>you think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more of a design element to it </v>

2634
02:31:50.601 --> 02:31:50.601
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It more.</v>

2635
02:31:50.601 --> 02:31:55.050
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be acting and responding in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a creative and intelligent way.</v>

2636
02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:57.260
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

2637
02:31:57.410 --> 02:32:02.410
<v Speaker 5>it is creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Creativity is there before anything is </v>

2638
02:32:04.641 --> 02:32:05.870
<v Speaker 5>created.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

2639
02:32:05.871 --> 02:32:06.860
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2640
02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:11.920
<v Speaker 5>it's the matrix in which things somehow </v>
<v Speaker 5>or another,</v>

2641
02:32:11.961 --> 02:32:15.020
<v Speaker 5>and we don't know the process evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not.</v>

2642
02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:20.740
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It probably is not random and in fact </v>

2643
02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:21.800
<v Speaker 5>there's a ton of stuff when you get into</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2644
02:32:21.801 --> 02:32:26.540
<v Speaker 5>I have a folder this live on nolan </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution.</v>

2645
02:32:26.541 --> 02:32:29.360
<v Speaker 5>That's shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will let and I will get into</v>

2646
02:32:30.010 --> 02:32:30.290
<v Speaker 8>what</v>

2647
02:32:31.430 --> 02:32:36.430
<v Speaker 5>pretty soon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere along the line that it can't.</v>

2648
02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:42.170
<v Speaker 5>It can't work that way and the deeper </v>
<v Speaker 5>they look,</v>

2649
02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:44.150
<v Speaker 5>the more they find.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2650
02:32:44.151 --> 02:32:49.151
<v Speaker 5>I just had today actually you should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should write and conquer and get </v>

2651
02:32:49.970 --> 02:32:52.280
<v Speaker 5>this guys is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I worked with them,</v>

2652
02:32:52.281 --> 02:32:52.610
<v Speaker 5>steve</v>

2653
02:32:54.600 --> 02:32:57.450
<v Speaker 5>list that he sends out every week of </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting articles.</v>

2654
02:32:57.451 --> 02:32:58.980
<v Speaker 5>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was one just today,</v>

2655
02:32:59.130 --> 02:33:04.130
<v Speaker 5>maybe one of the other science things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I get all the time about the </v>

2656
02:33:05.941 --> 02:33:08.850
<v Speaker 5>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the intelligence of plants.</v>

2657
02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.710
<v Speaker 5>We actually communicate with each other </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so on.</v>

2658
02:33:12.711 --> 02:33:17.711
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we exist within the creative matrix.</v>

2659
02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:22.590
<v Speaker 5>It's not that stuff just happens in all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden there's intelligence.</v>

2660
02:33:22.591 --> 02:33:27.300
<v Speaker 5>It's that there is intelligence and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>are the results of the intelligence.</v>

2661
02:33:28.050 --> 02:33:30.420
<v Speaker 5>Not that god woke up one morning and </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

2662
02:33:30.421 --> 02:33:33.150
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>today I think I will create mosquitoes.</v>

2663
02:33:33.470 --> 02:33:38.470
<v Speaker 5>Is that somehow that it's like imagining</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2664
02:33:39.271 --> 02:33:44.271
<v Speaker 5>do you suppose that the cells in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>body have any idea of or my body have </v>

2665
02:33:45.811 --> 02:33:50.811
<v Speaker 5>any idea that I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here I am talking to a guy called joe </v>

2666
02:33:50.811 --> 02:33:51.870
<v Speaker 5>rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the three hours about these subjects.</v>

2667
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:57.110
<v Speaker 5>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they know something else </v>

2668
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:59.400
<v Speaker 5>that they know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's something like us.</v>

2669
02:33:59.490 --> 02:34:02.730
<v Speaker 5>We're cells in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a much in a,</v>

2670
02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:07.780
<v Speaker 5>in a prodigious let intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 5>directed organism and that's the.</v>

2671
02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:13.400
<v Speaker 5>That's actually the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though you'd never know it from </v>

2672
02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:14.780
<v Speaker 5>listening to the bologna that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2673
02:34:14.860 --> 02:34:19.860
<v Speaker 5>the priests and the or rabbis and all of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these imbeciles talk about this is </v>

2674
02:34:20.561 --> 02:34:24.070
<v Speaker 5>actually what's at the basis of all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the religions,</v>

2675
02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:29.100
<v Speaker 5>however corrupt they become with we have</v>
<v Speaker 5>a function to perform in the whole </v>

2676
02:34:29.891 --> 02:34:34.710
<v Speaker 5>gigantic structure and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hierarchical and it's organized and</v>

2677
02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:39.720
<v Speaker 5>it's up to us to do our bit to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But natural selection is a set.</v>

2678
02:34:40.030 --> 02:34:42.160
<v Speaker 5>It's a linguistic fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's spin.</v>

2679
02:34:42.450 --> 02:34:47.450
<v Speaker 1>So this is where it gets really crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because where did the,</v>

2680
02:34:48.300 --> 02:34:53.300
<v Speaker 1>how did the human animal emerge if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human animal didn't emerge from lower </v>

2681
02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:56.010
<v Speaker 1>hot minutes and we existed in this form </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning.</v>

2682
02:34:56.011 --> 02:35:01.011
<v Speaker 1>Is that the supposition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they've absolutely proven that </v>

2683
02:35:01.011 --> 02:35:02.610
<v Speaker 1>there had been loW lower forms of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

2684
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:07.790
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other different branches of the human </v>

2685
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:08.550
<v Speaker 1>tree that that died off neanderthal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

2686
02:35:08.551 --> 02:35:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pithy kiss is a,</v>

2687
02:35:10.021 --> 02:35:15.021
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different ones from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They suppose where what they call quote </v>

2688
02:35:15.021 --> 02:35:15.890
<v Speaker 1>unquote early man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't buy that.</v>

2689
02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:16.370
<v Speaker 1>That's early.</v>

2690
02:35:16.460 --> 02:35:20.160
<v Speaker 5>We don't know where they lived within </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves saying earlier.</v>

2691
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:23.630
<v Speaker 5>they're assuming these are primitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings.</v>

2692
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:25.430
<v Speaker 5>When I talked earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>

2693
02:35:25.540 --> 02:35:28.760
<v Speaker 5>we're going with our strengths and I go </v>
<v Speaker 5>back in our shell date,</v>

2694
02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:33.260
<v Speaker 5>april who produced day and as I said </v>
<v Speaker 5>earlier,</v>

2695
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:39.070
<v Speaker 5>really are our level of development is </v>
<v Speaker 5>an inner thing.</v>

2696
02:35:40.940 --> 02:35:42.920
<v Speaker 5>You can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anD as I,</v>

2697
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:48.030
<v Speaker 5>as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>using the image of dance as an as say an</v>

2698
02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:53.620
<v Speaker 5>enlightened society idea that expressed </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself only in dance and by dancing </v>

2699
02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:59.410
<v Speaker 5>experienced the highest levels of </v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity.</v>

2700
02:35:59.810 --> 02:36:04.810
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the thing that most of these </v>

2701
02:36:04.810 --> 02:36:06.761
<v Speaker 5>scientists are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are seriously defective human beings.</v>

2702
02:36:07.041 --> 02:36:11.540
<v Speaker 5>They're uncreative bite nature and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>distrust their own emotions.</v>

2703
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:16.950
<v Speaker 5>london that grants you listened to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beethoven quartets and walk into this </v>

2704
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:21.280
<v Speaker 5>cathedral of genre of the temples of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt and that tells you a lot,</v>

2705
02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.750
<v Speaker 5>even if you can't necessarily explain </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2706
02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:29.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>however we are at maybe let's say the </v>

2707
02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:31.670
<v Speaker 5>car sufis in certain of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the esoteric societies,</v>

2708
02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:37.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>habit that we're there from the </v>

2709
02:36:37.090 --> 02:36:39.860
<v Speaker 5>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're only made manifest.</v>

2710
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:45.370
<v Speaker 5>However that happens at a later date.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's absolutely no evidence that,</v>

2711
02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:47.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they Come up with lucy or something like</v>

2712
02:36:47.901 --> 02:36:48.620
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>

2713
02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:53.480
<v Speaker 5>We have no idea what went on inside </v>
<v Speaker 5>lucy's art none.</v>

2714
02:36:53.970 --> 02:36:55.890
<v Speaker 1>But we do know that 65 million,</v>

2715
02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:00.920
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we do paypal extrapolating,</v>

2716
02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:07.360
<v Speaker 5>rationalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basically wHat they're doing is they're </v>

2717
02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:07.360
<v Speaker 5>rationalizing their own emptiness.</v>

2718
02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:09.770
<v Speaker 1>We know that 65 million years ago there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a mass extinction.</v>

2719
02:37:09.771 --> 02:37:14.000
<v Speaker 1>There's no flowering plants before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a completely different sort of</v>

2720
02:37:14.001 --> 02:37:16.430
<v Speaker 1>an atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely animals here.</v>

2721
02:37:16.590 --> 02:37:16.980
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

2722
02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:22.000
<v Speaker 1>what happened there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously if most life was wiped </v>

2723
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.811
<v Speaker 1>out and the current life that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now exists post 65 million years </v>

2724
02:37:25.811 --> 02:37:26.000
<v Speaker 1>ago</v>

2725
02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:32.370
<v Speaker 5>following this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I do every week.</v>

2726
02:37:32.371 --> 02:37:35.790
<v Speaker 5>There's a new theory about what happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>65 million years ago.</v>

2727
02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:38.190
<v Speaker 5>We don't know and we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>

2728
02:37:38.370 --> 02:37:42.750
<v Speaker 5>we don't even know if there were people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's some pretty good.</v>

2729
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:46.810
<v Speaker 11>We still have an instance that dog to </v>
<v Speaker 11>settle down what I said,</v>

2730
02:37:46.811 --> 02:37:51.811
<v Speaker 11>tell that dog to settle down and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 11>going to tell him what's.</v>

2731
02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:58.750
<v Speaker 11>What kind of dog is it?</v>
<v Speaker 11>ThIs dude's awesome.</v>

2732

<v Speaker 11>theory before we take off.</v>

<v Speaker 5>into the goodwill when I.</v>

2743
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:30.520
<v Speaker 5>My first short story was published in </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] 57.</v>

2744
02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:35.530
<v Speaker 5>I went to the island of the visa in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>corinthian in the mediterranean.</v>

2745
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:38.930
<v Speaker 5>And these dogs stayed secure there.</v>

2746
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:43.070
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I wanted it.</v>

2747
02:38:43.710 --> 02:38:45.620
<v Speaker 11>They got me interested in needs at the </v>
<v Speaker 11>beginning.</v>

2748
02:38:45.790 --> 02:38:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ask you one more question </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the development of human beings.</v>

2749
02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Are you familiar with the work of </v>
<v Speaker 1>terence mckenna?</v>

2750
02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you familiar with his stoned ape </v>

2751
02:38:57.120 --> 02:38:57.120
<v Speaker 1>theory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2752
02:38:57.120 --> 02:38:58.460
<v Speaker 1>and I don't go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't go for it.</v>

2753
02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:05.260
<v Speaker 1>For the folks at home is the doubling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human brain size occurred over a </v>

2754
02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:09.911
<v Speaker 1>period of 2 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he coincides with the rain forest </v>

2755
02:39:09.911 --> 02:39:13.721
<v Speaker 1>receding into grasslands and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower hominids coming out of the trees </v>

2756
02:39:13.721 --> 02:39:16.790
<v Speaker 1>experimented with new food sources and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating psilocybin mushrooms.</v>

2757
02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2758
02:39:17.470 --> 02:39:22.470
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's actually funny because for </v>

2759
02:39:22.470 --> 02:39:24.030
<v Speaker 5>somebody who did a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of experimenting with I Alaska,</v>

2760
02:39:24.100 --> 02:39:26.380
<v Speaker 5>which I've also done excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2761
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:33.000
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's extrapolating and trying to make </v>

2762
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.500
<v Speaker 5>his experience fit in with darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 5>theory and he should know better than </v>

2763
02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:38.890
<v Speaker 5>that because it was a smart guy.</v>

2764
02:39:39.850 --> 02:39:41.810
<v Speaker 11>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you're feeling.</v>

2765
02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:43.210
<v Speaker 11>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 11>go ahead.</v>

2766
02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:44.260
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm,</v>

2767
02:39:44.261 --> 02:39:44.690
<v Speaker 11>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm,</v>

2768
02:39:44.790 --> 02:39:46.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm more inclined to think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2769
02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:47.820
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2770
02:39:49.570 --> 02:39:54.570
<v Speaker 5>virtually all of the ancient texts talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>about a kind of edenic state,</v>

2771
02:39:55.851 --> 02:39:58.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and enlightened states that we descended</v>

2772
02:39:58.811 --> 02:40:02.730
<v Speaker 5>from another word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We start at the top and degenerate.</v>

2773
02:40:03.130 --> 02:40:05.710
<v Speaker 5>And to me this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2774
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:09.150
<v Speaker 5>this is not so difficult to imaGine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this,</v>

2775
02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:14.400
<v Speaker 5>it happens often that things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the great teacher comes and everything </v>

2776
02:40:14.491 --> 02:40:15.290
<v Speaker 5>disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2777
02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:20.300
<v Speaker 5>we tend to think that everything's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology and it started off with an </v>

2778
02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:24.420
<v Speaker 5>18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>92 mercedes and suddenly we've got a </v>

2779
02:40:24.420 --> 02:40:27.840
<v Speaker 5>2012 ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But with Egypt for example,</v>

2780
02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:33.200
<v Speaker 5>it seems to be at its height at the very</v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning with no period of development </v>

2781
02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:33.200
<v Speaker 5>we don't know.</v>

2782
02:40:33.210 --> 02:40:38.210
<v Speaker 6>So it's Just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's such a massive mystery and your </v>

2783
02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:40.971
<v Speaker 6>all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your years of exploring it have </v>

2784
02:40:40.971 --> 02:40:40.971
<v Speaker 6>literally got you to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

2785
02:40:40.971 --> 02:40:41.650
<v Speaker 6>no one knows and not talking about it.</v>

2786
02:40:41.940 --> 02:40:44.910
<v Speaker 11>Nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Well anyway,</v>

2787
02:40:44.911 --> 02:40:46.560
<v Speaker 11>talking about it as though,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

2788
02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:47.980
<v Speaker 11>definitive terms.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

2789
02:40:48.090 --> 02:40:50.700
<v Speaker 11>in definitive terms,</v>
<v Speaker 11>just so crazy.</v>

2790
02:40:51.390 --> 02:40:53.340
<v Speaker 11>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we just plain don't know.</v>

2791
02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:56.640
<v Speaker 11>But one of the things you can depend on </v>
<v Speaker 11>actually</v>

2792
02:40:57.060 --> 02:41:02.060
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are you going to take your lessons </v>

2793
02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:06.291
<v Speaker 5>from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guys who invented the bobble head </v>

2794
02:41:06.291 --> 02:41:08.271
<v Speaker 5>doll and the atom bomb with the guys who</v>
<v Speaker 5>did shots and the temple of luxor and </v>

2795
02:41:08.361 --> 02:41:10.770
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the late quartets.</v>

2796
02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:16.100
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll go with the creatives any day </v>

2797
02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:16.100
<v Speaker 5>because I am one myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2798
02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:16.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

2799
02:41:17.010 --> 02:41:22.010
<v Speaker 6>How long was the period between the </v>
<v Speaker 6>decline of the old kingdom and the time </v>

2800
02:41:22.010 --> 02:41:23.750
<v Speaker 6>where they discovered the pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which were,</v>

2801
02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:25.860
<v Speaker 6>there was no one living in them when </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were discovered.</v>

2802
02:41:25.861 --> 02:41:26.430
<v Speaker 6>When,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

2803
02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:27.280
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2804
02:41:27.330 --> 02:41:31.150
<v Speaker 6>napoleon's army marched through Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was no one living in the,</v>

2805
02:41:31.230 --> 02:41:33.030
<v Speaker 6>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the pyramids like they,</v>

2806
02:41:33.570 --> 02:41:38.570
<v Speaker 11>where we lost a lot of information as </v>
<v Speaker 11>far as anyone knows to live in that </v>

2807
02:41:40.771 --> 02:41:42.270
<v Speaker 11>area.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Then there no one,</v>

2808
02:41:42.300 --> 02:41:44.310
<v Speaker 11>there weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They didn't habit that area.</v>

2809
02:41:44.930 --> 02:41:45.490
<v Speaker 11>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 11>sure.</v>

2810
02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:45.830
<v Speaker 11>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 11>good.</v>

2811
02:41:45.930 --> 02:41:47.760
<v Speaker 11>I mean it was all farmland around in </v>
<v Speaker 11>there.</v>

2812
02:41:48.010 --> 02:41:52.690
<v Speaker 5>They're in the desert with just a couple</v>
<v Speaker 5>of few hundred yards below with a sphinx</v>

2813
02:41:52.691 --> 02:41:54.370
<v Speaker 5>says this valley.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>

2814
02:41:54.371 --> 02:41:56.170
<v Speaker 5>So it's all farmland and everything.</v>

2815
02:41:57.520 --> 02:41:58.980
<v Speaker 6>So my point was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2816
02:41:58.981 --> 02:42:03.981
<v Speaker 6>what time did it all fall apart where it</v>
<v Speaker 6>was essentially the sphinx and the </v>

2817
02:42:03.981 --> 02:42:08.431
<v Speaker 6>pyramids and all that stopped being used</v>
<v Speaker 6>for what they were were abandoned and </v>

2818
02:42:08.431 --> 02:42:08.500
<v Speaker 6>then people had to come back to and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

2819
02:42:08.501 --> 02:42:09.210
<v Speaker 6>look at what we have.</v>

2820
02:42:10.580 --> 02:42:15.580
<v Speaker 5>You can sort of put a date in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The egyptian religion died shortly after</v>

2821
02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:19.030
<v Speaker 5>first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>second century add,</v>

2822
02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:24.320
<v Speaker 5>who was no longer being practiced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although the knowledge percolated down </v>

2823
02:42:24.931 --> 02:42:28.770
<v Speaker 5>into alexandria and dispersed around the</v>
<v Speaker 5>middle east,</v>

2824
02:42:28.771 --> 02:42:31.090
<v Speaker 5>the library of alexandria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was,</v>

2825
02:42:31.410 --> 02:42:36.410
<v Speaker 5>this was a hotbed of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of intellectual and philosophical </v>

2826
02:42:37.321 --> 02:42:39.180
<v Speaker 5>activity always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2827
02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:44.300
<v Speaker 5>alexandria was always there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the actual egyptian religion as </v>

2828
02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:45.600
<v Speaker 5>such,</v>
<v Speaker 5>died somewhere,</v>

2829
02:42:45.601 --> 02:42:47.520
<v Speaker 5>let's say in the middle of the third </v>
<v Speaker 5>century,</v>

2830
02:42:48.330 --> 02:42:53.330
<v Speaker 5>add letters and said earlier than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hermetic disciplines in alchemy and </v>

2831
02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:55.440
<v Speaker 5>astrology and magic and number </v>
<v Speaker 5>symbolism,</v>

2832
02:42:55.900 --> 02:43:00.900
<v Speaker 5>neoplatonism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of that knowledge continued </v>

2833
02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:01.590
<v Speaker 5>throughout,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2834
02:43:01.591 --> 02:43:03.980
<v Speaker 5>throughout european civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we know this,</v>

2835
02:43:04.030 --> 02:43:08.530
<v Speaker 5>the renaissance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the great figures of the renaissance.</v>

2836
02:43:08.531 --> 02:43:12.710
<v Speaker 5>So we're always credited with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with opening way out of superstition and</v>

2837
02:43:12.711 --> 02:43:13.840
<v Speaker 5>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2838
02:43:13.841 --> 02:43:15.220
<v Speaker 5>an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Modern science,</v>

2839
02:43:15.730 --> 02:43:20.730
<v Speaker 5>they did open the way to modern science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they themselves believe that their </v>

2840
02:43:20.730 --> 02:43:24.010
<v Speaker 5>own knowledge and kepler discovered the </v>
<v Speaker 5>laws of planetary motion.</v>

2841
02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:25.870
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've discovered the.</v>

2842
02:43:26.010 --> 02:43:28.420
<v Speaker 5>I really discovered the secrets of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>egyptians.</v>

2843
02:43:28.690 --> 02:43:32.410
<v Speaker 5>It was a given to them that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that all of this,</v>

2844
02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:35.380
<v Speaker 5>this advanced knowledge was available in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt,</v>

2845
02:43:35.650 --> 02:43:38.470
<v Speaker 5>but it was trawler who actually this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of his great,</v>

2846
02:43:38.770 --> 02:43:39.400
<v Speaker 5>great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great,</v>

2847
02:43:39.430 --> 02:43:42.520
<v Speaker 5>great contributions that human thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which weiler,</v>

2848
02:43:42.521 --> 02:43:45.490
<v Speaker 5>who proves that they had no mistaking it</v>

2849
02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:50.940
<v Speaker 6>and they had it and it came out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>nowhere and they had it and it came out </v>

2850
02:43:50.941 --> 02:43:54.450
<v Speaker 6>of nowhere and there was nothing before </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then all of a sudden this incredibly</v>

2851
02:43:54.451 --> 02:43:55.680
<v Speaker 6>intelligent civilization.</v>

2852
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:57.740
<v Speaker 5>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no you don't.</v>

2853
02:43:57.790 --> 02:43:58.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2854
02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:03.780
<v Speaker 5>Just too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You keep going back and they keep going </v>

2855
02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:04.980
<v Speaker 5>back in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The further they go back,</v>

2856
02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:10.560
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden they come across </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that disproves everything they</v>

2857
02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:13.710
<v Speaker 5>thought the floor look show gay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is wonderfuL.</v>

2858
02:44:13.740 --> 02:44:18.740
<v Speaker 5>This is spectacular art in the cave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How would those people living In that </v>

2859
02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:21.870
<v Speaker 5>television sets the bobble head dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you can tank like that,</v>

2860
02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:29.680
<v Speaker 5>you've got something serious going on </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside you and who says they invented </v>

2861
02:44:29.761 --> 02:44:32.010
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see the further back you go,</v>

2862
02:44:32.310 --> 02:44:34.920
<v Speaker 5>the more tenuous everything gets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Recently,</v>

2863
02:44:34.921 --> 02:44:39.470
<v Speaker 5>there've been some interesting studies </v>
<v Speaker 5>on flint knapping on,</v>

2864
02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:40.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in other words,</v>

2865
02:44:40.231 --> 02:44:45.231
<v Speaker 5>cutting flint to make to make different </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of tools with this is this is </v>

2866
02:44:45.231 --> 02:44:50.121
<v Speaker 5>actually a pretty advanced art and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're finding flint tools,</v>

2867
02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:55.410
<v Speaker 5>very sophisticated tools that go back </v>
<v Speaker 5>200,000</v>

2868
02:44:55.411 --> 02:44:56.310
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2869
02:44:56.311 --> 02:44:58.770
<v Speaker 5>what was going through their heads that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doing this stuff.</v>

2870
02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:01.140
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what was going through </v>
<v Speaker 5>their hearts.</v>

2871
02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:06.500
<v Speaker 5>They've discovered this is again only </v>
<v Speaker 5>the last couple of years that sea travel</v>

2872
02:45:06.961 --> 02:45:11.961
<v Speaker 5>was going on between north africa and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if it was cypress or some </v>

2873
02:45:11.961 --> 02:45:14.970
<v Speaker 5>of the greek islands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's either 100,000</v>

2874
02:45:14.971 --> 02:45:17.040
<v Speaker 5>years ago or 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

2875
02:45:18.210 --> 02:45:23.210
<v Speaker 5>So if you follow this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more the more that's discovered,</v>

2876
02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:29.960
<v Speaker 5>the more you become impressed that some </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of advanced knowledge was always </v>

2877
02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:34.551
<v Speaker 5>there and even that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is based upon a technological.</v>

2878
02:45:34.671 --> 02:45:39.671
<v Speaker 5>It's the only way we tend to think a </v>
<v Speaker 5>technological assessment of what they </v>

2879
02:45:39.671 --> 02:45:43.791
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what was going on inside </v>

2880
02:45:43.791 --> 02:45:43.791
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2881
02:45:43.791 --> 02:45:46.780
<v Speaker 6>We don't know how intelligent they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that the possibility is that they </v>

2882
02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:47.390
<v Speaker 6>were right for this intelligent from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>beginning.</v>

2883
02:45:48.570 --> 02:45:52.450
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it isn't even a question of </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence.</v>

2884
02:45:52.790 --> 02:45:56.320
<v Speaker 5>It's more requests and really a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

2885
02:45:56.470 --> 02:45:59.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean how much intelligence do you need</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2886
02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:04.960
<v Speaker 5>let's say it's to be moved like a dates </v>
<v Speaker 5>open courts at so you don't think about </v>

2887
02:46:04.991 --> 02:46:07.840
<v Speaker 5>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just we're brought up in such a way</v>

2888
02:46:07.860 --> 02:46:10.430
<v Speaker 5>by this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by this Nicholas Church and progress.</v>

2889
02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:15.880
<v Speaker 5>To think that you have to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>complex mathematics and all kinds of </v>

2890
02:46:16.911 --> 02:46:21.911
<v Speaker 5>stuff in order to be civilized and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>even even when even when you have that </v>

2891
02:46:21.951 --> 02:46:24.320
<v Speaker 5>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the further back you go,</v>

2892
02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:29.560
<v Speaker 5>you see that they had a cosmology and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see that they had a geometry and they </v>

2893
02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:33.701
<v Speaker 5>had technology to produce to go back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tap in the today.</v>

2894
02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:35.540
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the whole.</v>

2895
02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:40.670
<v Speaker 5>So the whole darwinian paradigm is </v>
<v Speaker 5>exploded.</v>

2896
02:46:40.671 --> 02:46:43.070
<v Speaker 5>When you take all of those things into </v>
<v Speaker 5>consideration,</v>

2897
02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:47.520
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that the dark darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>model works?</v>

2898
02:46:47.521 --> 02:46:52.521
<v Speaker 1>If you just take the timeline way back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then people evolved over hundreds of </v>

2899
02:46:52.521 --> 02:46:56.511
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years earlier than we </v>

2900
02:46:56.511 --> 02:46:56.511
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

2901
02:46:56.511 --> 02:46:56.760
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they say,</v>

2902
02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.770
<v Speaker 5>but why should it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

2903
02:46:58.980 --> 02:47:03.980
<v Speaker 5>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is there and the what is there and </v>

2904
02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:06.801
<v Speaker 5>the nature of the hydrogen atom that </v>
<v Speaker 5>presupposes that that things are going </v>

2905
02:47:06.801 --> 02:47:08.820
<v Speaker 5>to get more complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated.</v>

2906
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:10.410
<v Speaker 5>Who says,</v>

2907
02:47:11.130 --> 02:47:13.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say by our own designs on earth,</v>

2908
02:47:13.770 --> 02:47:15.480
<v Speaker 1>our own physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2909
02:47:15.481 --> 02:47:16.440
<v Speaker 1>our creations.</v>

2910
02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:21.660
<v Speaker 5>Should that be accidental?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're not be,</v>

2911
02:47:22.050 --> 02:47:27.050
<v Speaker 5>why should there not be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say I a plan to adjust this,</v>

2912
02:47:28.741 --> 02:47:31.780
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just as we grow from the fertilized ovum</v>

2913
02:47:32.170 --> 02:47:37.170
<v Speaker 5>and we go through this complex process </v>
<v Speaker 5>of gestation and then we're born and </v>

2914
02:47:37.170 --> 02:47:39.340
<v Speaker 5>then it's up to us with what we're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do with our lives and so on.</v>

2915
02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:41.290
<v Speaker 5>Who says that's an accident?</v>

2916
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:43.540
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2917
02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:46.350
<v Speaker 8>and we're not acting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2918
02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:49.760
<v Speaker 8>to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how do you Prove that accidents?</v>

2919
02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:53.850
<v Speaker 8>See these assholes who happened on </v>
<v Speaker 8>creativity in them?</v>

2920
02:47:54.270 --> 02:47:59.270
<v Speaker 8>Are determined,</v>
<v Speaker 8>make the world sound as meaningless as </v>

2921
02:47:59.270 --> 02:48:02.330
<v Speaker 8>they experience it as bland and </v>
<v Speaker 8>passionless and as devops,</v>

2922
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:06.290
<v Speaker 8>not deliberate</v>

2923
02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:11.580
<v Speaker 5>because they don't know any better and </v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact they hate creative people for </v>

2924
02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:11.580
<v Speaker 5>the most part.</v>

2925
02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the beautiful things about</v>

2926
02:48:12.841 --> 02:48:13.250
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2927
02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:16.670
<v Speaker 1>the title of your dvd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magical Egypt.</v>

2928
02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:22.900
<v Speaker 1>It really is really is and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thank you very much for coming on </v>

2929
02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:22.910
<v Speaker 1>the show today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2930
02:48:22.911 --> 02:48:27.140
<v Speaker 1>You've explained a lot of things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible detail.</v>

2931
02:48:27.350 --> 02:48:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It's been an honor to get to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions because I have been a huge fan</v>

2932
02:48:31.611 --> 02:48:36.611
<v Speaker 1>of your work for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years now and I'm a huge fan of </v>

2933
02:48:36.611 --> 02:48:38.400
<v Speaker 1>that dvd series and I would love to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually to Egypt with you someday.</v>

2934
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:40.030
<v Speaker 1>We should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should figure something out.</v>

2935
02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:45.040
<v Speaker 5>That's to be that eventual you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do is talk about it and get 10 people </v>

2936
02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:48.230
<v Speaker 5>from your very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very extensive store of people to go and</v>

2937
02:48:48.231 --> 02:48:49.160
<v Speaker 5>you can get a free trip.</v>

2938
02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can make that happen.</v>

2939
02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.740
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do it.</v>

2940
02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:55.630
<v Speaker 5>I say one thing because I have a list of</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that I want to talk about.</v>

2941
02:48:56.770 --> 02:48:58.700
<v Speaker 5>One of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2942
02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:01.770
<v Speaker 5>do you know gerald celente is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2943
02:49:02.390 --> 02:49:05.210
<v Speaker 5>A trends analyst and he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very interesting guys.</v>

2944
02:49:05.250 --> 02:49:07.020
<v Speaker 5>A colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his name before he,</v>

2945
02:49:07.100 --> 02:49:12.100
<v Speaker 5>he is working with them is I'm cold </v>
<v Speaker 5>writer and executive editor of the </v>

2946
02:49:12.421 --> 02:49:14.760
<v Speaker 5>trends journal and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's,</v>

2947
02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:21.040
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he forecasts is probably more accurate </v>

2948
02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:23.130
<v Speaker 5>over the last 30 years than anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we put out,</v>

2949
02:49:23.190 --> 02:49:24.600
<v Speaker 5>he puts out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we put out,</v>

2950
02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:26.780
<v Speaker 5>he puts it really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2951
02:49:26.820 --> 02:49:31.820
<v Speaker 5>something called the trends journal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very interesting because what he </v>

2952
02:49:32.461 --> 02:49:37.461
<v Speaker 5>sees coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was not pretty and these right a lot </v>

2953
02:49:38.821 --> 02:49:42.240
<v Speaker 5>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean I try,</v>

2954
02:49:42.250 --> 02:49:47.250
<v Speaker 5>I tried to tell people that it really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I'm talking the esotericism and </v>

2955
02:49:47.250 --> 02:49:50.640
<v Speaker 5>the ancient Egypt than the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the real civilization.</v>

2956
02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:53.640
<v Speaker 5>And gerald waS,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gerald is the,</v>

2957
02:49:53.730 --> 02:49:58.730
<v Speaker 5>between us and we've got really high </v>
<v Speaker 5>level people working is a brilliant </v>

2958
02:49:58.730 --> 02:50:02.901
<v Speaker 5>illustrator and we put out this journal </v>
<v Speaker 5>that light we.</v>

2959
02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:10.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean this thing is coming unstuck in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hurry and people don't individually and </v>

2960
02:50:11.401 --> 02:50:16.401
<v Speaker 5>collectively prepare florid that going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be unprepared.</v>

2961
02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:19.980
<v Speaker 5>And so we can add to the trends journal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a.</v>

2962
02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about a collapse in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

2963
02:50:22.071 --> 02:50:23.960
<v Speaker 1>the end of civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

2965
02:50:26.411 --> 02:50:28.120

<v Speaker 5>unless,</v>

2966
02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:32.770
<v Speaker 5>unless enough people act together </v>
<v Speaker 5>quickly and they probably won't.</v>

2967
02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:38.400

<v Speaker 5>You've got to get away plan.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2983
02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:29.330
<v Speaker 5>I know my daughter is looking after it </v>
<v Speaker 5>for me.</v>

2984
02:51:29.430 --> 02:51:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Tell your daughter to get you a twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a John Anthony weSt.</v>

2985
02:51:31.921 --> 02:51:36.921
<v Speaker 1>Twitter will populate that very quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people could find out about your </v>

2986
02:51:36.921 --> 02:51:36.921
<v Speaker 1>trips</v>

2987
02:51:37.060 --> 02:51:38.100
<v Speaker 5>because as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're.</v>

2988
02:51:38.410 --> 02:51:43.410
<v Speaker 5>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're reviving where reincarnating our </v>

2989
02:51:43.410 --> 02:51:44.730
<v Speaker 5>ancient wisdom foundation and by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

2990
02:51:44.731 --> 02:51:47.490
<v Speaker 5>I always put a plug in that before we </v>
<v Speaker 5>end up because it's.</v>

2991
02:51:48.330 --> 02:51:53.330
<v Speaker 5>I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're pretty sure I can't be a </v>

2992
02:51:53.330 --> 02:51:54.330
<v Speaker 5>promise yet that we've got this </v>
<v Speaker 5>incentive thing going and if you pull up</v>

2993
02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:59.360
<v Speaker 5>ancient wisdom foundation.org,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll be some information about the </v>

2994
02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:04.131
<v Speaker 5>projects that we're involved in and and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do believe that that unless,</v>

2995
02:52:05.890 --> 02:52:10.890
<v Speaker 5>unless enough of us have humanity goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>back to recreates the civilization based</v>

2996
02:52:15.071 --> 02:52:17.680
<v Speaker 5>upon the ancient principles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

2997
02:52:17.681 --> 02:52:22.681
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to be build pyramids </v>
<v Speaker 5>again or mummify or arrows or anything </v>

2998
02:52:22.681 --> 02:52:23.750
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

2999
02:52:23.751 --> 02:52:26.000
<v Speaker 5>the principals meet needs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's a one issue,</v>

3000
02:52:26.030 --> 02:52:31.030
<v Speaker 5>civilization is it's based upon the </v>
<v Speaker 5>quest for immortality above the notion </v>

3001
02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:34.150
<v Speaker 5>of the immortality of the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I absolutely believe in,</v>

3002
02:52:34.590 --> 02:52:38.050
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and without that,</v>

3003
02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:39.880
<v Speaker 5>no civilization as possible.</v>

3004
02:52:40.290 --> 02:52:45.290
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the principles upon which Egypt and </v>

3005
02:52:45.290 --> 02:52:50.011
<v Speaker 5>the other instance civilizations are </v>
<v Speaker 5>founded is the principles are eternal in</v>

3006
02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:57.630
<v Speaker 5>civilization has passed when I said </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to multiply our parents </v>

3007
02:52:57.630 --> 02:53:00.991
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but without that understanding and </v>

3008
02:53:00.991 --> 02:53:03.160
<v Speaker 5>without an understanding of where we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>heading at the moment.</v>

3009
02:53:03.161 --> 02:53:04.750
<v Speaker 5>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a scary stuff out there.</v>

3010
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:08.920
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it is valid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but most of the scare stuff doesn't have</v>

3011
02:53:08.921 --> 02:53:12.400
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the antidote built into it.</v>

3012
02:53:13.090 --> 02:53:18.090
<v Speaker 5>And I like to think that that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think like the conversation we just </v>

3013
02:53:18.091 --> 02:53:23.091
<v Speaker 5>had is one of none of despair but have </v>
<v Speaker 5>the possibility of renaissance and </v>

3014
02:53:24.850 --> 02:53:29.850
<v Speaker 5>light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not something known as let's say a </v>

3015
02:53:29.850 --> 02:53:34.030
<v Speaker 5>spiritual doctrine is not something you </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe in.</v>

3016
02:53:34.090 --> 02:53:38.740
<v Speaker 5>Believes is useless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not something you do do it</v>

3017
02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:39.660
<v Speaker 7>well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>John.</v>

3018
02:53:39.661 --> 02:53:44.661
<v Speaker 7>I think also there's just the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 7>spread that kind of information </v>

3019
02:53:44.661 --> 02:53:46.650
<v Speaker 7>knowledge to people and to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 7>it in a forum like this.</v>

3020
02:53:46.651 --> 02:53:51.651
<v Speaker 7>It's very rare and very new and I think </v>
<v Speaker 7>that the internet and this open access </v>

3021
02:53:51.651 --> 02:53:55.941
<v Speaker 7>to information that we have on it is one</v>
<v Speaker 7>of the best hopes that we have for </v>

3022
02:53:55.941 --> 02:53:57.930
<v Speaker 7>turning this whole thing around and </v>
<v Speaker 7>thank you very much my friend.</v>
