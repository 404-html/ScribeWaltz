1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Trying my day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 1>There's very few things that are as</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful as listening to bad corner work.</v>

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fun.</v>

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went down to his liver and a quarter I</v>

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just read.</v>

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't want him to throw a right hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

7
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let him keep that here so the liver is</v>

8
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.700
<v Speaker 1>protected and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>that's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

10
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Who Does it see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch the fights this weekend?</v>

11
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

12
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>What did you think about steep and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allison?</v>

13
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

14
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might differ.</v>

15
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Or three or four last punches you gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>there on an inch.</v>

16
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 2>They're all exact at the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got really good precision.</v>

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stopped him and he got hit hard.</v>

18
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 2>He waved it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then that guillotine and we know 11</v>

19
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 2>guillotines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that he had beats right and</v>

20
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 2>tight once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People being a one time I say,</v>

21
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

22
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a really tight guilty.</v>

23
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 2>But he got out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in a.</v>

24
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 2>he's a freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really is,</v>

25
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 2>and he's a very likable guy.</v>

26
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve is a good guy.</v>

27
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about his composure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>

28
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So composed like in Brazil when he</v>

29
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>fought for breach you to stare down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just dead faced.</v>

30
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>He's got his own dead face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a fade or dead face or</v>

31
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>cane dead phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his own dead phase,</v>

32
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>but those guys that can just stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely calm,</v>

33
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that incredible environment of being</v>

34
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>there in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty 5,000 plus people screaming for</v>

35
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>breezy overdue and he just shuts his</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights out.</v>

36
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>One of the things on our own or our main</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle right,</v>

37
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>is being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to control ourselves and he's looks to</v>

38
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>have mastered that ability to control</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own emotions,</v>

39
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 1>to make sure he's directing the energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the right path.</v>

40
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>So Steep Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good job.</v>

41
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Could ask Papa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be interesting to see if</v>

43
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>someone got into his head the way like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and dominic were going after each</v>

44
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:47.410
<v Speaker 1>other or the way connor got into all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those head?</v>

45
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess that was a masterclass and fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when someone's head absolutely mean</v>

46
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 1>connor took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although completely out of his element</v>

47
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>where he was just so frazzled by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time they actually met each other inside</v>

48
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

49
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I think we're at the overeem and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shameless Hoven Rosie.</v>

50
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Rosie's intimidating everybody the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is and she wants.</v>

51
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 2>She stood at the stare down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when she lost because she</v>

52
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 2>realized holly didn't care at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just there.</v>

53
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

54
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same as everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimidated by overeem and you shouldn't</v>

55
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 2>be because he's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think over and could see in his</v>

56
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 2>face already hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not intimidated.</v>

57
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 2>This guy has absolutely no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you fight a guy like that,</v>

58
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little voice starts playing in</v>

59
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your mind when it gets bad,</v>

60
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why maybe we saw these crazy</v>

61
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 2>things of running away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say it's a good thing because I said</v>

63
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess Cortland Mcgregor,</v>

64
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a big,</v>

65
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>huge heavy weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look good,</v>

66
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now you,</v>

67
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 2>you set yourself up more as effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's following you in fact.</v>

68
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 2>And that all is an input in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your own brain because now you start</v>

69
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 2>telling yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

70
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 2>everybody thinks I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm hurt or that I'm afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I afraid I'm,</v>

72
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the whole cow thing that goes on</v>

73
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 2>in the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always these two forces I say to</v>

74
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>one force wants to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Yoda voice wants to go,</v>

75
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

76
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 2>you're a really bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then say,</v>

77
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call it quits Colloquy,</v>

78
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.790
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait to know that.</v>

79
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just see what happens,</v>

80
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then suddenly you come out of the</v>

81
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>situation like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about to step in my second fight</v>

82
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>and then the audience started cheering</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him and then my ego to go over.</v>

83
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:22.631
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

84
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I get out of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then 30 seconds later I knocked him</v>

85
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>out with the need to deliver and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

86
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 2>this is the last time I'm going to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that because before the I stay away</v>

87
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 2>from the bad voice.</v>
