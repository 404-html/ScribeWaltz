<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

41

<v Speaker 2>getting you to do shit,</v>

42
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like no matter how hard you push yourself,</v>

43
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't quite push yourself as if not even close man.</v>

44
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Someone else does it.</v>

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

46
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what I don't push myself.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just started doing that recently.</v>

50
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad ass.</v>

51
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I do it for,</v>

52
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 2>I hire somebody once every once in a while for like a month and I'm like,</v>

53
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.023
<v Speaker 2>that's just too hard.</v>

54
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I got Justin,</v>

55
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 2>he trains in my gym and he would,</v>

56
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 2>we would,</v>

57
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.811
<v Speaker 2>I would watch him,</v>

58
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:30.461
<v Speaker 2>his train and I'm like,</v>

59
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 2>this guy never gets fucking tired.</v>

60
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 2>So I said like,</v>

61
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing for conditioning?</v>

62
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 2>He told me he's a trainer and so I said,</v>

63
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:37.210
<v Speaker 2>let me one more time.</v>

64
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Which one day he had me doing all kinds.</v>

65
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 2>How long the workouts are you doing?</v>

66
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

67
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.100
<v Speaker 2>it's only an hour.</v>

68
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 2>That's all I can tell you.</v>

69
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 2>But intense hour is tarted,</v>

70
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

71
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 2>It's all like Madison balls and jumping over this and jumping squats and all</v>

72
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:56.821
<v Speaker 2>this nutty tracking on the field shit and jumping over boxes and pushups left to</v>

73
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:57.731
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

74
00:01:57.731 --> 00:01:58.241
<v Speaker 2>left to right,</v>

75
00:01:58.241 --> 00:01:58.451
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

76
00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:58.601
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

77
00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 2>like all this crazy like conditioning type shit.</v>

78
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck.</v>

79
00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Is it hard to do whenever every time I've done a workout with a trainer and it's</v>

80
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 2>been like an hour,</v>

81
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm always amazed at how little I usually accomplish in an hour.</v>

82
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.131
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

83
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Cause like you finished with the trainer and you're like,</v>

84
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.801
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

85
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.190
<v Speaker 2>we did all,</v>

86
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 2>we did that in an hour.</v>

87
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I usually spend an hour and I do a fraction of one of those things.</v>

88
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to</v>

89
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.140
<v Speaker 1>really fucking bucks down,</v>

90
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 2>feel it a little bit.</v>

91
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I could do it every now and again,</v>

92
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 2>but I think on a regular basis sometimes you need to take a class or you got to</v>

93
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 2>have somebody yell at you.</v>

94
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like working with a deadline.</v>

95
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Like you were working on a deadline and you analyze what you accomplish and</v>

96
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

97
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 2>and then when you're on your own again,</v>

98
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

99
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

100
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.311
<v Speaker 2>you feel like it.</v>

101
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:42.061
<v Speaker 2>Lazy Bitch.</v>

102
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with me?</v>

103
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I am always,</v>

104
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with a deadline a few times from the road and I'm like,</v>

105
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

106
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.570
<v Speaker 2>how much work I just accomplished this weekend?</v>

107
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 2>And then it's usually the,</v>

108
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.361
<v Speaker 2>the opposite thought.</v>

109
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:54.511
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

110
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

111
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I went the entire weekend without doing one product.</v>

112
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I got up and I went down to do the show and I dropped off four times.</v>

113
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 2>That's the day.</v>

114
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much time you can waste.</v>

115
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.413
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing,</v>

116
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's a crazy feeling when you set the bar really high and you accomplish</v>

117
00:03:12.081 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>something and like you short period of time,</v>

118
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>you accomplish a lot of things because then you know,</v>

119
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you've got to keep that pace up.</v>

120
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

121
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.383
<v Speaker 1>that's brutal.</v>

122
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

123
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.793
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

124
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.963
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard.</v>

125
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>That creative pace,</v>

126
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 1>this has nothing to do with on a.com or cattle.</v>

127
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>That was a fun time.</v>

128
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.671
<v Speaker 1>But whatever,</v>

129
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:28.504

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

149
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

150
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.453
<v Speaker 1>It does it,</v>

151
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.413
<v Speaker 1>I should know that.</v>

152
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's Google it.</v>

153
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>because it's what don't do it.</v>

155
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think what it does?</v>

156
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.024
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

157
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>did you get bill blade?</v>

158
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it's five HTP,</v>

159
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

160
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>produces a,</v>

161
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Speaker 1>it makes your brain produce serotonin and l tryptofan converts to five HTP.</v>

162
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 1>So it like literally it's like a,</v>

163
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:26.191
<v Speaker 1>it acts as sort of a time released formula for helping your body produce</v>

164
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>essentially what makes you happy.</v>

165
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.523
<v Speaker 2>But people have heard,</v>

166
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.580
<v Speaker 2>cause I haven't tried it,</v>

167
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard other people talk about since they started it,</v>

168
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 2>they sleep better.</v>

169
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.490
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

170
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.151
<v Speaker 1>they told me that,</v>

171
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:36.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>zinc and zinc is a good one.</v>

175
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:40.891
<v Speaker 1>That zinc,</v>

176
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:41.910
<v Speaker 1>magnesium stuff.</v>

177
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>That stuff was good.</v>

178
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

179
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.571
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

180

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.570
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people have good success with Melatonin.</v>

187
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Melatonin has a,</v>

188
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

189
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I've tried Valerian root,</v>

190
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.170
<v Speaker 2>but that would get that Gamey psychadelic dream crazy dreams.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like nature sleeping.</v>

197
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.910
<v Speaker 1>The craziest Shit I've ever done is the Alpha brain dreams.</v>

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain especially.</v>

201
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:21.301
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the,</v>

202
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:21.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:24.090
<v Speaker 1>the old formula may be fucked with your head even more.</v>

204
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.051
<v Speaker 1>The real formula,</v>

205
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 1>either that or I'm used to it,</v>

206
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

207
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

208
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.240
<v Speaker 1>but what it used to do to me was giving me these crazy lucid dreams.</v>

209
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.650
<v Speaker 1>There were really strange because there were so much more like potent than my</v>

210
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:41.490
<v Speaker 1>normal dreams.</v>

211
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

212
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

213
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.220
<v Speaker 1>this is how I describe it.</v>

214
00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like my normal dreams or like a bubble that a kid would</v>

215
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 2>below and they're blowing those soap bubbles.</v>

216
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like so fragile.</v>

217
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:52.834
<v Speaker 2>It's so fragile.</v>

218
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 2>These dreams were like basketballs.</v>

219
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Like they were hard,</v>

220
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:57.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

221
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Like they were real.</v>

222
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

223
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>it was really strange because it was like I was aware that I was dreaming,</v>

224
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>but I was still able to maintain the dream state.</v>

225
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to do that before.</v>

226
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

227
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we've been able to do that for like reef seconds.</v>

228
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried.</v>

229
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's this thing called,</v>

230
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:15.164
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

231
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.430
<v Speaker 1>a lucid dreaming where you can actually practice certain techniques that can aid</v>

232
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>you and into literally manipulating your dreams.</v>

233
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.363
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

234
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:26.031
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

236
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:26.864
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried it.</v>

237
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm too scared that I would like that too much and I'm fucking forget real life.</v>

238
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking bad ass and my dreams a dream.</v>

239
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

240
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:35.271
<v Speaker 1>it'd be worried.</v>

241
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I would be worried that I wasn't dedicated enough time to real life.</v>

242
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

243
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 3>that's like virtual living,</v>

244
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:40.731
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

245
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

246
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

247
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 3>there are times when you wake up from a dream,</v>

248
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:43.431
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

249
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 3>the dream was so awesome.</v>

250
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.830
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

251
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 3>She kind of go back to sleep and I don't know if anybody's that much of a master</v>

252
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 3>that they can really control it that,</v>

253
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 3>but there's somebody like that.</v>

254
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 3>If I focus on what I want to dream about next.</v>

255
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I just did it yesterday.</v>

256
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.391
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why,</v>

257
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 3>but I wanted to dream about Phyllis Diller.</v>

258
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 3>I was like obsessed with her yesterday on my dream about Phyllis Diller and I</v>

259
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 3>went to sleep and I did Phyllis Diller.</v>

260
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:05.301

<v Speaker 3>Why were you obsessed with Phyllis Diller?</v>

262
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I think because,</v>

263

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

264

265
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 3>and Phyllis Diller sent me like a note that I had framed.</v>

266
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Like she encouraged me before she died in my career.</v>

267
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 3>So I just have this bond with her.</v>

268
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.231
<v Speaker 3>I love her.</v>

269

00:09:07.391 --> 00:09:08.320
<v Speaker 1>You fuck you work here.</v>

329
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

330
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.133
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>

331
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll find it.</v>

332
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll find that URL while I do this.</v>

333
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.030
<v Speaker 1>But what's important is what ting is.</v>

334
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.880
<v Speaker 1>And Ting is a cell phone company that uses sprints,</v>

335
00:09:18.881 --> 00:09:21.220
<v Speaker 1>backbone and um,</v>

336
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:21.760
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

337
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.150
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

338
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.560
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they make it really fair and they don't have any contracts.</v>

339
00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:27.910
<v Speaker 1>You can quit whenever you want.</v>

340
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the same service that you get with sprint,</v>

341
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's like they,</v>

342
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.550
<v Speaker 1>they don't have you as locked in to this.</v>

343
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Just sort of a shitty situation that you can get in with a regular cell phone</v>

344
00:09:38.441 --> 00:09:39.250
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

345
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.240
<v Speaker 1>regular cell phone company.</v>

346
00:09:40.241 --> 00:09:41.290
<v Speaker 1>When you buy a phone,</v>

347
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.690
<v Speaker 1>like say if you buy a phone and it costs like 500 bucks,</v>

348
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.150
<v Speaker 1>what it really costs us probably more than that.</v>

349
00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.130
<v Speaker 1>It probably really costs like 700 bucks.</v>

350
00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:48.560
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

351
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.900
<v Speaker 1>they take it and they apply it to your contract so that if you are going to</v>

352
00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:56.800
<v Speaker 1>stick with them for three years and give them x amount of dollars a month,</v>

353
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.880
<v Speaker 1>then it's worth it for them to sorta take that money,</v>

354
00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:02.860
<v Speaker 1>take a little piece of that and pay off that phone.</v>

355
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.281
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

356
00:10:03.281 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Speaker 1>when you want to leave early,</v>

357
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:09.190
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have to pay these cancellations places like several hundred</v>

358
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.220
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

359
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.620
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen with Ting.</v>

361
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.380
<v Speaker 1>You can get the exact same services you get with sprint.</v>

362
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's like really good cell phone service is shit.</v>

363
00:10:17.381 --> 00:10:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz swears by and it's um,</v>

562
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.573
<v Speaker 4>Big Badge.</v>

<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

584
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:42.020
<v Speaker 6>Just in life you go there like,</v>

585
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.261
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

586
00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 6>you know I've decided to do this.</v>

587
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:44.571
<v Speaker 6>I'm a woman now,</v>

588
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:44.871
<v Speaker 6>and you go,</v>

589
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:45.430
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

590
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.621
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

591
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:46.401
<v Speaker 6>you want to be like,</v>

592
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:46.701
<v Speaker 6>fine,</v>

593
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:47.534
<v Speaker 6>you're a woman now.</v>

594
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.810
<v Speaker 6>But there's that part in my mind that always goes,</v>

595
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

596
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.450
<v Speaker 6>but when I look at your hands,</v>

597
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 6>even if you've had surgery and everything,</v>

598
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 6>those are still man men's hands.</v>

599
00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:57.900
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

600
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.320
<v Speaker 6>Those are men's arms that you have and legs.</v>

601
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 6>Even if you have like implants in and you change your whole face,</v>

602
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:07.070
<v Speaker 6>like that's still a guys bicep and your arm,</v>

603
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 6>even though you had a sex change,</v>

604
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:09.921
<v Speaker 6>so you're still,</v>

605
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 6>so if you think that's a sports,</v>

606
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

607
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 6>that's where it all counts.</v>

608
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.930
<v Speaker 6>That's where your original</v>

609
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.960
<v Speaker 4>allergies the other way as well,</v>

610
00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:21.190
<v Speaker 4>because there was a guy who is a Meu tie fighter and he was really like a high</v>

611
00:17:21.191 --> 00:17:26.191
<v Speaker 4>level fighter and he decided to get a sex change and then once you get a sex</v>

612
00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:26.501
<v Speaker 4>change,</v>

613
00:17:26.501 --> 00:17:26.861
<v Speaker 4>he literally,</v>

614
00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:27.760
<v Speaker 4>he got his balls cut off,</v>

615
00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:30.420
<v Speaker 4>stop producing testosterone and started getting the fuck beat out.</v>

616
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.363
<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>

617
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.530
<v Speaker 4>He was still fighting men.</v>

618
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.011
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

619
00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:33.791
<v Speaker 4>he's still fighting men,</v>

620
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:34.810
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't have balls anymore.</v>

621
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.900
<v Speaker 4>So it's not exactly that.</v>

622
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.450
<v Speaker 4>This six foot tall person that was a man.</v>

623
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.920
<v Speaker 4>And I see what you're saying.</v>

624
00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:43.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm a woman is a woman,</v>

625
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 4>but it's not exactly that is a man either.</v>

626
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.770
<v Speaker 4>He's sort of in this weird limbo state.</v>

627
00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

628
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.400
<v Speaker 4>But he still this unfair mechanical advantage.</v>

629
00:17:51.401 --> 00:17:52.630
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant person.</v>

630
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.370
<v Speaker 4>He's got huge shoulders,</v>

631
00:17:54.371 --> 00:17:55.240
<v Speaker 4>huge hands.</v>

632
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.920
<v Speaker 4>If you're playing against a little girl,</v>

633
00:17:56.921 --> 00:17:57.760
<v Speaker 4>that's just stupid.</v>

634
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

635
00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:58.251
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

636
00:17:58.251 --> 00:18:01.460
<v Speaker 6>and it is like those athletes then they weren't they saying that the people that</v>

637
00:18:01.461 --> 00:18:03.410
<v Speaker 6>had prosthetic limbs,</v>

638
00:18:03.411 --> 00:18:05.300
<v Speaker 6>like the runners with those special,</v>

639
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.441
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean,</v>

640
00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:07.274
<v Speaker 6>those legs,</v>

641
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 6>but they're like,</v>

642
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

643
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.890
<v Speaker 6>it's an unfair advantage.</v>

644
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.180
<v Speaker 6>So lucky to be criminal.</v>

645
00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:12.110
<v Speaker 6>One guy made it in.</v>

646
00:18:12.111 --> 00:18:12.520
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

647
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:12.770
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

648
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.161
<v Speaker 6>I don't want,</v>

649
00:18:13.161 --> 00:18:14.580
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to say that.</v>

650
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.320
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

651
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.200
<v Speaker 6>that anybody would be lucky to be critical.</v>

652
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.790
<v Speaker 6>But they were saying that,</v>

653
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think they were really saying that.</v>

654
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.140
<v Speaker 4>What they're really saying.</v>

655
00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

656
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.610
<v Speaker 4>realistically,</v>

657
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.050
<v Speaker 4>let's look at what's going on here.</v>

658
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.380
<v Speaker 4>There's a mechanical advantage to those things that surpasses the human body.</v>

659
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 4>Like these are springs.</v>

660
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 4>You're running on these crazy sprinting springs.</v>

661
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

662
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.281
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

663
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:35.611
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

664
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:37.230
<v Speaker 4>those things work like a motherfucker.</v>

665
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.910
<v Speaker 4>So if they're really the,</v>

666
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.070
<v Speaker 4>it seems like they work better than legs.</v>

667
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

668
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.720
<v Speaker 6>That is one thing that can happen for sure.</v>

669
00:18:44.721 --> 00:18:46.910
<v Speaker 6>What goes on is you cannot tear your Achilles.</v>

670
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:47.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

671
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.500
<v Speaker 6>It's like it literally,</v>

672
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.393
<v Speaker 6>you don't have one.</v>

673
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.151
<v Speaker 6>You can't,</v>

674
00:18:50.151 --> 00:18:50.600
<v Speaker 6>you can't.</v>

675
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.270
<v Speaker 6>You can't tear your ACL if it's up to your quad.</v>

676
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:53.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

677
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

678
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:54.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

679
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.060
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing is really,</v>

680
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.511
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

681
00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:59.380
<v Speaker 4>you would never want to say that there's anyone that has any sort of an</v>

682
00:18:59.381 --> 00:19:00.800
<v Speaker 4>advantage to being handy.</v>

683
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.541
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

684
00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:02.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

685
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.950
<v Speaker 4>it's a sensitive issue.</v>

686
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

687
00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:05.780
<v Speaker 4>we're all very lucky that we're not.</v>

688
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.400
<v Speaker 4>Thank God.</v>

689
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:06.911
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

690
00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:07.700
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

691
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.180
<v Speaker 4>When you do see like that you can run faster with that.</v>

692
00:19:11.181 --> 00:19:14.960
<v Speaker 4>Like at what point in time do you let that go off the world record becomes a guy</v>

693
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:15.170
<v Speaker 4>with</v>

694
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.070
<v Speaker 6>robot legs.</v>

695
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:16.880
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

696
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.391
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

697
00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:18.890
<v Speaker 6>Like how do you define the athletics?</v>

698
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.560
<v Speaker 6>Like that guy was in the Olympics this summer with prosthetics.</v>

699
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.403
<v Speaker 6>Remember that?</v>

700
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.091
<v Speaker 6>The spinner,</v>

701
00:19:23.091 --> 00:19:24.050
<v Speaker 6>was he South African?</v>

702
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.650
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

703
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:25.760
<v Speaker 6>I forget where he was from.</v>

704
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.541
<v Speaker 6>I think he was,</v>

705
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:27.410
<v Speaker 6>but he,</v>

706
00:19:27.411 --> 00:19:27.830
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

707
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.960
<v Speaker 6>it was cool to see him in the event.</v>

708
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:30.740
<v Speaker 6>He didn't,</v>

709
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.730
<v Speaker 6>he didn't win or metal,</v>

710
00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:33.980
<v Speaker 6>which made it less of an issue.</v>

711
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:34.550
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

712
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.331
<v Speaker 6>people didn't press it,</v>

713
00:19:35.331 --> 00:19:36.860
<v Speaker 6>but they were pressing it before he got in.</v>

714
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.880
<v Speaker 6>Everybody was,</v>

715
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.920
<v Speaker 6>people were saying that South African run.</v>

716
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.290
<v Speaker 6>Remember Africa was she,</v>

717
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.810
<v Speaker 6>she was both genders or something and everyone was upset?</v>

718
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.250
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

719
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:45.831
<v Speaker 6>Well that was,</v>

720
00:19:45.831 --> 00:19:48.680
<v Speaker 6>people were accusing her of being,</v>

721
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.280
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

722
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.680
<v Speaker 6>a hermaphrodite and they put her throat.</v>

723
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.630
<v Speaker 6>She at the end of the day,</v>

724
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.021
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

725
00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:54.500
<v Speaker 6>it's the shoes.</v>

726
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.220
<v Speaker 6>She's a woman.</v>

727
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.160
<v Speaker 6>But she was put through like really brutal,</v>

728
00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.180
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

729
00:19:59.180 --> 00:19:59.571
<v Speaker 6>exam.</v>

730
00:19:59.571 --> 00:20:00.530
<v Speaker 6>I read the scrutiny.</v>

731
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:00.851
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

732
00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:01.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

733
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:01.370
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

734
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.440
<v Speaker 6>and they were people were people definitely as a woman,</v>

735
00:20:03.441 --> 00:20:04.040
<v Speaker 6>100%.</v>

736
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

737
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm almost certain,</v>

738
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.470
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

739
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.861
<v Speaker 6>I forget,</v>

740
00:20:06.861 --> 00:20:08.570
<v Speaker 6>I just forgot her name blanked on her name too,</v>

741
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.210
<v Speaker 6>but she is South African and uh,</v>

742
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.470
<v Speaker 6>yeah and the country,</v>

743
00:20:12.471 --> 00:20:15.020
<v Speaker 6>they adore her because she was so,</v>

744
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.291
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

745
00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:15.680
<v Speaker 6>cause they were,</v>

746
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.640
<v Speaker 6>people really were,</v>

747
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.280
<v Speaker 6>were horrible to her like during the,</v>

748
00:20:19.281 --> 00:20:20.270
<v Speaker 6>you know the scribe.</v>

749
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:20.511
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

750
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:20.840
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

751
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.380
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

752
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:21.531
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

753
00:20:21.531 --> 00:20:22.364
<v Speaker 6>But she's,</v>

754
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.230
<v Speaker 6>I'm fairly certain she's legitimately,</v>

755
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:29.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you go through the trouble of of cotton your Peter off and doing all</v>

756
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:29.510
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

757
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.190
<v Speaker 6>like just let the guy let the girl,</v>

758
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.203
<v Speaker 6>but that's not her.</v>

759
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:32.451
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

760
00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:34.550
<v Speaker 4>No problem is it's not let her play basketball,</v>

761
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.350
<v Speaker 4>play basketball with a little girl.</v>

762
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.200
<v Speaker 4>What school does all these like little girls that are playing there?</v>

763
00:20:39.201 --> 00:20:40.520
<v Speaker 4>Like they just went to college.</v>

764
00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.360
<v Speaker 4>The 18.</v>

765
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.980
<v Speaker 4>This is a 50 year old man.</v>

766
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.570
<v Speaker 4>That was crazy.</v>

767
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.120
<v Speaker 4>That one is crazy.</v>

768
00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.730
<v Speaker 4>What school is he?</v>

769
00:20:47.731 --> 00:20:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Is</v>

770
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.380
<v Speaker 2>this Lucy here?</v>

771
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

772
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.820
<v Speaker 2>You're white.</v>

773
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.481
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

774
00:20:54.481 --> 00:20:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

775
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

776
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

777
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.620
<v Speaker 2>God bless him his whole life.</v>

778
00:20:58.621 --> 00:21:00.640
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to be on the ladies' team.</v>

779
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.711
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>

780
00:21:01.711 --> 00:21:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

781
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Sort of,</v>

782
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's not fair.</v>

783
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just not,</v>

784
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.340
<v Speaker 2>the problem is once you start having competitive athletics,</v>

785
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like ended.</v>

786
00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.560
<v Speaker 2>But then the other thing in life,</v>

787
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.850
<v Speaker 2>it's do whatever you want to do.</v>

788
00:21:14.851 --> 00:21:16.260
<v Speaker 2>If you want to go to work with a dress,</v>

789
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.161
<v Speaker 2>if you're nice,</v>

790
00:21:17.161 --> 00:21:17.994
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to you.</v>

791
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

792
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.750
<v Speaker 2>It was more of you to dress like a man if you were,</v>

793
00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

794
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever your fucking thing is.</v>

795
00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:23.363
<v Speaker 2>If you're nice,</v>

796
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:23.971
<v Speaker 2>I don't care,</v>

797
00:21:23.971 --> 00:21:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to you I,</v>

798
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but when you have to recognize the mechanical advantages to the male frame,</v>

799
00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.710
<v Speaker 2>of course the tendon strength.</v>

800
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Even when there's a depletion of testosterone and your body showed us shrivels</v>

801
00:21:36.121 --> 00:21:37.770
<v Speaker 2>up a little bit and then you lose muscle mass.</v>

802
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.440
<v Speaker 2>It's still a God damn man.</v>

803
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.350
<v Speaker 2>And the overwhelming evidence is if you look at men's verse,</v>

804
00:21:43.351 --> 00:21:47.280
<v Speaker 2>if you line up men's and women's results for athletic competition,</v>

805
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

806
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a depth.</v>

807
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why every single one,</v>

808
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:54.320
<v Speaker 2>basically the men are more advanced and they're there,</v>

809
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.343
<v Speaker 2>they run faster,</v>

810
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.233
<v Speaker 2>jump higher,</v>

811
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.260
<v Speaker 2>but then you guys are going to get like the anomalies,</v>

812
00:21:58.261 --> 00:22:01.920
<v Speaker 2>like every now and then there is a woman that can do as many pushups as the male</v>

813
00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:03.000
<v Speaker 2>marines or whatever.</v>

814
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.660
<v Speaker 2>They have the same athletic standards.</v>

815
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.361
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

816
00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you might get a group of weak guys,</v>

817
00:22:10.761 --> 00:22:11.900
<v Speaker 1>one really strong girl.</v>

818
00:22:11.901 --> 00:22:13.500
<v Speaker 1>But if you have all the guys,</v>

819
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.920
<v Speaker 1>you have just the strongest guys in the strongest girls.</v>

820
00:22:15.921 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's strong as Christ this.</v>

821
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.230
<v Speaker 1>There are fucking freaks out there.</v>

822
00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

823
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some of these guys in the UFC that fine.</v>

824
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.621
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

825
00:22:24.621 --> 00:22:24.980
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

826
00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.200
<v Speaker 1>five rounds and don't even get fucking tired.</v>

827
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

828
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.540
<v Speaker 1>What kind of incredible shape.</v>

829
00:22:29.541 --> 00:22:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Some of those fucking guys are amazing,</v>

830
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.300
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

831
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Some high level shit.</v>

832
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.860
<v Speaker 1>And at that level that those men,</v>

833
00:22:36.861 --> 00:22:37.241
<v Speaker 1>those like,</v>

834
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:39.260
<v Speaker 1>like the really high level men,</v>

835
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.220
<v Speaker 1>like there's nothing like that that when women can't really keep up with that.</v>

836
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

837
00:22:43.491 --> 00:22:43.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

838
00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.761
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the,</v>

839
00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:44.971
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

840
00:22:44.971 --> 00:22:49.971
<v Speaker 1>the big accusation against this one woman who is like one of the top women in</v>

841
00:22:50.301 --> 00:22:51.134
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

842
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.600
<v Speaker 1>She was stripped of her tire named Cyborg.</v>

843

<v Speaker 1>And there's a difference between you and a wagon and you,</v>

877
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

878
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.070
<v Speaker 1>when you're actually fighting.</v>

879
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Cause when you're actually fighting,</v>

880
00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 1>that's when your muscles pump up with blood.</v>

881
00:23:58.281 --> 00:24:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Like we have one on the far right.</v>

882
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 1>You see your Brian far IA right there.</v>

883
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.170

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.003
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>

885
00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.950
<v Speaker 3>She looks like Kate from the last mix with the sweetest.</v>

886
00:24:07.951 --> 00:24:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding me,</v>

887
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.750
<v Speaker 3>grandma?</v>

888
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

889
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.513
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

890
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.653
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

891
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.953
<v Speaker 1>in any way,</v>

892
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.330
<v Speaker 1>like Lauren Landry,</v>

893
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.070
<v Speaker 1>she's a very,</v>

894
00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:18.570
<v Speaker 1>very muscular woman.</v>

895
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

896
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.510
<v Speaker 1>she's a tank and she's scary,</v>

897
00:24:21.511 --> 00:24:22.081
<v Speaker 1>talented,</v>

898
00:24:22.081 --> 00:24:22.470
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

899
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.251
<v Speaker 1>as a striker.</v>

900
00:24:23.251 --> 00:24:23.950
<v Speaker 1>She's really,</v>

901
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:24.900
<v Speaker 1>she's for a woman.</v>

902
00:24:24.901 --> 00:24:26.760
<v Speaker 1>She is fucking vicious.</v>

903
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.061
<v Speaker 3>It's so okay.</v>

904
00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:31.250
<v Speaker 3>And as feminist as I totally am,</v>

905
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

906
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 3>there's some part of me that I look at her and you're like,</v>

907
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

908
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.090
<v Speaker 3>why sweet?</v>

909
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.271
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

910
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 3>because she wants to go to war.</v>

911
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.890
<v Speaker 3>And I liked that and I respect that because I too am an angry fucking,</v>

912
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time you're like,</v>

913
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:41.751
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

914
00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I just want to protect her.</v>

915
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:44.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't want her to get her face head.</v>

916
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

917
00:24:44.321 --> 00:24:44.710

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:45.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:45.430
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.370
<v Speaker 1>she came up with the craziest camp in Brazil.</v>

921
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.263
<v Speaker 1>There she is.</v>

922
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.500

<v Speaker 1>the shoot the box shoe box and a shoot.</v>

924
00:24:53.651 --> 00:24:57.880
<v Speaker 1>The box camp is all these like bad ass Brazilian Moy Thai guys.</v>

925
00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.260
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking animals.</v>

926
00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

927
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.650
<v Speaker 1>she was married to the other dude's Cyborg,</v>

928
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.030
<v Speaker 1>eventually sta.</v>

929
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.080

<v Speaker 1>He's an old school and then a legend.</v>

932
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.410
<v Speaker 1>So the two of them were just like the scariest Koppel ever.</v>

933
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And they breeding super babies.</v>

934
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're together anymore.</v>

935
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.040
<v Speaker 1>She fortunately,</v>

936
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:16.451

938
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.240

943
00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:26.471
<v Speaker 6>in the hotel.</v>

944
00:25:26.471 --> 00:25:26.770
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

945
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.570
<v Speaker 6>I was in Calgary and uh,</v>

946
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:34.230
<v Speaker 6>I saw you on and then when a brown beat Swick it was right.</v>

947
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:35.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

948
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.830
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

949
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.251
<v Speaker 6>which was,</v>

950
00:25:36.251 --> 00:25:37.084
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

951
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:37.451
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

952
00:25:37.451 --> 00:25:38.110
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

953
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.590
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

954
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.220
<v Speaker 6>there's some great,</v>

955
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.780
<v Speaker 6>that was a most of the ground game fight.</v>

956
00:25:40.781 --> 00:25:41.614
<v Speaker 6>If I remember.</v>

957
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.420
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

958
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

959
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.013
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they went to the,</v>

960
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

961
00:25:44.171 --> 00:25:44.950
<v Speaker 1>they went to the ground.</v>

962
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:46.990
<v Speaker 1>He got them in a dark and then he almost got him,</v>

963
00:25:46.991 --> 00:25:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I think he almost got him at a triangle and the cars,</v>

964
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

965
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

966
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Brown almost had him like they would in the first round,</v>

967
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.813
<v Speaker 1>the first round,</v>

968
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.320
<v Speaker 1>and then the second one is stomped him.</v>

969
00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happened or did they stop him at the end of the first round?</v>

970
00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.673
<v Speaker 1>Was that the first round?</v>

971
00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.173
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

972
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.871
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

973
00:26:01.871 --> 00:26:02.141
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

974
00:26:02.141 --> 00:26:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember when exactly it happened,</v>

975
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.900
<v Speaker 1>but mine knocked the sensational Knox.</v>

976
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:07.351
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

977
00:26:07.351 --> 00:26:07.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

978
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.221
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

979
00:26:08.221 --> 00:26:08.670
<v Speaker 6>Knock out.</v>

980
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:09.503
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

981
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.940
<v Speaker 6>but afterwards did,</v>

982
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:13.380
<v Speaker 6>did you know or did you just see or they tell you,</v>

983
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.250
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

984
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.220
<v Speaker 6>when Brown was waiting for you and like what Erin on Fox was that he was</v>

985
00:26:17.221 --> 00:26:18.230
<v Speaker 6>standing there and he was looking around.</v>

986
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:18.461
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

987
00:26:18.461 --> 00:26:19.294
<v Speaker 6>Hey Joe.</v>

988
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:20.910
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

989
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.570
<v Speaker 1>what's up man?</v>

990
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

991
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:22.741
<v Speaker 1>cut to commercial.</v>

992
00:26:22.741 --> 00:26:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

993
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.270
<v Speaker 1>he even said that to me.</v>

994
00:26:24.271 --> 00:26:25.051
<v Speaker 1>Like he looked over at me.</v>

995
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:28.050
<v Speaker 1>It was totally not my call.</v>

996
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't miss it.</v>

997
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.370
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

998
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:29.761
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

999
00:26:29.761 --> 00:26:32.320
<v Speaker 1>if you see me in the cage or,</v>

1000
00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:32.640
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1001
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.420
<v Speaker 1>or uh,</v>

1002
00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:33.931
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

1003
00:26:33.931 --> 00:26:34.201
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1004
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:35.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not my call.</v>

1005
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.790
<v Speaker 1>They tell me we want an interview or they tell me there's no time for an</v>

1006
00:26:38.791 --> 00:26:39.420
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

1007
00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.100
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times they say there's no time.</v>

1008
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.350
<v Speaker 1>And when you do a sh a like the Fox card,</v>

1009
00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.090
<v Speaker 4>like I think they were already worried about time and it turned out to be a good</v>

1010
00:26:49.091 --> 00:26:49.924
<v Speaker 4>worry because of the,</v>

1011
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.790
<v Speaker 4>the fight I believe started after it was supposed to end.</v>

1012
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.160
<v Speaker 4>So like for people that set their dvrs,</v>

1013
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.510
<v Speaker 4>like they didn't even get to fight.</v>

1014
00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.130
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people didn't get the fight apparently.</v>

1015
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

1016
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:01.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1017
00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.200
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

1018
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.930
<v Speaker 4>So that's why they were behind the time.</v>

1019
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand like how they produce a show like that.</v>

1020
00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:08.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1021
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:08.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1022
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't really like even go in the truck and peak.</v>

1023
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.730
<v Speaker 4>Like I dunno what the fuck they're doing,</v>

1024
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.390
<v Speaker 4>but I know that when you know you have like live fight,</v>

1025
00:27:16.391 --> 00:27:20.020
<v Speaker 4>it's really difficult to judge how much actual time you have.</v>

1026
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.250
<v Speaker 4>It could be like three first round knock outs or it could be three really long</v>

1027
00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:27.280
<v Speaker 4>decisions where or it can be three decisions where a guy gets kicked in the</v>

1028
00:27:27.281 --> 00:27:29.800
<v Speaker 4>balls and you have to stop the time for five minutes.</v>

1029
00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:33.820
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes shit can drag on past where you think it's going to be.</v>

1030
00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.930
<v Speaker 4>So they err on the side of caution and they cut out interviews when they can.</v>

1031
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1032
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.970
<v Speaker 4>Well you got to have much tighter time restrictions on a network like Fox than</v>

1033
00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.540
<v Speaker 4>like a normal either.</v>

1034
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:44.740
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1035
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.750
<v Speaker 4>obviously a paper view or even like a cable thing.</v>

1036
00:27:46.751 --> 00:27:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's like hard out and ends for other shows that you can't go late into.</v>

1037
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:51.541
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1038
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:51.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1039
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.630
<v Speaker 4>I guess it is.</v>

1040
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:57.040
<v Speaker 4>She just get walkie talkies between that probably solve everything.</v>

1041
00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.383
<v Speaker 2>Talking to</v>

1042

00:28:03.531 --> 00:28:03.941
<v Speaker 2>no you don't.</v>

1047
00:28:03.941 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you know what you're talking about.</v>

1048
00:28:05.241 --> 00:28:06.074
<v Speaker 2>Silly bitch</v>

1049
00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.130
<v Speaker 2>talking about like miss [inaudible] idea.</v>

1050
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.290
<v Speaker 2>What we're saying</v>

1051
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:15.763
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1052
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.910
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you go into your next production meeting and be like,</v>

1053
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to bring him and he's going to talk for me from you guys talking,</v>

1054
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.730
<v Speaker 4>talking about the guys getting kicked in the balls.</v>

1055
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.770
<v Speaker 4>They have something to protect her.</v>

1056
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1057
00:28:28.371 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

1058
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.640
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>

1059
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.171
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>

1060
00:28:30.171 --> 00:28:32.450
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of guys that were the wrong cups,</v>

1061
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.680
<v Speaker 4>if you just wear like a regular jockstrap strap,</v>

1062
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.860
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>

1063
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:37.820
<v Speaker 4>there's like,</v>

1064
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:42.350
<v Speaker 4>there's those things move around and they're designed for like sports.</v>

1065
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.550
<v Speaker 4>They're really not designed for dudes kicking you in the things that you need</v>

1066
00:28:46.551 --> 00:28:47.810
<v Speaker 4>when someone's kicking you in the deck,</v>

1067
00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:48.520
<v Speaker 4>you need it</v>

1068
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.870
<v Speaker 2>more comprehensive approach</v>

1069
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.650
<v Speaker 2>has been a Titleist natural.</v>

1070
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.010
<v Speaker 2>You can't be set off for that softball bullshit</v>

1072
00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:59.460
<v Speaker 4>because those,</v>

1073
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.720
<v Speaker 4>those kicks are hard as fuck inside leg kicks that Dick or one of the most</v>

1074
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:05.130
<v Speaker 4>painful things I ever,</v>

1075
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.510
<v Speaker 4>oops.</v>

1076
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.170
<v Speaker 4>So they're so horrible.</v>

1077
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I'd been kicked in the balls so many times</v>

1078
00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 4>because I've had,</v>

1079
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:17.940
<v Speaker 4>I've probably had been kicked in the balls at least a hundred times in my life.</v>

1080
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.183
<v Speaker 4>Really hard.</v>

1081
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.060
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that they,</v>

1082
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.230
<v Speaker 4>you can get through those.</v>

1083
00:29:22.231 --> 00:29:22.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1084
00:29:22.531 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 4>cause I worry about,</v>

1085
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.030
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1086
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 4>but always with a cup on.</v>

1087
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:25.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1089
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.300
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't think I've ever been kicked without a cup that God,</v>

1090
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.191
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh.</v>

1091
00:29:29.191 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 4>Well there's videos about that.</v>

1092
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:31.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.880
<v Speaker 4>It's the Cup protects you a little bit caught,</v>

1094
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.100
<v Speaker 4>protects you a little bit.</v>

1095
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.020
<v Speaker 4>It keeps them from rupturing.</v>

1096
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 4>I think is what it is.</v>

1097
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1098
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.060
<v Speaker 4>Guys have lost testicles because</v>

1099
00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.080
<v Speaker 2>they were sparring and they got kicked and they didn't have a cup on.</v>

1100
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1101
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.321
<v Speaker 2>what about one of those?</v>

1102
00:29:46.321 --> 00:29:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Like people get like the,</v>

1103
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:48.870
<v Speaker 2>the high heels and the balls.</v>

1104
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:50.310
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

1105
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.380
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't have burst Burstows.</v>

1106
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.640
<v Speaker 2>And you played the one before?</v>

1107
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1108
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:54.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a video that shit's frightening.</v>

1111
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 2>There's some that are clearly faked.</v>

1112
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Like you can be like,</v>

1114
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:01.261
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1115
00:30:01.261 --> 00:30:02.460
<v Speaker 2>they've got a cup on or whatever.</v>

1116
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.260
<v Speaker 2>But then I have one,</v>

1117
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll send it to you where they,</v>

1118
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:07.020
<v Speaker 2>it starts,</v>

1119
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.980
<v Speaker 2>she's kicking 'em really hard and he's got underwear on.</v>

1120
00:30:10.981 --> 00:30:11.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1121
00:30:11.191 --> 00:30:11.401
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1122
00:30:11.401 --> 00:30:12.234
<v Speaker 2>it's in Spanish.</v>

1123
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.261
<v Speaker 2>And then she just like,</v>

1124
00:30:13.261 --> 00:30:13.621
<v Speaker 2>suffer,</v>

1125
00:30:13.621 --> 00:30:13.981
<v Speaker 2>suffer.</v>

1126
00:30:13.981 --> 00:30:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I want you to suffer.</v>

1127
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.450
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1128
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:15.721
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1129
00:30:15.721 --> 00:30:16.610
<v Speaker 2>But maybe he has a cup on.</v>

1130
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Then she takes the underwear off and she fucking,</v>

1131
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.380
<v Speaker 2>she's like punting a football kicking out like Bam.</v>

1132
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.800
<v Speaker 2>And He is like,</v>

1133
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.640
<v Speaker 2>what heals on his knees are shaking and he starts to bleed.</v>

1134
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:30.780
<v Speaker 2>He starts bleeding.</v>

1135
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1136
00:30:31.891 --> 00:30:33.810
<v Speaker 2>He's just taking it like London's likes it.</v>

1137
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1138
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:36.570
<v Speaker 2>She squeezes so hard.</v>

1139
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Some grill over.</v>

1140
00:30:37.891 --> 00:30:38.900
<v Speaker 2>She's saying Spanish.</v>

1141
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.320
<v Speaker 2>You bleed.</v>

1142
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.153
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1143
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.633
<v Speaker 2>Macro.</v>

1144
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Unnecessary.</v>

1145
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:43.981
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1146
00:30:43.981 --> 00:30:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1147
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Tell her to stop.</v>

1148
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Then when I saw as she was taking the healing,</v>

1149
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.530
<v Speaker 2>she was grinding it like a cigarette,</v>

1150
00:30:49.531 --> 00:30:51.300
<v Speaker 2>but after our rainy day,</v>

1151
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.760
<v Speaker 2>grinding it into this concrete,</v>

1152
00:30:53.761 --> 00:30:55.860
<v Speaker 2>that's what she was doing his balls with high heels on.</v>

1153
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.760
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1154
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.990
<v Speaker 2>How could someone want that?</v>

1155
00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.853
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1156
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 2>What is what?</v>

1157
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.840
<v Speaker 2>What is the switch that goes wrong in your,</v>

1158
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think where you want someone to hurt you.</v>

1159
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:05.370
<v Speaker 2>He's dirty balls.</v>

1160
00:31:05.371 --> 00:31:06.204
<v Speaker 2>I hate them</v>

1161
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:10.890
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

1162
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.760
<v Speaker 2>They can even would want it.</v>

1163
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they even think they want it.</v>

1164
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.250
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>

1165
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I think they something with leads them to discover it.</v>

1166
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Not that they want it,</v>

1167
00:31:18.211 --> 00:31:19.044

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1169
00:31:19.351 --> 00:31:22.200
<v Speaker 2>my reaction to that is not what most people go through,</v>

1170
00:31:22.201 --> 00:31:23.010
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

1173
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.350

<v Speaker 2>they get a rush,</v>

1175
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.540
<v Speaker 2>some type of adrenaline,</v>

1176
00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:31.320

1242
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:23.110
<v Speaker 4>the sides of the humans testicles is proportionate to the promiscuity of the</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1251
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.620

1254
00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:50.340
<v Speaker 2>I think he was putting on underwear.</v>

1255
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.660
<v Speaker 2>So from behind I go,</v>

1261
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.570
<v Speaker 2>It's probably his g not necessarily him,</v>

1262
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:09.750
<v Speaker 4>but you know the generations before him that made him,</v>

1263
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1264
00:34:10.141 --> 00:34:14.460
<v Speaker 4>it's like it becomes a genetic thing and it all comes from being around more</v>

1265
00:34:14.461 --> 00:34:15.390
<v Speaker 4>promiscuous women.</v>

1266
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.390
<v Speaker 4>That's why chimps have the biggest balls,</v>

1267
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.170
<v Speaker 4>seven normous ball cause Dick's aren't even as big as ours</v>

1268
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.250
<v Speaker 2>cause female chimps like way bigger.</v>

1269
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Their balls are so big.</v>

1270
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1271
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.940
<v Speaker 2>chimps are down to fuck all day.</v>

1272
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:31.660
<v Speaker 2>What's the other monkey</v>

1274
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:36.481
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1275
00:34:36.481 --> 00:34:38.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a separate type of champ.</v>

1276
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.143
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1277
00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't just masturbate.</v>

1278
00:34:40.331 --> 00:34:43.750
<v Speaker 2>They do everything except mother and son.</v>

1279
00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Mother,</v>

1280
00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 2>mother and son is the only,</v>

1281
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:46.060
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1282
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:46.893
<v Speaker 4>they don't do.</v>

1283
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:47.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:48.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.860
<v Speaker 4>And we were talking about that on the podcast is that someone had speculated</v>

1286
00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:51.491
<v Speaker 4>that that might,</v>

1287
00:34:51.491 --> 00:34:56.491
<v Speaker 4>because they had figured out that there was like bad things happen to the baby</v>

1288
00:34:56.831 --> 00:34:58.030
<v Speaker 4>when the mother has sex.</v>

1289
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.440
<v Speaker 4>Figured it out basically.</v>

1290
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:00.401
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>

1291
00:35:00.401 --> 00:35:03.220
<v Speaker 4>but the problem with that is that they're fucking all day.</v>

1292
00:35:03.221 --> 00:35:04.180
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking everybody.</v>

1293
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.040
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't have to like really be sure to kind of,</v>

1294
00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:09.820
<v Speaker 4>they use sex as a social tool.</v>

1295
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:10.081
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1296
00:35:10.081 --> 00:35:11.290
<v Speaker 4>Smooth over differences.</v>

1297
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.150
<v Speaker 4>Homosexual sex.</v>

1298
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.693
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1299
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.573
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

1300
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.570
<v Speaker 4>They just show the,</v>

1301
00:35:16.571 --> 00:35:17.710
<v Speaker 4>and they just fucking each other.</v>

1302
00:35:17.711 --> 00:35:19.870
<v Speaker 4>They go crazy and they are like,</v>

1303
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.060
<v Speaker 4>they're very rarely violent with each other.</v>

1304
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.140
<v Speaker 4>It's really fascinating.</v>

1305
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.850
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1306

<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1307
00:35:25.331 --> 00:35:25.841
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

1308
00:35:25.841 --> 00:35:27.670
<v Speaker 4>But it's amazing how that evolved.</v>

1309
00:35:27.671 --> 00:35:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Like how does that evolve?</v>

1310
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.913
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>

1311
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.521
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1312
00:35:30.521 --> 00:35:33.820
<v Speaker 4>How do you get to a point where you gotta like this Weird Society of like loving</v>

1313
00:35:33.821 --> 00:35:34.151
<v Speaker 4>chimps?</v>

1314
00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:35.170
<v Speaker 4>It just fuck all the time.</v>

1315
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.000
<v Speaker 4>Then we look at them like they're sick.</v>

1316
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1317
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1318
00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.150
<v Speaker 1>They're the oldest primates that we know of,</v>

1319
00:35:40.151 --> 00:35:42.970
<v Speaker 1>but don't kill each other or don't kill each other a lot.</v>

1320
00:35:42.971 --> 00:35:43.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1321
00:35:43.271 --> 00:35:43.781
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

1322
00:35:43.781 --> 00:35:44.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1323
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.830
<v Speaker 1>there's probably some aberrations even in the Bonobo world where some shit goes</v>

1324
00:35:47.831 --> 00:35:48.100
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

1325
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:48.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1326
00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got to regulate.</v>

1327
00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1328
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Banabos decks don't work.</v>

1329
00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:55.601
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

1330
00:35:55.601 --> 00:36:00.460
<v Speaker 7>I heard somewhere that before we had traditional marriage that it actually made</v>

1331
00:36:00.461 --> 00:36:05.230
<v Speaker 7>sense for the woman to bang his many dudes in the village so that the paternity</v>

1332
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:10.240
<v Speaker 7>of her children was unknown and she'd actually have more men to protect the</v>

1333
00:36:10.241 --> 00:36:10.990
<v Speaker 7>offspring.</v>

1334
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.930
<v Speaker 7>Like that to me would make sense if I had all of you guys,</v>

1335
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.500
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>

1336
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.500
<v Speaker 7>Tommy Red Banjo and that guy all doing me and then right.</v>

1337
00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:20.501
<v Speaker 7>I make a baby.</v>

1338
00:36:20.501 --> 00:36:21.334
<v Speaker 7>Whose baby is it?</v>

1339
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 7>Logan's going to defend it and yeah,</v>

1340
00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to take care of my babies.</v>

1341
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.380
<v Speaker 1>They become community babies.</v>

1342
00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.650
<v Speaker 1>If you guys want to set that up,</v>

1343
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.533
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna,</v>

1344
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.033
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna,</v>

1345
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.600
<v Speaker 1>the sinks to the bottom,</v>

1346
00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna always thought that in our distant history that it's likely that</v>

1347
00:36:38.141 --> 00:36:43.141
<v Speaker 1>we had these polygamous groups of people that like did psychedelic drugs</v>

1348
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:44.110
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1349
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Like his idea of like the long forgotten paradise was like these,</v>

1350
00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1351
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.190
<v Speaker 1>back where he believed like,</v>

1352
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1353
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:56.170
<v Speaker 1>civilization was first being created and he believes that those civilizations</v>

1354
00:36:56.171 --> 00:36:56.681
<v Speaker 1>that came up,</v>

1355
00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:57.880
<v Speaker 1>they were all just eating mushrooms,</v>

1356
00:36:57.881 --> 00:36:59.770
<v Speaker 1>tripping their balls off and fucking each other.</v>

1357
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1358
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.990
<v Speaker 1>And then Club Med came,</v>

1360
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.650
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1361
00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:03.940
<v Speaker 1>that took a long time.</v>

1362
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I think your timeline,</v>

1363
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.390
<v Speaker 1>it might be a little bit off,</v>

1364
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.400
<v Speaker 1>but that sounds like a fun time,</v>

1365
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.810
<v Speaker 1>but that Mccain was world.</v>

1366
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Speaker 1>But this idea was that at one time there was enough people doing ego suppressing</v>

1367
00:37:16.991 --> 00:37:19.060
<v Speaker 1>things like he eating mushrooms,</v>

1368
00:37:19.061 --> 00:37:19.894
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

1369
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.390
<v Speaker 1>it's all like really speculative.</v>

1370
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:27.460
<v Speaker 1>There's the idea of trying to figure out how many different cultures we're doing</v>

1371
00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:31.330
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs when they came up with their religion,</v>

1372
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.080
<v Speaker 1>when they came up with a lot of their ideas about life and,</v>

1373
00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:35.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1374
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:35.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1375
00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:36.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1376
00:37:36.131 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 1>studying the cosmos,</v>

1377
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:40.000
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of those cultures that really got heavily into that stuff.</v>

1378
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.640
<v Speaker 1>We're also really heavily into psychedelic drugs.</v>

1379
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Like the Mayans,</v>

1380
00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:45.520
<v Speaker 1>like making their crazy fucking calendars.</v>

1381
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.620
<v Speaker 1>The Mayans did a lot of mushrooms,</v>

1382
00:37:47.621 --> 00:37:48.160
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1383
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1384
00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1385
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.750
<v Speaker 1>they mushrooms and raw chocolate together.</v>

1386
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:53.501
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1387
00:37:53.501 --> 00:37:54.160
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

1388
00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.340
<v Speaker 1>some plant that had like an LSD like effect.</v>

1389
00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.320
<v Speaker 1>They also took this,</v>

1390
00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was,</v>

1391
00:38:00.281 --> 00:38:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but the idea,</v>

1392
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I went on a tour of Cheech and needs.</v>

1393
00:38:02.871 --> 00:38:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So with this guy who was a professor and it was a really cool,</v>

1394
00:38:06.431 --> 00:38:09.820
<v Speaker 1>like you can hire him as a guide and he was so knowledgeable,</v>

1395
00:38:09.821 --> 00:38:10.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1396
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.380
<v Speaker 1>It was just really interesting.</v>

1397
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1398
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:11.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1399
00:38:11.831 --> 00:38:12.960
<v Speaker 1>him talking about all the,</v>

1400
00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.260
<v Speaker 1>the different traditions and why this was created and that was created.</v>

1401
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.040
<v Speaker 1>But he had the,</v>

1402
00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.330
<v Speaker 1>he took me to this room and he's like,</v>

1403
00:38:19.331 --> 00:38:20.380
<v Speaker 1>this is where they did their,</v>

1404
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:21.843
<v Speaker 1>their rituals.</v>

1405
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:22.280
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1406
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:22.511
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1407
00:38:22.511 --> 00:38:22.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1408
00:38:22.781 --> 00:38:26.020
<v Speaker 1>and taking some sort of a psychedelic plant that had an Lsd,</v>

1409
00:38:26.021 --> 00:38:26.651
<v Speaker 1>like a fact,</v>

1410
00:38:26.651 --> 00:38:29.830
<v Speaker 1>like this was just like a culture of super duper trippers.</v>

1411
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1414
00:38:31.301 --> 00:38:32.340
<v Speaker 1>when you see the right,</v>

1415
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.610
<v Speaker 1>when you see what they built,</v>

1416
00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1417
00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 1>you did not have been sound mind when</v>

1418
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.090
<v Speaker 4>you came up with not logical.</v>

1419
00:38:38.091 --> 00:38:38.924
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>

1420
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 4>He got to some weird places,</v>

1421
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 4>weirder than anybody where they,</v>

1422
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:46.570
<v Speaker 4>they fucking killed people so often that they had like spots.</v>

1423
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.070
<v Speaker 4>Like we're going to kill him right here.</v>

1424
00:38:48.071 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 4>This is the altar they had alters where they would sacrifice.</v>

1425
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:52.210
<v Speaker 4>Be Sure I saw one,</v>

1426
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.720
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

1427
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 4>not in Mexico.</v>

1428
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 4>I went to a,</v>

1429
00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:55.001
<v Speaker 4>in Peru,</v>

1430
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:57.880
<v Speaker 4>I went to Machu Picchu a couple of times and they had the,</v>

1431
00:38:57.881 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 4>like a sacrificial room they showed you.</v>

1432
00:39:00.701 --> 00:39:02.080
<v Speaker 4>They would like on this table,</v>

1433
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.460
<v Speaker 4>people would voluntarily be sacrificed.</v>

1434
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:04.841
<v Speaker 4>Let's see,</v>

1435
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:07.560
<v Speaker 4>utilities that you have to be high as fuck for a thing.</v>

1436
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Is that the point to satisfy the gods?</v>

1437
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 4>Take a virgin?</v>

1438
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 4>Are you taking so strong?</v>

1439
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.300
<v Speaker 1>There was a period in um,</v>

1440
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:15.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1441
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.580
<v Speaker 1>when the Aztecs,</v>

1442
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:18.391
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

1443
00:39:18.391 --> 00:39:18.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1444
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.380
<v Speaker 1>when they killed 80,000 people,</v>

1445
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.211
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1446
00:39:24.211 --> 00:39:28.670
<v Speaker 1>some insane number of people over like a,</v>

1447
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.540
<v Speaker 1>just a period of four days when there was one,</v>

1448
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.680
<v Speaker 1>one of the temples that was being built there.</v>

1449
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.570
<v Speaker 1>They apparently,</v>

1450
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.500
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

1451
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.070
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

1452
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:43.070
<v Speaker 1>it's disputed whether or not they killed 80,000 or whether they killed,</v>

1453
00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:44.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1454
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.160
<v Speaker 1>whether it was only really 10,000 people exaggerated.</v>

1455
00:39:47.161 --> 00:39:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some dispute as to how many people were actually killed.</v>

1456
00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:55.191
<v Speaker 1>But if the number there they believe is 80,000,</v>

1457
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.230
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1458
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.770
<v Speaker 1>and this was said in 1487,</v>

1459
00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.390
<v Speaker 1>the Aztec King,</v>

1460
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1461
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1462
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.490
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

1463
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.440
<v Speaker 1>when they completed one of their,</v>

1464
00:40:04.441 --> 00:40:04.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1465
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:05.850
<v Speaker 1>their pyramids,</v>

1466
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.050
<v Speaker 1>he killed every prisoner that like was,</v>

1467
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.330
<v Speaker 1>was part of the construction.</v>

1468
00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:13.951
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1469
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:14.784
<v Speaker 4>So they like,</v>

1470
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 4>they fucking built this shit for free,</v>

1471
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.250
<v Speaker 4>built this shit for him.</v>

1472
00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:24.750
<v Speaker 4>And then he kills some insane amount of people over the course of four days.</v>

1473
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.600
<v Speaker 4>But that's a lot of voluntarily dying to,</v>

1474
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1475
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:28.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1476
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:29.760
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

1477
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.420
<v Speaker 4>This was not,</v>

1478
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.740
<v Speaker 4>it was so crazy that like Duncan told me about this first and then,</v>

1479
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:35.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1480
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.050
<v Speaker 4>I read it and I couldn't believe it.</v>

1481
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.910
<v Speaker 4>And then I told a bunch of different people,</v>

1482
00:40:38.911 --> 00:40:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1483
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.620
<v Speaker 4>did you know that this happened?</v>

1484
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.030
<v Speaker 4>And I've had people go,</v>

1485
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.631

1502
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:02.101
<v Speaker 4>there's no way.</v>

1508
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.920
<v Speaker 4>the actual,</v>

1509

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1510
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.390
<v Speaker 4>the different stories and depictions of this,</v>

1511
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:14.310
<v Speaker 4>this time and the 14 hundreds and you see that number 80,000 can you even wrap</v>

1512
00:41:14.311 --> 00:41:15.144
<v Speaker 4>your head around?</v>

1513
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.120
<v Speaker 4>You're not doing this with guns folks.</v>

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1515
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.660
<v Speaker 4>Wrap your head around 80,000 people getting cut to death.</v>

1516
00:41:23.671 --> 00:41:27.370
<v Speaker 4>Fucking the Rose Bowl in four fucking slaughtered.</v>

1517
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh.</v>

1518
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>Is everybody has their</v>

1519
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.020
<v Speaker 2>throats and they're heart pulled out of their chests.</v>

1520
00:41:37.021 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Dude is nuts.</v>

1521
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.380
<v Speaker 2>What a Co Raisie motherfucker.</v>

1522
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1523
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.260
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

1524
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.093
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

1525
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1526
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.300
<v Speaker 2>They yard,</v>

1527
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 2>they took shit to the next level.</v>

1528
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1529
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:48.270
<v Speaker 2>massive mushroom meters.</v>

1530
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Trippers bid time.</v>

1531
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:51.494
<v Speaker 2>Trippers.</v>

1532
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.730
<v Speaker 2>It's weird when you combine like a,</v>

1533
00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the,</v>

1534
00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.880
<v Speaker 2>the interesting things about those cultures,</v>

1535
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.400
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the interesting discoveries,</v>

1536
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:06.610
<v Speaker 2>there's very strange use of like an UN hieroglyphic like language and it took us</v>

1537
00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:10.430
<v Speaker 2>a long time to figure out if they still work on some of the,</v>

1538
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1539
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.391
<v Speaker 2>the different,</v>

1540
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 2>more complex character things in order and debate.</v>

1541
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Like what exactly it means.</v>

1542
00:42:17.061 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Like there,</v>

1543
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a great documentary,</v>

1544
00:42:19.071 --> 00:42:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it's from Nat Geo called decoding the Maya,</v>

1545
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's what it's called and it's really interesting to see these guys,</v>

1546
00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:29.870
<v Speaker 2>these scholars trying to figure out what the fuck this was.</v>

1547
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.820
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy language.</v>

1548
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Well the other thing that blows your mind every time if you see something mine</v>

1549
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 2>as tech or the Incas is that when you see what they built,</v>

1550
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:45.320
<v Speaker 2>you can take today's greatest architect and be like,</v>

1551
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:46.700
<v Speaker 2>how would you do this here?</v>

1552
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 2>And they don't even like,</v>

1553
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know where to start,</v>

1554
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:54.040
<v Speaker 2>but how these things were built perfectly constructed and stones that way,</v>

1555
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.000
<v Speaker 2>like 20 times are laid on top of another stone and fits into it.</v>

1556
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.021
<v Speaker 2>They have theories.</v>

1557
00:43:00.021 --> 00:43:00.201
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1558
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:00.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1559
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:03.050
<v Speaker 2>we think that they would pour water down here.</v>

1560
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.621
<v Speaker 2>And then you're like,</v>

1561
00:43:03.621 --> 00:43:04.910
<v Speaker 2>how many people would it take to move this?</v>

1562
00:43:04.911 --> 00:43:05.211
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1563
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:05.361
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1564
00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:06.194
<v Speaker 2>like 8,000.</v>

1565
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.750
<v Speaker 2>And then we probably put it over.</v>

1566
00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:08.181
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1567
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:09.014
<v Speaker 2>none of it makes sense.</v>

1568
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that like there's,</v>

1569
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:11.200
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1570
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 2>there's a people that will try to debunk anything.</v>

1571
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you bring up anything that seems even remotely paranormal,</v>

1572
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:19.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1573
00:43:19.461 --> 00:43:20.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1574
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.410
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1575
00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.170
<v Speaker 2>like ghosts or fuck on the aliens here,</v>

1576
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.720
<v Speaker 2>anything you remotely parent,</v>

1577
00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.480
<v Speaker 1>they automatically try to go block.</v>

1578
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

1579
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.340
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence for that.</v>

1580
00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:34.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no that's all well and good till you get to giant stones.</v>

1581
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.310
<v Speaker 1>And there's something about moving.</v>

1582
00:43:36.311 --> 00:43:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Giant stones are like,</v>

1583
00:43:37.421 --> 00:43:38.111
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

1584
00:43:38.111 --> 00:43:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you got to explain this.</v>

1585
00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.200
<v Speaker 1>You got to explain that.</v>

1586
00:43:41.201 --> 00:43:42.220
<v Speaker 1>You can't just say,</v>

1587
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:44.380
<v Speaker 1>oh well they did that.</v>

1588
00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.191
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1589
00:43:45.191 --> 00:43:45.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1590
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:45.751
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1591
00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:45.951
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1592
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:48.550
<v Speaker 1>they figured it out and they cut it out of this quarry right here.</v>

1593
00:43:48.551 --> 00:43:48.761
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1594
00:43:48.761 --> 00:43:49.430
<v Speaker 1>we have one.</v>

1595
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.410
<v Speaker 1>There's one of my favorite pieces of evidence is would they show this one,</v>

1596
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1597
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.580
<v Speaker 1>one of these giant fucking pig stone pillars.</v>

1598
00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.440
<v Speaker 1>They were carving out of this,</v>

1599
00:43:59.441 --> 00:43:59.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1600
00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:03.640
<v Speaker 1>this one giant piece of granite and they stopped in the middle of the carving.</v>

1601
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:08.380
<v Speaker 1>But because of the fact that it was like partially completed,</v>

1602
00:44:08.381 --> 00:44:10.750
<v Speaker 1>you could see the method of shaping it.</v>

1603
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1604
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.310
<v Speaker 1>It was really kind of interesting.</v>

1605
00:44:12.311 --> 00:44:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

1606
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:13.990
<v Speaker 1>they learned a lot from that.</v>

1607
00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:18.490
<v Speaker 1>So they believe that they did it with stones and they believe that they did it</v>

1608
00:44:18.491 --> 00:44:19.360
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>

1609
00:44:19.361 --> 00:44:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a real painstaking process of slowly chipping away to get these,</v>

1610
00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:25.120
<v Speaker 1>but how the fuck</v>

1611
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.983
<v Speaker 2>did they move?</v>

1612
00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.200
<v Speaker 2>You gotta tell me how they move.</v>

1613
00:44:28.201 --> 00:44:29.050
<v Speaker 2>There's no cranes,</v>

1614
00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.070
<v Speaker 2>no bulldozers.</v>

1615
00:44:30.071 --> 00:44:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1616
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.980
<v Speaker 2>We to assume</v>

1617
00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 1>that they had some incredible knowledge of leverage and moving things and they</v>

1618
00:44:39.611 --> 00:44:43.180
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to get things under it and leverage it and move it somehow.</v>

1619
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.770
<v Speaker 1>But to pretend that that's not a mystery is really kind of disingenuous.</v>

1620
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:48.980
<v Speaker 6>The day.</v>

1621
00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:49.581
<v Speaker 6>I find that,</v>

1622
00:44:49.581 --> 00:44:53.750
<v Speaker 6>I mean also to human thinking changes over time and since the enlightened</v>

1623
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.090
<v Speaker 6>imminent period and like the scientific revolution,</v>

1624
00:44:56.091 --> 00:44:59.980
<v Speaker 6>we discredited anything that's remotely Ooky and mysterious</v>

1625
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:01.900
<v Speaker 1>because there's so much ooky mysterious stuff.</v>

1626
00:45:01.901 --> 00:45:03.250
<v Speaker 1>That's bull shit.</v>

1627
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1628
00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.410
<v Speaker 1>It's such a problem.</v>

1629
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.900
<v Speaker 1>There's so much bullshit out there.</v>

1630
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's ghost bullshit or Ufo bullshit.</v>

1631
00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.860
<v Speaker 1>There's so many nutty motherfuckers with fake bigfoot stories.</v>

1632
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1633
00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Just muddying up the waters.</v>

1634
00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1635
00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.700
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1636
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Bull Shit.</v>

1637
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1638
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.260
<v Speaker 1>So a course,</v>

1639
00:45:20.261 --> 00:45:25.261
<v Speaker 1>a smart person is going to gravitate towards the scientific and more likely</v>

1640
00:45:25.871 --> 00:45:26.704
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

1641
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1642
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything that's very,</v>

1643
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.150
<v Speaker 6>but it's not explaining everything.</v>

1644
00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing is,</v>

1645
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:32.570
<v Speaker 6>is leading.</v>

1646
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.580
<v Speaker 6>It's leaving things that are,</v>

1647
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.720
<v Speaker 6>that are valid.</v>

1648
00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:36.260
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1649
00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.640
<v Speaker 6>not the bullshit story.</v>

1650
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.330
<v Speaker 6>It was leaving the real thing also like unexplored or unexplained and,</v>

1651
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.590
<v Speaker 6>and people just go like,</v>

1652
00:45:42.591 --> 00:45:42.830
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1653
00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:43.300
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

1654
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Well with science can't figure out his emotions and our org and why do we like</v>

1655
00:45:49.331 --> 00:45:50.890
<v Speaker 1>beautiful things and why?</v>

1656
00:45:50.891 --> 00:45:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Why do I love hearing certain songs?</v>

1657
00:45:53.291 --> 00:45:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Why has it changed the way my body feels?</v>

1658
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1659
00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.180
<v Speaker 1>what does it feel like to the,</v>

1660
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.680
<v Speaker 1>to kiss somebody that you love?</v>

1661
00:45:59.681 --> 00:46:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Is that really just a bunch of chemicals?</v>

1662
00:46:01.331 --> 00:46:02.440
<v Speaker 1>It's floating around in your brain?</v>

1663
00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.620
<v Speaker 1>What is going on there?</v>

1664
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:05.230
<v Speaker 1>What can science measure that?</v>

1665
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:05.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1666
00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1667
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.120
<v Speaker 1>the emotional,</v>

1668
00:46:07.121 --> 00:46:10.270
<v Speaker 1>human aspect of life is the one thing that science,</v>

1669
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Canton,</v>

1670
00:46:11.341 --> 00:46:13.600
<v Speaker 1>we're really truly defined yet,</v>

1671
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.011
<v Speaker 1>but who knows?</v>

1672
00:46:15.011 --> 00:46:15.221
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1673
00:46:15.221 --> 00:46:18.800
<v Speaker 1>we might be able to break it down one day to ones and Zeros and you just program</v>

1674
00:46:18.801 --> 00:46:19.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1675
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.900
<v Speaker 1>the right ones and Zeros in your head and you're happy all the time.</v>

1676
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it just goes keep dreaming.</v>

1677
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Men Stream all day.</v>

1678
00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.970
<v Speaker 1>You ever talked to someone like who has a problem with like normal consciousness</v>

1679
00:46:27.971 --> 00:46:31.510
<v Speaker 1>and they need something like an Ssri or something like that and then when they</v>

1680
00:46:31.511 --> 00:46:33.790
<v Speaker 1>take it they talk about how like they,</v>

1681
00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:35.950
<v Speaker 1>they finally can like see life.</v>

1682
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.460
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be able to engineer that in people like,</v>

1683
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:41.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1684
00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess we're doing it right now,</v>

1685
00:46:42.671 --> 00:46:43.990
<v Speaker 1>but people taking pills,</v>

1686
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.970
<v Speaker 1>the meat and the cheese of it.</v>

1687
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1688
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:46.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1689
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:47.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1690
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.590
<v Speaker 1>the levels of certain things that make,</v>

1691
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1692
00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:51.940
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1693
00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.180
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness operate certain things like serotonin and dopamine,</v>

1694
00:46:55.181 --> 00:46:58.090
<v Speaker 1>like the levels of these things like how these things are produced by them,</v>

1695
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:59.560
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to manipulate that shit.</v>

1696
00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:00.423
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1697
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:02.350
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to be building to manipulate your mood.</v>

1698
00:47:02.351 --> 00:47:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to be like way happier.</v>

1699
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:05.310
<v Speaker 1>You're also okay</v>

1700
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.410
<v Speaker 6>be able to program or there'll be able to program,</v>

1701
00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1702
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.410
<v Speaker 1>the genes that are more desirable and leave out things that are not.</v>

1703
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1704
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the things I always felt like,</v>

1705
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.520
<v Speaker 1>if you look at those,</v>

1706
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1707
00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:18.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1708
00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 1>the standard image of the alien,</v>

1709
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1710
00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:22.344
<v Speaker 1>the gray I,</v>

1711
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the gray can big idea alien.</v>

1712
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.820
<v Speaker 1>They're like real flimsy bodies that big,</v>

1713
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:27.061
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1714
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:27.894
<v Speaker 1>giant heads.</v>

1715
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.333
<v Speaker 1>If you look at,</v>

1716
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.200
<v Speaker 1>and you look at us and you look at a gorilla,</v>

1717
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.270
<v Speaker 1>they look more like us than the gorilla.</v>

1718
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:34.761
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1719
00:47:34.761 --> 00:47:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1720
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:35.993
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

1721
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1722
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1723
00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Like that might be what we're gonna do.</v>

1724
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.560
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna get,</v>

1725
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.620
<v Speaker 1>get rid of all the whole sex organ thing and just going to,</v>

1726
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:44.011
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1727
00:47:44.011 --> 00:47:49.011
<v Speaker 1>we're going to design these like bulletproof bodies that can see through walls</v>

1728
00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.090
<v Speaker 1>and we're just going to take that on.</v>

1729
00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:52.950
<v Speaker 1>They had and we're going to repeat it.</v>

1730
00:47:52.951 --> 00:47:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1731
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be able to figure out a way to manipulate your genetics</v>

1732
00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.150
<v Speaker 1>and there's never going to be a dumb kid born again.</v>

1733
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.013
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1734
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Or develop a new language to dumb people and your fucking kids going to be five</v>

1735
00:48:04.921 --> 00:48:05.071
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1736
00:48:05.071 --> 00:48:05.221
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1737
00:48:05.221 --> 00:48:05.850
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

1738
00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1739
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.863
<v Speaker 4>why are you doing</v>

1740
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.470
<v Speaker 4>fucking super genetic freak kid,</v>

1741
00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:10.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1742
00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Five [inaudible] village.</v>

1743
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Three languages will stop speaking English at this point or any real</v>

1744
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.910
<v Speaker 1>and that'll mean that everything will just communicate with our consciousness.</v>

1745
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.540
<v Speaker 1>We don't even have to speak anymore.</v>

1746
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't how much different the world would be if we all had the same</v>

1747
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:25.654
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

1748
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It makes a huge difference.</v>

1749
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much do you know confusion when it comes to like,</v>

1750
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.313
<v Speaker 1>especially like,</v>

1751
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:33.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1752
00:48:33.321 --> 00:48:34.630
<v Speaker 1>things like that are going on.</v>

1753
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

1754
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Since they're going on in the Middle East.</v>

1755
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:38.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1756
00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:38.860

<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1758
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't speak Israeli.</v>

1759
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't speak Hebrew.</v>

1760
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1761
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1762
00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what the Palestinians are saying.</v>

1763
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the Saudis are saying.</v>

1764
00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:48.520
<v Speaker 1>I know what the Iranians are saying.</v>

1765
00:48:48.521 --> 00:48:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I can't hear,</v>

1766
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:49.331
<v Speaker 1>hear that.</v>

1767
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:50.164
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

1768
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:51.121
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1769
00:48:51.121 --> 00:48:51.340
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1770
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.790
<v Speaker 1>you're reliant on someone like have you ever seen like some of the translations</v>

1771
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:55.690
<v Speaker 1>that were uh,</v>

1772
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that were attributed to aqua,</v>

1773
00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.290
<v Speaker 1>a jod the a,</v>

1774
00:48:59.291 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 1>is that his name?</v>

1775
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:03.070
<v Speaker 1>The A to come in and then a job.</v>

1776
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

1777
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 1>people take like things out of context that he said and make it like much more</v>

1778
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:09.161
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory.</v>

1779
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:09.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1780
00:49:09.311 --> 00:49:11.020
<v Speaker 1>he says plenty of inflammatory shit,</v>

1781
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.560
<v Speaker 1>but they manipulate things and we don't know about that.</v>

1782
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 1>We don't know about that unless you really go and look.</v>

1783
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And if he talked English,</v>

1784
00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:19.930
<v Speaker 1>we would know,</v>

1785
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:20.660
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1786
00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:21.493
<v Speaker 4>fucker loans</v>

1787
00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.590
<v Speaker 4>radians and fucking listen to this podcast.</v>

1788
00:49:25.591 --> 00:49:26.281
<v Speaker 4>And I ran like,</v>

1789
00:49:26.281 --> 00:49:27.114
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

1790
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.440
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were cool.</v>

1791
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.470
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing too is that hitting folks,</v>

1792
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.760
<v Speaker 4>it always universal language.</v>

1793
00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:33.590
<v Speaker 4>We should learn Farsi.</v>

1794
00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:34.011
<v Speaker 6>There you go.</v>

1795
00:49:34.011 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 6>Universal language.</v>

1796
00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.530
<v Speaker 6>It always blows my mind too because it brings to the point when people say the</v>

1797
00:49:39.531 --> 00:49:44.000
<v Speaker 6>word fluent when they say they're fluent in another language and you realize</v>

1798
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:48.800
<v Speaker 6>what it really means to be fluent because people can speak a lot of a language</v>

1799
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:51.740
<v Speaker 6>and still miss tons of things,</v>

1800
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 6>misunderstand things and definitely not true.</v>

1801
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:59.660
<v Speaker 6>Like I speak pretty damn good Spanish from growing up in a Spanish speaking</v>

1802
00:49:59.661 --> 00:50:02.060
<v Speaker 6>household and I've seen,</v>

1803
00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.253
<v Speaker 6>I've watched,</v>

1804
00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:03.530
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1805
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:07.520
<v Speaker 6>like court shows where they have an interpreter for somebody and I've been like,</v>

1806
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.361
<v Speaker 6>that's not what he said.</v>

1807
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:09.860
<v Speaker 6>And that like the person said it,</v>

1808
00:50:09.861 --> 00:50:10.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1809
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.851
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

1810
00:50:10.851 --> 00:50:13.820
<v Speaker 6>I've watched translations like UN things where you'll be like,</v>

1811
00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:14.150
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1812
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.961
<v Speaker 6>that person speaks,</v>

1813
00:50:14.961 --> 00:50:16.820
<v Speaker 6>let's say fluent Spanish.</v>

1814
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:18.290
<v Speaker 6>And you think you're like,</v>

1815
00:50:18.291 --> 00:50:18.441
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1816
00:50:18.441 --> 00:50:19.520
<v Speaker 6>they speak great English too,</v>

1817
00:50:19.521 --> 00:50:24.380
<v Speaker 6>but it's actually like they speak 90% good English and can miss a word and</v>

1818
00:50:24.381 --> 00:50:28.390
<v Speaker 6>intention the it can be shuffled around and that when you miss it,</v>

1819
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 6>when you misunderstand something by a word or I'll have it,</v>

1820
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1821
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.670
<v Speaker 6>in Spanish we're all like you.</v>

1822
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:35.300
<v Speaker 6>You think I'm pretty much on point,</v>

1823
00:50:35.301 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 6>but you missed just a little thing,</v>

1824
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:41.630
<v Speaker 6>a little detail that you don't miss when it's either your native language or</v>

1825
00:50:41.631 --> 00:50:44.990
<v Speaker 6>you're so immersed in a language that you truly are fluent in it,</v>

1826
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1827
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:45.891
<v Speaker 6>You are,</v>

1828
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:47.360
<v Speaker 6>you're thinking while you're talking.</v>

1829
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.870
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

1830
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:48.171
<v Speaker 6>And like,</v>

1831
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:48.441
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1832
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:49.640
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you live in a,</v>

1833
00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:49.911
<v Speaker 6>in a,</v>

1834
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:50.570
<v Speaker 6>in a,</v>

1835
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:54.410
<v Speaker 6>in a country where if you live in your second language country,</v>

1836
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 6>you can overtime I think really speak tremendous,</v>

1837
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:59.720
<v Speaker 6>whatever that language might be.</v>

1838
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:00.441
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1839
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:01.100
<v Speaker 6>Like once you lit,</v>

1840
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 6>when you're surrounded by that language,</v>

1841
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:04.880
<v Speaker 6>24 seven but short of that,</v>

1842
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.730
<v Speaker 6>like you really do miss things and then you let them saying,</v>

1843
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 6>that's also what leads to misunderstandings lead to argument.</v>

1844
00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:15.600
<v Speaker 6>And he's a neat leads to confrontation and violent sometimes because you</v>

1845
00:51:15.601 --> 00:51:16.880
<v Speaker 6>misunderstood something.</v>

1846
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.440
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't even a disagreement.</v>

1847
00:51:18.441 --> 00:51:20.780
<v Speaker 6>You just say it right or understand it,</v>

1848
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:21.614
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1849
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:22.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1850
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1851
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:23.481
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1852
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:27.980
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's a new app and it,</v>

1853
00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you can talk to it and if you're talking and whatever language,</v>

1854
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.610
<v Speaker 1>it translates it back to you in real time and English.</v>

1855
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1856
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:40.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1857
00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

1858
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:42.740
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I'm talking about Brian?</v>

1859
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:43.191
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1860
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:44.024
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>

1861
00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of this?</v>

1863
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.793
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1864
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn and I have to find about this.</v>

1865
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I have to Google search it now because,</v>

1866
00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:50.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1867
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.850
<v Speaker 1>somebody told me about it and I haven't looked into it,</v>

1868
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:55.970
<v Speaker 1>but this is apparently something and either they're working on and it's going to</v>

1869
00:51:55.971 --> 00:51:58.430
<v Speaker 1>be released soon or it's out now.</v>

1870
00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:00.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1871
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.990
<v Speaker 1>like with my parents who are Hungarians speakers and I can understand stuff,</v>

1872
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.240
<v Speaker 1>but even when I speak to my father in English,</v>

1873
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:08.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1874
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Like he has a whole different understanding of English,</v>

1875
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:12.170
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1876
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 1>as I do in a different continent.</v>

1877
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.380
<v Speaker 1>When he speaks Hungarian,</v>

2032
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:33.303
<v Speaker 2>The person that you know,</v>

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.540
<v Speaker 2>she said that to you wrote a letter,</v>

2045
00:56:51.851 --> 00:56:53.140
<v Speaker 2>always hurting themselves.</v>

2046
00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I like terrible like cut themselves or pin,</v>

2047
00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like some people like have like crazy,</v>

2049
00:56:58.451 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 2>like genital piercings and shit like that.</v>

2050
00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:05.880
<v Speaker 2>They think that some people that do like really freaky shit might have a problem</v>

2051
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 2>with a not experiencing pain the right way.</v>

2052
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:09.371
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2053
00:57:09.371 --> 00:57:10.330
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2056
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 2>And it leads to more and more extreme,</v>

2057
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2058

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:19.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2062
00:57:19.421 --> 00:57:24.070
<v Speaker 2>some people clearly don't have the same pain threshold that like I would say the</v>

2063
00:57:24.071 --> 00:57:25.060
<v Speaker 2>majority of people have.</v>

2064

2080
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:52.600
<v Speaker 2>He was like run metal through his ball bag.</v>

2081
00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.713
<v Speaker 2>Horses,</v>

2086
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Horse Dick is second to the horse thrust because an animal thrust,</v>

2087
00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:12.010
<v Speaker 2>a thrust from a horse is in the hospital cancer.</v>

2088
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.530
<v Speaker 2>You could line up eight people and be like,</v>

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.083
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

2166
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.130
<v Speaker 4>for this beautiful,</v>

2167
01:00:21.131 --> 01:00:22.440
<v Speaker 4>magnificent beast.</v>

2168
01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean short of it is kind of cool to watch the jump.</v>

2169
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:25.390
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

2170
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:26.530
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it have respect.</v>

2171
01:00:26.531 --> 01:00:27.101
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>

2172
01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:27.561
<v Speaker 4>this animal,</v>

2173
01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:29.080
<v Speaker 4>he also has a mind of its own.</v>

2174
01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:30.490
<v Speaker 4>How do you know what it's going to do?</v>

2175
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:32.830
<v Speaker 4>It wants to do that bullshit.</v>

2176
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.420
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't want to do that.</v>

2177
01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:40.120
<v Speaker 4>Especially cause the animal can clearly see that there is nothing to the left of</v>

2178
01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:42.880
<v Speaker 4>this fucking boards and nothing to the right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I've seen that on,</v>

2183
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.020
<v Speaker 5>I've seen footage of that before where the horse goes like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

2202
01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:18.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2203
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.950
<v Speaker 4>I could probably jump decent.</v>

2204
01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.130
<v Speaker 4>Not like nothing happening</v>

2205
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:23.130
<v Speaker 6>is the one of all like the,</v>

2206
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2207
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:25.560
<v Speaker 6>the physical things and,</v>

2208
01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:25.801
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2209
01:01:25.801 --> 01:01:28.470
<v Speaker 6>and attributes that you can desire.</v>

2210
01:01:28.471 --> 01:01:28.621
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2211
01:01:28.621 --> 01:01:29.520
<v Speaker 6>I wish I could do this,</v>

2212
01:01:29.521 --> 01:01:30.310
<v Speaker 6>or you know,</v>

2213
01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:32.160
<v Speaker 6>when I remember with somebody,</v>

2214
01:01:32.161 --> 01:01:35.760
<v Speaker 6>especially if they're your size and they have an amazing vertical leap,</v>

2215
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:39.780
<v Speaker 6>it's the fucking most fascinating thing to watch them to watch it because it's</v>

2216
01:01:39.781 --> 01:01:40.390
<v Speaker 6>totally natural.</v>

2217
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.090
<v Speaker 6>Like I've been with people my height,</v>

2218
01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.360
<v Speaker 6>they can literally jump 15 inches higher than I can.</v>

2219
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.340
<v Speaker 6>You just like Holy Shit.</v>

2220
01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.630
<v Speaker 6>And it's the thing,</v>

2221
01:01:48.631 --> 01:01:49.051
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2222
01:01:49.051 --> 01:01:49.321
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2223
01:01:49.321 --> 01:01:50.220
<v Speaker 6>and it is not from,</v>

2224
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.470
<v Speaker 6>and the people that I've seen to do it wasn't through like about training every</v>

2225
01:01:53.471 --> 01:01:53.631
<v Speaker 6>day,</v>

2226
01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:54.464
<v Speaker 6>but it was just,</v>

2227
01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:55.530
<v Speaker 6>that's how high I can jump.</v>

2228
01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:58.443
<v Speaker 6>I jump all day.</v>

2229
01:01:58.650 --> 01:01:58.840
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2230
01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.090
<v Speaker 6>it was just a natural,</v>

2231
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.010
<v Speaker 6>hereditary like were whatever.</v>

2232
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.250
<v Speaker 6>They were just born being able to jump through the fucking roof.</v>

2233
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:06.300
<v Speaker 6>And I think it's the person,</v>

2234
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:08.070
<v Speaker 6>that's what Bo Jackson was like.</v>

2235
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:12.660
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the most amazing physical specimens in recorded time.</v>

2236
01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:13.620
<v Speaker 6>Jackson,</v>

2237
01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:16.140
<v Speaker 6>he's still got records and the NFL combine.</v>

2238
01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.870
<v Speaker 6>I think he still holds the record for the 40 does he?</v>

2239
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

2240
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 6>Watching that guy.</v>

2241
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:25.010
<v Speaker 6>So that was like watching a human horse like that.</v>

2242
01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.373
<v Speaker 6>It really was.</v>

2243
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:31.580
<v Speaker 6>That guy is an unbelievable athletes by somebody who wrote a book about him,</v>

2244
01:02:32.731 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 6>was talking about,</v>

2245
01:02:33.901 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 6>I wish I could remember the guy's name,</v>

2246
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.720
<v Speaker 6>I should Google it,</v>

2247
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.280
<v Speaker 6>watch,</v>

2248
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.070
<v Speaker 6>look up Bo Jackson highlights from,</v>

2249
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:44.950
<v Speaker 6>from football when he was at Auburn or when he,</v>

2250
01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.730
<v Speaker 6>when he played for the,</v>

2251
01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 6>if he didn't get his hip injured.</v>

2252
01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 6>There is absolutely no telling what that guy would have done.</v>

2253
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 6>He would fucking,</v>

2254
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:53.820
<v Speaker 6>he was so fast that he was like,</v>

2255
01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.091
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2256
01:02:54.091 --> 01:02:56.010
<v Speaker 6>he was like the fastest guy on the team,</v>

2257
01:02:56.370 --> 01:03:01.370
<v Speaker 6>but it was on like a 225 or 230 pound body so he could trust people to like just</v>

2258
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.960
<v Speaker 6>lower his shoulder and just,</v>

2259
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:06.390
<v Speaker 6>he would deliver hits,</v>

2260
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2261
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:10.080
<v Speaker 6>he'd give a concussion out with the football in his hand.</v>

2262
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.130
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2263
01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:16.130

2264
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:19.860
<v Speaker 6>professional baseball just because he liked baseball too.</v>

2265
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.461
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2266
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:21.810

<v Speaker 6>because I saw him do this for sure.</v>

2277
01:03:33.361 --> 01:03:38.361
<v Speaker 6>There's footage of this Bo Jackson breaking a baseball bat over his boyfriend's</v>

2278
01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:40.890
<v Speaker 6>name and like you would do it like it was nothing.</v>

2279
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:42.390
<v Speaker 6>It lives like a twig man.</v>

2284
01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:47.791
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

2285
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:48.540
<v Speaker 6>I struck out,</v>

2286
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.060
<v Speaker 6>apparently he was always able to do freaky shit.</v>

2287
01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:52.950
<v Speaker 6>This guy was talking about that when he was young.</v>

2288
01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:54.840
<v Speaker 6>He used to be able to jump over cars.</v>

2289
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.180
<v Speaker 6>He gets jumped over the hood of a car.</v>

2290
01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:00.060
<v Speaker 6>I saw a guy do that too.</v>

2291
01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:01.040
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

2292
01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:02.660
<v Speaker 6>Was that's like one of the things I was talking.</v>

2293
01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.830
<v Speaker 6>I saw a guy do that who was smaller than me,</v>

2294
01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.693
<v Speaker 6>shorter than me.</v>

2295
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:06.623

<v Speaker 6>a total fucking just yoked dude.</v>

2297
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 6>He played running back.</v>

2298
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 6>He actually broke California state records in high school and he did that.</v>

2299
01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:15.480
<v Speaker 6>He jumped over the hood of a car and I was like,</v>

2300
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 6>that is amazing to watch.</v>

2301
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.810
<v Speaker 6>I mean amazing and crazy to watch a guy like that sprint and you're like,</v>

2302
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:22.321
<v Speaker 6>oh dude,</v>

2303
01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:24.240
<v Speaker 6>I could run forever and never sprint like that.</v>

2304
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.073
<v Speaker 6>She does.</v>

2305

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:30.360
<v Speaker 6>There's a kid that I saw on a video who jumped off a roof,</v>

2307
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:35.460
<v Speaker 6>did a back flip off a roof and it was like a three story or two story building</v>

2308
01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:37.470
<v Speaker 6>was the most ridiculous shit I've ever seen.</v>

2309
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.960
<v Speaker 6>And the kid made it and lived in it was fine.</v>

2310
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.910
<v Speaker 6>If you want to see like that,</v>

2311
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:42.631
<v Speaker 6>that's incredible.</v>

2312
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:43.830
<v Speaker 6>If you want to see like a crate,</v>

2313
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:49.010
<v Speaker 6>like a crazy other level like type of athlete meaning athlete like you just see</v>

2314
01:04:50.191 --> 01:04:51.750
<v Speaker 6>like Oh said another gear that they have.</v>

2315
01:04:51.751 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 6>The other people just don't have.</v>

2316
01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:54.510
<v Speaker 6>If you look at um,</v>

2317
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:58.640
<v Speaker 6>there's this guy that plays football for like a,</v>

2318
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:01.890
<v Speaker 6>he plays for the bills I think now his name's Cj spiller and when he was at</v>

2319
01:05:01.891 --> 01:05:02.724
<v Speaker 6>Clemson,</v>

2320
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:06.180
<v Speaker 6>there's highlights of him like where he would stop,</v>

2321
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:10.020
<v Speaker 6>like stop in the middle of the field and there's like five guys surrounding him</v>

2322
01:05:10.021 --> 01:05:11.310
<v Speaker 6>and he just turns it on again.</v>

2323
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.420
<v Speaker 6>But he goes to like,</v>

2324
01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:15.030
<v Speaker 6>he goes like fifth gear before they get to first.</v>

2325
01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:15.864
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2326
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.793
<v Speaker 6>that's like,</v>

2327
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 6>he's to his gear so much faster than them.</v>

2328
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:21.390
<v Speaker 6>But those are all like dynamite.</v>

2329
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:22.631
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2331
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:23.410
<v Speaker 6>and you're just like that.</v>

2332
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:24.370
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't make sense.</v>

2333
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:28.870
<v Speaker 6>Like are like Devin Hester is this guy who he plays for the bears.</v>

2334
01:05:28.871 --> 01:05:29.090
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

2335
01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2336
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:30.100
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2337
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.520
<v Speaker 6>well known returner and if you watch his highlights,</v>

2338
01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:35.110
<v Speaker 6>the thing about him is that he hits,</v>

2339
01:05:35.111 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 6>they say like there are guys who have faster 40 times than him,</v>

2340
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.770
<v Speaker 6>but he hits his highest speed immediately.</v>

2341
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2342
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:48.520
<v Speaker 6>So it's like he gets the ball and then he's just like,</v>

2343
01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 6>here I'm running as fast as I can.</v>

2344
01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:52.150
<v Speaker 6>The first second I have the ball.</v>

2345
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 6>Whereas everybody else has to stop.</v>

2346
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.091
<v Speaker 6>And you just like,</v>

2348
01:05:55.091 --> 01:05:55.541
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

2349
01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:56.081
<v Speaker 6>He is like,</v>

2350
01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:56.914
<v Speaker 6>he just,</v>

2351
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.440
<v Speaker 6>he hit fifth gear immediately</v>

2352
01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.390
<v Speaker 4>and you see the other guy that's a gate explosions.</v>

2353
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:01.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2354
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:02.540
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>

2355
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.470
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>

2356
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.741
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2357
01:06:03.741 --> 01:06:03.931
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2358
01:06:03.931 --> 01:06:04.460
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2359
01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.830
<v Speaker 4>there's no even playing field.</v>

2360
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:10.790
<v Speaker 4>The idea that this uneven playing field when it comes to human beings is crazy.</v>

2361
01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:11.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Just by looking at the different sizes of us.</v>

2363
01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.570
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why we need weight classes.</v>

2364
01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:15.290
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2365
01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:17.810
<v Speaker 4>And the variables inside of weight classes,</v>

2366
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:21.380
<v Speaker 4>those are also pretty extreme with some athletes.</v>

2367
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:23.330
<v Speaker 4>Some people just aren't that coordinated.</v>

2368
01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.590
<v Speaker 4>They don't move that well,</v>

2369
01:06:24.591 --> 01:06:25.880
<v Speaker 4>they don't have that kind of power.</v>

2370
01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:29.570
<v Speaker 4>And then there's guys that can just learn things like immediately and they can</v>

2371
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:33.380
<v Speaker 4>run like a gazelle and they can do shit to you that you can't do to them.</v>

2372
01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:36.170
<v Speaker 4>And they were out of the box like that.</v>

2373
01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2374
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.861
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2375
01:06:36.861 --> 01:06:37.131
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2376
01:06:37.131 --> 01:06:39.230
<v Speaker 4>there's guys that are out of the box athletes.</v>

2377
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.670
<v Speaker 4>If you were thinking about how</v>

2378
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:45.300
<v Speaker 6>unlikely the total package of Lebron James,</v>

2379
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:46.210
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

2380
01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:51.240
<v Speaker 4>That like that is a 0.001% like package a critical date gives birth to him.</v>

2381
01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:55.291
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

01:07:23.861 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 4>if Lebron James was an MMA,</v>

2413
01:07:40.381 --> 01:07:41.310
<v Speaker 6>Cause people always talk about,</v>

2416
01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:44.490
<v Speaker 6>he stopped playing.</v>

2417
01:07:44.491 --> 01:07:47.190

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.240
<v Speaker 4>I was in Houston once and I find I wanted,</v>

2593
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:05.820
<v Speaker 4>want to congratulate this guy the way he was rocking it,</v>

2594
01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.700
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't want to offend them so I let it go.</v>

2595
01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.030
<v Speaker 4>But he had leg warmers on that.</v>

2596
01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:17.031
<v Speaker 4>We're rainbow that's already covered leg warmers on and he had these little</v>

2597
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:19.590
<v Speaker 4>designer,</v>

2598
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.620
<v Speaker 4>like they looked like some odd tennis shoe type thing that he was wearing,</v>

2599
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:27.060
<v Speaker 4>some very trendy tennis shoe.</v>

2600
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 4>And then he had these boys gym shorts,</v>

2601
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 4>these board member,</v>

2602
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.830
<v Speaker 4>those gym shorts he used to wear do your blue with the white stripe and they</v>

2603
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 4>were way too small.</v>

2604
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:36.780
<v Speaker 4>They were way too small.</v>

2605
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.351
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2606
01:13:37.351 --> 01:13:39.240
<v Speaker 4>And he's our frail man as it is.</v>

2607
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.610
<v Speaker 4>And then he had a pink skin,</v>

2608
01:13:41.611 --> 01:13:46.611
<v Speaker 4>tight shirt and a some crazy multicolored Bandana.</v>

2609
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.300
<v Speaker 4>And as he was working out,</v>

2610
01:13:48.301 --> 01:13:49.134
<v Speaker 4>he's working out like this,</v>

2611
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.033
<v Speaker 4>like grunting</v>

2612

<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2614
01:14:02.321 --> 01:14:02.971
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>

2615
01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:04.770
<v Speaker 4>if he got together with the other guy,</v>

2616
01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:08.330
<v Speaker 4>they would create a black hole of homosexuality.</v>

2617
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:10.810
<v Speaker 4>It would eat its way through the cement,</v>

2618
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:11.580
<v Speaker 4>eat cement,</v>

2619
01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.060

2622
01:14:16.541 --> 01:14:17.940
<v Speaker 2>If you slipped and fell into it,</v>

2623
01:14:17.941 --> 01:14:18.660
<v Speaker 2>you'd fall,</v>

2624
01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:19.690
<v Speaker 2>fall prey to the game.</v>

2625

2631
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2632
01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.551
<v Speaker 2>on the street.</v>

2633
01:14:35.551 --> 01:14:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Just on the street.</v>

2634
01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2635
01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.240
<v Speaker 2>seen guys dress or a bed.</v>

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:57.420
<v Speaker 7>What's an honor?</v>

2722
01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:57.571
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2723
01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:58.770
<v Speaker 7>I believe in honor.</v>

2724
01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:00.211
<v Speaker 7>It's a tall,</v>

2725
01:17:00.211 --> 01:17:01.380
<v Speaker 7>slender.</v>

2726
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.850
<v Speaker 7>Hairless is an auditor as opposed to a big hairy fat,</v>

2727
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:06.810
<v Speaker 7>which is a bear.</v>

2728
01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:10.050
<v Speaker 7>And a younger bear is actually a cub cub</v>

2729
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:15.310
<v Speaker 3>bears go with cubs and cubs are just smaller and more.</v>

2730
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.590
<v Speaker 3>It was wrong.</v>

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:21.710
<v Speaker 3>But now I heard that the word Twinkies becoming taboo to the way that bag is</v>

2732
01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 3>kind of not cool to say.</v>

2733
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:24.850
<v Speaker 3>I think twink is starting to become</v>

2734
01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.710

<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2738
01:17:33.321 --> 01:17:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Andy Cohen on Bravo,</v>

2739
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.700
<v Speaker 3>I think he went on some other show and he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh look at all these twinks here.</v>

2741
01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 3>And then the twin community got really upset and started tweeting and so he</v>

2742
01:17:43.821 --> 01:17:44.960
<v Speaker 3>apologized.</v>

2743
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.333
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2744
01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:53.900
<v Speaker 3>everybody is just looking for an opportunity to be sensitive.</v>

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:12.220
<v Speaker 3>What if they like develop some ways they have nefarious intention,</v>

2785
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:15.810
<v Speaker 3>so they developed some sort of lesbian pixie dust sprayed over a city when</v>

2786
01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:17.890
<v Speaker 3>they're flying around and your kids because</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2788
01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.830
<v Speaker 3>we've got a bunch of miniature gay elves running around.</v>

2789
01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>

2790
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:24.623
<v Speaker 3>you mock</v>

2791
01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:27.511
<v Speaker 3>Ian Community.</v>

2792
01:19:27.511 --> 01:19:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Have these genres.</v>

2793
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:29.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2794
01:19:29.610 --> 01:19:30.151
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2795
01:19:30.151 --> 01:19:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2796
01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:30.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2797
01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.711
<v Speaker 3>They have lipstick.</v>

2798
01:19:31.711 --> 01:19:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Lesbian.</v>

2799
01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:34.380
<v Speaker 3>I'd have those Fred Flintstone.</v>

2800
01:19:34.381 --> 01:19:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Looking lesbian lipsticks the best,</v>

2801
01:19:37.051 --> 01:19:37.884
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2802
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2803
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.673
<v Speaker 3>The lipsticks</v>

2804
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:43.521
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

2805
01:19:43.521 --> 01:19:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Yet the other ones are intimidating,</v>

2806
01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:46.920
<v Speaker 3>especially if they want to fight,</v>

2807
01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.390
<v Speaker 3>but not always good at shows.</v>

2808
01:19:48.391 --> 01:19:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Either.</v>

2809
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.760
<v Speaker 3>You'd want to argue over the best instance of humor</v>

2810
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.360
<v Speaker 3>can be cool.</v>

2811
01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:55.213
<v Speaker 3>They can be.</v>

2812
01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:59.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't really generalize a whole fucking sexual orientation.</v>

2813
01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I've met a lot of cool lesbians.</v>

2814
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Annoying straight people too.</v>

2815
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:06.970
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>

2816
01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:07.873
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2817
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:10.350
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of the anti positive approach.</v>

2818
01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got their own special gift.</v>

2819
01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Everybody sucks in their own way to the dark play trail.</v>

2820
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:17.881
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2821
01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:18.714
<v Speaker 1>And so true.</v>

2822
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:20.063
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2823
01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:21.620
<v Speaker 1>We have a little something,</v>

2824
01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>a little something fucking with us.</v>

2825
01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I had to ask you this.</v>

2826
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

2827
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2828
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.370
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get your thoughts on uh,</v>

2829
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Pacquiao going down to mark has this crazy crazy,</v>

2830
01:20:31.891 --> 01:20:32.140
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

2831
01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2832
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Well many pack y'all.</v>

2833
01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:34.711
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2834
01:20:34.711 --> 01:20:36.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a super nice guy.</v>

2835
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Tosh and I film this thing with him where I played,</v>

2836
01:20:39.361 --> 01:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2837
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Tosh is manager and uh,</v>

2838
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.713
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

2839
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.990
<v Speaker 1>was to let Manny Pacquiao punch him in the face of some strange reason like</v>

2840
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:47.540
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2841
01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 1>And so Manny Pacquiao,</v>

2842
01:20:48.661 --> 01:20:50.190
<v Speaker 1>he's very nice about it by the way.</v>

2843
01:20:50.191 --> 01:20:50.760
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

2844
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.680
<v Speaker 1>like kind of tapped him and then like hit him harder,</v>

2845
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:56.910
<v Speaker 1>hit him harder and Taj is looking at me like what the fuck man mean he's not</v>

2846
01:20:56.911 --> 01:20:58.670
<v Speaker 1>going to hurt you to little harder,</v>

2847
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:59.783
<v Speaker 1>harder,</v>

2848
01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2849
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2850
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.070
<v Speaker 1>and even then Manny Pacquiao just sort of pop like so gently,</v>

2851
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2852
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:06.330
<v Speaker 1>But he's so nice.</v>

2853
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.710
<v Speaker 1>He's like a really friendly guy.</v>

2854
01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't have any like weird feeling around like he's a super duper star.</v>

2855
01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.730
<v Speaker 1>He travels deep with like this giant entourage entourages taken care of</v>

2856
01:21:14.731 --> 01:21:18.210
<v Speaker 1>everything around him all the time and he's like the nicest guy in the world.</v>

2857
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:20.490
<v Speaker 1>So that made me sad.</v>

2858
01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.010
<v Speaker 1>But that's the game he's playing.</v>

2859
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.360
<v Speaker 1>He plays a crazy game.</v>

2860
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.360
<v Speaker 1>That game is you,</v>

2861
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.550
<v Speaker 1>you are competing with your consciousness,</v>

2862
01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you're competing with your physical health,</v>

2863
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.670
<v Speaker 1>your competing against another man who's a trained killer.</v>

2864
01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:36.773
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

2865
01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:38.280
<v Speaker 1>when he hits you,</v>

2866
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.641
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2867
01:21:38.641 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 1>your body is just like any other body.</v>

2868
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:42.750
<v Speaker 1>And if someone hits you perfectly like he did twice,</v>

2869
01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:47.070
<v Speaker 1>he name dropped him with that first one and mo most likely he was still hurt</v>

2870
01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:47.580
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

2871
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 1>But that's second punch was so powerful.</v>

2872
01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:56.690
<v Speaker 1>That was like the perfect punch cause Pacquiao was moving forward and mark has</v>

2873
01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:01.830
<v Speaker 1>caught him moving forward and just crushed him in his tracks and he was lights</v>

2874
01:22:01.831 --> 01:22:02.730
<v Speaker 1>out on the way down.</v>

2875
01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:02.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2876
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:04.420
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the worst or,</v>

2877
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:07.940
<v Speaker 1>or best one punch knockouts I've ever seen in all of boxing.</v>

2878
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes in the top 10.</v>

2879
01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.160
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2880
01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:10.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2881
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:11.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2882
01:22:11.601 --> 01:22:13.020
<v Speaker 1>that shit is right up there with uh,</v>

2883
01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Paul Williams getting knocked out by Sergio Martinez.</v>

2884
01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:16.164
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>

2885
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Sergio Martinez is,</v>

2886
01:22:18.781 --> 01:22:22.410
<v Speaker 1>it got a vicious lefthand and he's like super athletic and moves around a lot</v>

2887
01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:27.330
<v Speaker 1>and he nailed Paul Williams like this perfect overhand left as he was moving in</v>

2888
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and just spun him around and face planted.</v>

2889
01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:31.620
<v Speaker 1>It was just like that.</v>

2890
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.700
<v Speaker 1>He's at that,</v>

2891
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:34.580
<v Speaker 1>but I just didn't expect to see that.</v>

2892
01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2893
01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:35.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2894
01:22:35.641 --> 01:22:36.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2895
01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I think I was seeing some stats on it that that was his first time being knocked</v>

2896
01:22:42.121 --> 01:22:42.930
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2897
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:43.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2898
01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Since 19 well he hasn't been,</v>

2899
01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:48.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe not sound even [inaudible] 98 I think he's been dropped,</v>

2900
01:22:48.541 --> 01:22:49.070
<v Speaker 1>dropped.</v>

2901
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it has been dropped.</v>

2902
01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Some incredible stat that like it hadn't happened since 98 that he was thinking,</v>

2903
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.890
<v Speaker 1>well actually now that I think about it,</v>

2904
01:22:55.891 --> 01:22:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I think mark has dropped him in his fight,</v>

2905
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.930
<v Speaker 1>this fight before he knocked him out.</v>

2906
01:23:00.931 --> 01:23:02.970
<v Speaker 1>That was the first time mark has it knocked him down.</v>

2907
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:03.601
<v Speaker 1>He had knocked,</v>

2908
01:23:03.601 --> 01:23:04.470
<v Speaker 1>mark has done before,</v>

2909
01:23:04.471 --> 01:23:06.520
<v Speaker 1>but mark has had staggered him before,</v>

2910
01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 1>but somebody had stopped him earlier in his career.</v>

2911
01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:09.841
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>

2912
01:23:09.841 --> 01:23:12.640
<v Speaker 1>he had been knocked out early in his career but never liked this.</v>

2913
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.180
<v Speaker 1>This was one of those knockouts that might just be a game changer.</v>

2914
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2915
01:23:16.770 --> 01:23:17.603
<v Speaker 1>that's so really,</v>

2916
01:23:17.650 --> 01:23:18.970
<v Speaker 1>and you know boxers,</v>

2917
01:23:18.971 --> 01:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>what you're seeing first of all in in many is you're seeing a guy who's already</v>

2918
01:23:23.261 --> 01:23:25.300
<v Speaker 1>had before this fight,</v>

2919
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.840
<v Speaker 1>they had three crazy fucking wars,</v>

2920
01:23:27.841 --> 01:23:28.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2921
01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Three wars back blasting each other and you,</v>

2922
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.530
<v Speaker 1>how many of those can you have really in your life?</v>

2923
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 1>You know this,</v>

2924
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a number,</v>

2925
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:39.340
<v Speaker 1>it might be 10 it might be seven.</v>

2926
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's different depending on when you start,</v>

2927
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 1>depending on how good your defenses you're going to get nailed.</v>

2928
01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:45.760
<v Speaker 1>You're getting your head hit,</v>

2929
01:23:45.761 --> 01:23:46.594
<v Speaker 1>you're getting your body,</v>

2930
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 1>you've got a lot of fun problems that among other fights,</v>

2931
01:23:50.681 --> 01:23:51.251
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

2932
01:23:51.251 --> 01:23:53.070
<v Speaker 1>sparring sessions just,</v>

2933
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2934
01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Zach,</v>

2935
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:55.181
<v Speaker 1>that was the point.</v>

2936
01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:59.560
<v Speaker 1>The point is what you're saying is a tiny fraction of the actual damages head is</v>

2937
01:23:59.561 --> 01:24:03.370
<v Speaker 1>taken cause you're only seeing one fight so you think about all the fights that</v>

2938
01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 1>he's had to all the punches that he's taken.</v>

2939
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:07.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a tremendous amount of punishment as is.</v>

2940
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to factor in the fact that that is a for action of the actual</v>

2941
01:24:12.071 --> 01:24:12.850
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

2942
01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you start getting an idea of what the fuck is really going on.</v>

2943
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.590
<v Speaker 1>When you're training for a fight,</v>

2944
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:22.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a number in your head or a feeling or a time or what.</v>

2945
01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You got to know when to fucking get out because the more you do that shit,</v>

2946
01:24:26.171 --> 01:24:28.000
<v Speaker 1>the more one day it's going to catch up with you.</v>

2947
01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:29.520
<v Speaker 1>But with a guy like Pacquiao,</v>

2948
01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it's super hard for those guys to just go out on top.</v>

2949
01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:33.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2950
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather retired and then he came back,</v>

2951
01:24:34.931 --> 01:24:36.190
<v Speaker 1>he almost went out on top.</v>

2952
01:24:36.191 --> 01:24:37.660
<v Speaker 1>You almost said fuck it went out on top.</v>

2953
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:42.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think he's probably the most cautious of all of them.</v>

2954
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Floyd.</v>

2955
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2956
01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2957
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:45.400
<v Speaker 1>He's the most cautious stylistically,</v>

2958
01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2959
01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:48.970
<v Speaker 1>very rarely gets hit and he does get hit recovers very well.</v>

2960
01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Like Shane Mosley was the last one to tag him and he goes through entire fights</v>

2961
01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:54.040
<v Speaker 1>where he barely gets tagged.</v>

2962
01:24:54.041 --> 01:24:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2963
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:54.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2964
01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Just boxes the shit out of people,</v>

2965
01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2966
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:57.940
<v Speaker 1>And I love that.</v>

2967
01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that the guy's still,</v>

2968
01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2969
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:01.660
<v Speaker 1>not only is the unbeaten,</v>

2970
01:25:01.661 --> 01:25:03.470
<v Speaker 1>he's really unchallenged and he's like,</v>

2971
01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he's 36 now.</v>

2972
01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.540
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten pretty unheard of,</v>

2973
01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:08.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2974
01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and it looks fantastic.</v>

2975
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 1>His defense is so incredible.</v>

2976
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant boxer.</v>

2977
01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:13.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant,</v>

2978
01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.200
<v Speaker 1>and he probably would have box the shit out of Manny Pacquiao,</v>

2979
01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:17.920
<v Speaker 1>especially seeing what he did,</v>

2980
01:25:17.921 --> 01:25:21.280
<v Speaker 1>the Martinez and what I was able to do to Martinez.</v>

2981
01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:22.120
<v Speaker 1>And then what,</v>

2982
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2983
01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:23.680
<v Speaker 1>the differences,</v>

2984
01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:23.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2985
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Martinez in Floyd wasn't even close.</v>

2986
01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Floyd just outbox the shit out of him.</v>

2987
01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just couldn't get to him.</v>

2988
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Floyd is just too good.</v>

2989
01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 1>He's too good at positioning.</v>

2990
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Amazing punches.</v>

2991
01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:36.230
<v Speaker 6>He recovers well and his,</v>

2992
01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:37.064
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2993
01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.840
<v Speaker 6>people don't realize sometimes that like,</v>

2994
01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.640
<v Speaker 6>I mean depending on how good whoever he's fighting at the time,</v>

2995
01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:46.820
<v Speaker 6>that a lot of times he boxes a gloves down because he's so quick.</v>

2996
01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:48.060
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't even,</v>

2997
01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:51.180
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't pull up his gloves for a lot of fights.</v>

2998
01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.700
<v Speaker 6>His gloves are down and he's dipping around dance,</v>

2999
01:25:53.710 --> 01:25:54.543
<v Speaker 6>like playing with people.</v>

3000
01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:54.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3001
01:25:54.811 --> 01:25:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Toy.</v>

3002
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:56.550
<v Speaker 1>He does that shoulder roll.</v>

3003
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:57.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3004
01:25:57.630 --> 01:26:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Where he walks towards guys with his left shoulder up high in his right glove by</v>

3005
01:26:02.521 --> 01:26:05.490
<v Speaker 1>his face and they don't know what to do with that and fight.</v>

3006
01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:05.961
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3007
01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:06.741
<v Speaker 1>he's so good.</v>

3008
01:26:06.741 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty,</v>

3009
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.150
<v Speaker 1>flexes are so good.</v>

3010
01:26:08.151 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3011
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:09.860
<v Speaker 1>and now that Adrian Broner Chi,</v>

3012
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:10.790
<v Speaker 1>have you seen that kid?</v>

3013
01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 1>But upcoming kid.</v>

3014
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:12.771
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3015
01:26:12.771 --> 01:26:13.910
<v Speaker 1>this kid's a monster.</v>

3016
01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.200
<v Speaker 1>He's like Floyd Mayweather.</v>

3017
01:26:15.201 --> 01:26:16.490
<v Speaker 1>But with more punching power.</v>

3018
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Same like weight class.</v>

3019
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 1>He's 47 I'm not sure.</v>

3020
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Or it might be 35 is either 35 and struggling to make the weight and moving up</v>

3021
01:26:25.791 --> 01:26:28.280
<v Speaker 1>to 40 or 47 whatever it is.</v>

3022
01:26:28.281 --> 01:26:29.570
<v Speaker 1>He's he's kids.</v>

3023
01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Dynamind he has that same style that's high left shoulder up.</v>

3024
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3025
01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.673
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

3026
01:26:34.170 --> 01:26:35.570
<v Speaker 1>There's some fucking shows up there.</v>

3027
01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.460
<v Speaker 1>No fucking lead glove for most of your,</v>

3028
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:38.960
<v Speaker 1>like your left glove is down.</v>

3029
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:39.680
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3030
01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.340
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>

3031
01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:41.173
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

3032
01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:45.380
<v Speaker 1>they're so good at those duck and roll counter countywide hands and you don't</v>

3033
01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:46.520
<v Speaker 1>want to get clipped by that shit.</v>

3034
01:26:46.521 --> 01:26:47.750
<v Speaker 1>And then so like guys are real,</v>

3035
01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:48.531
<v Speaker 1>real cautious.</v>

3036
01:26:48.531 --> 01:26:49.010
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

3037
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:50.990
<v Speaker 1>And he's so good at like slipping jabs.</v>

3038
01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.090
<v Speaker 1>So good at anticipating your movement.</v>

3039
01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:58.130
<v Speaker 1>The best boxers are great at leading guys into certain directions and</v>

3040
01:26:58.131 --> 01:26:59.810
<v Speaker 1>anticipating how they respond.</v>

3041
01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:00.531
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3042
01:27:00.531 --> 01:27:04.220
<v Speaker 1>And so like a guy like Floyd Mayweather is not like an impulsive guy.</v>

3043
01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.320
<v Speaker 1>He's like a guy who's going to set traps for you.</v>

3044
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3045
01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.020
<v Speaker 1>So like he'll lead you in certain directions.</v>

3046
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And see how you respond and then lead you in that certain direction again and</v>

3047
01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:16.130
<v Speaker 1>see how you respond and then set you up for a time where he's going to lead you</v>

3048
01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:17.000
<v Speaker 1>in that certain direction.</v>

3049
01:27:17.010 --> 01:27:17.811
<v Speaker 1>He's going to stop,</v>

3050
01:27:17.811 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3051
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:21.530
<v Speaker 1>he's going to catch you because you do a certain thing over and over again.</v>

3052
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:22.780
<v Speaker 1>You know you do a certain thing,</v>

3053
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:25.670
<v Speaker 1>your gloves when you move off the ropes and he's going to catch you figure it</v>

3054
01:27:25.671 --> 01:27:28.190
<v Speaker 1>out till he's got to figure it out and that's like,</v>

3055
01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.170
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that Anderson Silva does.</v>

3056
01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva,</v>

3057
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:35.090
<v Speaker 1>he moves around with the guy for like the first minute or two kind of gets a</v>

3058
01:27:35.091 --> 01:27:35.960
<v Speaker 1>sense of how he,</v>

3059
01:27:35.961 --> 01:27:36.920
<v Speaker 1>how he operates,</v>

3060
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:40.280
<v Speaker 1>how he moves faint some a little bit and then start setting them up.</v>

3061
01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I started sending them out for,</v>

3062
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:42.283
<v Speaker 1>for death,</v>

3063
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:43.250
<v Speaker 1>for death.</v>

3064
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Setting them up for a dismantling.</v>

3065
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3066
01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's even his defense is so interesting and so developed it like when you</v>

3067
01:27:49.281 --> 01:27:50.120
<v Speaker 1>watch him box,</v>

3068
01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.540
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you'll see him get up against the ropes and you're like,</v>

3069
01:27:53.630 --> 01:27:54.890
<v Speaker 1>oh he's,</v>

3070
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:56.030
<v Speaker 1>he's up against the ropes.</v>

3071
01:27:56.031 --> 01:27:57.590
<v Speaker 1>This guy might take advantage of this.</v>

3072
01:27:57.830 --> 01:28:01.050
<v Speaker 1>And then Floyd somehow pulls it into his,</v>

3073
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:04.280
<v Speaker 1>like his defense becomes his offense and you're like,</v>

3074
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.581
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

3075
01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:04.870
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3076
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:06.800
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking ripping this guy upon this too good.</v>

3077
01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.050
<v Speaker 1>He's so good at straight boxing.</v>

3078
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

3079
01:28:09.771 --> 01:28:10.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3080
01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:10.913
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

3081
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And he's a guy that's had a lot of hand problems too that kind of broke his</v>

3082
01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:15.560
<v Speaker 1>hands several times.</v>

3083
01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:17.740
<v Speaker 1>So he goes for like the biggest cushion.</v>

3084
01:28:17.741 --> 01:28:18.574
<v Speaker 1>He has gloves.</v>

3085
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

3086
01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:20.594
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

3087
01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:20.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3088
01:28:20.841 --> 01:28:22.220
<v Speaker 1>because of his fragile hands,</v>

3089
01:28:22.221 --> 01:28:22.730
<v Speaker 1>he'd probably,</v>

3090
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:25.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys who doesn't knock out because of that very reason because</v>

3091
01:28:25.581 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 1>he's had like problems with his hands over and over again.</v>

3092
01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:29.420
<v Speaker 1>But the way he knocked out,</v>

3093
01:28:29.421 --> 01:28:30.254
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3094
01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.730
<v Speaker 1>a homeboy from England,</v>

3095
01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:34.910
<v Speaker 1>the fuck's his name hadn't Ricky Hatton Shit.</v>

3096
01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:36.231
<v Speaker 1>That was brilliant.</v>

3097
01:28:36.231 --> 01:28:39.980
<v Speaker 1>And that was what happened was in his prime was on the animal floods.</v>

3098
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So fast box the shit out of him.</v>

3099

3100
01:28:43.191 --> 01:28:44.180

<v Speaker 1>When was like,</v>

3135
01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I know Floyd is a supreme athlete.</v>

3136
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Great boxer and a,</v>

3137
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:41.090
<v Speaker 1>we have to be ready for war and they cut to Roger Mayweather.</v>

3138
01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:41.993
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3139
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:42.590
<v Speaker 1>fuck</v>

3140
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:47.590
<v Speaker 3>about Miguel Cotto [inaudible] well,</v>

3141
01:29:49.721 --> 01:29:50.510
<v Speaker 3>the level</v>

3142
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:55.100
<v Speaker 1>of technique that Floyd has is so above and beyond everybody else.</v>

3143
01:29:55.101 --> 01:29:55.791
<v Speaker 1>He fights that.</v>

3144
01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:56.181
<v Speaker 1>He guys,</v>

3145
01:29:56.181 --> 01:29:58.460
<v Speaker 1>that kind of confidence it made me Miguel Cotto,</v>

3146
01:29:58.461 --> 01:30:00.650
<v Speaker 1>especially during that fight was a prime athlete.</v>

3147
01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Margarito was the only one that ever really fucked up Miguel Cotto when he was</v>

3148
01:30:04.701 --> 01:30:06.320
<v Speaker 1>in his prime or that stomped him.</v>

3149
01:30:06.321 --> 01:30:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And that was when Margarita was accused of having loaded gloves because he got</v>

3150
01:30:10.701 --> 01:30:11.181
<v Speaker 1>busted.</v>

3151
01:30:11.181 --> 01:30:12.290
<v Speaker 1>And Sherry did one of his,</v>

3152
01:30:12.291 --> 01:30:12.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3153
01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.550
<v Speaker 1>subsequent fights.</v>

3154
01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:18.650
<v Speaker 1>But Miguel Cotto was a bad ass fucking boxer boxing with Floyd.</v>

3155
01:30:18.651 --> 01:30:19.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like he just,</v>

3156
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:21.740
<v Speaker 1>he makes everybody look goofy.</v>

3157
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:22.910
<v Speaker 1>He makes everybody look,</v>

3158
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:27.260
<v Speaker 1>they look like they just don't really know what he's doing there.</v>

3159
01:30:27.261 --> 01:30:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't really belong in there with him.</v>

3160
01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:29.330
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3161
01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:32.120
<v Speaker 1>he figured you out early enough and now every time you step,</v>

3162
01:30:32.121 --> 01:30:34.940
<v Speaker 1>if popping a jab in your face and there's no retaliation,</v>

3163
01:30:34.941 --> 01:30:35.780
<v Speaker 1>he's not there.</v>

3164
01:30:35.781 --> 01:30:36.051
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3165
01:30:36.051 --> 01:30:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3166
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.770
<v Speaker 1>you look stupid and he's slowly breaks you down.</v>

3167
01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.360
<v Speaker 1>He's just so good.</v>

3168
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.651
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

3169
01:30:42.651 --> 01:30:43.730
<v Speaker 1>he's superb,</v>

3170
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:44.810
<v Speaker 1>superb boxer,</v>

3171
01:30:44.811 --> 01:30:45.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3172
01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:45.873
<v Speaker 1>It's Perv athlete.</v>

3173
01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.230
<v Speaker 1>But if I had a choice between watching him and Anderson Silva,</v>

3174
01:30:48.231 --> 01:30:49.064
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

3175
01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:49.983
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

3176
01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.880
<v Speaker 1>I would way rather watch Anderson Silva fight.</v>

3177
01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a question.</v>

3178
01:30:54.051 --> 01:30:56.270
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I like MMA so much better.</v>

3179
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I like a good fight with Floyd Mayweather.</v>

3180
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3181
01:30:59.030 --> 01:31:00.710
<v Speaker 1>like if I found out for me what was going to fight,</v>

3182
01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3183
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:03.080
<v Speaker 1>packing out before this last thing,</v>

3184
01:31:03.081 --> 01:31:04.070
<v Speaker 1>then it would be super excited.</v>

3185
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3186
01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3187
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:05.710

3188
01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.673
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting.</v>

3189
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.830
<v Speaker 1>If he's fighting somebody that I don't give a fuck.</v>

3190
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3191
01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:10.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like whatever.</v>

3192
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:11.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3193
01:31:11.031 --> 01:31:12.410
<v Speaker 1>He's just going to box this guy up.</v>

3194
01:31:12.411 --> 01:31:13.750
<v Speaker 1>It'll be interesting to watch know,</v>

3195
01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but I can watch on HBO next week.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but how famous is Anderson Silva in Brazil?</v>

3201

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.500
<v Speaker 1>The cheers when he goes on and on into the octagon,</v>

3209
01:31:36.501 --> 01:31:38.660
<v Speaker 1>when he steps up the stairs and walks into the,</v>

3210
01:31:38.661 --> 01:31:39.410
<v Speaker 1>close the door behind them,</v>

3211
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:40.550
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking definitely.</v>

3212
01:31:40.551 --> 01:31:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I took my headphones off and I said,</v>

3213
01:31:42.681 --> 01:31:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I go to Mike Goldberg while I was talking to him on the ear.</v>

3214
01:31:44.781 --> 01:31:44.961
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3217
01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:48.790
<v Speaker 1>He texts the headphones off.</v>

3218
01:31:48.791 --> 01:31:49.100
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3219
01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:50.270
<v Speaker 1>we're just looking at each other like,</v>

3220
01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3221
01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:56.060
<v Speaker 1>there's 20,000 people in Rio and they are going fucking bananas.</v>

3222
01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And Anderson walks in and bows and they're going fucking ape shit.</v>

3223
01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:05.210
<v Speaker 1>That's so then he goes out there and this man told Stephan Bonner in a way that</v>

3224
01:32:05.461 --> 01:32:07.200
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even seem human.</v>

3225
01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3226
01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:07.960
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3227
01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:12.960
<v Speaker 1>he did it like some fucking Kung Fu movie dude who just got bolted with some</v>

3228
01:32:12.961 --> 01:32:14.370
<v Speaker 1>secret lightening power.</v>

3229
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:17.550
<v Speaker 1>He had a superpower so it didn't even make any sense.</v>

3230
01:32:17.551 --> 01:32:18.510
<v Speaker 1>He did movie shit.</v>

3231
01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:21.470
<v Speaker 1>He stepped with his back up against the cage and let Steph and,</v>

3232
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:24.780
<v Speaker 1>or throw punches at him with his hands down and just ducked and moved in front</v>

3233
01:32:24.781 --> 01:32:27.990
<v Speaker 1>of them and then through bond or the ground and knock them unconscious with a</v>

3234
01:32:27.991 --> 01:32:29.820
<v Speaker 1>knee to the body,</v>

3235
01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:31.780
<v Speaker 1>blasted with a needle,</v>

3236
01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:32.730
<v Speaker 1>bonding this boom.</v>

3237
01:32:32.731 --> 01:32:34.080
<v Speaker 1>It goes down in a turtle position.</v>

3238
01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>

3239
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:35.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

3240
01:32:35.461 --> 01:32:36.870
<v Speaker 1>the way he did it was like,</v>

3241
01:32:36.871 --> 01:32:37.620
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3242
01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.880
<v Speaker 1>it was superhuman.</v>

3243
01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.440
<v Speaker 1>It was like a guy in a movie.</v>

3244
01:32:40.441 --> 01:32:40.621
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3245
01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.570
<v Speaker 1>if you saw a guy do that and like Bourne identity,</v>

3246
01:32:42.571 --> 01:32:43.120
<v Speaker 1>black pitch,</v>

<v Speaker 1>nobody come on back then walk out of here,</v>

3248
01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:46.590
<v Speaker 1>put your back up against the wall.</v>

3249
01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Nobody puts their back up against the cage.</v>

3250
01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:23.370

3300
01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:24.150
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3301
01:34:24.150 --> 01:34:27.180
<v Speaker 4>but John Claude van Damme was awesome and a completely different way.</v>

3302
01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:27.991
<v Speaker 4>What was the cool,</v>

3303
01:34:27.991 --> 01:34:30.420
<v Speaker 4>the movie that he came out a year or two ago,</v>

3304
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:31.950
<v Speaker 4>what was the movie came out with?</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was like about,</v>

3306
01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:33.601
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

3307
01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:34.111
<v Speaker 4>I'm crazy.</v>

3308
01:34:34.111 --> 01:34:35.290
<v Speaker 4>You think I know what movies he's doing?</v>

3309
01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:35.420
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3310
01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:35.571
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3311
01:34:35.571 --> 01:34:36.030
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3312
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:39.770
<v Speaker 4>This one was actually good where he played JC Vd.</v>

3313
01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3314
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:41.013
<v Speaker 4>Made himself.</v>

3315
01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:46.130
<v Speaker 4>That was good that I'm blue ray [inaudible] I never said I wasn't a fan.</v>

3316
01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:49.170
<v Speaker 4>I love John Claude van Damme,</v>

3317
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:54.500
<v Speaker 4>but he's still crazy and he has a reality show and he plays,</v>

3318
01:34:55.411 --> 01:34:57.090
<v Speaker 4>I guess I've only seen the videos,</v>

3319
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:57.501
<v Speaker 4>the internet,</v>

3320
01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:58.730
<v Speaker 4>but you could readily get them on the Internet,</v>

3321
01:34:58.731 --> 01:35:00.680
<v Speaker 4>but it's wonderful.</v>

3322
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3323
01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:02.510
<v Speaker 4>He's crazy.</v>

3324
01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:02.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3325
01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3326
01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.660
<v Speaker 4>And he keeps talking about,</v>

3327
01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:05.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to hit this fight.</v>

3328
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to fight one more time for the children.</v>

3329
01:35:09.190 --> 01:35:11.690
<v Speaker 4>Like he has like crazy ideas.</v>

3330
01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:12.081
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>

3331
01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:12.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3332
01:35:12.321 --> 01:35:13.020
<v Speaker 4>they said,</v>

3333
01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:13.853
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

3334
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:16.160
<v Speaker 4>you did a lot of cocaine and you know,</v>

3335
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:18.050
<v Speaker 4>you know a lot of other things.</v>

3336
01:35:18.051 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm not happy about those other things,</v>

3337
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:23.510
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to make it up with this fight and I'm going to win but not ouch.</v>

3338
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:27.560
<v Speaker 4>And it's like so crazy and over the like he's acting,</v>

3339
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:32.790
<v Speaker 4>it's like this strange hybrid between a reality show and a movie.</v>

3340
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:37.340
<v Speaker 4>And what he's doing is really strange because he's saying he's going to have a</v>

3341
01:35:37.341 --> 01:35:40.850
<v Speaker 4>fight and he's got this guy that he keeps dragging around with them that these</v>

3342
01:35:40.851 --> 01:35:41.330
<v Speaker 4>things happen.</v>

3343
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:44.000
<v Speaker 4>But the promise has been doing this for like four years.</v>

3344
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:46.970
<v Speaker 4>So this guy for these four years,</v>

3345
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:48.850
<v Speaker 4>he's been saying he's going to fight like,</v>

3346
01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.600
<v Speaker 4>and they pose for stare downs for me years,</v>

3347
01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:52.670
<v Speaker 4>years man.</v>

3348
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean for fucking this weird,</v>

3349
01:35:54.471 --> 01:35:57.260
<v Speaker 4>it's still going on and he's still like,</v>

3350
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.650
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3351
01:35:57.650 --> 01:35:58.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3352
01:35:58.161 --> 01:36:01.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have this fight and I'm going to do it for the children to show</v>

3353
01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:06.880
<v Speaker 4>them you can bounce back from out of this bullshit and this cocaine and fucking</v>

3354
01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.450
<v Speaker 2>wonderful.</v>

3355
01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:10.943
<v Speaker 2>Can we do that?</v>

3356
01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3357
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:12.930
<v Speaker 2>that might be it.</v>

3358
01:36:12.931 --> 01:36:13.980
<v Speaker 2>That might be one of them.</v>

3359
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of them.</v>

3360
01:36:15.361 --> 01:36:16.350
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of them.</v>

3361
01:36:16.351 --> 01:36:17.184
<v Speaker 2>Can I do,</v>

3362
01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.080
<v Speaker 2>he seems like a really nice guy.</v>

3363
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:21.510
<v Speaker 2>It seems like real friendly and you know,</v>

3364
01:36:21.511 --> 01:36:23.430
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't seem like he's trying to be a hard ass.</v>

3365
01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Like even when he sang like he's going to knock it out.</v>

3366
01:36:25.531 --> 01:36:25.800
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3374
01:36:33.301 --> 01:36:37.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like a weird hybrid between like reality and like I think that's the,</v>

3375
01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:41.940
<v Speaker 2>that's the new and next steps that's going to really develop for television is</v>

3376
01:36:41.941 --> 01:36:44.220
<v Speaker 2>like shows like a duck hunters.</v>

3377
01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:49.470
<v Speaker 2>The Duck Dynasty Duck Dynasty where it's that family and they go this is the</v>

3378
01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:50.430
<v Speaker 2>reality show.</v>

3379
01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:55.700
<v Speaker 2>But it's clearly like it's produced to well you're like there's no way.</v>

3380
01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Like these are real people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

01:37:33.911 --> 01:37:35.460
<v Speaker 2>Swamp people is just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they should call that show alligator assassins.</v>

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3409
01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's just a bunch of motherfuckers that live in Florida and kill</v>

3410
01:37:41.551 --> 01:37:45.870
<v Speaker 2>alligators and they kill off fuck load of alligators.</v>

3411
01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:46.381
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3412
01:37:46.381 --> 01:37:49.110
<v Speaker 2>They killed like 500 of them a season.</v>

3413
01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I went to high school with a few of those guys.</v>

3414
01:37:50.791 --> 01:37:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I think I remember them.</v>

3415
01:37:52.230 --> 01:37:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Do they kill a lot of alligators?</v>

3416
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It's really to think there's that</v>

3417
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.650
<v Speaker 1>many God damn alligator's out there and you know it's really freaky.</v>

3418
01:37:58.651 --> 01:37:59.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people might not like this,</v>

3419
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but if they weren't killing those alligators,</v>

3420
01:38:02.071 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 1>those alligators would fuck and make more alligators.</v>

3421
01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:07.920
<v Speaker 1>And if you think of how many fucking alligators they're killing,</v>

3422
01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:11.130
<v Speaker 1>do you know what kind of an infestation of alligators we must have in this</v>

3423
01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:11.964
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3425
01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>If they're killing hundreds and hundreds of them and in Florida,</v>

3426
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.730

3430
01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.160
<v Speaker 1>When I lived in Gainesville,</v>

3431
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:24.630
<v Speaker 1>they were protected.</v>

3432
01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:25.733
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't kill them.</v>

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Gainesville for two years.</v>

3440
01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:35.400
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was going to the University of Florida and um,</v>

3441
01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:35.911
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3442
01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:36.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3443
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 1>we used to go to Lake Alice.</v>

3444
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:41.100
<v Speaker 1>There's this like little lake there and we used to feed the alligators</v>

3445
01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:42.060
<v Speaker 1>marshmallows.</v>

3446
01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3447
01:38:42.970 --> 01:38:44.600
<v Speaker 1>You'd flip throw marshmallows,</v>

3448
01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:44.941
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>

3449
01:38:44.941 --> 01:38:45.241
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

3450
01:38:45.241 --> 01:38:45.451
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3451
01:38:45.451 --> 01:38:47.640
<v Speaker 1>these are crazy monsters are feeding these monsters.</v>

3452
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:49.740
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't really fuck with people too much.</v>

3453
01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.570
<v Speaker 1>They occasionally would like get a dog.</v>

3454
01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:52.471
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone would,</v>

3455
01:38:52.471 --> 01:38:54.240
<v Speaker 1>they walk their dog too close to the water,</v>

3456
01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:55.860
<v Speaker 1>didn't see the alligator.</v>

3457
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Alligator can't help themselves,</v>

3458
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but I guess they would feed them or something.</v>

3459
01:38:59.341 --> 01:38:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

3460
01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they did.</v>

3461
01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:03.930
<v Speaker 1>They must have done something to keep them happy if they are around people.</v>

3462
01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:07.410
<v Speaker 1>But apparently it got to a certain point where they were just so many fucking</v>

3463
01:39:07.411 --> 01:39:07.861
<v Speaker 1>alligators.</v>

3464
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:08.500
<v Speaker 1>They had to do something.</v>

3465
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.333
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3466
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>

3467
01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:10.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean I used to see,</v>

3468
01:39:10.871 --> 01:39:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I went to high school in Florida and you know,</v>

3469
01:39:12.850 --> 01:39:14.940
<v Speaker 3>you would see them all the courses.</v>

3470
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:16.280
<v Speaker 3>You see people's backyards there.</v>

3471
01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Let people have pools and Florida and up till people,</v>

3472
01:39:19.061 --> 01:39:19.690
<v Speaker 3>alligators.</v>

3473
01:39:19.690 --> 01:39:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it happens that often.</v>

3474
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it happens that often,</v>

3475
01:39:22.150 --> 01:39:23.080
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I'm sure it has.</v>

3476
01:39:23.110 --> 01:39:23.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3477
01:39:23.261 --> 01:39:24.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's statistics on it,</v>

3478
01:39:24.371 --> 01:39:27.120
<v Speaker 3>but I don't remember a lot of one a year maybe sandy,</v>

3479
01:39:27.130 --> 01:39:28.090
<v Speaker 3>one of those kinds of things.</v>

3480
01:39:28.091 --> 01:39:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3481
01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.381
<v Speaker 3>I know people lose,</v>

3482
01:39:29.381 --> 01:39:29.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3483
01:39:29.651 --> 01:39:30.340
<v Speaker 3>limbs and shit.</v>

3484
01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:33.770
<v Speaker 3>People go to get their golf ball and they go into a little pond.</v>

3485
01:39:34.810 --> 01:39:35.950
<v Speaker 3>You can lose a hand.</v>

3486
01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:38.381
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

3487
01:39:38.381 --> 01:39:39.940
<v Speaker 3>fuck you let that ball go.</v>

3488
01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:41.021
<v Speaker 3>What you do man?</v>

3489
01:39:41.021 --> 01:39:41.261
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

01:39:41.261 --> 01:39:41.501
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

01:39:41.501 --> 01:39:41.771
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

3492
01:39:41.771 --> 01:39:42.200
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

3493
01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Get a new title list.</v>

3494
01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.133
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

3495
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.610
<v Speaker 3>we'll leave it in the water.</v>

3496
01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely horrifying.</v>

3497
01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:49.570
<v Speaker 3>Like human flesh.</v>

3498
01:39:49.571 --> 01:39:51.730
<v Speaker 3>That's not their first crack at it.</v>

3499
01:39:51.970 --> 01:39:52.803
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

3500
01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:54.850
<v Speaker 3>he'll eat a bag of shit.</v>

3501
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:55.690
<v Speaker 3>They will.</v>

3502
01:39:55.690 --> 01:39:56.230
<v Speaker 3>They will.</v>

3503
01:39:56.230 --> 01:39:56.981
<v Speaker 3>They would eat people.</v>

3504
01:39:56.981 --> 01:39:59.890
<v Speaker 3>They just haven't been to plates and tires and the shit.</v>

3505
01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:03.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not their preference one way or on road rules in Australia.</v>

3506
01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.000
<v Speaker 3>We went to a crocodile farm and like the guy that owned it was explaining how</v>

3507
01:40:07.001 --> 01:40:08.950
<v Speaker 3>they don't really want to eat us,</v>

3508
01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:11.230
<v Speaker 3>but if they're hungry and there's nothing else,</v>

3509
01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:12.730
<v Speaker 3>that's when they'll fuck with you.</v>

3510
01:40:12.731 --> 01:40:14.620
<v Speaker 3>If you're down by the fucking swamp and you're like,</v>

3511
01:40:14.621 --> 01:40:15.131
<v Speaker 3>Oh hey,</v>

3512
01:40:15.131 --> 01:40:15.911
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing here?</v>

3513
01:40:15.911 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 3>And then it'll grab you in depth</v>

3514
01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:17.850
<v Speaker 1>roll you.</v>

3515
01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:21.100
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the only reason why they don't do is because they don't</v>

3516
01:40:21.101 --> 01:40:22.710
<v Speaker 1>recognize us as a food source.</v>

3517
01:40:22.711 --> 01:40:25.180
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious meal because they don't usually eat us.</v>

3518
01:40:25.181 --> 01:40:27.370
<v Speaker 1>But once they recognize us as a food source,</v>

3519
01:40:27.371 --> 01:40:28.720
<v Speaker 1>that's when it becomes a real problem.</v>

3520
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Like there was one they killed in the field,</v>

3521
01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:31.480
<v Speaker 1>the Philippines recently,</v>

3522
01:40:31.481 --> 01:40:33.100
<v Speaker 1>and it was fucking huge,</v>

3523
01:40:33.250 --> 01:40:35.780
<v Speaker 1>huge saltwater crocodile and they,</v>

3524
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:37.180
<v Speaker 1>it had killed a bunch of villagers.</v>

3525
01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't,</v>

3526
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:39.910
<v Speaker 1>they knew that there was this one giant crocodile,</v>

3527
01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:43.890
<v Speaker 1>it was more than 20 fucking feet long and it was killing people and they'd,</v>

3528
01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:45.490
<v Speaker 1>so they had to go after it and go get it.</v>

3529
01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:45.760
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

3530
01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:46.790
<v Speaker 1>and there was that one that was like,</v>

3531
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:50.680
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't in Canada one that the movie is based on like they made up.</v>

3532
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:51.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3533
01:40:51.581 --> 01:40:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3534
01:40:51.930 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 3>W Crocodile and Canada.</v>

3535
01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>I know some</v>

3536
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.281
<v Speaker 2>lake,</v>

3537
01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:55.000
<v Speaker 2>it was like a norm.</v>

3538
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Some of northern sitting leg was about not a Croc,</v>

3539
01:40:57.761 --> 01:40:58.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

3540
01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:58.953
<v Speaker 2>maybe a gator.</v>

3541
01:40:59.170 --> 01:40:59.411
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3542
01:40:59.411 --> 01:41:00.400
<v Speaker 2>That's what the movie's about.</v>

3543
01:41:00.401 --> 01:41:01.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like a horror movie.</v>

3544
01:41:01.251 --> 01:41:04.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not Lake Michigan.</v>

3545
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Remember the movie like Michigan?</v>

3546
01:41:06.650 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Pat Plath?</v>

3547
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Was it placid that about the movie?</v>

3548
01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.660
<v Speaker 2>That's based on a real story.</v>

3549
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:14.973
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>

3550
01:41:15.550 --> 01:41:16.271
<v Speaker 2>I met one of the,</v>

3551
01:41:16.271 --> 01:41:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I think I met one of the writers on that who told me that.</v>

3552
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:19.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3553
01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure man,</v>

3554
01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:22.210
<v Speaker 2>like based on,</v>

3555
01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong on the location,</v>

3556
01:41:23.770 --> 01:41:27.670
<v Speaker 2>but I know it's based on a real murdering gator.</v>

3557
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I think so is that right?</v>

3558
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:35.740
<v Speaker 2>What's the true story of Lake placid is alligator.</v>

3559
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to Wiki answers.</v>

3560
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:40.050
<v Speaker 2>How beautiful is this day then?</v>

3561
01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.790
<v Speaker 2>It's in a just do that.</v>

3562
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And I know you used to have encyclopedia Britannica.</v>

3563
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:48.790
<v Speaker 2>That shit was wack as fuck the stories based off the 1943 mysterious</v>

3564
01:41:48.791 --> 01:41:53.530
<v Speaker 2>disappearances of 10 teenagers while playing one night on lake placid.</v>

3565
01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:55.451
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3566
01:41:55.451 --> 01:41:55.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3567
01:41:55.930 --> 01:41:56.091
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3568
01:41:56.091 --> 01:41:56.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just uh,</v>

3569
01:41:57.210 --> 01:41:57.680
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3570
01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:58.513
<v Speaker 2>Just a rumor.</v>

3571
01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:59.130
<v Speaker 2>But the mood,</v>

3572
01:41:59.130 --> 01:41:59.320
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3573
01:41:59.320 --> 01:41:59.891
<v Speaker 2>So the movie,</v>

3574
01:41:59.891 --> 01:42:03.340
<v Speaker 2>just the movie the gate or concept to it or something?</v>

3575
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3576
01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:08.050
<v Speaker 2>apparently it became a legend because it happened in 1943 and so people would</v>

3577
01:42:08.051 --> 01:42:08.890
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

3578
01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.830
<v Speaker 2>And so the movie is like based on this actual monster and it's sort of a,</v>

3579
01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:14.830
<v Speaker 2>it's a factual short,</v>

3580
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:18.760
<v Speaker 2>don't send me your tweets or your emails about how I'm wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>

3582
01:42:19.331 --> 01:42:20.410
<v Speaker 2>We just read it on the Internet.</v>

3583
01:42:20.411 --> 01:42:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

3584
01:42:21.190 --> 01:42:23.500
<v Speaker 2>It's in what you said cannot be argued.</v>

3585
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.513

3591
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Which terrorizes the fictitional fictitional location of Black Lake Maine.</v>

3592
01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:45.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3593
01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:46.900
<v Speaker 2>that's even more ridiculous.</v>

3594
01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Maine's only like thought out for like a month,</v>

3595
01:42:49.391 --> 01:42:50.224
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

3596
01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:53.210
<v Speaker 2>So I wasn't that far off when I,</v>

3597
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.150
<v Speaker 2>when I said rate's pretty close.</v>

3598
01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.380
<v Speaker 2>That's close to Maine.</v>

3599
01:42:56.410 --> 01:42:56.681
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3600
01:42:56.681 --> 01:42:57.160
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let me go write it down.</v>

3604
01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 2>That's a winter gators.</v>

3605
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:04.500
<v Speaker 2>If you think about like,</v>

3606
01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:07.360
<v Speaker 2>like a perfect nightmare that's chasing after you,</v>

3607
01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:08.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant reptile,</v>

3608
01:43:08.861 --> 01:43:09.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3609
01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Because there's so emotionless and conti and just,</v>

3610
01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.190
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

3611
01:43:14.190 --> 01:43:15.100
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a fuck.</v>

3612
01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:15.811
<v Speaker 2>That's a dinosaur.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

3615
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:17.960
<v Speaker 2>it's just an extension of,</v>

3616
01:43:17.961 --> 01:43:18.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the like a t rex chasing you.</v>

3618
01:43:20.151 --> 01:43:24.850
<v Speaker 2>It's an animal that has virtually not changed for 200 million years.</v>

3619
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:27.760
<v Speaker 2>They existed in this form 200 million years ago.</v>

3620
01:43:27.761 --> 01:43:28.650
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck,</v>

3621
01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.493
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

3622
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:32.640
<v Speaker 2>They're all muscle muscle in the,</v>

3623
01:43:32.650 --> 01:43:33.550
<v Speaker 2>they're just like the,</v>

3624
01:43:33.551 --> 01:43:36.880
<v Speaker 2>the cleaning systems of ecosystems.</v>

3625
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.410
<v Speaker 2>They're like the cleaners.</v>

3626
01:43:38.411 --> 01:43:39.940
<v Speaker 2>They come in and anything that's limping,</v>

3627
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 2>you'd done.</v>

3628
01:43:40.450 --> 01:43:41.283
<v Speaker 2>Song</v>

3629
01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:47.290
<v Speaker 2>goes and tries to get water out of the wrong spot.</v>

3630
01:43:47.291 --> 01:43:47.861
<v Speaker 2>Slam,</v>

3631
01:43:47.861 --> 01:43:49.060
<v Speaker 2>keep the population down.</v>

3632
01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.201
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

3633
01:43:50.201 --> 01:43:51.830
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to cross this river and not,</v>

3634
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3635
01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:56.660
<v Speaker 4>You ever see those river crossings for those ones in io crocodiles?</v>

3636
01:43:56.661 --> 01:43:57.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3637
01:43:57.170 --> 01:44:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Step up and just huge dinosaur jaws clamped down on Willdabeast and drag them</v>

3638
01:44:02.571 --> 01:44:03.210
<v Speaker 4>underwater.</v>

3639
01:44:03.210 --> 01:44:03.481
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

3640
01:44:03.481 --> 01:44:03.770
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3641
01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.570
<v Speaker 4>what is the going on here?</v>

3642
01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.870
<v Speaker 4>I always fix a system that's set up totally a life system.</v>

3643
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:09.740
<v Speaker 4>Life and death.</v>

3644
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.350
<v Speaker 4>There is a population control mechanism in effect,</v>

3645
01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.660
<v Speaker 4>big cats and alligators.</v>

3646
01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:15.151
<v Speaker 4>Does it,</v>

3647
01:44:15.151 --> 01:44:15.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3648
01:44:15.381 --> 01:44:15.921
<v Speaker 4>crocodiles,</v>

3649
01:44:15.921 --> 01:44:18.800
<v Speaker 4>is it any coincidence that's the place where this is the most gazelles?</v>

3650
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:19.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3651
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.250
<v Speaker 4>Fucking things are running around everywhere.</v>

3652
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:22.730
<v Speaker 4>Everything's running around everywhere.</v>

3653
01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:24.200
<v Speaker 4>Willdabeast and all these things.</v>

3654
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:27.830
<v Speaker 4>You just giant things trying to eat and we keep their populations down.</v>

3655
01:44:28.190 --> 01:44:29.240
<v Speaker 4>The thing at the footage,</v>

3656
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.310
<v Speaker 4>the footage of that is always the same.</v>

3657
01:44:31.311 --> 01:44:32.120
<v Speaker 4>If you watch those,</v>

3658
01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:32.810
<v Speaker 4>those uh,</v>

3659
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:34.760
<v Speaker 4>like a nat Geo shows,</v>

3660
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.300
<v Speaker 4>they'll be like these 50 gazelles crossing the river and you're like,</v>

3661
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:39.143
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3662
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:43.060
<v Speaker 3>And then like three seconds go by and you're like,</v>

3663
01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:43.271
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3664
01:44:43.271 --> 01:44:44.920
<v Speaker 3>there's one that's not with the pack.</v>

3665
01:44:44.930 --> 01:44:46.660
<v Speaker 3>I think we should watch him for a second.</v>

3666
01:44:47.110 --> 01:44:48.940
<v Speaker 3>And then you watch him kind of limping,</v>

3667
01:44:48.970 --> 01:44:53.960
<v Speaker 3>tentatively crossed the creek and that crop comes up is like fucking over it.</v>

3668
01:44:54.710 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 4>There's such machines,</v>

3669
01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:59.480
<v Speaker 4>they're so terrified and they can be under that water for hours.</v>

3670
01:44:59.810 --> 01:45:01.460
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to breathe for hours.</v>

3671
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:06.200
<v Speaker 4>So they sit under the water waiting for someone to come by and then the bars all</v>

3672
01:45:06.201 --> 01:45:07.490
<v Speaker 4>fucking murky and shit.</v>

3673
01:45:07.491 --> 01:45:11.510
<v Speaker 4>You can't see that big dinosaur waiting there to eat babies.</v>

3674
01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:12.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

3675
01:45:12.250 --> 01:45:13.490
<v Speaker 4>That monster.</v>

3676
01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.520
<v Speaker 4>And how perfectly designed as where when you see you terrifying</v>

3677
01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.720
<v Speaker 3>footage of his eyes just out of the water.</v>

3678
01:45:19.930 --> 01:45:22.390
<v Speaker 3>So it's just up like just the water.</v>

3679
01:45:22.630 --> 01:45:23.231
<v Speaker 3>Horrific,</v>

3680
01:45:23.231 --> 01:45:24.220
<v Speaker 3>horrific monster.</v>

3681
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:25.300
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

3682
01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:25.481
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3683
01:45:25.481 --> 01:45:26.590
<v Speaker 3>this is gonna Sound really lame,</v>

3684
01:45:26.591 --> 01:45:27.290
<v Speaker 3>but unreal.</v>

3685
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:28.123
<v Speaker 3>Sros,</v>

3686
01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.051
<v Speaker 3>I had to,</v>

3687
01:45:29.051 --> 01:45:29.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3688
01:45:29.650 --> 01:45:32.020
<v Speaker 3>we had to put a bag over a crocodile's head.</v>

3689
01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:32.771
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3690
01:45:32.771 --> 01:45:33.231
<v Speaker 3>So you have to,</v>

3691
01:45:33.231 --> 01:45:34.270
<v Speaker 3>at first you have to clamp,</v>

3692
01:45:34.271 --> 01:45:38.320
<v Speaker 3>it's Josh shut and then duct tape it and then you put a bag on his head and then</v>

3693
01:45:38.321 --> 01:45:39.070
<v Speaker 3>you step you,</v>

3694
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.851
<v Speaker 3>you sit on it,</v>

3695
01:45:39.851 --> 01:45:41.620
<v Speaker 3>you have to sit on it to hold it still.</v>

3696
01:45:41.621 --> 01:45:42.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's how we would transport it.</v>

3697
01:45:42.911 --> 01:45:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Like for one of the mission I was,</v>

3698
01:45:45.041 --> 01:45:45.551
<v Speaker 3>so this guy,</v>

3699
01:45:45.551 --> 01:45:46.630
<v Speaker 3>key flaw on the show,</v>

3700
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:51.130
<v Speaker 3>you had a pole and he was trying to rope the crocodiles neck and the crocodile</v>

3701
01:45:51.131 --> 01:45:52.630
<v Speaker 3>went into a death roll.</v>

3702
01:45:52.690 --> 01:45:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh Geez.</v>

3703
01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.250
<v Speaker 3>And his shirt got caught in the poll twist around his arm and it was cutting off</v>

3704
01:45:58.270 --> 01:46:00.790
<v Speaker 3>the circulation and everybody was like,</v>

3705
01:46:00.791 --> 01:46:01.890
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

3706
01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Like when that really happens on a reality show,</v>

3707
01:46:03.791 --> 01:46:04.840
<v Speaker 3>like you don't know what to do.</v>

3708
01:46:04.841 --> 01:46:05.890
<v Speaker 3>So he was just screaming,</v>

3709
01:46:05.891 --> 01:46:06.724
<v Speaker 3>cut the shirt,</v>

3710
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:07.583
<v Speaker 3>got the shirt,</v>

3711
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:08.833
<v Speaker 3>got that fuck.</v>

3712
01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:09.851
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3713
01:46:09.851 --> 01:46:10.180
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

3714
01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:11.740
<v Speaker 3>there's no scissors in the outback.</v>

3715
01:46:11.741 --> 01:46:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody had to rummage through their sound kit or whatever.</v>

3716
01:46:14.441 --> 01:46:15.690
<v Speaker 3>And we were standing still spinning.</v>

3717
01:46:15.691 --> 01:46:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Spinning is when it ended up a big as a solopreneur I was,</v>

3718
01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:19.480
<v Speaker 3>it was medium size,</v>

3719
01:46:19.481 --> 01:46:21.460
<v Speaker 3>10 to 15 feet long.</v>

3720
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.173
<v Speaker 3>Teenager,</v>

3721
01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:26.440
<v Speaker 3>it was its teeth clamped down on a shirt.</v>

3722
01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3723
01:46:26.710 --> 01:46:29.860
<v Speaker 3>So you clamp the jaw shut and then somebody duct tapes,</v>

3724
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:31.223
<v Speaker 3>the jaws together,</v>

3725
01:46:31.610 --> 01:46:32.770
<v Speaker 3>he got a hold of the teeth.</v>

3726
01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:33.731
<v Speaker 3>So no,</v>

3727
01:46:33.731 --> 01:46:34.180
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3728
01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:36.850
<v Speaker 3>so the next part is you have to just put something around its neck.</v>

3729
01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.350
<v Speaker 3>So Keith Lowe was using a poll with the rope at the end of it,</v>

3730
01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.320
<v Speaker 3>like a loop road.</v>

3731
01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:42.670
<v Speaker 3>So they loop it that,</v>

3732
01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:42.881
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3733
01:46:42.881 --> 01:46:43.030
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3734
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.181
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3735
01:46:43.181 --> 01:46:43.841
<v Speaker 3>So he did it in,</v>

3736
01:46:43.841 --> 01:46:48.190
<v Speaker 3>somehow this crocodile like got latched onto maybe in this job,</v>

3737
01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:48.790
<v Speaker 3>the rope,</v>

3738
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:49.360
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3739
01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.200
<v Speaker 3>and he just started</v>

3740
01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.033
<v Speaker 2>death rolling.</v>

3741
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:51.903
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

3742
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:56.800
<v Speaker 2>It got the polo shirt on his sleeve and then tighten the sleeve.</v>

3743
01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:58.750
<v Speaker 2>So we had to cut the shirt off of him.</v>

3744
01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Got To wear spandex.</v>

3745
01:47:00.821 --> 01:47:01.770
<v Speaker 2>When you fucking with Crocker,</v>

3746
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:03.191

3747
01:47:03.191 --> 01:47:04.270
<v Speaker 2>It'd be all tucked up,</v>

3748
01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:06.010
<v Speaker 2>tucked up and ready to sprint</v>

3750
01:47:09.131 --> 01:47:09.990

<v Speaker 2>I'd be lifting weights right next.</v>

3800
01:49:08.150 --> 01:49:09.270
<v Speaker 4>I got some wolf color.</v>

3801
01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:13.220
<v Speaker 4>It's just the fact that he eyeballing me knowing that I look delicious and</v>

3802
01:49:13.221 --> 01:49:16.430
<v Speaker 4>nutritious and he's starving to death and they made me do more squats.</v>

01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:00.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3834
01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:02.770
<v Speaker 2>that had the animals at his house and he released them,</v>

3835
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:03.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3836
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Remember Ohio?</v>

3837
01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3838
01:50:05.141 --> 01:50:06.090
<v Speaker 2>I have a bit about that.</v>

3839
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.320
<v Speaker 2>That's on my plug plugging it or anything.</v>

3840
01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3841
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:09.641
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

3842
01:50:09.641 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 2>He Ke,</v>

3843
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:11.110
<v Speaker 2>he killed him.</v>

3844
01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:11.351
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3845
01:50:11.351 --> 01:50:12.610
<v Speaker 2>he cut up,</v>

3846
01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.050
<v Speaker 2>he released them all right.</v>

3847
01:50:14.051 --> 01:50:18.130
<v Speaker 2>And then I believe he cut up like some chickens and like poured the blood all</v>

3848
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:20.770
<v Speaker 2>over himself and with dead animals on him.</v>

3849
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:21.131
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3850
01:50:21.131 --> 01:50:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>

3851
01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:22.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3852
01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:23.770
<v Speaker 2>he had lions and shit and he released.</v>

3853
01:50:23.771 --> 01:50:24.340
<v Speaker 2>So he got,</v>

3854
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:25.840
<v Speaker 2>he got fucked up by everything.</v>

3855
01:50:25.841 --> 01:50:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I think he might've been dead before they got to him,</v>

3856
01:50:28.991 --> 01:50:31.780
<v Speaker 2>but they eventually like animals a pull in his dead body apart.</v>

3857
01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.673
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3865
01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:38.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3866
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Our system was silly.</v>

3867
01:50:40.631 --> 01:50:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

3868
01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3869
01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3870
01:50:42.041 --> 01:50:42.631
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

3871
01:50:42.631 --> 01:50:43.160
<v Speaker 2>the whole</v>

3872
01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.920
<v Speaker 1>zoo life is really a,</v>

3873
01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.041
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3874
01:50:46.041 --> 01:50:49.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy torture that we do so that we can look at animals in real life</v>

3875
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.600
<v Speaker 1>because they don't even allow them to live a natural life while in captivity.</v>

3876
01:50:53.630 --> 01:50:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if we had them in an ecosystem that was similar to their own,</v>

3877
01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:59.470
<v Speaker 1>so we put them in these containment areas,</v>

3878
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:00.760
<v Speaker 1>then we let loose antelope.</v>

3879
01:51:00.761 --> 01:51:03.140
<v Speaker 1>So whatever the fuck it is that they get to run and chase down and kill</v>

3880
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:05.460
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that was the case.</v>

3881
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that that would at least be like rewarding life and these cats,</v>

3882
01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:13.460
<v Speaker 1>when you keep pushing that meat out to them and they don't get any sort of chase</v>

3883
01:51:13.461 --> 01:51:15.260
<v Speaker 1>reward thing going on,</v>

3884
01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:17.360
<v Speaker 1>we see like the play with each other.</v>

3885
01:51:17.361 --> 01:51:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Like they want to chase things like it's a part of the whole dynamics of their</v>

3886
01:51:20.781 --> 01:51:21.614
<v Speaker 1>organism,</v>

3887
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:24.410
<v Speaker 1>like their design to chase and kill Shit.</v>

3888
01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 1>They're designed to kill all the shit and so you put them in this cage just like</v>

3889
01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:33.920
<v Speaker 1>jolting their brain like they never get a chance to express what they were put</v>

3890
01:51:33.921 --> 01:51:35.000
<v Speaker 1>on earth to do.</v>

3891
01:51:35.210 --> 01:51:38.480
<v Speaker 1>It sounds fucked up but it's depressing but you mean what are you going to do?</v>

3892
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:41.900
<v Speaker 1>You're going to stop the gazelles from breeding and you're going to control the</v>

3893
01:51:41.901 --> 01:51:42.191
<v Speaker 1>gazelle,</v>

3894
01:51:42.191 --> 01:51:42.651
<v Speaker 1>but I can put,</v>

3895
01:51:42.651 --> 01:51:44.540
<v Speaker 1>put a few fucking gazelles in the cage with them.</v>

3896
01:51:44.630 --> 01:51:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3897
01:51:45.230 --> 01:51:46.063
<v Speaker 1>Just let them know</v>

3898
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:47.810
<v Speaker 2>we don't need to watch it.</v>

3899
01:51:47.811 --> 01:51:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll pay extra.</v>

3900
01:51:49.610 --> 01:51:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Here's the team.</v>

3901
01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:50.981
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference?</v>

3902
01:51:50.981 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 1>God it between the meat that you're giving them because you're giving them meet</v>

3903
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:54.130
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3904
01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Someone's killing an animal and someone's giving him that mean.</v>

3905
01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Why can't he do that?</v>

3906
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Because you know he wants to,</v>

3907
01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:00.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3908
01:52:00.370 --> 01:52:01.510
<v Speaker 1>well someone else is killing it.</v>

3909
01:52:01.511 --> 01:52:02.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're saving an animal,</v>

3910
01:52:02.921 --> 01:52:05.860
<v Speaker 1>someone else's killing a fucking animal and you're cutting.</v>

3911
01:52:05.861 --> 01:52:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3912
01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're sliding under the track.</v>

3913
01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Why not just let a cow loose and let them that don't go out and talk about</v>

3914
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:15.070
<v Speaker 2>driving revenue like,</v>

3915
01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.260
<v Speaker 2>because they're like,</v>

3916
01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:16.860
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3917
01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:19.000
<v Speaker 2>it's an extra 70 to watch.</v>

3918
01:52:19.630 --> 01:52:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Here you go.</v>

3919
01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:20.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3920
01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:21.830
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do in Asia,</v>

3921
01:52:22.230 --> 01:52:23.890
<v Speaker 2>in Asia and they feed tigers.</v>

3922
01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:25.300
<v Speaker 2>They released goats.</v>

3923
01:52:25.770 --> 01:52:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

3924
01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

3925
01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Paul pornos videos up.</v>

3926
01:52:27.970 --> 01:52:29.410
<v Speaker 2>You ready to freak the fuck out?</v>

3927
01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3928
01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3929
01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:31.720
<v Speaker 2>This is like a common thing</v>

3930
01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:32.091
<v Speaker 1>theme.</v>

3931
01:52:32.091 --> 01:52:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Apparently in Asia they,</v>

3932
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.980
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3933
01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.000
<v Speaker 1>when they have tigers,</v>

3934
01:52:35.150 --> 01:52:38.630
<v Speaker 1>they just have this big dump truck and they have the dump truck with a couple of</v>

3935
01:52:38.631 --> 01:52:39.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking goats in it and yeah.</v>

3936
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:44.550
<v Speaker 2>And the goat doesn't know what the fuck is going on.</v>

3937
01:52:44.551 --> 01:52:45.384
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

3938
01:52:45.690 --> 01:52:46.523
<v Speaker 2>do</v>

3939
01:52:46.590 --> 01:52:46.891
<v Speaker 4>you know why?</v>

3940
01:52:46.891 --> 01:52:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Because a new goat gets dropped off like that every day.</v>

3941
01:52:49.610 --> 01:52:49.741
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3942
01:52:49.741 --> 01:52:53.550
<v Speaker 4>So the Tigers like stand there and stare while this thing backs up and beeps and</v>

3943
01:52:53.551 --> 01:52:55.560
<v Speaker 4>they just wait and they get real close to it.</v>

3944
01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:56.910
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as this thing opens,</v>

3945
01:52:57.090 --> 01:52:58.980
<v Speaker 4>the goat dumps out and boom,</v>

3946
01:52:58.981 --> 01:53:00.000
<v Speaker 4>they jump on a three,</v>

3947
01:53:00.001 --> 01:53:00.900
<v Speaker 4>four minute time,</v>

3948
01:53:00.901 --> 01:53:04.920
<v Speaker 4>rip it apart into shreds in a matter of seconds and they run away with like,</v>

3949
01:53:04.930 --> 01:53:05.970
<v Speaker 4>one's got head,</v>

3950
01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.320
<v Speaker 4>one's got a leg.</v>

3951
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.581
<v Speaker 4>I love this.</v>

3952
01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:09.414
<v Speaker 4>You find any,</v>

3953
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:11.310
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're supposed to do.</v>

3954
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.641
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

3955
01:53:11.641 --> 01:53:12.450
<v Speaker 4>do you see this shit?</v>

3956
01:53:12.450 --> 01:53:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Because this is a weird thing to see,</v>

3957
01:53:14.370 --> 01:53:15.990
<v Speaker 4>but this is what they want to do.</v>

3958
01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3959
01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:17.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're going to kill that,</v>

3960
01:53:17.671 --> 01:53:18.271
<v Speaker 4>go to anyway.</v>

3961
01:53:18.271 --> 01:53:18.981
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to feed him,</v>

3962
01:53:18.981 --> 01:53:19.814
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

3963
01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.090
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3964
01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Why we need to do that.</v>

3965
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:22.650
<v Speaker 4>Because then at least,</v>

3966
01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's still fucked up that you're got them.</v>

3967
01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:26.550
<v Speaker 4>You've got them contained like that,</v>

3968
01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:27.540
<v Speaker 4>but it leaves.</v>

3969
01:53:27.541 --> 01:53:29.880
<v Speaker 4>Then they get to live a tiger's life.</v>

3970
01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.690
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the only reason we don't get that it's because of like some type of</v>

3971
01:53:33.691 --> 01:53:36.960
<v Speaker 4>animal rights organizations here that don't really exist in other parts of the</v>

3972
01:53:36.961 --> 01:53:38.160
<v Speaker 4>world about what I'm saying.</v>

3973
01:53:38.430 --> 01:53:43.430
<v Speaker 4>I think our own lives for a lot of people are so fucking suppressive and</v>

3974
01:53:43.501 --> 01:53:47.520
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous and restrained that we don't give a fuck about that stupid elephant.</v>

3975
01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:48.331
<v Speaker 4>Tough Shit,</v>

3976
01:53:48.331 --> 01:53:48.810
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

3977
01:53:48.810 --> 01:53:49.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3978
01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:50.191
<v Speaker 4>Take your cage.</v>

3979
01:53:50.191 --> 01:53:51.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't like my cubicle.</v>

3980
01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3981
01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:53.213
<v Speaker 2>Here's one.</v>

3982
01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

3983
01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

3984
01:53:54.710 --> 01:53:56.760
<v Speaker 2>They just sitting there watching and waiting.</v>

3985
01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:58.320
<v Speaker 2>These are lions.</v>

3986
01:53:59.030 --> 01:54:00.570
<v Speaker 2>This is a different lab,</v>

3987
01:54:00.690 --> 01:54:01.523
<v Speaker 2>but a they do.</v>

3988
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3989
01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:02.331
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

3990
01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:03.164
<v Speaker 2>It lives too,</v>

3991
01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:07.200
<v Speaker 2>so they just sit around and they lift up this dump truck.</v>

3992
01:54:08.250 --> 01:54:10.410
<v Speaker 2>They're opening the door right now and the lines are just,</v>

3993
01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:12.410
<v Speaker 2>they're just hovering right in front of it.</v>

3994
01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:13.803
<v Speaker 5>Erica,</v>

3998
01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.890
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to control the lines by honking his horn.</v>

3999
01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:24.211
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't.</v>

4005
01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:36.770
<v Speaker 2>It's really going high now and the things going to drop out.</v>

4006

<v Speaker 2>Some of the best.</v>

4008
01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's got his dick out.</v>

4009
01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:45.950
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4011
01:54:46.441 --> 01:54:47.191
<v Speaker 5>He pulled it out of it.</v>

4012
01:54:47.191 --> 01:54:48.024
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>

4013
01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:50.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

4014
01:54:50.521 --> 01:54:51.240
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

4015
01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:52.680
<v Speaker 2>They just latch onto it.</v>

4016
01:54:52.730 --> 01:54:52.981
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

4017
01:54:52.981 --> 01:54:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Toy Rip it to shreds.</v>

4018
01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:55.513
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Look at it.</v>

4020
01:54:56.431 --> 01:54:57.480
<v Speaker 4>They're all playing tug of war.</v>

4021
01:54:57.481 --> 01:55:01.540
<v Speaker 4>There's like nine lines and then another one tries to get in this one pot at him</v>

4022
01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.060
<v Speaker 4>seeing that one's pawn at them.</v>

4023
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.781
<v Speaker 4>I don't hear it.</v>

4024
01:55:03.781 --> 01:55:04.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't hear her crying anymore.</v>

4025
01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:05.603
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

4026
01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:08.203
<v Speaker 2>She's like guys,</v>

4027
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:09.081
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4028
01:55:09.081 --> 01:55:09.470
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4029
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:10.303
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

4030
01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:11.443
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

4031
01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4032
01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:14.460
<v Speaker 2>people are screaming.</v>

4033
01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:16.293
<v Speaker 8>That is awesome.</v>

4034
01:55:20.190 --> 01:55:21.550
<v Speaker 8>I pay a lot to see that</v>

4035
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:29.330
<v Speaker 5>a seven year old.</v>

4036
01:55:29.650 --> 01:55:29.940
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4037
01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.760
<v Speaker 5>You do not want to fuck that shit</v>

4038
01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:34.580
<v Speaker 4>girl or a boy if that's a girl.</v>

4039
01:55:34.581 --> 01:55:35.720
<v Speaker 4>You do not want to fire ground.</v>

4040
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:36.561
<v Speaker 4>If that's a boy,</v>

4041
01:55:36.561 --> 01:55:37.550
<v Speaker 4>he needs to be monitored.</v>

4042
01:55:38.130 --> 01:55:39.090
<v Speaker 4>It needs to be monitored.</v>

4043
01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:40.160
<v Speaker 4>Like that piece that Josh,</v>

4044
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:41.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh these are,</v>

4045
01:55:41.811 --> 01:55:42.561
<v Speaker 4>these are impressive,</v>

4046
01:55:42.561 --> 01:55:43.394
<v Speaker 4>but these are lions.</v>

4047
01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:44.770
<v Speaker 4>If you could find tigers,</v>

4048
01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:45.071
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

4049
01:55:45.071 --> 01:55:45.970
<v Speaker 4>see if we can find tigers.</v>

4050
01:55:45.971 --> 01:55:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Cause the tiger video that I saw is way more quick,</v>

4051
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:49.460
<v Speaker 4>way more quicker,</v>

4052
01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:54.460
<v Speaker 4>were a kid was spying on the Roche's see more humane.</v>

4053
01:55:54.521 --> 01:55:55.001
<v Speaker 4>Oddly,</v>

4054
01:55:55.001 --> 01:55:56.880
<v Speaker 4>when you're feeding these wild animals,</v>

4055
01:55:56.881 --> 01:55:59.940
<v Speaker 4>it's totally more than to be in their element to be,</v>

4056
01:55:59.950 --> 01:56:00.730
<v Speaker 4>that's your nature.</v>

4057
01:56:00.730 --> 01:56:01.570
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're supposed to be.</v>

4058
01:56:01.571 --> 01:56:02.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4059
01:56:02.110 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>

4060
01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:03.203
<v Speaker 4>we've already,</v>

4061
01:56:03.730 --> 01:56:06.730
<v Speaker 4>I think that weighs ridiculous where the slow dump truck,</v>

4062
01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:10.190
<v Speaker 4>but there should be a gate and you should let a couple of them out in the</v>

4063
01:56:10.190 --> 01:56:10.210
<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>

4064
01:56:10.210 --> 01:56:10.490

4066
01:56:12.170 --> 01:56:15.490
<v Speaker 4>I think the footage I saw what time was from the Baghdad zoo was like that</v>

4067
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:16.390
<v Speaker 4>terrible way to die.</v>

4068
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Someone's honking their horns and all sudden they're playing tug of war with</v>

4069
01:56:19.361 --> 01:56:19.901
<v Speaker 4>your body.</v>

4070

4108
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:29.780
<v Speaker 4>was kind of looked like he was paying up a cup to have a sip out of it.</v>

01:58:32.210 --> 01:58:33.320
<v Speaker 4>that death row,</v>

4150
01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:35.170
<v Speaker 4>those crocodiles love,</v>

4151
01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:37.100
<v Speaker 4>they'll eat your fucking delicious dick.</v>

4152
01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:40.670
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the thing with bears too,</v>

4153
01:58:40.730 --> 01:58:42.150
<v Speaker 4>is a bears.</v>

4154
01:58:42.150 --> 01:58:42.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

4155
01:58:42.570 --> 01:58:43.500
<v Speaker 1>they don't kill you first.</v>

4156
01:58:43.501 --> 01:58:44.334
<v Speaker 1>They just eat you.</v>

4157
01:58:44.490 --> 01:58:45.161
<v Speaker 1>Because if you,</v>

4158
01:58:45.161 --> 01:58:48.600
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do is you want to get killed by a Predator because predators</v>

4159
01:58:48.630 --> 01:58:49.200
<v Speaker 1>are always,</v>

4160
01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:53.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting killed by something that doesn't always kill it stuff.</v>

4161
01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he eats a lot of things that it finds laying around,</v>

4162
01:58:55.831 --> 01:58:57.690
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in or whether it's,</v>

4163
01:58:57.691 --> 01:58:58.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4164
01:58:58.110 --> 01:59:00.840
<v Speaker 1>a berries or vegetables like bears.</v>

4165
01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:02.070
<v Speaker 1>They fight just,</v>

4166
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.903
<v Speaker 1>they just eat you.</v>

4167
01:59:03.070 --> 01:59:05.670
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know that I can certainly killing you once they have you.</v>

4168
01:59:05.671 --> 01:59:08.220
<v Speaker 1>They have you say they wait 1200 fucking pounds,</v>

4169
01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:09.450
<v Speaker 1>so they just start eating.</v>

4170
01:59:09.570 --> 01:59:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Why kill you first?</v>

4171
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.890
<v Speaker 1>So carefree,</v>

4172
01:59:10.890 --> 01:59:11.250
<v Speaker 1>scream,</v>

4173
01:59:11.250 --> 01:59:11.491
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

4174
01:59:11.491 --> 01:59:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to eat your Dick.</v>

4175
01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:15.480
<v Speaker 1>They just just shoo chunks of you.</v>

4176
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:17.960
<v Speaker 1>They say that the Grizzly man documentary when that guy,</v>

4177
01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:18.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4178
01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:19.291
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

4179
01:59:19.291 --> 01:59:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Right folks,</v>

4180
01:59:20.431 --> 01:59:22.140
<v Speaker 1>if you have not watched grizzly man,</v>

4181
01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:25.500
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the best unintentional comedies in the history of film.</v>

4182
01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:26.933
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4183
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:29.070
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of our love story.</v>

4184
01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:34.180
<v Speaker 6>When we were dating I was like,</v>

4185
01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:34.571
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

4186
01:59:34.571 --> 01:59:35.081
<v Speaker 6>I forget,</v>

4187
01:59:35.081 --> 01:59:35.471
<v Speaker 6>but we were like,</v>

4188
01:59:35.471 --> 01:59:37.660
<v Speaker 6>we got to go see this movie.</v>

4189
01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:40.210
<v Speaker 6>But this fucking guy that lived with bears,</v>

4190
01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:41.213
<v Speaker 6>I remember that.</v>

4191
01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:45.670
<v Speaker 6>I remember the news story breaking and that we went and we're sitting in this</v>

4192
01:59:45.671 --> 01:59:46.061
<v Speaker 6>theater,</v>

4193
01:59:46.061 --> 01:59:48.790
<v Speaker 6>I think it was in Pasadena at a Lemley,</v>

4194
01:59:48.791 --> 01:59:51.370
<v Speaker 6>so it was more of like it was playing in like the art artsy theater.</v>

4195
01:59:51.371 --> 01:59:53.050
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't in like the major release theaters.</v>

4196
01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:56.110
<v Speaker 6>It was in the artsy theaters around and we went and there was like,</v>

4197
01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:56.351
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

4198
01:59:56.351 --> 02:00:01.351
<v Speaker 6>maybe like 50 or 60 people at it and the whole time every like basically beat</v>

4199
02:00:02.651 --> 02:00:05.680
<v Speaker 6>over the movie were in hysterics laughing.</v>

4200
02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.200
<v Speaker 6>And the other 50 people are not like,</v>

4201
02:00:08.201 --> 02:00:12.040
<v Speaker 6>they're all serious movie goers that like really feel</v>

4202
02:00:12.210 --> 02:00:13.043
<v Speaker 5>for like</v>

4203
02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.430
<v Speaker 5>two years</v>

4204
02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:21.180
<v Speaker 5>we're getting looks from people that were getting looks like it's not fucking</v>

4205
02:00:21.181 --> 02:00:22.014
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>

4206
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:23.223
<v Speaker 1>He's dead.</v>

4207
02:00:23.290 --> 02:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4208
02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

4209
02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:24.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4210
02:00:24.671 --> 02:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>funny though.</v>

4211
02:00:25.571 --> 02:00:29.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like it does a disservice to his life to pretend he wasn't funny.</v>

4212
02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:31.080
<v Speaker 6>Remember the pilot,</v>

4213
02:00:31.230 --> 02:00:33.300
<v Speaker 6>the best lines that the pilot who,</v>

4214
02:00:33.301 --> 02:00:33.600
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4215
02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:34.830
<v Speaker 6>would drop them off and he was like,</v>

4216
02:00:34.831 --> 02:00:36.850
<v Speaker 6>and he decided he wanted to go live with bears in the,</v>

4217
02:00:37.110 --> 02:00:37.410
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4218
02:00:37.410 --> 02:00:38.280
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was retarded.</v>

4219
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:43.310
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

4220
02:00:47.730 --> 02:00:48.890
<v Speaker 5>my favorite part was when</v>

4221
02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>he was walking around with his camera,</v>

4222
02:00:52.050 --> 02:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>talking to his camera about how easy it would be if he was gay,</v>

4223
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:55.243
<v Speaker 1>but he's not gay.</v>

4224
02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:56.271
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4225
02:00:56.271 --> 02:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>so obviously gang walking around with his camera and he's like talking to it.</v>

4226
02:01:01.490 --> 02:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I ran into some guy who,</v>

4227
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:04.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4228
02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:05.900
<v Speaker 1>his roommate,</v>

4229
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>like apparently the grizzly man was in love with his roommate and when his</v>

4230
02:01:09.351 --> 02:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>roommate didn't reciprocate,</v>

4231
02:01:10.461 --> 02:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>he trashed his apartment.</v>

4232
02:01:12.170 --> 02:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he was a bit of an angry fellow.</v>

4233
02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Like if you ever saw the video and he's screaming and yelling into the camera,</v>

4234
02:01:19.190 --> 02:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>he does like a bunch of different takes</v>

4235
02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:24.653
<v Speaker 1>pairs.</v>

4236
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I worked it out</v>

4237
02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>and he's got this like really obvious like sort of fam gay voice.</v>

4238
02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>He's got that voice like this</v>

4239
02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:39.800
<v Speaker 6>undeniable stereotypical</v>

4240
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:42.460
<v Speaker 4>like cartoonish gay boys.</v>

4241
02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4242
02:01:42.730 --> 02:01:43.100
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

4243
02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:44.150
<v Speaker 4>And so he's walking,</v>

4244
02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:45.590
<v Speaker 4>holding up the camera going,</v>

4245
02:01:45.591 --> 02:01:45.831
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4246
02:01:45.831 --> 02:01:47.520
<v Speaker 4>if I was gay I could just go to a rest,</v>

4247
02:01:47.521 --> 02:01:49.160
<v Speaker 4>stop and meet a guy bought,</v>

4248
02:01:49.170 --> 02:01:50.003
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

4249
02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:51.650
<v Speaker 4>he Treadwell's not gay.</v>

4250
02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 4>And it's like the weirdest thing.</v>

4251
02:01:53.271 --> 02:01:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Like this poor fucking guy.</v>

4252
02:01:54.611 --> 02:01:59.611
<v Speaker 4>Like he was so torn up and confused and conflicted that he just decided to go</v>

4253
02:01:59.991 --> 02:02:00.880
<v Speaker 4>live with bears.</v>

4254
02:02:02.090 --> 02:02:02.481
<v Speaker 4>He missed,</v>

4255
02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:05.950
<v Speaker 4>he misread the fucking newsletter and when after real bears.</v>

4256
02:02:05.951 --> 02:02:06.784
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:08.133
<v Speaker 5>guys like me.</v>

4258
02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:12.290
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

4259
02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:15.290
<v Speaker 4>it was crazy how close he got to the animals.</v>

4260
02:02:15.291 --> 02:02:17.190
<v Speaker 4>They're like with a fox became his little buddy.</v>

4261
02:02:20.010 --> 02:02:20.843
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4262
02:02:24.910 --> 02:02:26.210
<v Speaker 5>he's like touching her shit.</v>

4263
02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.690
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't the Fox called like Foxy Fox is foxy?</v>

4264
02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:31.573
<v Speaker 5>What was the thing?</v>

4265
02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:34.310
<v Speaker 5>Chocolat it also says us so gay.</v>

4266
02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:34.821
<v Speaker 5>When he got,</v>

4267
02:02:34.821 --> 02:02:37.880
<v Speaker 5>remember when the bear approached him one time bear was approaching him and he</v>

4268
02:02:37.881 --> 02:02:38.450
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

4269
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.691
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

4270
02:02:38.691 --> 02:02:39.080
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

4271
02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:39.381

02:02:46.410 --> 02:02:46.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4276
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:47.451
<v Speaker 5>that's what it was.</v>

4277
02:02:47.451 --> 02:02:48.284
<v Speaker 5>The reverse.</v>

4278
02:02:48.970 --> 02:02:50.000
<v Speaker 5>He has to be in IBM.</v>

4279
02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:51.170

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:55.280
<v Speaker 4>don't want to let him get in too close.</v>

4283
02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Apparently the death video where they never got a kit lens on it so it's only</v>

4284
02:02:59.451 --> 02:03:00.240
<v Speaker 4>audio.</v>

4285
02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.710
<v Speaker 4>The other cap on but the camera was running is seven minutes long.</v>

4286
02:03:04.130 --> 02:03:06.080
<v Speaker 4>It took them seven minutes for the bear to eat them.</v>

4287
02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.030
<v Speaker 4>It was him and his girlfriend.</v>

4288
02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:09.313
<v Speaker 4>The barrel of the bolts.</v>

4289
02:03:09.650 --> 02:03:12.890
<v Speaker 4>The girlfriend hit the bear over the head with a frying pan apparently a couple</v>

4290
02:03:12.891 --> 02:03:16.070
<v Speaker 4>of times in the barrels like bitch and there was a sick bear.</v>

4291
02:03:16.071 --> 02:03:17.540
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it was sick bear.</v>

4292
02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:19.820
<v Speaker 4>They found out like later on.</v>

4293
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:24.850
<v Speaker 4>I remember you could look it up that I don't remember if the bear had like some</v>

4294
02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:25.870
<v Speaker 4>type of disease.</v>

4295
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:26.151
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4296
02:03:26.151 --> 02:03:28.820
<v Speaker 4>the rabies or something where it was not in a,</v>

4297
02:03:28.821 --> 02:03:33.630
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like a healthy normal functioning bear is what that was.</v>

4298
02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:34.340
<v Speaker 4>But it was,</v>

4299
02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:35.560
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know it was something else.</v>

4300
02:03:35.630 --> 02:03:35.950
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4301
02:03:35.950 --> 02:03:39.830
<v Speaker 4>that's what I read is that they didn't really find much of the bear because the,</v>

4302
02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.450
<v Speaker 4>they shot the bear when they,</v>

4303
02:03:41.451 --> 02:03:41.571
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4304
02:03:41.571 --> 02:03:44.720
<v Speaker 4>they flew over and they saw that the bear had,</v>

4305
02:03:44.730 --> 02:03:45.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4306
02:03:45.110 --> 02:03:45.411
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>

4307
02:03:45.411 --> 02:03:50.000
<v Speaker 4>had killed these people because apparently a pilot saw the rib cage coming up.</v>

4308
02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:51.193
<v Speaker 4>That's what he saw.</v>

4309
02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:53.240
<v Speaker 4>And he realized that this bears eating a person.</v>

4310
02:03:53.610 --> 02:03:55.790
<v Speaker 4>He saw close saw tent all the camp.</v>

4311
02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:57.350
<v Speaker 4>So he knew that the bear was eating a person.</v>

4312
02:03:57.351 --> 02:03:57.951
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

4313
02:03:57.951 --> 02:03:58.550
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4314
02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:00.110
<v Speaker 4>they got a guy,</v>

4315
02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:00.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4316
02:04:00.801 --> 02:04:02.270
<v Speaker 4>one of the ranges I guess shot him.</v>

4317
02:04:02.650 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 4>And then when they went back,</v>

4318
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:06.590
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like a couple of months later,</v>

4319
02:04:06.591 --> 02:04:07.580
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing left.</v>

4320
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.541
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

4321
02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:08.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4322
02:04:08.791 --> 02:04:11.460
<v Speaker 4>there was just a fucking a couple pieces of bones I thought.</v>

4323
02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.210
<v Speaker 4>I thought they found the diamond is the guy.</v>

4324
02:04:15.150 --> 02:04:15.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4325
02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:16.400
<v Speaker 4>They might have,</v>

4326
02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:19.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean they might have processed the bears guts once they're,</v>

4327
02:04:19.521 --> 02:04:19.940
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4328
02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:20.910
<v Speaker 4>they killed him as well.</v>

4329
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:21.440
<v Speaker 4>Likely.</v>

4330
02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.400
<v Speaker 4>And by no means,</v>

4331
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:22.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4332
02:04:22.670 --> 02:04:23.211
<v Speaker 4>if you're listening,</v>

4333
02:04:23.211 --> 02:04:25.700
<v Speaker 4>do not let this deter you from living with them.</v>

4334
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:30.183
<v Speaker 5>Fine</v>

4335
02:04:30.850 --> 02:04:32.580
<v Speaker 4>dictated to all these Alaska shows,</v>

4336
02:04:32.581 --> 02:04:33.020
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4337
02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:33.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4338
02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:33.953
<v Speaker 4>it's really cool.</v>

4339
02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:36.630
<v Speaker 4>I watch all these last frontier shows like Alaska,</v>

4340
02:04:36.631 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 4>the last and the Yukon</v>

4341
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>man and that is courageous.</v>

4342
02:04:40.931 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>He live in man and he just went hunting somewhere up north than you Montana.</v>

4343
02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:45.653
<v Speaker 1>But that's Marty</v>

4344
02:04:47.310 --> 02:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Montana doesn't give a fuck.</v>

4345
02:04:48.650 --> 02:04:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4346
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:50.161
<v Speaker 1>That place is,</v>

4347
02:04:50.161 --> 02:04:53.370
<v Speaker 1>we went down the Missouri River and to a place called the bad lands and the</v>

4348
02:04:53.371 --> 02:04:54.750
<v Speaker 1>badlands does not give a fuck.</v>

4349
02:04:54.751 --> 02:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>You might as well have gone to the moon.</v>

4350
02:04:56.430 --> 02:04:56.851
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4351
02:04:56.851 --> 02:04:57.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4352
02:04:57.121 --> 02:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>You might as well be on the moon.</v>

4353
02:04:58.201 --> 02:04:58.921
<v Speaker 1>There's no one there.</v>

4354
02:04:58.921 --> 02:05:00.990
<v Speaker 1>There's no cell phone signal and you ain't got shit.</v>

4355
02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:06.050
<v Speaker 1>You got no radio and you are in what is the bottom of a giant ancient ocean?</v>

4356
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>He used to be the great western inland sea during the Jurassic period,</v>

4357
02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:13.140
<v Speaker 1>like there was dinosaurs and Shit Roman through that area.</v>

4358
02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:14.220
<v Speaker 1>So the bottom,</v>

4359
02:05:14.221 --> 02:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>the ground everywhere is like silt.</v>

4360
02:05:16.650 --> 02:05:19.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like that same like slippery shit on the bottom of the lake.</v>

4361
02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:22.590
<v Speaker 1>So you have mountains sort of covered in silt and theirs.</v>

4362
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>They had homesteads out there where they gave people like you,</v>

4363
02:05:26.250 --> 02:05:26.491
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4364
02:05:26.491 --> 02:05:27.390
<v Speaker 1>if you live there,</v>

4365
02:05:27.391 --> 02:05:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you could claim a giant chunk of land and as long as you lived on it for a</v>

4366
02:05:30.541 --> 02:05:31.321
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of time,</v>

4367
02:05:31.321 --> 02:05:32.370
<v Speaker 1>it would be your land.</v>

4368
02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:32.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4369
02:05:32.851 --> 02:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>they gave these people land and they all left.</v>

4370
02:05:34.650 --> 02:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>They all quit.</v>

4371
02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:35.870
<v Speaker 1>No one can,</v>

4372
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:36.770
<v Speaker 1>you can't grow anything on it.</v>

4373
02:05:36.771 --> 02:05:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4374
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:38.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like this crazy silty shit.</v>

4375
02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:39.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

4376
02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's deer round,</v>

4377
02:05:41.161 --> 02:05:41.701
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

4378
02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:44.670
<v Speaker 1>you've got to fucking hunt for days sometimes to kill one.</v>

4379
02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4380
02:05:45.330 --> 02:05:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So you're out there camping and trying to catch these deer and bringing them</v>

4381
02:05:48.031 --> 02:05:49.500
<v Speaker 1>back to your family at a certain point in time.</v>

4382
02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:49.651
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4383
02:05:49.651 --> 02:05:49.801
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4384
02:05:49.801 --> 02:05:51.930
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get the fuck out of here and we're going to run out of food.</v>

4385
02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:52.981
<v Speaker 1>And so they all did.</v>

4386
02:05:52.981 --> 02:05:53.814
<v Speaker 1>They all bailed.</v>

4387
02:05:54.140 --> 02:05:54.351
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4388
02:05:54.351 --> 02:05:54.641
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

4389
02:05:54.641 --> 02:05:55.800
<v Speaker 1>this just not reliable.</v>

4390
02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And in the wintertime it gets way too fucking cold.</v>

4391
02:05:58.320 --> 02:05:59.490
<v Speaker 1>It gets so cold at the river.</v>

4392
02:05:59.491 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Freezes the river fees a solid.</v>

4393
02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4394
02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:04.170
<v Speaker 1>you got to cut holes in it and try to get fish out of there.</v>

4395
02:06:04.171 --> 02:06:05.004
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

4396
02:06:05.130 --> 02:06:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Good luck trying to feed yourself like that.</v>

4397
02:06:06.871 --> 02:06:07.704
<v Speaker 1>So they all bailed.</v>

4398
02:06:07.710 --> 02:06:07.951
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4399
02:06:07.951 --> 02:06:08.581
<v Speaker 1>So that's why we,</v>

4400
02:06:08.581 --> 02:06:09.414
<v Speaker 1>we went hunting.</v>

4401
02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.080
<v Speaker 1>It was fast.</v>

4402
02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:10.711
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty awesome.</v>

4403
02:06:10.711 --> 02:06:11.011
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4404
02:06:11.011 --> 02:06:12.690
<v Speaker 1>it was literally like going to another planet.</v>

4405
02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:13.800
<v Speaker 1>It was so humbling,</v>

4406
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4407
02:06:14.521 --> 02:06:18.570
<v Speaker 1>the live outside like that for five days and that kind of environment is really,</v>

4408
02:06:18.571 --> 02:06:18.901
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

4409
02:06:18.901 --> 02:06:20.520
<v Speaker 1>really humbling because you,</v>

4410
02:06:20.521 --> 02:06:21.540
<v Speaker 1>you start to feel it,</v>

4411
02:06:21.541 --> 02:06:23.790
<v Speaker 1>you start to see like how Frat,</v>

4412
02:06:23.791 --> 02:06:24.091
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

4413
02:06:24.091 --> 02:06:25.170
<v Speaker 1>how fragile you are.</v>

4414
02:06:25.171 --> 02:06:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Even just the temperature,</v>

4415
02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:27.930
<v Speaker 1>like it was 12 degrees out.</v>

4416
02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:29.280
<v Speaker 1>When we're sleeping outside,</v>

4417
02:06:29.281 --> 02:06:30.240
<v Speaker 1>it's 12 degrees.</v>

4418
02:06:30.450 --> 02:06:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So you're bundled up in this sleeping bag and shit and zipped over your head</v>

4419
02:06:33.881 --> 02:06:34.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4420
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:36.470
<v Speaker 1>and we're trying to squeeze yourself to Ge,</v>

4421
02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:38.940
<v Speaker 1>so make your body warm and it's 12 degrees</v>

4422
02:06:40.890 --> 02:06:42.840
<v Speaker 1>and nothing gives a fuck about you.</v>

4423
02:06:42.841 --> 02:06:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's just a bunch of things out there eating other things.</v>

4424
02:06:45.250 --> 02:06:45.991
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

4425
02:06:45.991 --> 02:06:47.550
<v Speaker 1>It's deer eating grass.</v>

4426
02:06:47.551 --> 02:06:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Mountain lions eaten deer.</v>

4427
02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:52.950
<v Speaker 1>We found mountain mine shit is big thick rope of shit with fur in it.</v>

4428
02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:54.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4429
02:06:54.241 --> 02:06:55.260
<v Speaker 1>whoa son.</v>

4430
02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:56.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4431
02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:57.073

4441
02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:11.830
<v Speaker 7>if there's people living right at the Morris or whatever on the other side,</v>

<v Speaker 7>There were people do live just out in the wild and he,</v>

02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Is this the real survivor man or that other guy?</v>

4449
02:07:22.570 --> 02:07:24.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember which one is that guy?</v>

4450
02:07:24.881 --> 02:07:26.530
<v Speaker 1>That guy who slept in hotels.</v>

4451
02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:29.500
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy slept in hotels that made it seem like he wasn't.</v>

4452
02:07:29.501 --> 02:07:29.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4453
02:07:29.711 --> 02:07:30.400
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know that.</v>

4454
02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:31.000
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4455
02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:31.571
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4456
02:07:31.571 --> 02:07:32.291
<v Speaker 1>the real guys,</v>

4457
02:07:32.291 --> 02:07:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Les Stroud,</v>

4458
02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.360
<v Speaker 1>less trout is the real guy.</v>

4459
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:35.320
<v Speaker 1>He goes out even for,</v>

4460
02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 1>he goes for 10 days now films it all himself.</v>

4461
02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:39.101
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4462
02:07:39.101 --> 02:07:40.120
<v Speaker 1>he's the real deal.</v>

4463
02:07:40.121 --> 02:07:40.751
<v Speaker 1>He's legit.</v>

4464
02:07:40.751 --> 02:07:42.310
<v Speaker 1>But that bear Grylls character,</v>

4465
02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:45.760
<v Speaker 1>that dude is apparently in the some like military guy.</v>

4466
02:07:45.761 --> 02:07:47.500
<v Speaker 1>He probably is like sort of a survival expert.</v>

4467
02:07:47.770 --> 02:07:49.180
<v Speaker 1>But when he was doing that show,</v>

4468
02:07:49.181 --> 02:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>he was like faking a lot of shit.</v>

4469
02:07:50.551 --> 02:07:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Like we just came upon a seal caucus.</v>

4470
02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Now we can use this for food.</v>

4471
02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4472
02:07:54.810 --> 02:07:55.240
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

4473
02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:55.871
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

4474
02:07:55.871 --> 02:07:57.600
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really come across the seal carcass.</v>

4475
02:07:57.750 --> 02:08:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Like they put that thing there and they,</v>

4476
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:01.150
<v Speaker 1>according to les,</v>

4477
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Les says they made man vs wild because they were always trying to get him to</v>

4478
02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:06.671
<v Speaker 1>fake shit,</v>

4479
02:08:06.671 --> 02:08:07.750
<v Speaker 1>but he wouldn't fake shit.</v>

4480
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:09.970
<v Speaker 1>We had him on the podcast he was talking about.</v>

4481
02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:10.451
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4482
02:08:10.451 --> 02:08:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say wow.</v>

4483
02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:12.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4484
02:08:12.341 --> 02:08:12.880
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

4485
02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4486
02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:15.610
<v Speaker 1>he told me that that's what they got bear Grylls to do his show.</v>

4487
02:08:15.611 --> 02:08:15.881
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

4488
02:08:15.881 --> 02:08:16.714
<v Speaker 1>we'll show you.</v>

4489
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:17.740
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do the same show,</v>

4490
02:08:17.741 --> 02:08:18.431
<v Speaker 1>do your own show,</v>

4491
02:08:18.431 --> 02:08:19.420
<v Speaker 1>but we're faking everything.</v>

4492
02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:22.360
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile everybody found out they fake things and nobody wants to watch it</v>

4493
02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's and then what's happening now.</v>

4604
02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:19.030
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

4605
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:21.250

4608
02:11:25.961 --> 02:11:28.270
<v Speaker 6>And then Burt just came out with a podcast.</v>

4609
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:29.740
<v Speaker 6>Burt cast,</v>

4610
02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:31.600
<v Speaker 6>I did the first episode I should say.</v>

4611
02:11:31.601 --> 02:11:36.080
<v Speaker 6>I just sat there and laughed on the first episode because it was in Burt's at</v>

4612
02:11:36.081 --> 02:11:36.914
<v Speaker 6>first place.</v>

4613
02:11:38.770 --> 02:11:43.770
<v Speaker 6>He had Joey Diaz and his father and me in this room.</v>

4614
02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:45.110
<v Speaker 6>And Bert is,</v>

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:46.750
<v Speaker 6>he's steering the ship.</v>

4618
02:11:46.751 --> 02:11:47.830
<v Speaker 6>It's what he wants it to be.</v>

4619
02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:48.880
<v Speaker 6>That same thing.</v>

4620
02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.300
<v Speaker 6>But you just sit there listening to Diaz.</v>

4621
02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:53.800
<v Speaker 6>Mr Kreischer,</v>

4622
02:11:54.330 --> 02:11:55.750
<v Speaker 6>the fucking funniest thing of,</v>

4623
02:11:55.751 --> 02:11:56.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4624
02:11:56.380 --> 02:11:57.250
<v Speaker 6>I was crying.</v>

4625
02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:57.780
<v Speaker 6>I was at,</v>

4626
02:11:57.780 --> 02:11:58.840
<v Speaker 6>I was in tears.</v>

4627
02:11:58.841 --> 02:11:59.674
<v Speaker 6>It was so funny.</v>

4628
02:12:00.010 --> 02:12:00.910
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

4629
02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:02.830
<v Speaker 6>what we do in your mom's house,</v>

4630
02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:03.693
<v Speaker 6>it's totally,</v>

4631
02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:05.470
<v Speaker 6>it's exactly what we want the show.</v>

4632
02:12:05.471 --> 02:12:06.304
<v Speaker 6>To me that's the most fun</v>

4633
02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:06.890
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

4634
02:12:06.890 --> 02:12:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Is it totally what you want it to be?</v>

4635
02:12:08.650 --> 02:12:09.790
<v Speaker 1>We're so lucky right now.</v>

4636
02:12:09.791 --> 02:12:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4637
02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Did judge,</v>

4638
02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:14.770
<v Speaker 1>you was like feel that I feel so fortunate to be a standup comic because you</v>

4639
02:12:14.771 --> 02:12:16.540
<v Speaker 1>don't need the big networks now.</v>

4640
02:12:16.541 --> 02:12:17.950
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do your fucking hour,</v>

4641
02:12:17.951 --> 02:12:19.840
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to go through comedy central.</v>

4642
02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:21.310
<v Speaker 1>If you want to talk to your audience,</v>

4643
02:12:21.311 --> 02:12:23.260
<v Speaker 1>you can reach them directly through the podcast.</v>

4644
02:12:23.290 --> 02:12:25.180
<v Speaker 1>They can download at any time of day or night.</v>

4645
02:12:25.181 --> 02:12:25.840
<v Speaker 1>It's the best thing.</v>

4646
02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:29.800
<v Speaker 1>And what's really cool about this is that people that get into a position where</v>

4647
02:12:29.801 --> 02:12:31.060
<v Speaker 1>people are paying attention to,</v>

4648
02:12:31.061 --> 02:12:33.190
<v Speaker 1>then they can tell you about some other cool shit.</v>

4649
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4650
02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like retweeting.</v>

4651
02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4652
02:12:35.250 --> 02:12:39.310
<v Speaker 1>like I love retweeting because people send me some really fucking cool articles</v>

4653
02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:40.720
<v Speaker 1>and I'll retweet those.</v>

4654
02:12:40.721 --> 02:12:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And like a lot of it is like really interesting shit and there's no way you're</v>

4655
02:12:44.381 --> 02:12:45.940
<v Speaker 1>going to accumulate all that crap on your own.</v>

4656
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:47.010
<v Speaker 1>You need some help out there.</v>

4657
02:12:47.610 --> 02:12:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the cools things about like having a successful podcast is</v>

4658
02:12:52.081 --> 02:12:54.490
<v Speaker 1>like your podcast now has a big following.</v>

4659
02:12:54.670 --> 02:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>You could tell them,</v>

4660
02:12:55.751 --> 02:12:56.320
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4661

4662
02:12:57.851 --> 02:12:59.540
<v Speaker 1>listen to Burke crushes podcasts a new,</v>

4663
02:12:59.650 --> 02:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>and now everybody goes,</v>

4664
02:13:00.370 --> 02:13:01.203
<v Speaker 1>oh awesome.</v>

4665
02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:01.961
<v Speaker 1>And then they go,</v>

4666
02:13:01.961 --> 02:13:02.231
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4667
02:13:02.231 --> 02:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I liked the way Tommy thinks.</v>

4668
02:13:03.371 --> 02:13:03.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4669
02:13:03.701 --> 02:13:03.891
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>

4670
02:13:03.891 --> 02:13:04.724
<v Speaker 1>he makes me laugh.</v>

4671
02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Christina makes me laugh.</v>

4672
02:13:06.070 --> 02:13:08.320
<v Speaker 1>They're saying that this is a great podcast.</v>

4673
02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll go check it out.</v>

4674
02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>And then it branches off and they can do that and the next person and Ari can</v>

4675
02:13:13.451 --> 02:13:14.380
<v Speaker 1>introduce a new one.</v>

4676
02:13:14.381 --> 02:13:15.214
<v Speaker 1>And absolutely.</v>

4677
02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:19.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the coolest thing about it is like we know so many people that are really</v>

4678
02:13:19.811 --> 02:13:20.531
<v Speaker 1>fucking funny.</v>

4679
02:13:20.531 --> 02:13:22.630
<v Speaker 1>But in this day and age,</v>

4680
02:13:23.410 --> 02:13:24.970
<v Speaker 1>before podcasting,</v>

4681
02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>it was really hard to get your name out there,</v>

4682
02:13:28.630 --> 02:13:29.800
<v Speaker 1>but just as a standup.</v>

4683
02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 1>But you had to have some TV in order</v>

4684
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.900
<v Speaker 2>to be in the club.</v>

4685
02:13:33.930 --> 02:13:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4686
02:13:34.170 --> 02:13:35.040
<v Speaker 2>And even then,</v>

4687
02:13:35.041 --> 02:13:39.240
<v Speaker 2>like it takes a long time for people to take enough chances on you and then word</v>

4688
02:13:39.241 --> 02:13:41.520
<v Speaker 2>of mouth and returning to a place over and over again,</v>

4689
02:13:41.730 --> 02:13:43.080
<v Speaker 2>like to build up markets.</v>

4690
02:13:43.090 --> 02:13:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long,</v>

4691
02:13:44.250 --> 02:13:45.320
<v Speaker 2>hard road.</v>

4692
02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:47.160
<v Speaker 2>But now all they have to do is be funny.</v>

4693
02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:47.910
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

4694
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:49.050
<v Speaker 2>podcasting too,</v>

4695
02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:52.790
<v Speaker 2>like this was kind of an experiment for me was um,</v>

4696
02:13:53.050 --> 02:13:53.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4697
02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I spoke to you about it,</v>

4698
02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Elsa spoke to like Bill Burr,</v>

4699
02:13:55.770 --> 02:14:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Al Madrigal about putting out an album on my own and you guys,</v>

4700
02:14:00.931 --> 02:14:05.931
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying separately all encouraged me to do that and I did it on my own,</v>

4701
02:14:06.030 --> 02:14:06.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4702
02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:07.253
<v Speaker 2>put it out.</v>

4703
02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:12.320
<v Speaker 2>But podcasting is the thing that got really an audience for it.</v>

4704
02:14:13.230 --> 02:14:13.700

02:14:25.741 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to record it.</v>

4716
02:14:26.850 --> 02:14:27.683
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to,</v>

4717
02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4718
02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:28.711
<v Speaker 2>put it it,</v>

4719
02:14:28.711 --> 02:14:31.860
<v Speaker 2>just do it on my own and putting it out there and then seeing if it works.</v>

4720
02:14:31.861 --> 02:14:36.420
<v Speaker 2>But seeing that the success is basically because of the audience we built from</v>

4721
02:14:36.421 --> 02:14:37.260
<v Speaker 2>doing podcasts.</v>

4722
02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4723
02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:39.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy connection to,</v>

4724
02:14:39.271 --> 02:14:42.750
<v Speaker 2>and don't you feel like kind of obligated to be in communication with these</v>

4725
02:14:42.751 --> 02:14:43.330
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

4726
02:14:43.330 --> 02:14:44.163
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4727
02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:45.091
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

4728
02:14:45.091 --> 02:14:45.660
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

4729
02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.430
<v Speaker 2>and keep making it more content.</v>

4730
02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

4731
02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:51.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's so cool when the standup now like,</v>

4732
02:14:52.450 --> 02:14:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4733
02:14:53.230 --> 02:14:54.270
<v Speaker 2>my audience isn't there yet.</v>

4734
02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:58.830
<v Speaker 2>They're coming now and it makes such a difference when I look out and I can see</v>

4735
02:14:58.831 --> 02:15:02.790
<v Speaker 2>that they know who I am and I recognize them and I see that we have this</v>

4736
02:15:02.791 --> 02:15:05.730
<v Speaker 2>wonderful connection and a talk to the people after changed everything.</v>

4737
02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:06.571
<v Speaker 2>This is awesome.</v>

4738
02:15:06.571 --> 02:15:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Like this is what I've wanted for so long.</v>

4739
02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:13.320
<v Speaker 2>We brought Brian on stage in Austin and they went fucking ape shit.</v>

4740
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4741
02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Brian got like a standing ovation going on stage in Austin.</v>

4742
02:15:16.530 --> 02:15:17.363
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:19.830
<v Speaker 2>And did you ever watch that interview Alex Jones did of us.</v>

4744
02:15:19.890 --> 02:15:20.491
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty cool.</v>

4745
02:15:20.491 --> 02:15:20.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4746
02:15:20.611 --> 02:15:21.001
<v Speaker 2>it was good.</v>

4747
02:15:21.001 --> 02:15:21.481
<v Speaker 2>It was really cool.</v>

4748
02:15:21.481 --> 02:15:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Really good.</v>

4749
02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:22.201
<v Speaker 2>It was cool.</v>

4750
02:15:22.201 --> 02:15:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4751
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:25.740

4752
02:15:25.890 --> 02:15:26.723

4753
02:15:27.210 --> 02:15:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I did a may or may not.</v>

4754
02:15:29.010 --> 02:15:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I did Brian's like a little desk squad tour in Ohio couple months ago.</v>

4755
02:15:32.551 --> 02:15:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4756
02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:35.250
<v Speaker 2>A month ago and I'm holy Shit,</v>

4757
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:36.930
<v Speaker 2>when when you were brought on stage,</v>

4758
02:15:37.170 --> 02:15:38.490
<v Speaker 2>the place went fucking crazy.</v>

4759
02:15:38.491 --> 02:15:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4760
02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4761
02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:39.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4762
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:42.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a completely different world now because of podcasts.</v>

4763
02:15:42.210 --> 02:15:42.600
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

4764
02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.940
<v Speaker 2>you could literally make people famous like in the real world.</v>

4765
02:15:44.941 --> 02:15:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Like they walk around like,</v>

4766
02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:47.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4767
02:15:47.230 --> 02:15:47.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4768
02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:52.500
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting but it's like everything that comedy networks never were,</v>

4769
02:15:52.710 --> 02:15:55.230
<v Speaker 2>comedy networks were never really comedians networking.</v>

4770
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:56.880
<v Speaker 2>This is like a real comedy network.</v>

4771
02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4772
02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Cause all of us,</v>

4773
02:15:58.770 --> 02:15:59.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

4774
02:15:59.280 --> 02:15:59.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4775
02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:04.551
<v Speaker 2>if I tell you go listen to Joey Diaz a CD and I'm crying laughing when I tell</v>

4776
02:16:04.891 --> 02:16:06.000
<v Speaker 2>you that you can trust me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4779
02:16:07.831 --> 02:16:08.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like we,</v>

4780
02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:11.340
<v Speaker 2>we know what Ari's tastes or like,</v>

4781
02:16:11.341 --> 02:16:11.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4782
02:16:11.551 --> 02:16:12.800
<v Speaker 2>we know a Dunkin station.</v>

4783
02:16:13.050 --> 02:16:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4784
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:14.730
<v Speaker 2>You get to know the rare,</v>

4785
02:16:14.731 --> 02:16:15.301
<v Speaker 2>rare time,</v>

4786
02:16:15.301 --> 02:16:15.710
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4787
02:16:15.710 --> 02:16:17.970
<v Speaker 2>this is never been a moment like this for entertainers.</v>

4788
02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:18.390
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4789
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:20.850
<v Speaker 2>We can just sort of do your own connection with your,</v>

4790
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:23.020
<v Speaker 2>with the audience that wants to be with you.</v>

4791
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4792
02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:27.240
<v Speaker 2>you're connected to them before that would take a fucking pen and a pad and a</v>

4793
02:16:27.241 --> 02:16:28.074
<v Speaker 2>letter.</v>

4794
02:16:28.210 --> 02:16:29.043
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4795
02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I mailed this time,</v>

4796
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.120
<v Speaker 7>they get to know the real you,</v>

4797
02:16:32.121 --> 02:16:34.100
<v Speaker 7>which is an interesting facet of celebrity.</v>

4798
02:16:34.101 --> 02:16:34.821
<v Speaker 7>Now I think,</v>

4799
02:16:34.821 --> 02:16:38.750
<v Speaker 7>and I don't know if it seems like in the past celebrities had to have two lives,</v>

4800
02:16:38.751 --> 02:16:42.650
<v Speaker 7>like there's your public sphere and your private and now those two spheres are</v>

4801
02:16:42.651 --> 02:16:45.770
<v Speaker 7>merging and they almost have to because of this technology.</v>

4802
02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:47.810
<v Speaker 7>Like they have access to the real you.</v>

4803
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:48.101
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4804
02:16:48.101 --> 02:16:48.491
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4805
02:16:48.491 --> 02:16:49.460
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of cool.</v>

4806
02:16:49.490 --> 02:16:49.791
<v Speaker 7>I mean the,</v>

4807
02:16:49.791 --> 02:16:51.770
<v Speaker 7>obviously there's drawbacks to that as well.</v>

4808
02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:52.670
<v Speaker 7>If you're a douchebag,</v>

4809
02:16:52.670 --> 02:16:53.510
<v Speaker 7>if you're a Douche bag,</v>

4810
02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:54.560
<v Speaker 7>they're gonna know who you really are.</v>

4811
02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:54.800
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4812
02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:55.341
<v Speaker 7>Correct.</v>

4813
02:16:55.341 --> 02:16:56.030
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4814
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.510
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

4815
02:16:56.510 --> 02:16:57.200
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4816
02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:58.033
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4817
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:59.083
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4818
02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:02.120
<v Speaker 7>but I think that's ultimately where the whole world was headed.</v>

4819
02:17:02.450 --> 02:17:02.900
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

4820
02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:04.370
<v Speaker 7>the no secrets world.</v>

4821
02:17:04.430 --> 02:17:05.061
<v Speaker 7>I agree.</v>

4822
02:17:05.061 --> 02:17:06.380
<v Speaker 7>And no shame world.</v>

4823
02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:06.800
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4824
02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:09.650
<v Speaker 7>Because everything this generation is growing up in public,</v>

4825
02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:11.030
<v Speaker 7>not like we did.</v>

4826
02:17:11.031 --> 02:17:11.210
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>

4827
02:17:11.210 --> 02:17:14.780
<v Speaker 7>there's no notion anymore of like keep that photograph in your locker.</v>

4828
02:17:14.781 --> 02:17:16.610
<v Speaker 7>Like now put the photograph on Facebook.</v>

4829

<v Speaker 7>Everyone's going to see your titties.</v>

4830
02:17:18.130 --> 02:17:18.261
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

02:17:18.261 --> 02:17:19.150
<v Speaker 7>Everybody's going to see it,</v>

4832
02:17:19.151 --> 02:17:19.984

4835
02:17:26.710 --> 02:17:27.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4836
02:17:27.050 --> 02:17:27.800

02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:29.390
<v Speaker 4>these kids today too.</v>

4838
02:17:29.391 --> 02:17:32.030
<v Speaker 4>If you stop and think about how silly you were when you were 17.</v>

4839
02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:32.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How many pictures of your Dick would be online?</v>

4841
02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:36.411
<v Speaker 4>There would be,</v>

4842
02:17:36.411 --> 02:17:38.860
<v Speaker 4>so there would be chapters.</v>

4843
02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:42.110
<v Speaker 4>It would be like gigabytes of my day</v>

4844
02:17:44.970 --> 02:17:46.010
<v Speaker 4>would be everywhere.</v>

4845
02:17:46.011 --> 02:17:49.610
<v Speaker 4>College course famous for being the dumbest kid.</v>

02:17:54.691 --> 02:17:54.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4850
02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:55.280
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

4851
02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.410
<v Speaker 4>I would dick role everybody instead of Rick Roll,</v>

4852
02:17:57.411 --> 02:17:58.700
<v Speaker 4>I would release the videos.</v>

4853
02:17:59.750 --> 02:18:02.930
<v Speaker 4>The video would start out with some music and then I would jump out with my Dick</v>

4854
02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:05.210
<v Speaker 4>and funny ones too though.</v>

<v Speaker 6>for comedy central,</v>

4891
02:19:09.721 --> 02:19:13.110
<v Speaker 6>I was a writer on it that Kyle kinane hosted like earlier this year,</v>

4892
02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:15.360

4893
02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:17.250
<v Speaker 6>One of the episodes we were like,</v>

4894

02:19:22.830 --> 02:19:23.830
<v Speaker 6>like is this Photoshop?</v>

4897
02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:24.541

02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:26.390
<v Speaker 4>Like now that's,</v>

4901
02:19:26.390 --> 02:19:27.223
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

4902
02:19:27.970 --> 02:19:28.220
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

4903
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:28.821
<v Speaker 2>people were like,</v>

4904
02:19:28.821 --> 02:19:29.750
<v Speaker 2>like lawyers were like,</v>

4905

4906
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:32.443
<v Speaker 2>Asking</v>

4907
02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:38.820
<v Speaker 2>for photos came out of his clothes and he had experts examine them and show</v>

4908
02:19:39.951 --> 02:19:41.570
<v Speaker 2>proof that they had been doctored.</v>

4909
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:43.610
<v Speaker 2>And then later he came out and said,</v>

4910
02:19:43.611 --> 02:19:43.971
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

4911
02:19:43.971 --> 02:19:44.661
<v Speaker 2>this is me.</v>

4912
02:19:44.661 --> 02:19:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I got doing coke and dress up like a check.</v>

4913
02:19:50.390 --> 02:19:51.950
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to come clean with that.</v>

4914
02:19:51.970 --> 02:19:52.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4915

<v Speaker 2>Well I liked that.</v>

4917
02:19:54.501 --> 02:19:55.850
<v Speaker 2>He probably got that monkey off his back.</v>

4918
02:19:55.851 --> 02:19:57.290
<v Speaker 2>They're probably fuck with him for a long time.</v>

4919
02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Plus I'm sure like panties,</v>

4922
02:20:01.221 --> 02:20:02.510

4923
02:20:02.511 --> 02:20:06.800
<v Speaker 2>That probably scared one day she's going to do interviews and shit and he's not</v>

<v Speaker 2>gonna be able to pay her off anymore.</v>

02:22:13.620 --> 02:22:14.640
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about this.</v>

5003
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

5004
02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:17.541
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5005
02:22:17.541 --> 02:22:22.220
<v Speaker 2>cause I know in Sushi I like fatty tuna the most because it's a nice fatty</v>

5006
02:22:22.221 --> 02:22:22.521
<v Speaker 2>piece.</v>

5007
02:22:22.521 --> 02:22:24.710
<v Speaker 2>So white people right now we're pretty fatty.</v>

5008
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:25.603
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5009
02:22:25.930 --> 02:22:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go corn Fed Iowa woman in the airport that looks like Sam Kinison</v>

5010
02:22:31.690 --> 02:22:33.490
<v Speaker 2>fat lady be,</v>

5011
02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:38.650
<v Speaker 2>that would be good.</v>

5012
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:40.260
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

5013
02:22:40.261 --> 02:22:42.750
<v Speaker 1>the like the fattiness would be more like a pork.</v>

5014
02:22:42.751 --> 02:22:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

5015
02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:43.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like porn belly.</v>

5016
02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:44.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5017
02:22:44.521 --> 02:22:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it'd be like tonight at all to those fatty tuna.</v>

5018
02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Even when tunas are slightly fatty,</v>

5019
02:22:50.251 --> 02:22:53.400
<v Speaker 2>like the bottom area that's lean is fuck compared to almost every other organism</v>

5020
02:22:53.401 --> 02:22:55.470
<v Speaker 2>on the planet and still pretty muscular.</v>

5021
02:22:55.500 --> 02:22:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5022
02:22:55.690 --> 02:22:56.910
<v Speaker 2>You want to look at a Schumann?</v>

5023
02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Humans are gross.</v>

5024
02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I like pork rinds.</v>

5025
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5026
02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:01.890
<v Speaker 2>no more like a,</v>

5027
02:23:01.890 --> 02:23:02.760
<v Speaker 2>like a roast,</v>

5028
02:23:03.330 --> 02:23:07.380
<v Speaker 2>like a fat sloppy pork roast where the meat's just fallen off cause it saw me</v>

5029
02:23:07.390 --> 02:23:11.640
<v Speaker 2>that a Cheetos me nutrition is as soda.</v>

5030
02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I kind of fat guy</v>

5031
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:18.060
<v Speaker 2>with black beans or rice.</v>

5032
02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I like hot sauce.</v>

5033
02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:23.160
<v Speaker 2>I think you know the black guys are pretty naturally muscular so I'd take one.</v>

5034
02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:24.060
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of fat,</v>

5035
02:23:24.270 --> 02:23:25.590
<v Speaker 2>so I get a nice mixture of like,</v>

5036
02:23:25.591 --> 02:23:26.424
<v Speaker 2>it's like a Ribeye,</v>

5037
02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:28.051
<v Speaker 2>marble,</v>

5038
02:23:28.051 --> 02:23:28.381
<v Speaker 2>marble,</v>

5039
02:23:28.381 --> 02:23:28.841
<v Speaker 2>the marble,</v>

5040
02:23:28.841 --> 02:23:29.611
<v Speaker 2>but not crazy.</v>

5041
02:23:29.611 --> 02:23:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5042
02:23:29.940 --> 02:23:30.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5043
02:23:30.151 --> 02:23:31.650
<v Speaker 2>And probably just the darker meat too.</v>

5044
02:23:31.650 --> 02:23:35.190
<v Speaker 2>It's probably more nutritious Indian because it's already seasoned.</v>

5045
02:23:36.390 --> 02:23:37.223
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

5046
02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:38.333
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good</v>

5047
02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:40.973
<v Speaker 2>price.</v>

5048
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:42.160
<v Speaker 2>All that curry,</v>

5049
02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:44.580
<v Speaker 2>they say that like pineapple flavors your loads.</v>

5050
02:23:44.670 --> 02:23:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5051
02:23:44.930 --> 02:23:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure curry would flavor your rump.</v>

5052
02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:47.641
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

5053
02:23:47.641 --> 02:23:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Curry Curry.</v>

5054
02:23:48.691 --> 02:23:49.524
<v Speaker 2>And your fats.</v>

5055
02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the case with bears.</v>

5056
02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:51.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5057
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:52.111
<v Speaker 2>with bears,</v>

5058
02:23:52.111 --> 02:23:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you want to eat a bear that,</v>

5059
02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:53.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5060
02:23:53.730 --> 02:23:54.570
<v Speaker 2>gets shot after,</v>

5061
02:23:54.571 --> 02:23:55.800
<v Speaker 2>eats a lot of blueberries.</v>

5062
02:23:56.010 --> 02:23:58.950
<v Speaker 2>The bears that like if you eat bears it apparently it's like some of the most</v>

5063
02:23:58.951 --> 02:24:00.150
<v Speaker 2>delicious meat you can have.</v>

5064
02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:00.541
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

5065
02:24:00.541 --> 02:24:00.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5066
02:24:00.781 --> 02:24:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Because it literally changes the way that their flesh tastes and they're fat.</v>

5067
02:24:04.531 --> 02:24:05.011
<v Speaker 2>They're fat,</v>

5068
02:24:05.011 --> 02:24:07.020
<v Speaker 2>has all this like blueberry in the fat.</v>

5069
02:24:07.050 --> 02:24:07.883
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

5070
02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:09.200
<v Speaker 2>It's really nutty.</v>

5071
02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:09.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5072
02:24:09.491 --> 02:24:09.811
<v Speaker 2>Let's do,</v>

5073
02:24:09.811 --> 02:24:10.530
<v Speaker 2>let's do a trip.</v>

5074
02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:10.971
<v Speaker 2>I'll go kill it.</v>

5075
02:24:10.971 --> 02:24:11.250

<v Speaker 2>Let's go last night.</v>

5077
02:24:13.290 --> 02:24:14.123
<v Speaker 2>What's your race?</v>

5078
02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Probably Asians.</v>

5079
02:24:19.710 --> 02:24:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I just know just type is either Brazilian or Asians.</v>

5080
02:24:22.850 --> 02:24:23.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5081
02:24:24.220 --> 02:24:25.053
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

5082
02:24:25.610 --> 02:24:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Probably we would have like,</v>

5083
02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Asians aren't known for being the most muscular call.</v>

5084
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:30.423
<v Speaker 1>It'd be good.</v>

5085
02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Get a good cut.</v>

5086

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5087
02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever hear about that one guy from</v>

5088
02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:34.840
<v Speaker 2>pan who uh,</v>

5089
02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:35.793
<v Speaker 2>murdered a girl,</v>

5090
02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:40.040
<v Speaker 2>cooked her an aider and then got off like on some insanity case.</v>

5091
02:24:40.041 --> 02:24:40.571
<v Speaker 2>So he's only,</v>

5092
02:24:40.571 --> 02:24:45.010
<v Speaker 2>he was only incarcerated for a small amount of time with her for a long time,</v>

5093
02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:46.270
<v Speaker 2>like in a closet or something.</v>

5094
02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:47.373
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5095
02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:48.661
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5097
02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:50.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

5098
02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Something along the lines.</v>

5099
02:24:51.900 --> 02:24:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I forget the guy's name,</v>

5100

<v Speaker 1>but he was uh,</v>

5101
02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:56.180
<v Speaker 1>he was famous for it.</v>

5102
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:59.543
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

5103

5139
02:25:53.690 --> 02:25:56.190
<v Speaker 1>inadequate in the ADR because he wanted to absorb her energy.</v>

5141
02:26:00.121 --> 02:26:04.110
<v Speaker 1>but it woke with a realization that he had to carry out his desire to eat her.</v>

5142
02:26:04.410 --> 02:26:07.020
<v Speaker 1>He did so beginning with her buttocks and thighs.</v>

02:26:18.390 --> 02:26:22.080
<v Speaker 1>He described to me as soft and odorless like tuna.</v>

5147
02:26:22.770 --> 02:26:23.603
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

5148
02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:24.893
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5149
02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:26.060
<v Speaker 2>That shit's crazy.</v>

5150
02:26:26.061 --> 02:26:27.140
<v Speaker 2>You fucking nailed it.</v>

5151
02:26:27.330 --> 02:26:31.430
<v Speaker 2>That flavor on that role cannot shape girl though.</v>

5152
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.823
<v Speaker 2>This wasn't a</v>

5153
02:26:32.930 --> 02:26:33.763
<v Speaker 1>fatty,</v>

5154
02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:36.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was eating someone for their pork like,</v>

5155
02:26:37.710 --> 02:26:38.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5156
02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Sam Kinison like delicious.</v>

5157
02:26:40.770 --> 02:26:41.603
<v Speaker 2>He then attempted to do</v>

5158
02:26:41.610 --> 02:26:43.800
<v Speaker 1>dumped the mutilated body in a remote lake,</v>

5159
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:48.030
<v Speaker 1>but was seen in the act and later arrested by the French police who found parts</v>

5160
02:26:48.031 --> 02:26:50.130
<v Speaker 1>of the deceased still in his refrigerator.</v>

5161
02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:51.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5162
02:26:51.271 --> 02:26:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Ago is wealthy.</v>

5163
02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Father provided a top lawyer for his defense and after being held for two years</v>

5164
02:26:56.731 --> 02:26:58.200
<v Speaker 1>without trying on the French jail,</v>

5165
02:26:58.890 --> 02:26:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

5166
02:26:59.890 --> 02:27:00.120
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

5167
02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:00.491
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

5168
02:27:00.491 --> 02:27:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I found him legally insane,</v>

5169
02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:05.740
<v Speaker 1>an unfit to stand trial and ordered him to be held indefinitely,</v>

5170
02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:07.110
<v Speaker 1>an immense less tuition.</v>

5171
02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Good cow.</v>

5172
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:12.670
<v Speaker 2>He spent over three months there and then he went home.</v>

5173
02:27:13.420 --> 02:27:13.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5174
02:27:13.781 --> 02:27:14.710
<v Speaker 1>How did they let them out?</v>

5175
02:27:14.711 --> 02:27:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

5176
02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:15.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5177
02:27:15.911 --> 02:27:19.120
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese authorities found it legally impossible to hold him because the</v>

5178
02:27:19.121 --> 02:27:22.360
<v Speaker 1>French government refuse to release court documents,</v>

5179
02:27:22.361 --> 02:27:25.960
<v Speaker 1>which remained a secret to Japan claiming that the case has already dropped in</v>

5180
02:27:25.961 --> 02:27:26.680
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

5181
02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So as a result,</v>

5182
02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:29.380
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

5183
02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:33.630
<v Speaker 1>They extradited him to Japan and when they let him in Japan,</v>

5184
02:27:33.650 --> 02:27:33.971
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

5185
02:27:33.971 --> 02:27:34.804
<v Speaker 1>just let them go.</v>

5186
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jeez.</v>

5187
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:40.270
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how that always happens between like when when somebody from a</v>

5188
02:27:40.271 --> 02:27:42.610
<v Speaker 2>country gets caught for something in another country,</v>

5189
02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.410
<v Speaker 2>there's always like this irrational,</v>

5190
02:27:44.411 --> 02:27:46.500
<v Speaker 2>just we just want him once.</v>

5191
02:27:46.610 --> 02:27:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Don't punish him.</v>

5192
02:27:47.550 --> 02:27:48.281
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

5193
02:27:48.281 --> 02:27:49.090
<v Speaker 2>This is</v>

5194
02:27:49.090 --> 02:27:50.410
<v Speaker 1>upon his arrival in Japan,</v>

5195
02:27:50.411 --> 02:27:54.670
<v Speaker 1>he was immediately taken to the Mat Susanna hospital where examining</v>

5196
02:27:54.671 --> 02:27:56.860
<v Speaker 1>psychologists all found him to be sane,</v>

5197
02:27:56.980 --> 02:28:01.030
<v Speaker 1>stating that sexual perversion was the sole motivation for the murder.</v>

5198
02:28:01.570 --> 02:28:03.040
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a sadistic,</v>

5199
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:04.180
<v Speaker 1>evil motherfucker then.</v>

5200
02:28:04.181 --> 02:28:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5201
02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:05.321
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

5202
02:28:05.321 --> 02:28:08.110
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese authorities found that legally impossible to hold him because the</v>

5203
02:28:08.111 --> 02:28:10.450
<v Speaker 1>French government refuse to release the documents.</v>

5204
02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:13.360
<v Speaker 1>So they said that this guy was just a prevo.</v>

5205
02:28:13.390 --> 02:28:18.070
<v Speaker 1>He was totally sane to prayed and just sexual perversion was the reason why I</v>

5206
02:28:18.071 --> 02:28:18.904
<v Speaker 1>killed this check.</v>

5207
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 1>He kills one and then he makes a living as a minor.</v>

5208
02:28:23.301 --> 02:28:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Celebrities invited like as a guest speaker,</v>

5209
02:28:25.671 --> 02:28:26.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5210
02:28:26.090 --> 02:28:26.980
<v Speaker 1>TV shows and shit.</v>

5211
02:28:26.981 --> 02:28:29.240
<v Speaker 1>He pretends to eat people's crazy box,</v>

5212
02:28:29.241 --> 02:28:30.440
<v Speaker 1>like biting people.</v>

5213
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:32.420
<v Speaker 1>That's like if Ted Bundy was doing talk shows,</v>

5214
02:28:32.421 --> 02:28:35.180
<v Speaker 1>like he wrote books about the murder.</v>

5215
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:38.750
<v Speaker 1>He wrote books about it and describing it in great detail.</v>

5216
02:28:39.290 --> 02:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5217
02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

5218
02:28:40.701 --> 02:28:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

5219
02:28:40.850 --> 02:28:41.840
<v Speaker 1>this is incredible.</v>

5220
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:43.463

<v Speaker 1>Japanese are so different.</v>

5223
02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I know that culture is Joe.</v>

5224
02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Brian had all the places that we've ever been to.</v>

5225
02:28:50.770 --> 02:28:53.050

5229
02:28:55.220 --> 02:28:56.690
<v Speaker 2>But wasn't it like Taiwan?</v>

5230
02:28:56.780 --> 02:28:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It really felt highly,</v>

5231
02:28:58.700 --> 02:29:02.240
<v Speaker 2>it really felt like you were in like another planet.</v>

5232
02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:04.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're in blade runner or something really,</v>
