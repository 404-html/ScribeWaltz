11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>It seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 1>at least half of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not even close to,</v>

13
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.170
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why is it like five years?</v>

14
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>It was five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I thought a half years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was back when it was October</v>

16
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>of 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought there was only two months left</v>

17
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>in the world cause I thought the Mayan</v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar was correct and it was December</v>

18
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.770
<v Speaker 1>21st,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012 was going to end the world.</v>

19
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:39.604
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

20
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.300
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you fucked off and went to Montana to</v>

21
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.580
<v Speaker 1>go on a boat ride with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>we took a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took a canoe down the Missouri River.</v>

23
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>That was fucking awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

24
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that wild?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite trips ever.</v>

25
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Was cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cold,</v>

26
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>like not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold.</v>

27
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 1>It was cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gets sucked.</v>

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.940
<v Speaker 1>But once he got moved and it was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned about Merino wool.</v>

30
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>That was the important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an important lesson like the</v>

31
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 1>first light Merino wool like that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if you're ever in a cold</v>

32
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so important that you have a base</v>

33
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 1>layer of Merino wool cause that shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets wet and you stay warm.</v>

34
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Even if you sweat in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay warm and calf as much as,</v>

35
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>as the synthetic versions at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird like some people really liked</v>

36
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>synthetics in some weird way like use</v>
<v Speaker 1>them or did you,</v>

37
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 1>do you have I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smelled terrible.</v>

38
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>So you actually don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like them both but I just,</v>

39
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with those guys for so long and,</v>

40
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>and firstlight I got used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

41
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I use synthetics for 10 years before</v>

42
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:43.330
<v Speaker 1>that and I mean I didn't smell good but</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really care.</v>

43
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>A lot of mountaineering people like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>synthetics because they dry quicker.</v>

44
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like the,</v>

45
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.300
<v Speaker 1>one of the best benefits of the wall is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when it is wet,</v>

46
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 1>it's still retains your warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mind being a little moist.</v>

47
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the synthetics will keep you warm too</v>

48
00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 1>when they're wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just it's slightly different value.</v>

49
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:05.131
<v Speaker 1>Like cotton will not right it all night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's synthetic like a kathleen that</v>

50
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Patagonia is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there other things?</v>

51
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.870
<v Speaker 1>They also will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't,</v>

52
00:02:07.871 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>they won't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

54
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marino has some other better</v>

55
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>qualities.</v>

56
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the stink things huge because I</v>

57
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>fuck it smelled terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a fun trip,</v>

58
00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was actually the first episode of</v>

59
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>that show that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>that I fully kind of shot and directed</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

61
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>So that was kind of a big stage from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fun.</v>

62
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just basically hung out with Kalyn two</v>

63
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.060
<v Speaker 1>per week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you have,</v>

64
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 1>when you have Cowan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Collin has a,</v>

65
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>like a captive audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the funniest man alive.</v>

66
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I will never forget these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't share them.</v>

67
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I these scenes from that campfire,</v>

68
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.720
<v Speaker 1>do you remember the ravine calmer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

69
00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember him taking a shit.</v>

70
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Literally 10 feet from our campfire is</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked,</v>

71
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 1>sticking out and we put a flag in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took pictures of it and how that shit</v>

72
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>that we put it in aluminum flag on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuck in there.</v>

73
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>I've never touched another man's shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than his,</v>

74
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I tried to set up a hunt for myself last</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and the brakes and it just ended up</v>

75
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>didn't happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

76
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my favorite places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so lonely out there,</v>

77
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>but so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That area is so,</v>

78
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.220
<v Speaker 1>it's such a perfect place to introduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>count and I to the world of hunting</v>

79
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>because it's so wild with multifaceted</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

80
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of history there.</v>

83
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>complete wilderness experience cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the water right there.</v>

84
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.620

<v Speaker 1>we're not crossing roads like we got</v>

85
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>dropped off at the end of a road and</v>
<v Speaker 1>floated to basically the next row down</v>

86
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>the river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a big deal.</v>

87
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>We floated 40 miles down over the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

88
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six days is one of my,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one right there.</v>

91
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.970

<v Speaker 1>Hey Buddy.</v>

92
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.970

<v Speaker 1>That's a different time.</v>

93
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>That was in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one where it was constant,</v>

94
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>that video that you just put up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

95
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>when we did do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

96
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was where Lewis and Clark had made</v>

97
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>some stops expedition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where one of the coolest</v>

98
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>things about doing it with Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he knows so much about the history</v>

99
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>of the United States and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the settling of the United States and</v>

100
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>also the Nez perce Indian stories that</v>

102
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I heard the story about</v>

103
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the real story,</v>

104
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>the original story about the Leonardo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dicaprio movie.</v>

105
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>The revenant.</v>

107
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>He told me that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual story about the guy that got</v>

109
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>left behind and crawled back many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many miles.</v>

110
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>What's the guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the actual guy's name,</v>

111
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>but there's so much they made up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

112
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just to kind of brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a freaky movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't pretty.</v>

114
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.980
<v Speaker 1>The grizzly bear attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.080

<v Speaker 1>The real grizzly bear attack.</v>

116
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:48.760

117
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 1>swatted that dude once and then just he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell down and it left him alone.</v>

118
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that thing would have torn to</v>

119
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:58.860
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a giant bear too.</v>

120
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And I just fuck bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

121
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>They scare the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder really the average length of</v>

122
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>time of a bear attack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how long has it lasts?</v>

123
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Two seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds.</v>

124
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Well the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie grizzly man,</v>

125
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>apparently the audio of him getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed by the bears like seven minutes</v>

126
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:16.740
<v Speaker 1>long and listen to that.</v>

127
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.831
<v Speaker 1>That was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

128
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one you listened to online's not</v>

129
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no shit.</v>

130
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual audio was never released.</v>

132
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Life is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>I have somebody send it to me too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I looked into it and Werner</v>

134
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Herzog and the woman who owns the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>audio,</v>

135
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>they got rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They destroyed it.</v>

136
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>They never listened to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Werner Herzog actually told her to</v>

137
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.530
<v Speaker 1>destroy it in the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the one,</v>

138
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>when you hear it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fake.</v>

139
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>And then once you know it's fake and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to it,</v>

140
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

141
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>this shit's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like you can hear it.</v>

142
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to listen to it again,</v>

143
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

144
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really want to see,</v>

145
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>do you find that grizzly man audio who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear it and you go,</v>

146
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't real.</v>

147
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.970
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my top five movies of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time though.</v>

148
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Credible to one of the funniest movies</v>

149
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:06.570
<v Speaker 1>ever as far as unintentional comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

150
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the sheriff?</v>

151
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>The sheriff goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

152
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was retarded</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

153
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

154
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.170
<v Speaker 1>like screams and shed</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the fox audio bear attack.</v>

155
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Why is it echoing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The echo that was done in the room.</v>

156
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>All these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these voices,</v>

157
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 1>these supposed to be in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

158
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that audio is unquestionably done in a</v>

159
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.680
<v Speaker 1>room somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Sierra.</v>

160
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>It's fake horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See now you know those mother fuckers,</v>

161
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 1>they got us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they benefited from</v>

162
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 1>creating that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

163
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody probably put up some youtube</v>

164
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>ads and made some cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

165
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they just did it for fun.</v>

166
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>It sounded like people were having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good time.</v>

167
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's yelling.</v>

168
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you can almost kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here in his yellow.</v>

169
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

170
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so ridiculous.</v>

171
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.600
<v Speaker 1>But it's supposedly lasted seven minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're just start leading them.</v>

172
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's that?</v>

173
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>What does that stat that's not from like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real audio last bought actual</v>

174
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:28.440
<v Speaker 1>audience because the bears not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill him.</v>

175
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's just eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause bears apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I've seen bears kill moose in</v>

177
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:37.550
<v Speaker 1>videos and they just start eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't kill him right away.</v>

178
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I know all of them down to wolves do</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

179
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>They just eat right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start right at the back end and</v>

180
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 1>start eating you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

181
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 1>they don't bother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the decency.</v>

182
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Like at least a mountain lion kills Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

183
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.080
<v Speaker 1>cats kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Bears and wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just eat you.</v>

185
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I guess they just don't need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't need to incapacitate</v>

186
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>everybody there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

187
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also a thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>omnivores.</v>

188
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think don't have that instinct to</v>

189
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 1>instantly kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's interesting.</v>

190
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't make sense though.</v>

191
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>My theory sucks because of wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because wolves.</v>

192
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

194
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do that because they have to,</v>

195
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:20.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

196
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take,</v>

197
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 1>they take on a running animal itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills.</v>

198
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>They snap at the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

199
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they just,</v>

200
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it's the easiest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>softest part of me just start eating on</v>

201
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 1>the back end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to a podcast today about</v>

202
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>wolves and Idaho where they were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how when you go deep into the back</v>

203
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>country where people can't get to or</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's very difficult,</v>

204
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 1>really rocky terrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wolves are just running,</v>

205
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>ramping out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have so many wolves there.</v>

206
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Ever seen one in the wild?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

207
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>she put that on your list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually did see one,</v>

208
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.750
<v Speaker 1>you know Berta I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was at twilight and it was dog</v>

209
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 1>sized and it ran across the road and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a little too big to be a coyote.</v>

210
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my mind.</v>

211
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>But I thought I saw a wolf for like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds and it was a squirrel.</v>

212
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:10.010
<v Speaker 1>So take that thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a couple of the most memorable</v>

213
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>we where we were in a valley in Alaska</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was dusk and uh,</v>

214
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just too massive mountain ranges on each</v>

215
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

216
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been the honest,</v>

217
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 1>somebody yelled and somebody spotted one</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the river and we went and looked</v>

218
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>at it and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was men.</v>

219
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>My memory is failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was either pure white,</v>

220
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it was pure white and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God it's shown,</v>

221
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I it just like emanated light and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most like regal,</v>

222
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like perfect,</v>

223
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just sort of trotted along the</v>

224
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:43.250
<v Speaker 1>river and disappeared back in the woods</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're amazing.</v>

225
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about it this morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a hike here,</v>

226
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for mountain lion tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

227
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>the sign at the trailhead says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you warning about mountain lions</v>

228
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 1>are out here for sure.</v>

229
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really,</v>

230
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

231
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:02.440
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that ever gives me pause</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the woods is a grizzly because you</v>

232
00:10:02.441 --> 00:10:03.274
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve and I,</v>

233
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 1>we got charged that once and ever since</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened,</v>

234
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.810
<v Speaker 1>my a bear radar is more intense and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just such a freaky animal.</v>

235
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see what a grizzly really is,</v>

236
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 1>essentially a thousand pound giant wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>

237
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>have you seen those in the wild yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet?</v>

238
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Grisly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

239
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen a grizzly.</v>

240
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Not In the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them,</v>

241
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in a sanctuary and I've seen a lot</v>

242
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:28.771
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

243
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I did see a Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw small grizzly in Alberta,</v>

244
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>

245
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't that big.</v>

246
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It was like maybe six and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven feet.</v>

247
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It was on the stand where you're pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

248
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very close.</v>

249
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 1>It was like 30 or 40 yards from us.</v>

250
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

251
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But it took off pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't a Grizzly,</v>

252
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 1>like they had some trail cam photos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking tankers.</v>

253
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 1>They were Goddamn VW buses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was like a juvenile.</v>

254
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 1>So it was probably like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like six and a half feet or</v>

255
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 1>something like that where I live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bozeman.</v>

256
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:03.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's literally a line right where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

257
00:11:03.091 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 1>So south of us is the Gallatin range in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Madison Range,</v>

258
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 1>just full full of grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just north of town,</v>

259
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 1>there's the bridger range and a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ranges too.</v>

260
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:16.191
<v Speaker 1>And for whatever reason that is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>impasse to the population of bears.</v>

261
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Why is rls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have any ideas?</v>

262
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be,</v>

263
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just physicality.</v>

264
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>And my actually Steve Rainelle would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that I've heard him talk about</v>

265
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:26.820
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would know exactly,</v>

266
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's either a physical impasse or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

267
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the human and the proximity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

268
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>the of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the town and all this.</v>

269
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.860
<v Speaker 1>But the way that it relates is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to go hiking with my little</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby boy,</v>

271
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:42.290
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I choose to go north just because,</v>

272
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would always thought</v>

273
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I carry bear spray.</v>

274
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Usually I carry a pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

275
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I probably will in the future just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that guy he was from Bozeman got</v>

276
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>attacked last year.</v>

277
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got tore up and that was horrific.</v>

278
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His scalp is hanging off his head while</v>

279
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:01.040
<v Speaker 2>he's making the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a gnarly,</v>

280
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 2>and he wasn't hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just hiking.</v>

281
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 2>He was scouting and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used bear spray and it didn't work.</v>

282
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 2>It was a sow with her cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

283
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.850
<v Speaker 2>So that's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

284
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 2>50 miles from where I live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's where he got hit 60 miles.</v>

285
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Close.</v>

286
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

287
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to mess around with.</v>

288
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's awesome that they exist.</v>

289
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so cool that they exist.</v>

290
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him to not exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I don't want to be</v>

291
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:27.940
<v Speaker 2>near them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

292
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to encounter him.</v>

293
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so uh,</v>

294
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.041
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

295
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm more sensitive to them now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have really have a deep,</v>

296
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 2>deep love for them.</v>

297
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Sharks on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could just kill them.</v>

298
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 2>What's weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are getting like really touchy</v>

299
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 2>feely about sharks because they hear all</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these sharks getting slaughtered</v>

300
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 2>for shark fin soup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

301
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.991
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

302
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:54.991
<v Speaker 2>The governor I think of New York caught</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shark fishing totally legal and not an</v>

303
00:12:57.071 --> 00:13:02.071
<v Speaker 2>endangered fish at all and he got so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much hate because people who,</v>

304
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like we were talking before about</v>
<v Speaker 2>science that so many people want to</v>

305
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 2>argue things online but they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually like look into like what are</v>

306
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.220
<v Speaker 2>the studies that had been done and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much do people actually know?</v>

307
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people want to have an opinion.</v>

308
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 2>They have this like narrow window of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information and then I'm just going to</v>

309
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 2>run with my opinion and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you for killing that shark.</v>

310
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

311
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like people have time necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go investigate everything.</v>

312
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 2>They have an opinion about an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

313
00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:30.790
<v Speaker 2>but they do have time to tweet about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get Mad at the governor.</v>

314
00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Was it the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it the mayor of New York that that</v>

315
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 2>got in trouble for the shark?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

316
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get in trouble because what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did was totally legal and they cooked</v>

317
00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.860
<v Speaker 2>it and Maaco shark is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] ever had.</v>

318
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And the Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they serve,</v>

319
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 2>they serve shark everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you go to a food stand,</v>

320
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:48.100
<v Speaker 2>they fry shark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on a stick.</v>

321
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a fish machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an ocean.</v>

322
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 2>It's an ocean out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

323
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 2>New York governor sparks anger after</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing threatened shark.</v>

324
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.650
<v Speaker 2>But it's not threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

325
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Why does it say threatened shark?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a threatened animal thresher</v>

326
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:01.800
<v Speaker 2>shark yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

327
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it said threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

328
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 2>It's it fresher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it say in the headline?</v>

329
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.661
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threaten.</v>

330
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

331
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 2>So threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true.</v>

332
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 2>I do not think that's a threatened</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

333
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all three species of thresher.</v>

334
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Shark is listed as vulnerable by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>International Union for conservation of</v>

335
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:23.850
<v Speaker 2>nature because of their declining</v>
<v Speaker 2>populations.</v>

336
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Fishing for them is regulated in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Oceanic and atmospheric</v>

337
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:29.590
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is not illegal.</v>

338
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite its legality,</v>

339
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:36.490
<v Speaker 2>you and patrons of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lewis said the killing and subsequent</v>

340
00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 2>photos were a porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

341
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 2>it might be a Twat and worked against</v>
<v Speaker 2>those trying to conserve dwindling shark</v>

342
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um Hm.</v>

343
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

344
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.920
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe he's right.</v>

345
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I know that some of them are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno</v>

346
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't really control what</v>

347
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of fish you catch when you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>

348
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 1>And if you catch a fish that's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

349
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 1>what do you do the problem with catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>and release?</v>

350
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 1>This is a dirty secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

351
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 1>because people do go catch and release</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing and I've released fish before.</v>

352
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.890
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

353
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.520
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is that a secret still you think</v>

354
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>for some folks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

355
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not sure.</v>

356
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

357
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:16.401
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

358
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:17.600
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

359
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:21.050
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like taking you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan is underwater for five minutes</v>

360
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 1>and putting us back you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even worse,</v>

361
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 1>shoving a fucking barb through your face</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then drowning us because all we're</v>

362
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 1>doing to it and we're literally drowning</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

363
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

364
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:31.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

365
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:34.220
<v Speaker 1>some people use barbless hooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are better,</v>

366
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 1>and the inside of the mouth of a fish is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different than our mouth.</v>

367
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.021
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

368
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:39.711
<v Speaker 1>there's Pratt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

369
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:41.070
<v Speaker 1>There's best practices to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

370
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 1>to harm the fish as little as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

371
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:45.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I say,</v>

372
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.140
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

373
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Fly fishing with barbless hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely you can.</v>

375
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are going to be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of our night,</v>

376
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

377
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't putting them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

378
00:15:57.561 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Well it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

379
00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

380
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a catch and release fish</v>

381
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 1>fisherman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even a huge fisherman.</v>

382
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I love to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to go to Alaska,</v>

383
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>catch a buttload of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come home and eat it for the rest of the</v>

384
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to go halibut fishing.</v>

385
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Jesse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do cause I've done that yet.</v>

386
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

387
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I love how I've gone fluke fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've caught flounder before,</v>

388
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 1>which a little baby halibut's but</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're delicious.</v>

389
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.240
<v Speaker 1>But halibut is supposed to be like one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most delicious fish to catch and</v>

390
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 1>cook like right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's amazing.</v>

391
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

392
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those rule of fleshy white</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

393
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 1>kinda like grouper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grouper.</v>

394
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

395
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like chunks the hell,</v>

396
00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:32.860
<v Speaker 1>the deep fried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

397
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.170
<v Speaker 1>like a well coated and deep fried it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

398
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>the thing about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you overcook it though,</v>

399
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like chewing on a sock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just gets tough.</v>

400
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Real fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true of other white flesh fish</v>

401
00:16:41.811 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 1>like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

402
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 1>it's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the most exciting to catch.</v>

403
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are giant doors.</v>

404
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just like holding up his heavy ass.</v>

405
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 1>They're so alien looking to two eyes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one side of their head and they flatten</v>

406
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.860
<v Speaker 1>out at the bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that they're,</v>

407
00:16:57.861 --> 00:16:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I migrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

408
00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

409
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.600
<v Speaker 1>They start swimming up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes on each side and then started a</v>

410
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.833
<v Speaker 1>part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

411
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.010
<v Speaker 1>maturation processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They flip over as they're getting older.</v>

412
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As they're getting older and there I</v>

413
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:16.260
<v Speaker 1>literally slides onto the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it stays there once it's,</v>

414
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I can't go back and forth</v>

415
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.900
<v Speaker 1>on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fucking weird is so weird looking at</v>

416
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 1>it looks wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Let me see two eyes on one side of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

418
00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Their bodies flattened out and it's full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of so much good meat.</v>

419
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

420
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like as heavy and like my aunt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncle live on Kodiak island.</v>

421
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 1>We've been going up there since I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid and I mean it's,</v>

422
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

423
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.990
<v Speaker 1>that's as much meat as a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

424
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.190
<v Speaker 1>You get to 200 pound halibut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't the most common.</v>

425
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:44.450
<v Speaker 1>They can be way bigger than that too.</v>

426
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.670
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to release the really</v>
<v Speaker 1>big ones though,</v>

427
00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:47.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't they say that?</v>

428
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I,</v>

429
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

430
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine caught one and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was apparently enormous and he was</v>

431
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 1>furious because the guide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went fishing with a guide.</v>

432
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 1>The guide cut the line because it was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

433
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he just couldn't get it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boat?</v>

434
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:00.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

435
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:01.531
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

436
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to let this go because it's a big</v>

437
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 1>breeder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

438
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And that these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these big ones are responsible for</v>

439
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:10.710
<v Speaker 1>keeping the populations healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because this guy made a living off</v>

440
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 1>of fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

441
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 1>it's our responsibility to cut the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeves.</v>

442
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

443
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.650
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

444
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know that that was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>an option.</v>

445
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's pulling up this thing where</v>

446
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 1>he described it as like the side of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

447
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the wall of a room.</v>

448
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking huge.</v>

449
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's true how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

450
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Speaker 1>but I know other fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the big ones don't eat that</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

452
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Speaker 1>You're just not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not have been.</v>

453
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's going to get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mounted.</v>

454
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.114
<v Speaker 1>I doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

455
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Like a 400 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that's true with deer too.</v>

456
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never eaten a really old deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they say old deer just do not taste</v>

457
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 1>that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be it.</v>

458
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I know they can be worse for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoot an old dough.</v>

459
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 1>That was mo mo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mo.</v>

460
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:50.330
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

461
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.580
<v Speaker 1>And he said it was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

462
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>how did it change rooms over a winter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my little brother shot me a deer and</v>

463
00:18:56.581 --> 00:19:01.581
<v Speaker 1>gave it to me for Christmas and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first slightly off tasting animal</v>

464
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:05.670
<v Speaker 1>that I've tasted in man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years,</v>

465
00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been eating a lot of animals,</v>

466
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over my course of time.</v>

467
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've worked on for a long time.</v>

469
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

470
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I a lot of animals and they all tasted</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally good.</v>

471
00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And my brother shot this one and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was.</v>

472
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 1>It was cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He killed it.</v>

473
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it got dark and he had to track it</v>

474
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:28.900
<v Speaker 1>in early the next morning and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

475
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 1>did he got shot it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

476
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:31.981
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit it.</v>

477
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Well it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

478
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it died fairly close.</v>

479
00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it was,</v>

480
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.180
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty gnarly and I even mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I made sausage out of it and try to</v>

481
00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:42.700
<v Speaker 1>eat that and that was hard to get down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>

482
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.030
<v Speaker 1>we have a couple pounds of it left</v>
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

483
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.650
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

484
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

485
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was a tarsal glands or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

486
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Like was it in the Rut?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

487
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.070
<v Speaker 1>it was muzzleloader season in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in December in Minnesota.</v>

488
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was.</v>

489
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

490
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Well you hear stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

492
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:05.070
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that really</v>

493
00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:06.960
<v Speaker 1>got me into hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not with just the,</v>

494
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 1>how cool that trip was and how amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was and how bizarre it is to be out</v>

495
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And total silence.</v>

496
00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:14.680
<v Speaker 1>No cell phone signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear.</v>

497
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Not What do we see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe three people the whole week</v>

498
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 1>we were out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

499
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Two boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

500
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember seeing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember we saw a dude's tent and he</v>

501
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 1>had like a little a woodstove and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

502
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to go the stove.</v>

503
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Fuck is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got a stove inside of his</v>

504
00:20:30.121 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 1>tent because he used to stay at warm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his tent.</v>

505
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:37.680
<v Speaker 1>We were freezing our dicks off and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw another guy who had a deer in his</v>

506
00:20:37.681 --> 00:20:39.030
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had shot up.</v>

507
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that guy?</v>

508
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a memorable meal,</v>

509
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:42.511
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

510
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 1>that was going to say the food was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

511
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Once we did shoot that deer and we</v>

512
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 2>ate it that night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

513
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.220
<v Speaker 2>good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>

514
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:54.460
<v Speaker 2>it's the best meat ever and pos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much connected to it,</v>

515
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that.</v>

516
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like you went to a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a delicious meal.</v>

517
00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.381
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

518
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you busted your ass for five days</v>

519
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 2>humping over mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally put a stock on a deer shot.</v>

520
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 2>The deer killed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dragged it back to camp,</v>

521
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.350
<v Speaker 2>cut it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>butchered it,</v>

522
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.500
<v Speaker 2>and then we ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

523
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.030
<v Speaker 2>and then when Steve took that dough head</v>
<v Speaker 2>and buried it underground because,</v>

524
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:17.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that Guthrie Book?</v>

525
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.030
<v Speaker 2>A big sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

526
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in this book.</v>

527
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

528
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the name of the book.</v>

529
00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that book he talks about cooking</v>

530
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 2>a deer head under the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Steve wanted to try it.</v>

531
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 2>We soaked burlap sack I've ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was incredible.</v>

532
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:37.300
<v Speaker 2>It was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>

533
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 2>It was like some sort of exotic smoked</v>
<v Speaker 2>pork or something like that.</v>

534
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

535
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ate everything,</v>

536
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ate the liver,</v>

537
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 2>we ate the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

538
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 2>when we ate it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>

539
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you still have a freezer full of meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

540
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Shot an elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

541
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 2>In October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

542
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.010
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had shot a deer in November,</v>

543
00:21:57.011 --> 00:21:58.770
<v Speaker 2>but I ate that near pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

544
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.380
<v Speaker 2>I had a doubt of the season last year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this year for the first time.</v>

545
00:22:02.381 --> 00:22:05.950
<v Speaker 2>A long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been eating more local pork and</v>

546
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 2>beef and I'm just so sick of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

547
00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait until this fall again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now when are you going back home?</v>

548
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Back home from here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

549
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

550
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.170
<v Speaker 2>a week from two weeks from yesterday.</v>

551
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I have two commercial freezers in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

552
00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I could hook you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

553
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to turn it down.</v>

554
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 2>How could you get it back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

555
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.680
<v Speaker 2>let me think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

556
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I can go buy cooler stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go buy a small Yeti or figure something</v>

557
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:32.190
<v Speaker 2>out and get you some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one of those Yeti hoppers at home</v>

558
00:22:32.191 --> 00:22:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I could give you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes me really proud that like,</v>

559
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there the first time you hunted,</v>

560
00:22:36.611 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 2>now you're going to hook me up with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good stuff.</v>

561
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I live off it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy meat anymore unless I go to</v>

562
00:22:42.731 --> 00:22:45.700
<v Speaker 2>a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that I go to a store like</v>

563
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 2>a butcher shop and buy meat unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something I'm preparing,</v>

564
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.640
<v Speaker 2>it's just not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just actually not as good.</v>

565
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Well or I find that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

566
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.310
<v Speaker 2>It tastes like a soft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy animal.</v>

567
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 2>It's weird like when you eat a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like from a butcher shop,</v>

568
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean they taste good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still taste good,</v>

569
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 2>but it tastes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this soft almost sick thing.</v>

570
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chink,</v>

571
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:10.780
<v Speaker 2>grass fed beef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that I</v>

572
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:14.650
<v Speaker 2>noticed like way back in the day when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>first started learning about grass fed</v>

573
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:15.131
<v Speaker 2>beef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

574
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:16.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the difference?</v>

575
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 2>And people explain to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

576
00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference in the fatty acids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's,</v>

577
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.080
<v Speaker 2>what's healthier about it is these</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals are not supposed to be eating</v>

578
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:24.370
<v Speaker 2>grain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they eat grain,</v>

579
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:26.170
<v Speaker 2>it's bad for their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they're so fat.</v>

580
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And the marbling is actually them being</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly unhealthy and like,</v>

581
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

582
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.800
<v Speaker 2>so I'm gonna try some grass fed meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was so expensive.</v>

583
00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 2>And then it was a small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're smaller,</v>

584
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:36.940
<v Speaker 2>like the stakes are small and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>darker meat.</v>

585
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.773
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

586
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And then I remember eating it thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

587
00:23:39.581 --> 00:23:41.360
<v Speaker 2>this tastes really different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

588
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.350
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a grass fed steak tastes different</v>

589
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 2>than a grain fed steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look different when you lay them</v>

590
00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:48.090
<v Speaker 2>out side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

591
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 2>But then you take those and then you put</v>
<v Speaker 2>an elk stake next to it and you go,</v>

592
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the real meat man.</v>

593
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>

594
00:23:56.301 --> 00:24:00.290
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be in that deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark red meat that you eat it and you</v>

595
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.650
<v Speaker 2>just want to run through a fucking wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's got energy in it.</v>

596
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Like it it fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes your body feel different when</v>

597
00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 2>you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>

598
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:08.770
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

599
00:24:08.771 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a a psychological thing?</v>

600
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that it's actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological in the meat?</v>

601
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 2>It is better.</v>

602
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.360
<v Speaker 2>There's something in there and more for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

603
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.930
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you make sense of that for</v>

604
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a terrible unscientific theory</v>

605
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.580
<v Speaker 2>and my unscientific theory is things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that run fast or better for you.</v>

606
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.100
<v Speaker 2>That's why fish is really good for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's hard to catch and they've,</v>

607
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 2>they've swim fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deer are great.</v>

608
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 2>They run fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbits are great.</v>

609
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:37.880
<v Speaker 2>They run fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cows just sort of wander around,</v>

610
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just meandering and slow theory.</v>

611
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 2>But it makes sense that we have more</v>
<v Speaker 2>cows cause I guess it's just all right</v>

612
00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:48.750
<v Speaker 2>there corral those bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know my buddy Adam lives in uh,</v>

613
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam Green tree and in Australia they</v>

614
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:57.431
<v Speaker 2>have wild cows where cows at one time</v>
<v Speaker 2>were domestic but they broke loose and</v>

615
00:24:58.221 --> 00:24:59.480
<v Speaker 2>they've been for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

616
00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.890
<v Speaker 2>many generations living wild and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely dangerous.</v>

617
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially the bowls.</v>

618
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Like when you watch cowboys riding bowls</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

619
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

620
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:10.960
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

621
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking big scary animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

622
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 2>a domestic animal that is not fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>off predators.</v>

623
00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:19.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

624
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.720
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't want you to fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got these giant watermelon</v>

625
00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:28.721
<v Speaker 2>testicles and they're just full of piss</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vinegar and that we don't eat those.</v>

626
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 2>If Pete for people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you buy meat from a cow,</v>

627
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.570
<v Speaker 2>you're buying meat from a steer and want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to steer is a bold.</v>

628
00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Speaker 2>It cut his balls off and he's young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his testosterone stops.</v>

629
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.770
<v Speaker 2>So there's bodies mushy and soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

630
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.800
<v Speaker 2>But these bulls that Adam sees out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bush in Australia are super</v>

631
00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:53.780
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and very dangerous and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his friends was torn apart by Juan Gord,</v>

632
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.180
<v Speaker 2>like really badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

633
00:25:55.181 --> 00:25:58.030
<v Speaker 2>they lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had a med vac to safety at</v>

634
00:25:58.031 --> 00:25:59.950
<v Speaker 2>tours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guts open and you know,</v>

635
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he was hunting it.</v>

636
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I think like he was just in the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

637
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:06.140
<v Speaker 2>The wrong time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see you and they just fucking</v>

638
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:06.974
<v Speaker 2>charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

639
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.080
<v Speaker 2>It means a reason why they have those</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn giant horns.</v>

640
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the saying that uh,</v>

641
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.610
<v Speaker 2>you cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cut into a male animals balls off</v>

642
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:17.210
<v Speaker 2>and they stop thinking about ass and</v>
<v Speaker 2>start thinking about grass.</v>

643
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's literal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

644
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.890
<v Speaker 2>They stopped trying to get laid and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just eat,</v>

645
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.820
<v Speaker 2>they just keep eating and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lack of testosterone make some soft</v>

646
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 2>and mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I'm Cam Haynes shot of water</v>

647
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:35.081
<v Speaker 2>buffalo in Australia and he said that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had one piece of meat in his mouth for</v>

648
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 2>half an hour trying to chew it down</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he was practicing archery.</v>

649
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:41.810
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exaggerating.</v>

650
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Chewed piece of meat for a whole half</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

651
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it say about us though?</v>

652
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Are as as humans though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could easily make an analogy</v>

653
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:55.980
<v Speaker 1>there between cows and then a wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and us.</v>

654
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean nobody's more domesticated than</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

655
00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things we domesticate.</v>

656
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I think we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where the domestic cater</v>

657
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 1>somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're even more</v>

658
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.500
<v Speaker 1>domesticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could eat one of the duck</v>

659
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:10.010
<v Speaker 1>dynasty guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

660
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:15.020
<v Speaker 1>they would cook up good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Oh mushy.</v>

661
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there would be so much</v>

662
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 1>flavoring and marbling and plus they</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably eat a lot of sugar.</v>

663
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 1>So there's probably like a lot of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweetness to the meat.</v>

664
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not advocating,</v>

665
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what your tooth is though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're used to eating wild animals</v>

666
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:32.160
<v Speaker 1>and eight one of the duck dynasty guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>would taste like shit.</v>

667
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.720
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

668
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.480
<v Speaker 1>But if you eat McDonald's and ring</v>
<v Speaker 1>dings,</v>

669
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.070
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the ring thing?</v>

670
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one of those little hostess</v>

671
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So chocolate covered,</v>

672
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:46.680
<v Speaker 1>cream filled jammies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have to get one of those.</v>

673
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had them on those disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look great.</v>

674
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

675
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 1>who is it going to enjoy this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as you eat it,</v>

676
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with me,</v>

677
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:54.320
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

678
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I love just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some tacos.</v>

679
00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I got to town last night and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to go to the first Taqueria.</v>

680
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I saw it was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have legit Mexican food in La.</v>

681
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.080
<v Speaker 1>The Montessori does not have next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really right.</v>

682
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Not such good Mexican food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Colorado has some really good</v>

683
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Mexican food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

684
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

685
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

686
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.780
<v Speaker 1>the line of that I think stops at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

687
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe why I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think has it been north into</v>

688
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:18.661
<v Speaker 1>Montana?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

689
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you're in a dead zone where you are is</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing though.</v>

690
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 1>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could take a trip for Mexican food</v>

691
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 1>because where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

692
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.473
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

693
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I almost feel like I shouldn't say this</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast because I don't want</v>

694
00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:34.560
<v Speaker 1>anybody moving to Bozeman is already on</v>
<v Speaker 1>her foot to list.</v>

695
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:36.690
<v Speaker 1>It's everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the cat's out of the bag.</v>

696
00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:38.640

<v Speaker 1>highest percentage of phds in America.</v>

706
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a highly educated population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not like boulder where</v>

707

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no national about their</v>

709

<v Speaker 1>It's balanced.</v>

710
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.140
<v Speaker 1>You can find some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

713

<v Speaker 1>It's diverse some ways.</v>

716
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Not with mostly white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.233
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

718
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Moving there from New York and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

719
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:31.440
<v Speaker 1>that is my least favorite thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Montana and not a whole lot of</v>

720
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:32.274
<v Speaker 1>flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

721
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.930
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many good things about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

722
00:29:35.931 --> 00:29:38.820
<v Speaker 1>the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you get to see when you're</v>

723
00:29:38.821 --> 00:29:40.020
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stunning.</v>

724
00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:42.910
<v Speaker 1>And the access to the is the huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge thing too.</v>

725
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Bozeman from my house in,</v>

726
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many fin fought four</v>
<v Speaker 1>different directions,</v>

727
00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 1>three different directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be at a trail in 15 minutes and</v>

728
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:54.070
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just endless.</v>

729
00:29:54.071 --> 00:29:55.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get on a trail ride side of,</v>

730
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk right outside of Bozeman.</v>

731
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:04.021
<v Speaker 1>And you can go if you wanted to for days</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the yellowstone ecosystem south.</v>

732
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just keep going and keep going and</v>

733
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

734
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:10.900
<v Speaker 1>it connects you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean real big wilderness,</v>

735
00:30:10.901 --> 00:30:12.160
<v Speaker 1>the kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind that you can,</v>

736
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean in Alaska you find it even</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

737
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but I think in the lower 48 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unparalleled.</v>

738
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Man in the lower 48 is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about as wild as it gets.</v>

739
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And that leads me to what I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring up to you today because I saw this</v>

740
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:30.160
<v Speaker 1>today where trump is his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his challenging some of the protection</v>

741
00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:33.560
<v Speaker 1>of certain national monuments and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>public lands today.</v>

742
00:30:33.561 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 1>It was something that came out and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you fuckers,</v>

743
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I knew this was coming and there were so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people that were telling me that</v>

744
00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 1>trump is going to protect our public</v>
<v Speaker 1>lands because his son is a hunter and</v>

745
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:44.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

746
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:49.170
<v Speaker 1>that guy worships money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's money to be made in delisting</v>

747
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 1>these public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this trump order could roll back</v>

748
00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:54.460
<v Speaker 1>public land protections from three</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents.</v>

749
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 1>This is going to have a shit storm on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands though may play there so we</v>

750
00:30:58.271 --> 00:31:03.271
<v Speaker 1>could hear exactly what he says of</v>
<v Speaker 1>America's natural ratio sis</v>

751
00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.280
<v Speaker 3>and I can tell you the group that's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>here right now,</v>

752
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.860
<v Speaker 3>they're really doing the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rightly said,</v>

753
00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.480
<v Speaker 3>they doing a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

754
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.880
<v Speaker 3>we're going to take care of Alaska too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>

755
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:21.950
<v Speaker 3>And they protect the ability of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to access and utilize the land</v>

756
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:27.460
<v Speaker 3>which truly belongs to them and belongs</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all of us.</v>

757
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Secretary Ryan Zinky is doing an</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible job and he never overlooks</v>

758
00:31:37.671 --> 00:31:39.650
<v Speaker 3>the details.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a detailed person.</v>

759
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Soon after he was confirmed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a snow storm,</v>

760
00:31:44.481 --> 00:31:48.740
<v Speaker 3>big one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was out there on the steps of the</v>

761
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:53.741
<v Speaker 3>Lincoln memorial shoveling the snow all</v>
<v Speaker 3>by himself.</v>

762
00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.270
<v Speaker 3>And he's a strong guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did a good job.</v>

763
00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Part the fuck am I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

764
00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.120
<v Speaker 3>very good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Proud of heard the first 100 days we've</v>

765
00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:06.920
<v Speaker 3>taken historic action to eliminate</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasteful regulations.</v>

766
00:32:06.921 --> 00:32:10.460
<v Speaker 3>They're being eliminated like nobody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever seen before.</v>

767
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.840
<v Speaker 3>There's never been anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I look at some of the things</v>

768
00:32:14.841 --> 00:32:16.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm signing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say maybe people won't like it,</v>

769
00:32:16.881 --> 00:32:18.080
<v Speaker 3>but I'm doing the right thing.</v>

770
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.510
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so weird that that's a</v>

771
00:32:23.511 --> 00:32:26.030
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way he communicates,</v>

772
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.880
<v Speaker 1>did you see when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just pinned a purple heart?</v>

773
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just pinned a purple heart on,</v>

774
00:32:33.441 --> 00:32:35.990
<v Speaker 1>on a return vet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got lost.</v>

775
00:32:35.991 --> 00:32:37.640
<v Speaker 1>His leg just happened last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

776
00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>It's the most awkward and weirdest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is</v>

777
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 4>the weirdest single thing I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>watched on a screen.</v>

778
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:45.980
<v Speaker 4>His,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his body language and his,</v>

779
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he does.</v>

780
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.350
<v Speaker 4>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really Bizarre.</v>

781
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:51.740
<v Speaker 4>And what does it</v>

782
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 2>say there in terms of like what the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual rollbacks mean and what the,</v>

783
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 2>the issue is</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

784
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's go largely ignored order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which trump sign.</v>

785
00:33:01.191 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 2>The interior department could lead to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reshaping of 24 national monuments,</v>

786
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:07.430
<v Speaker 2>including the Grand Canyon Parish</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shan't,</v>

787
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:12.460
<v Speaker 2>national monument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grand Staircase Escalante National</v>

788
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Monument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Bass and range national monument</v>

789
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>as well as the host of Pacific Ocean</v>
<v Speaker 2>monuments,</v>

790
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 2>including the World War II valor in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacific National Monument though</v>

791
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he cast the move as a way to include</v>

792
00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 2>local voices in the decision to</v>
<v Speaker 2>designate monuments.</v>

793
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 2>The review of the antiquities act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the first signed by President</v>

794
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:37.481
<v Speaker 2>Teddy Roosevelt in 1906 stands in stark</v>
<v Speaker 2>relief two years of bipartisan work at</v>

795
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:39.890
<v Speaker 2>conserving lands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

796
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 2>The move comes after Western Republican</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawmakers,</v>

797
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:48.140
<v Speaker 2>including Utah Senator Orrin Hatch</v>
<v Speaker 2>complained that Obama overused the law</v>

798
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.160
<v Speaker 2>to overprotect land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck do you overprotect land?</v>

799
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.490
<v Speaker 2>It kind of protected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't overprotect it,</v>

800
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.510
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

801
00:33:56.511 --> 00:33:56.910
<v Speaker 2>It's history</v>

802
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.940
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The worry is going to be that this would</v>

803
00:33:59.941 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 4>be in the beginning of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a larger pattern.</v>

804
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

805
00:34:03.991 --> 00:34:04.824
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I wanted to,</v>

806
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.680
<v Speaker 2>you know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I think most people don't,</v>

807
00:34:08.681 --> 00:34:11.350
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of the people in this</v>

808
00:34:11.351 --> 00:34:16.351
<v Speaker 2>country live in these communities and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities and towns and you know,</v>

809
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.820
<v Speaker 2>even small towns they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand how much of this</v>

810
00:34:21.821 --> 00:34:24.670
<v Speaker 2>land that we live in is just this</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible,</v>

811
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.740
<v Speaker 2>bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

812
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:30.490
<v Speaker 2>experiment in like the people having</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

813
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:35.530
<v Speaker 2>the actual American people owning this</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible swath of public land.</v>

814
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:37.923
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

815
00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:39.610
<v Speaker 2>it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what you're talking about.</v>

816
00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Like you can walk for days and days into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

817
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they don't know that exists</v>

818
00:34:44.311 --> 00:34:46.290
<v Speaker 4>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think even to me,</v>

819
00:34:46.291 --> 00:34:49.080
<v Speaker 4>more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't understand the impact that</v>

820
00:34:49.081 --> 00:34:54.081
<v Speaker 4>that actually has on people and what it</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually means to be able to be part of</v>

821
00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:55.100
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

822
00:34:55.101 --> 00:34:56.730
<v Speaker 4>it's a really deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>important thing.</v>

823
00:34:56.731 --> 00:34:58.920
<v Speaker 4>And I think that people just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

824
00:34:58.921 --> 00:35:01.590
<v Speaker 4>you get your postcard tourists and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

825
00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the national forest.</v>

826
00:35:02.731 --> 00:35:05.280
<v Speaker 4>I love the national parks and let's</v>
<v Speaker 4>drive around and take pictures.</v>

827
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.540
<v Speaker 4>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

828
00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:10.740
<v Speaker 4>There's a big industry there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very helpful to the economy and uh,</v>

829
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.370
<v Speaker 4>but there's something way deeper to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

830
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.200
<v Speaker 4>Brings a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

831
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:19.200
<v Speaker 4>and I will even say culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something really deep there that we</v>

832
00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:20.550
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be fucking with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

833
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.150
<v Speaker 4>You just shouldn't be messing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

834
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.980
<v Speaker 4>it's been there for a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>110 years.</v>

835
00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.440
<v Speaker 4>It's the conservation part of it.</v>

836
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

837
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.700
<v Speaker 4>But the land itself has been there way</v>
<v Speaker 4>longer and that's,</v>

838
00:35:32.701 --> 00:35:34.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of like the deep time.</v>

839
00:35:34.471 --> 00:35:36.510
<v Speaker 4>Part of that is what really interests me</v>
<v Speaker 4>is because,</v>

840
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>step out into that in the right context</v>

841
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:40.140
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're all of a sudden,</v>

842
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

843
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:44.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're playing with something way bigger</v>

844
00:35:44.191 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 4>and more powerful and more impactful by</v>
<v Speaker 4>just being part of the landscape that,</v>

845
00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're right.</v>

846
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:50.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

847
00:35:50.411 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 4>the conservation thing is present and</v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

848
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:53.670
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

849
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.710
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in Minnesota and North Dakota</v>

850
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 4>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my first wilderness trip was in the</v>

851
00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 4>boundary waters of northern Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this million 8 million Acre</v>

852
00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:04.800
<v Speaker 4>wilderness of lakes that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>interconnected by trails and you can go</v>

853
00:36:04.801 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 4>out for weeks at a time and canoe across</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lake and then carry your boat to the</v>

854
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:10.620
<v Speaker 4>next lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's camp sites and it's just,</v>

855
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 4>it's paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's where I fell in love with the idea</v>

856
00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:16.590
<v Speaker 4>of wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually where I fell in love with</v>

857
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:18.560
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the first lady that fell in love at</v>

858
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.220
<v Speaker 4>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on a church trip.</v>

859
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

860
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

861
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 4>so what I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying as far as it's</v>

862
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 4>shaping people and its importance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's first trip into the</v>

863
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:31.470
<v Speaker 4>wilderness changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

864
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.140
<v Speaker 4>and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a pretty mild way of saying it.</v>

865
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

866
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 4>it shaped who I am all the way.</v>

867
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Well that gets us to what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>now because you,</v>

868
00:36:40.601 --> 00:36:45.130
<v Speaker 2>you stop working for 0.0 and we talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about on the last podcast that you had</v>

869
00:36:45.131 --> 00:36:49.720
<v Speaker 2>done a lot of these wilderness therapy</v>
<v Speaker 2>trips where you'd take like troubled</v>

870
00:36:49.721 --> 00:36:53.440
<v Speaker 2>kids that have lost their way and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents don't know what the fuck to do</v>

871
00:36:53.441 --> 00:36:56.350
<v Speaker 2>and you would take them out into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woods and live with these kids for</v>

872
00:36:56.351 --> 00:36:57.310
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

873
00:36:57.311 --> 00:36:58.580
<v Speaker 2>For a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

874
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Just crazy to think about like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but make sense.</v>

875
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Like just the five days that I was out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there six days or whatever,</v>

876
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.040
<v Speaker 2>when I first went to Montana with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys changed the way I thought about</v>

877
00:37:12.041 --> 00:37:14.200
<v Speaker 2>wilderness cause I really had never</v>
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>

878
00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd kind of been to like wooded</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>

879
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

880
00:37:19.781 --> 00:37:22.300
<v Speaker 2>But I maybe I went to yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid,</v>

881
00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:23.360
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't really remember it.</v>

882
00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.000
<v Speaker 4>It's a different thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we went to Alaska.</v>

883
00:37:26.001 --> 00:37:26.960
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

884
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.080
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another level of which it was</v>

885
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.980
<v Speaker 4>listened to you on that trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were like,</v>

886
00:37:30.981 --> 00:37:32.950
<v Speaker 4>fuck that place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't go to that place.</v>

887
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.820
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was uncomfortable.</v>

888
00:37:34.821 --> 00:37:38.810
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad we went though in retrospect.</v>

889
00:37:38.811 --> 00:37:39.261
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

890
00:37:39.261 --> 00:37:43.850
<v Speaker 4>and I'm glad you went just because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the level of how deep out we are.</v>

891
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.191
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

892
00:37:45.191 --> 00:37:46.610
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Missouri Breaks in Montana,</v>

893
00:37:46.611 --> 00:37:50.480
<v Speaker 4>you're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in this spot and in southeast</v>

894
00:37:50.481 --> 00:37:52.250
<v Speaker 4>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were really out there and you can</v>

895
00:37:52.251 --> 00:37:53.120
<v Speaker 4>feel in the air</v>

896
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:57.910
<v Speaker 2>fell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell off of this like six foot drop.</v>

897
00:37:57.911 --> 00:38:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I slept and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and luckily I just landed good.</v>

898
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.370
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

899
00:38:03.371 --> 00:38:06.790
<v Speaker 2>you could fuck yourself up up here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not be able to get out of here.</v>

900
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.320
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you do a solo trip.</v>

901
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Bueno.</v>

902
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:11.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

903
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.793
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

904
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm addicted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That feeling.</v>

905
00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of immense.</v>

906
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.950
<v Speaker 4>Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes you over.</v>

907
00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.560
<v Speaker 4>You are so tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are not,</v>

908
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not in charge anymore.</v>

909
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.890
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't care about you.</v>

910
00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the thing about like Prince of</v>

911
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Wales is this solitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sadness.</v>

912
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.220
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>

913
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird feeling that you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just like it.</v>

914
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 4>There's no denying your lack of</v>
<v Speaker 4>significance in this particular</v>

915
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't give a fuck about your credit</v>

916
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 4>cards now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't care if like cell phone,</v>

917
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't care who you know or where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you live or what kind of car each,</v>

918
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.790
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

919
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:55.050
<v Speaker 4>It's just tooth than Fang and claw and</v>
<v Speaker 4>rain and constant rain and beauty.</v>

920
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 4>Just unbelievable beauty with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when the sun does color coaster.</v>

921
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're just in hell and all of a</v>

922
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:05.040
<v Speaker 4>sudden you're on the top of a ridge and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

923
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.360
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the sun peaks out in a rainbow pops</v>

924
00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 4>up and the like the technicolor hyper</v>
<v Speaker 4>vivid,</v>

925
00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:13.850
<v Speaker 4>just like crazy green.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

926
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.090
<v Speaker 4>sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have cold,</v>

927
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that place as a personality.</v>

928
00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:20.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

929
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 4>But being in wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in wilderness spots all over</v>

930
00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 4>the globe.</v>

931
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:28.520
<v Speaker 4>It's what's so fascinating to me is how</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all have a different vibe.</v>

932
00:39:28.521 --> 00:39:30.630
<v Speaker 4>They'll have a different like life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is,</v>

933
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.331
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

934
00:39:31.331 --> 00:39:31.991
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

935
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:33.880
<v Speaker 4>sure it looks different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a,</v>

936
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:37.540
<v Speaker 4>like a felt sense or a feeling you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>from places like the Brooks range in</v>

937
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Alaska is the northern most range of</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountains and it runs east and west.</v>

938
00:39:42.221 --> 00:39:44.980
<v Speaker 4>And then above it is the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Arctic plane,</v>

939
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:48.670
<v Speaker 4>and an Arctic Ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is something about being up there.</v>

940
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.420
<v Speaker 4>And especially I think in the summer</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the sun doesn't really go down.</v>

941
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.280
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

942
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.740
<v Speaker 4>it feels like being on a different</v>
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>

943
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.590
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I have the worst to</v>

944
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:01.210
<v Speaker 4>describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

945
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:02.170
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

946
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:04.090
<v Speaker 4>and that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm addicted to.</v>

947
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.320
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

948
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I moved to Montana for professional</v>

949
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:09.610
<v Speaker 4>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then also because it's where I</v>

950
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 4>wanted to live.</v>

951
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 4>And so I get out hiking all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

952
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:13.900
<v Speaker 4>I train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hike with,</v>

953
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.980
<v Speaker 4>that's Kinda how I stay fit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

954
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 4>but I come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to figure this out because I come</v>

955
00:40:20.741 --> 00:40:25.741
<v Speaker 4>home from that feeling like I just like</v>
<v Speaker 4>got started.</v>

956
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've missed the deep immersion of the</v>

957
00:40:29.321 --> 00:40:33.310
<v Speaker 4>woods when you were working for meat</v>
<v Speaker 4>eater and you constantly on those trips</v>

958
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.850
<v Speaker 4>or any time that I spent over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something that happens</v>

959
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 4>after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

960
00:40:38.051 --> 00:40:40.810
<v Speaker 4>depending on how long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the longest I've stayed out at a time is</v>

961
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.580
<v Speaker 4>a 40 some days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

962
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.940
<v Speaker 4>but there's some that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

963
00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:47.140
<v Speaker 4>a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two days,</v>

964
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:49.480
<v Speaker 4>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five days in where you really just kind</v>

965
00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:52.030
<v Speaker 4>of let go of the regular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

966
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's actually physiological,</v>

967
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.210
<v Speaker 4>some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but whatever.</v>

968
00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:58.630
<v Speaker 4>It could be just psychological too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but something shifts,</v>

969
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you do a real expedition,</v>

970
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.040
<v Speaker 4>when you do a real thing where you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

971
00:41:03.041 --> 00:41:05.800
<v Speaker 4>your brain's not half stuck back in all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other stuff.</v>

972
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go hiking and I love it,</v>

973
00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:10.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time and we get out in the</v>

974
00:41:10.091 --> 00:41:12.190
<v Speaker 4>woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just doesn't really do it for me.</v>

975
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.340
<v Speaker 4>I feel kind of unfulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

976
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.490
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just got so addicted to being out</v>

977
00:41:18.491 --> 00:41:20.820
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely disconnected that you,</v>

978
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.210
<v Speaker 4>when you go on the hike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

979
00:41:22.211 --> 00:41:24.670
<v Speaker 4>you could always just make it back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>town a couple hours.</v>

980
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like a little,</v>

981
00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:30.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think of like an analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it would be like a little taste.</v>

982
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be like maybe like a five</v>

983
00:41:33.411 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 4>minute</v>

984
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:39.050
<v Speaker 1>porn session versus a week long like</v>
<v Speaker 1>lovemaking session that of your dreams,</v>

985
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a little,</v>

986
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:41.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

987
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.370
<v Speaker 1>a little teaser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not as fun.</v>

988
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you plan on staying there?</v>

989
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

990
00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we think about we definitely</v>

991
00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 1>won't move back east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would either move somewhere out here</v>

992
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 1>or stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets cold as fuck in the winter</v>

993
00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:56.630
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

994
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

995
00:41:57.921 --> 00:42:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that call to action.</v>

996
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Like not compared to where I grew up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota.</v>

997
00:42:01.821 --> 00:42:04.930
<v Speaker 1>It gets really cold for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana where we're at.</v>

998
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

999
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 1>global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1000
00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:11.740
<v Speaker 1>something it's different this year was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty mild.</v>

1001
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 1>The year before was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really mild.</v>

1002
00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 35 average temperature.</v>

1003
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1004
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad.</v>

1005
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like 35 below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1006
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you go northern Montana up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highline area.</v>

1007
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 1>It'll start to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1008
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 1>more of a deep freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot more wind is kind of a nice little</v>

1009
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 1>protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should stop talking about Bozeman so</v>

1010
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:34.760
<v Speaker 1>people hear me telling you we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get people into it.</v>

1011
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well just another factor and that it is</v>

1012
00:42:37.431 --> 00:42:39.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the third fastest growing county</v>

1013
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.360
<v Speaker 1>in the states right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1014
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:43.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it makes sense.</v>

1015
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:44.810
<v Speaker 1>When I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went there,</v>

1016
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.360
<v Speaker 1>took the family in there last summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1017
00:42:47.361 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Speaker 1>this place is magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pretty.</v>

1018
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I got a couple of other spots though</v>
<v Speaker 1>that saving.</v>

1019
00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell anybody.</v>

1020
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:53.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1033
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a perception changing thing to go</v>

1034
00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:17.060
<v Speaker 1>up there and watch the sun literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of like,</v>

00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 1>people like Alaska even more extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>because something about those people</v>

1045
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:49.091
<v Speaker 1>that they deal with nature in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else just doesn't.</v>

1046
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they have,</v>

1047
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1048
00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's gnarly.</v>

1049
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't walk out your house for more</v>

1050
00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:56.890
<v Speaker 1>than 10 miles before you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1051
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.550
<v Speaker 1>giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive in front of you peak.</v>

1052
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 1>The ocean's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1054
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:05.090

<v Speaker 1>it's a weird place too.</v>

1055
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.890
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting too because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of it as like a bunch of like</v>

1057
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 1>lumberjacks and fishermen and Weirdos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like people trying to run from the</v>

1058
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:17.300
<v Speaker 1>law or something like that and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and there was like honk free</v>

1059
00:44:17.301 --> 00:44:18.890
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people with gay</v>

1060
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:21.260
<v Speaker 1>rights signs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People beeping their horns as they drove</v>

1061
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:21.710
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1062
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not what you think it is.</v>

1063
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Craft breweries and really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>

1064
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1065
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:28.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1066
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like Hicks.</v>

1067
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it has a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>flavor of the Pacific northwest of</v>

1068
00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Seattle and Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then then a,</v>

1069
00:44:36.801 --> 00:44:39.110
<v Speaker 1>a big dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weird to a lot of weird,</v>

1070
00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of extreme.</v>

1071
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are people that are there.</v>

1072
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where they're going to live and</v>

1073
00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1074
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.531
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1075
00:44:46.531 --> 00:44:49.380
<v Speaker 1>it was a grizzly bears everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Minnesotans and folks from</v>

1076
00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:51.000
<v Speaker 1>where I grew up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big connection.</v>

1077
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.760
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people move up to have moved up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Alaska.</v>

1078
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:54.870
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1079
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I grew up going up there fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly in the summer.</v>

1080
00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.020
<v Speaker 1>So who did you say lives that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lives on Kodiak Island?</v>

1081
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:04.530
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's sister family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary place.</v>

1082
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Those bears are fuck and John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They onto the biggest brown bears in the</v>

1084
00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:11.410
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1085
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:15.000
<v Speaker 1>they might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've heard that the Kamchatka</v>

1086
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Brown bears in Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1087
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Speaker 1>in Russia across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that is Siberia,</v>

1088
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:20.920
<v Speaker 1>but up across the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water there,</v>

1089
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be bigger.</v>

1090
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I could be totally wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw this video of this guy.</v>

1091
00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was on a,</v>

1092
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.510
<v Speaker 1>it was called the hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1093
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:34.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a show that,</v>

1094
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.650
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1095
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 1>James Hetfield of Metallica was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrator of it.</v>

1096
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:44.220
<v Speaker 1>And people were so angry at him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrating this thing that they were,</v>

1097
00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about boycotting metallica when</v>

1098
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:49.500
<v Speaker 1>they played some music festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never watched.</v>

1099
00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I remember you talking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1100
00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>

1101
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And it was about a bear hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1102
00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about brown bear hunting,</v>

1103
00:45:57.001 --> 00:46:00.510
<v Speaker 1>which is a really controversial form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting because you don't really eat</v>

1104
00:46:00.511 --> 00:46:01.440
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1105
00:46:01.441 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 1>you kind of can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they taste like shit.</v>

1106
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coastal ones special,</v>

1107
00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.890
<v Speaker 1>they're just eating rotten fish all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1108
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well like animals tastes like what</v>

1109
00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:11.580
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they eat,</v>

1110
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:12.700
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1111
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems pretty counterintuitive.</v>

1112
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I dare trump to try to take away some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those Alaskan wilderness areas and they,</v>

1113
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the real worry is that he's</v>

1114
00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 1>going to let people drill in them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to destroy something.</v>

1115
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the real worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real worry is the reason why he's</v>

1116
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 1>releasing or relaxing some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations is that he wants to let</v>

1117
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:39.300
<v Speaker 1>industry get in there and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start fracking and polluting wells</v>

1118
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:43.410
<v Speaker 1>and rivers and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking dangerous man.</v>

1119
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that if they do fuck it</v>

1120
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:48.660
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be fucked up for a hundred</v>

1121
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:49.700
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1122
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever live in New York City?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In the city.</v>

1123
00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I used to live in new Rochelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is right outside of the Bronx.</v>

1124
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I lived there for seven years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1125
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 1>if there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there wasn't the existence of central</v>

1126
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:03.390
<v Speaker 1>park and I lived in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so prospect park,</v>

1127
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.980
<v Speaker 1>if those two green places didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I lived there,</v>

1128
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I would have probably lost my mind or</v>
<v Speaker 1>just moved.</v>

1129
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like these big areas of</v>

1130
00:47:14.161 --> 00:47:16.330
<v Speaker 1>wilderness we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1131
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:21.470
<v Speaker 1>as we will not be okay as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as humans.</v>

1132
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean like individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1133
00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It is it going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my worry.</v>

1134
00:47:25.531 --> 00:47:27.770
<v Speaker 1>My worry is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1135
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general American public or the</v>

1136
00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:35.671
<v Speaker 1>general public doesn't have enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection or real life experience to</v>

1137
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:40.861
<v Speaker 1>know why to care so much and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal and it's,</v>

1138
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1139
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different angles you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can take on that.</v>

1140
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:46.660
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much,</v>

1141
00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:48.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's just something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1142
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

1143
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it really gets intense,</v>

1144
00:47:52.961 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to basically drop what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing and do everything I can to,</v>

1145
00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:01.530
<v Speaker 1>to stop them from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from harming these places could be done.</v>

1146
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.550
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my real concern is not just this,</v>

1147
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.120
<v Speaker 1>what's going on now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the future and then also when you</v>

1148
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 1>really consider it overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's seven and a half billion</v>

1149
00:48:11.651 --> 00:48:13.900
<v Speaker 1>people on the planet now and the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent census,</v>

1150
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

1151
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:17.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a half a billion increase over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last,</v>

1152
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't been that many.</v>

1153
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 1>It was 6 billion just a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remembered that was a number that they</v>

1154
00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:27.850
<v Speaker 1>bandied about like a decade or two ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's seven and a half.</v>

1155
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens when it gets to be 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where are we going to put these</v>

1156
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:33.910
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the carrying capacity?</v>

1157
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Then it must apply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amber.</v>

1158
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

1159
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:38.180
<v Speaker 1>We're like rats on a sinking ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 1>We're just scrambling everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're everywhere.</v>

1161
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.700
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have not another animal</v>

1162
00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:46.000
<v Speaker 1>like us when we're on every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>patch of land.</v>

1163
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:47.320
<v Speaker 1>You can find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1164
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.500
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're awesome.</v>

1165
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Except these wilderness spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1166
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Look at this current world population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

1167
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:59.620
<v Speaker 1>How do they know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Births today?</v>

1168
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 1>It's based off averages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the burst today.</v>

1169
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 1>You could watch the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers just roll in.</v>

1170
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between the birth today</v>

1171
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:09.430
<v Speaker 1>and the death today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>

1172
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's moving so fast because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're dying slow as fuck.</v>

1173
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Population growth today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1174
00:49:14.491 --> 00:49:19.491
<v Speaker 1>the average 139,000 people today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>44 million this year.</v>

1175
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

1176
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's scary.</v>

1177
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And what's the u s 400 million?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're 300 plus Mexicans.</v>

1178
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Three 26 it says c but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not counting.</v>

1179
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.530
<v Speaker 1>They're not counting all the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>snuck in.</v>

1180
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

1181
00:49:43.591 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 1>when they'd say Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say Los Angeles,</v>

1182
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:47.260
<v Speaker 1>20 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1183
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:49.930
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about the Mexicans?</v>

1184
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:50.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1185
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 1>cause there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not anti Mexican in any way,</v>

1186
00:49:54.131 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen don't,</v>

1187
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking at this pragmatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking shit load of illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens here,</v>

1189
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.860
<v Speaker 1>which I support also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people are here that any given</v>

1190
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:08.980
<v Speaker 1>time that don't live here but are here</v>
<v Speaker 1>on vacation or working here for like a</v>

1191
00:50:08.981 --> 00:50:09.670
<v Speaker 1>week?</v>

1192
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:10.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Just added people for hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>

1194
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1195
00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:16.420
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 1>When you get on the four oh five and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to San Diego and it takes you six</v>

1197
00:50:20.801 --> 00:50:23.770
<v Speaker 1>hours and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

1198
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Like what have we done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This massive humans.</v>

1199
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many of us.</v>

1200
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.610
<v Speaker 1>But when you get here and you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh you,</v>

1201
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't have any weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

1202
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could also,</v>

1203
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go 30 miles outside the city and have</v>

1204
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 1>that same either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't ya?</v>

1205
00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:40.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>

1206
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1207
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't get the same Taco stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1208
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1209
00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love cities,</v>

1210
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:47.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I miss it.</v>

1211
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I miss living in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do to you.</v>

1212
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't trade it at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1213
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I was younger and single in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>

1214
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 1>had a fun time and moved to Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a family now it's kind of perfect</v>

1215
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.880
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

1216
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 1>where I'm at in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really need anything else.</v>

1217
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the balance,</v>

1218
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:07.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there is no really perfect</v>

1219
00:51:07.821 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's places that are</v>

1220
00:51:10.521 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Speaker 1>perfect for certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a comedian,</v>

1221
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles is the best place to either</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles or New York.</v>

1222
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I prefer Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of clubs,</v>

1223
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most of the best comedians in the</v>

1224
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 1>world live here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great place for us to network and</v>

1225
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:27.710
<v Speaker 1>we work together and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

1226
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be in that business is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the best place in the world to</v>

1227
00:51:31.491 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the reasons it keeps me</v>

1228
00:51:33.111 --> 00:51:35.750
<v Speaker 1>around here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the podcast and all that jazz.</v>

1229
00:51:35.751 --> 00:51:39.740
<v Speaker 1>But for peace of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best place.</v>

1230
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.260
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that actually fuck with you?</v>

1231
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.153
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1232
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers of humans is just,</v>

1233
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:48.770
<v Speaker 1>it's untenable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're close to North Korea.</v>

1234
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1235
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.040
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you know what man,</v>

1236
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:54.320
<v Speaker 1>if they nuke California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you going to go?</v>

1237
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole thing's going to be a</v>

1238
00:51:56.511 --> 00:51:57.344
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1239
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Might as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be better off if it lands on</v>

1240
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:00.434
<v Speaker 1>your head.</v>

1241
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:06.680
<v Speaker 1>That's why we say about asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't want to be that guy in</v>

1242
00:52:06.681 --> 00:52:11.681
<v Speaker 1>the movie that like is like storing food</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his basement and staying up all night</v>

1243
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:15.710
<v Speaker 1>to shoot vandals and because people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to steal your canned goods.</v>

1244
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't sound fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like a healthy life.</v>

1245
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to live like that.</v>

1246
00:52:19.611 --> 00:52:21.380
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You die of old age.</v>

1247
00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Die Of old age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protecting your canned goods.</v>

1248
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fight or flight your entire life.</v>

1249
00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

1250
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And then just let that rock land right</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your fucking head.</v>

1251
00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I used to stress out a lot about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the perfect place to live was I just</v>

1252
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 1>gave that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>

1253
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1254
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.120
<v Speaker 1>there's places you don't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught dead like Florida.</v>

1255
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I liked Florida.</v>

1261
00:52:52.731 --> 00:52:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good place.</v>

1262
00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.960
<v Speaker 1>You just want to drink and take naps or</v>

<v Speaker 1>Would their oxycontin regulations know</v>

1268
00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.590
<v Speaker 1>one time there were more oxycontin</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescriptions in Florida than they were</v>

1269
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:15.380
<v Speaker 1>the entire country combined?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1274
00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 1>there was a documentary that I called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Oxycontin express that was on</v>

1275
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:27.830
<v Speaker 1>vanguard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1276
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:28.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1277
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:30.800
<v Speaker 1>these people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1278
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:34.770
<v Speaker 1>went down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went undercover and uh,</v>

1279
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 1>saw how easy it is to buy opiates down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1280
00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:40.290
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these one stop shops,</v>

1281
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:43.410
<v Speaker 1>they have these pain management centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd go in and he'd say,</v>

1282
00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Hey doc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my back is killing me.</v>

1283
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Doc said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need pills.</v>

1284
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Go right next door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he'd write your prescription,</v>

1285
00:53:48.631 --> 00:53:50.850
<v Speaker 1>you go right next door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the pills and then boom,</v>

1286
00:53:50.851 --> 00:53:53.460
<v Speaker 1>you're off to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't have a database,</v>

1287
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.570
<v Speaker 1>which meant that you could go to Dr</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and say,</v>

1288
00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my back's killing me.</v>

1289
00:53:58.021 --> 00:54:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jamie gives you a prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You buy some opium pills or whatever the</v>

1290
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:04.050
<v Speaker 1>fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you come to me and he'd go,</v>

1291
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my back is killing me.</v>

1292
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:06.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1293
00:54:06.301 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you see where this just being sourced</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then so sold elsewhere or did</v>

1294
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:14.751
<v Speaker 1>we purposely made the regulations lax</v>
<v Speaker 1>there so they can make more money.</v>

1295
00:54:15.031 --> 00:54:18.960
<v Speaker 1>So people were buying them and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing them and selling them and</v>

1296
00:54:18.961 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky and up to Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1297
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.580
<v Speaker 1>that's why they call it the Oxycontin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Express,</v>

1298
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:27.360
<v Speaker 1>the highway that led from Florida to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the country.</v>

1299
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It sounds evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:31.800
<v Speaker 1>It was sick and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people lost their lives and a</v>

1301
00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:34.860
<v Speaker 1>lot of people lost like who they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the addiction.</v>

1302
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.240
<v Speaker 1>The numbers were insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Google the numbers.</v>

1304
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the numbers of oxy cottons or</v>

1305
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 1>oxycodone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't know what the differences,</v>

1306
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:48.160
<v Speaker 1>and you've seen the reports lately</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that the uh,</v>

1307
00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:53.130
<v Speaker 1>the life expectancy or the early death</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate of middle age white men</v>

1308
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.160
<v Speaker 1>specifically lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has dropped for the first time in,</v>

1309
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens or cause of pain pills.</v>

1310
00:54:58.650 --> 00:54:59.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1311
00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:02.340
<v Speaker 1>part of it and calling them deaths of</v>
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>

1312
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they're being Jesus written about is</v>

1313
00:55:05.461 --> 00:55:07.170
<v Speaker 1>literally deaths of despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1314
00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:08.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1315
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1316
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 1>it's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real heavy.</v>

1317
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been a spate of articles over the</v>

1318
00:55:13.681 --> 00:55:17.740
<v Speaker 1>last three or four months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that's really diving into it.</v>

1319
00:55:17.741 --> 00:55:18.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's men.</v>

1320
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctors in Florida prescribed 10 times</v>

1321
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:26.280
<v Speaker 1>more oxycodone pills then every other</v>
<v Speaker 1>state in the country combined.</v>

1322
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is now,</v>

1323
00:55:30.241 --> 00:55:31.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What ends this article from,</v>

1324
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:34.740
<v Speaker 1>this was actually from 2011 on NPR when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1325
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 1>probably when it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1326
00:55:36.151 --> 00:55:39.300
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get the updated one.</v>

1327
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

1328
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy place.</v>

1329
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's just put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despairs one of the scariest words,</v>

1330
00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you hear about someone like despair</v>

1331
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:52.320
<v Speaker 1>and lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are two like really?</v>

1332
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:54.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's the other word that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>using is,</v>

1333
00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:59.530
<v Speaker 1>is his loneliness has been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now measuring it and loneliness is,</v>

1334
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:04.910
<v Speaker 1>is as or worse of a health issue in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country than smoking heavily smoking</v>

1335
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.140
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all this,</v>

1336
00:56:07.141 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 1>there's this new only misses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loneliness isn't overpopulation</v>

1337
00:56:11.371 --> 00:56:16.170
<v Speaker 1>coincided with lowliness the same time</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thrust further and further closer</v>

1338
00:56:16.171 --> 00:56:21.171
<v Speaker 1>together and we don't know each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're more and more disconnected and</v>

1339
00:56:21.401 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 1>lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's literally,</v>

1340
00:56:22.771 --> 00:56:24.090
<v Speaker 1>so there's a whole new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1341
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 4>I dunno how new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's called interpersonal</v>

1342
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 4>neurobiology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the science of our brain</v>

1343
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:33.370
<v Speaker 4>wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And physiological wiring on how we're,</v>

1344
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1345
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.440
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the articles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Loneliness might be a bigger health risk</v>

1346
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:40.510
<v Speaker 4>than smoking or obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1347
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 4>that's dark dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dark.</v>

1348
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>

1349
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 4>in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the experience I've had in my life,</v>

1350
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:49.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I read that I'm like of course Duh,</v>

1351
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense.</v>

1352
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are a disconnected people.</v>

1353
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 4>We are electronically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>digitally connected in a crazy way but</v>

1354
00:56:58.001 --> 00:57:02.410
<v Speaker 4>in a human way and it's killing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It literally is harming.</v>

1355
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are dying and it's crazy.</v>

1356
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:10.360
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating that like feelings have an</v>

1357
00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:13.040
<v Speaker 4>effect on your health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the feeling of loneliness to</v>

1358
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 4>feeling of despair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you could eat your</v>

1359
00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:17.230
<v Speaker 4>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get your exercise in and you,</v>

1360
00:57:17.231 --> 00:57:19.450
<v Speaker 4>if you feel despair and you feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>loneliness,</v>

1361
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 4>your body is actually like being harmed</v>
<v Speaker 4>by that.</v>

1362
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:26.530
<v Speaker 4>But there's a real like practical reason</v>
<v Speaker 4>for that and that's because we are,</v>

1363
00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:31.150
<v Speaker 4>when we come out as babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are the most dependent individuals.</v>

1364
00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 4>So like are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1365
00:57:32.891 --> 00:57:34.190
<v Speaker 4>Like on your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on your mother.</v>

1366
00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:38.050
<v Speaker 4>We are completely socially dependent</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we're born completely.</v>

1367
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1368
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.160
<v Speaker 4>April Maslov's hierarchy of needs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever heard of that?</v>

1369
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:43.780
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1370
00:57:43.781 --> 00:57:45.910
<v Speaker 4>to be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to take care of breathing and</v>

1371
00:57:45.911 --> 00:57:48.310
<v Speaker 4>water and your basic functions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>

1372
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:52.750
<v Speaker 4>there's been studies recently by these</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurobiologists that are showing that</v>

1373
00:57:52.751 --> 00:57:57.751
<v Speaker 4>these social needs are just as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or even like come before some of these</v>

1374
00:57:58.511 --> 00:57:59.301
<v Speaker 4>physical needs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1375
00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:00.134
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1376
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.410
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's literally,</v>

1377
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.500
<v Speaker 4>there's a book called social by a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>named Matthew Lieberman.</v>

1378
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:10.060
<v Speaker 4>Like you gotta check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what they are finding is that</v>

1379
00:58:10.061 --> 00:58:11.700
<v Speaker 4>there's like two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1380
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.500
<v Speaker 4>parts of our operating brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

1381
00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be me paring it down,</v>

1382
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:20.890
<v Speaker 4>but one is the analytical thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deciding thing.</v>

1383
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:23.410
<v Speaker 4>And the other is this social awareness</v>
<v Speaker 4>sprain,</v>

1384
00:58:23.411 --> 00:58:28.411
<v Speaker 4>which is always like always checking in</v>
<v Speaker 4>on how am I in relation to others.</v>

1385
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:31.060
<v Speaker 4>And it's also the part of their brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>that actually we can,</v>

1386
00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the metacognitive part and the part</v>

1387
00:58:33.341 --> 00:58:35.350
<v Speaker 4>that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they call it mind reading,</v>

1388
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:37.840
<v Speaker 4>but really it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just by US sitting here,</v>

1389
00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:41.020
<v Speaker 4>I can kind of get a sense of how you</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel and what you're thinking right.</v>

1390
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:44.110
<v Speaker 4>Just by the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the connection that we have and just,</v>

1391
00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.920
<v Speaker 4>it's part of who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when our analytical brain is offline,</v>

1392
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:50.590
<v Speaker 4>this other one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the social one pops on immediately.</v>

1393
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:54.400
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what they're theorizing is that that</v>

1394
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:59.401
<v Speaker 4>is like the fundamental need for humans</v>
<v Speaker 4>in safety and survival is how are we</v>

1395
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:03.370
<v Speaker 4>relating to each other as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a group.</v>

1396
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.820
<v Speaker 4>But it makes sense if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean to me it makes sense in,</v>

1397
00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:08.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1398
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:09.310
<v Speaker 4>we are social animals.</v>

1399
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 4>We forget that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you look at other species of monkeys</v>

1400
00:59:13.001 --> 00:59:15.820
<v Speaker 4>or wolves or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1401
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:19.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there might be a period of time where</v>

1402
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:19.721
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1403
00:59:19.721 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 4>a wolf will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get kicked of a pack for a while</v>

1404
00:59:22.011 --> 00:59:24.530
<v Speaker 4>and he'll go do his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but eventually come back to a pack.</v>

1405
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 4>It's not safe for us as humans and</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals,</v>

1406
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 4>social animals like these to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>isolated.</v>

1407
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:32.360
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1408
00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.720
<v Speaker 4>and so there's all these parts of us</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just,</v>

1409
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.790
<v Speaker 4>if we're not connected to other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

1410
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 4>in a very direct and true way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's these sort of a deep down</v>

1411
00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:45.590
<v Speaker 4>emotional and physiological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1412
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.450
<v Speaker 4>fears that come up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1413
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're the real,</v>

1414
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.900
<v Speaker 4>and that's what the neurobiology is</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing,</v>

1415
00:59:50.901 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Speaker 4>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when we can just think about that,</v>

1416
00:59:53.481 --> 00:59:57.080
<v Speaker 4>but they're actually showing it now that</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're not really connected to each</v>

1417
00:59:57.081 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be freaked out.</v>

1418
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.470
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1419
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:02.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1420
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:06.710
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that this really drives</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the internal struggle we have.</v>

1421
01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.680
<v Speaker 4>And we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is part of,</v>

1422
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting into it,</v>

1423
01:00:09.541 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 4>but that's part of my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm trying to bring into the world</v>

1424
01:00:12.201 --> 01:00:14.300
<v Speaker 4>and my platform now is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just to,</v>

1425
01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up and say,</v>

1426
01:00:16.731 --> 01:00:19.100
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need each other and we can do it.</v>

1427
01:00:19.101 --> 01:00:21.830
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for guys pitch specifically,</v>

1428
01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:24.860
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a social stigma of ours to not</v>

1429
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:28.310
<v Speaker 4>be real or open or connected or</v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable with guys.</v>

1430
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1431
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool to see the science coming out</v>

1432
01:00:33.061 --> 01:00:35.630
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have all this anecdotal evidence of</v>

1433
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:38.600
<v Speaker 4>being out the woods in the woods with</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids or being in a,</v>

1434
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.750
<v Speaker 4>in a management with guys are running a</v>
<v Speaker 4>retreat or whatever this is of how</v>

1435
01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:46.751
<v Speaker 4>powerful it is to like set down all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>our differences and just be there with</v>

1436
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.110
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1437
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:51.170
<v Speaker 4>But now the science is really lighten it</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and yeah,</v>

1438
01:00:51.171 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loneliest.</v>

1439
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean we can all think about a</v>
<v Speaker 4>loneliness isn't fun.</v>

1440
01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.300
<v Speaker 4>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't feel good.</v>

1441
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:59.690
<v Speaker 4>But the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy too that they're showing</v>

1442
01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:03.860
<v Speaker 4>that emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lights up the same centers of our</v>

1443
01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:05.630
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's physical pain.</v>

1444
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:08.800
<v Speaker 4>And that the one study showed that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1445
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.260
<v Speaker 4>an insult to someone had much more</v>
<v Speaker 4>painful and long term effects than</v>

1446
01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 4>slamming somebody with a hammer hitting</v>
<v Speaker 4>their hand with a hammer.</v>

1447
01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:22.810
<v Speaker 4>So like our emotional pain literally</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually exists in the body.</v>

1448
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:27.650
<v Speaker 4>Like it is actual pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason that it's so</v>

1449
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:30.440
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable to feel our emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which it is,</v>

1450
01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'll just say it is,</v>

1451
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.690
<v Speaker 4>is that it actually hurts like actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurts.</v>

1452
01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:38.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's like people say things like,</v>

1453
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:40.730
<v Speaker 4>you broke my heart or I'm dying of heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>ache or whatever,</v>

1454
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:44.810
<v Speaker 4>but the science is catching up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing us that this pain is actual,</v>

1455
01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:48.170
<v Speaker 4>it's real and we're not addressing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not even aware of it.</v>

1456
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.510
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's deep.</v>

1457
01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting too because what you're</v>

1458
01:01:53.551 --> 01:01:57.520
<v Speaker 2>saying about us being disconnected and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how unhealthy it is now on unhealthy</v>

1459
01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.320
<v Speaker 2>loneliness is it sort of confirms these</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that I've always had,</v>

1460
01:02:01.321 --> 01:02:06.321
<v Speaker 2>that the human race itself is not like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>group of individuals but a super</v>

1461
01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:09.660
<v Speaker 2>organism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much like the human body is like the</v>

1462
01:02:09.661 --> 01:02:12.810
<v Speaker 2>human body like requires all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria in your gut,</v>

1463
01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:16.470
<v Speaker 2>all the skin flora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different things that compose</v>

1464
01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:18.840
<v Speaker 2>the actual physical structure of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>human body.</v>

1465
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Whereas we think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some nutty number of how</v>

1466
01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:26.910
<v Speaker 2>much bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many bacteria cells are in your body</v>

1467
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 2>versus how many human cells and is he</v>
<v Speaker 2>far out numbers,</v>

1468
01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 2>the human cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just that we think of ourselves</v>

1469
01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 2>as I'm mike and I put my shoes on and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to work cause I am Mike and,</v>

1470
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 2>but Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a system,</v>

1471
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.930
<v Speaker 2>you're a system of individual organisms</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are collectively keeping this whole</v>

1472
01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>thing alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the imbalances off,</v>

1473
01:02:48.421 --> 01:02:52.590
<v Speaker 2>like when someone takes an antibiotic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it fucks up their gut flora,</v>

1474
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.800
<v Speaker 2>like literally you've like nuked a part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your civilization and you know to try</v>

1475
01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:01.290
<v Speaker 2>to save something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had some sort of a surgery</v>

1476
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:04.470
<v Speaker 2>and you're worried about an infection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of like an invading army</v>

1477
01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:08.040
<v Speaker 2>coming in and taking over part of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg that you have it operated on.</v>

1478
01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or It'd be like slashing the tires of</v>

1479
01:03:09.851 --> 01:03:11.710
<v Speaker 4>all of our transport system in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

1480
01:03:11.711 --> 01:03:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how it got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the first things in an in</v>

1481
01:03:14.171 --> 01:03:14.700
<v Speaker 4>and out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1482
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even has an impact on your,</v>

1483
01:03:16.921 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 2>your health mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1484
01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:22.590
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like how you feel and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

1485
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.780
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that has connected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>led,</v>

1486
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.840
<v Speaker 2>legitimately connected to your diet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that affects your gut flora and it</v>

1487
01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:34.950
<v Speaker 2>affects the way your body produces</v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonin and dopamine and it's bananas,</v>

1488
01:03:34.951 --> 01:03:35.730
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1489
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:36.331
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1490
01:03:36.331 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Is Scientists Bust the myth that our</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies have more bacteria than human</v>

1491
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:44.100
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decades old assumption about Microbiota</v>

1492
01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:45.120
<v Speaker 2>revisited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1493
01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>What's the new new data one instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1494
01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 2>so it's why you are as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1495
01:03:51.451 --> 01:03:55.260
<v Speaker 2>so they used to say it was 10 to one but</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's one to one.</v>

1496
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1497
01:03:56.731 --> 01:03:57.960
<v Speaker 2>That's still crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1498
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.040
<v Speaker 2>It's still like you're half bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1499
01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I like that analogy though of the body</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like a civilization or what it means</v>

1500
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.090
<v Speaker 4>to think about if you're one of your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

1501
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:12.020
<v Speaker 4>one important neuron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one cell neural cell or something</v>

1502
01:04:12.021 --> 01:04:14.750
<v Speaker 4>decided just to go rogue and not be in</v>
<v Speaker 4>connection with the rest of you.</v>

1503
01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1504
01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wouldn't work so well.</v>

1505
01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:18.621
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1506
01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:20.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body would probably get rid of it</v>

1507
01:04:20.901 --> 01:04:25.901
<v Speaker 4>and get it out of there or I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe so I'm just really reaching here,</v>

1508
01:04:26.511 --> 01:04:29.240
<v Speaker 4>but it's some sort of rogue cell at that</v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

1509
01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:31.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like cancerous cell or something and it</v>

1510
01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.130
<v Speaker 4>would probably be attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1511
01:04:34.131 --> 01:04:37.010
<v Speaker 4>if I think that if you'd take that</v>
<v Speaker 4>analogy,</v>

1512
01:04:37.011 --> 01:04:39.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our civilization here is we're hurting,</v>

1513
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.140
<v Speaker 4>really hurting because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're really not,</v>

1514
01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are working together obviously in</v>

1515
01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.940
<v Speaker 4>practical ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times,</v>

1516
01:04:46.941 --> 01:04:48.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work in commerce and you know,</v>

1517
01:04:48.771 --> 01:04:52.310
<v Speaker 4>the world is functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think on a like a health and</v>

1518
01:04:52.311 --> 01:04:53.780
<v Speaker 4>fulfillment level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1519
01:04:53.781 --> 01:04:56.050
<v Speaker 4>we're missing something pretty deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1520
01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Well also like</v>

1521
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.050
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnected from actual humans but</v>

1522
01:05:02.051 --> 01:05:04.250
<v Speaker 2>connect them the cyber way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people are like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>lonely in terms of like physical touch</v>

1524
01:05:08.231 --> 01:05:11.680
<v Speaker 2>and communication with friends and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they sit in front of their computer</v>

1525
01:05:11.681 --> 01:05:13.810
<v Speaker 2>all day and they interact with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>

1526
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:17.380
<v Speaker 2>which shows you like some of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy communities you'll ever</v>

1527
01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:22.381
<v Speaker 2>encounter are like online message boards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forums where people are just the</v>

1528
01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>anonymous and interacting with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>without what we were talking about</v>

1529
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the reasons why I like to do</v>

1530
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>podcasts with a person in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only done one podcast ever through</v>

1531
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:33.500
<v Speaker 2>skype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1532
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.530
<v Speaker 2>and that was with John Anthony West</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he was living in New York and he's</v>

1533
01:05:37.531 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 2>just this really important egyptologist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really wanted to talk to him as</v>

1534
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.370
<v Speaker 2>the only way I could get them to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was to do it through skype.</v>

1535
01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 2>So I did one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I prefer to sit there with people</v>

1536
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.350
<v Speaker 2>because I want to look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel their energy.</v>

1537
01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you and I doing this</v>

1538
01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to understand each other.</v>

1539
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:52.331
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1540
01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:52.991
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1541
01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:55.150
<v Speaker 4>and I think I can hear it in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast too.</v>

1542
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1543
01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

1544
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to keep hitting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>biology part,</v>

1545
01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:01.840
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

1546
01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:06.670
<v Speaker 4>I think that it means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can sense that there's something else</v>

1547
01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.050
<v Speaker 4>in me is getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is triggered,</v>

1548
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we were just talking on the phone,</v>

1549
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:13.480
<v Speaker 4>there is something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's might be this other part of</v>

1550
01:06:13.481 --> 01:06:14.980
<v Speaker 4>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's lit up right now.</v>

1551
01:06:14.981 --> 01:06:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I can,</v>

1552
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 4>I can spatially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1553
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:20.110
<v Speaker 4>so you can feel where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can,</v>

1554
01:06:20.111 --> 01:06:23.640
<v Speaker 4>we can have social content,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that,</v>

1555
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 4>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1556
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.530
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's set sense of connection.</v>

1557
01:06:26.531 --> 01:06:27.930
<v Speaker 4>It's that real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1558
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:30.340
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that is,</v>

1559
01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:32.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really apparent in your podcast is that</v>

1560
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1561
01:06:33.551 --> 01:06:36.580
<v Speaker 4>you sit here and you really connect to</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody and just run with it.</v>

1562
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.160
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big,</v>

1563
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1564
01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:41.471
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1565
01:06:41.471 --> 01:06:44.140
<v Speaker 4>I think of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1566
01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:49.600
<v Speaker 4>so part of what I do is I help</v>
<v Speaker 4>proliferate this idea of men's groups</v>

1567
01:06:49.601 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 4>across the country where guys get</v>
<v Speaker 4>together for exactly what we're talking</v>

1568
01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:54.460
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

1569
01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:55.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1570
01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 4>the intent of them is to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1571
01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.810
<v Speaker 4>get together to challenge and support</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other's growth or personal growth,</v>

1572
01:07:01.811 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just a simple sort of protocol</v>

1573
01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:06.970
<v Speaker 4>and a simple sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1574
01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>design or are sort of,</v>

1575
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.810
<v Speaker 4>there's a structure to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the whole point is it's remedial in</v>

1576
01:07:13.811 --> 01:07:14.740
<v Speaker 4>a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that,</v>

1577
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our culture in general,</v>

1578
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 4>but guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in our culture,</v>

1579
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:23.521
<v Speaker 4>don't have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this on fettered place to really show up</v>

1580
01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:29.020
<v Speaker 4>and actually connect with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a scary thing.</v>

1581
01:07:29.021 --> 01:07:29.411
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1582
01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:30.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1583
01:07:30.491 --> 01:07:31.300
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1584
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's until now and still now,</v>

1585
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:37.810
<v Speaker 4>but hopefully not too long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like that stigma of not being</v>

1586
01:07:37.811 --> 01:07:39.660
<v Speaker 4>connected is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1587
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:40.920
<v Speaker 4>it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1588
01:07:40.921 --> 01:07:44.500
<v Speaker 4>and I think that back to the cyber thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're saying like we can,</v>

1589
01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.620
<v Speaker 4>we can get that hit of Serotonin by</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting a,</v>

1590
01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:49.330
<v Speaker 4>like on facebook or instagram or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1591
01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 4>We can get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that pain,</v>

1592
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to make a comparison</v>

1593
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:57.610
<v Speaker 4>toward actually sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting down with somebody and actually</v>

1594
01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:01.720
<v Speaker 4>feeling and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and experiencing them.</v>

1595
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1596
01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:04.660
<v Speaker 4>you can't make a comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1597
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.060
<v Speaker 4>it's not okay to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1598
01:08:07.061 --> 01:08:08.770
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just something different.</v>

1599
01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a tricky position because I rely</v>
<v Speaker 2>on social media to let people know that</v>

1600
01:08:13.061 --> 01:08:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I have a podcast coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1601
01:08:15.051 --> 01:08:16.490
<v Speaker 2>like right before the podcast I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1602
01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:18.010
<v Speaker 2>what's your twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can tweet it.</v>

1603
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:22.370
<v Speaker 2>And then I also like to promote comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>dates and to let people know about cool</v>

1604
01:08:22.371 --> 01:08:25.110
<v Speaker 2>shit that I find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1605
01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.920
<v Speaker 2>the interaction is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird.</v>

1606
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Like especially there's like a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of interactions.</v>

1607
01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:35.891
<v Speaker 2>Like instagram is one of the weird ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the Qantas people all have</v>

1608
01:08:36.351 --> 01:08:39.170
<v Speaker 2>blocked pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're blocking,</v>

1609
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:42.710
<v Speaker 2>don't look at me and they just say nasty</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit to people.</v>

1610
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 2>But they have these block pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1611
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.410
<v Speaker 2>but I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny how that seems to be like</v>

1612
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.500
<v Speaker 2>it's so common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes sense.</v>

1613
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:55.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're blocked off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're attacking people in Saint Shitty</v>

1614
01:08:55.191 --> 01:08:55.430
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1615
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 2>To be blunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even talking about,</v>

1616
01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:58.550
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about like when I go to</v>

1617
01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.700
<v Speaker 2>someone else's page and I read</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] things,</v>

1618
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I always go to that I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see if that guy is blocked.</v>

1619
01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's blocked.</v>

1620
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.040
<v Speaker 2>How funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's super common.</v>

1621
01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:09.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like this weird thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing with each other.</v>

1622
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Speaker 2>What's not real interaction and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people that are perpetrating it</v>

1623
01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:18.530
<v Speaker 2>are extremely unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why they're saying such nasty,</v>

1624
01:09:18.531 --> 01:09:21.200
<v Speaker 2>vicious shit in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

1625
01:09:21.201 --> 01:09:22.820
<v Speaker 2>really odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're lonely.</v>

1626
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:23.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1627
01:09:23.841 --> 01:09:28.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean in some way or disconnected or</v>
<v Speaker 2>disenfranchised or they feel inferior</v>

1628
01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:32.450
<v Speaker 2>and so they lash out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want other people to feel the way</v>

1629
01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:33.284
<v Speaker 2>they feel.</v>

1630
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.520
<v Speaker 4>And so what I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I feel when you say that,</v>

1631
01:09:35.521 --> 01:09:38.560
<v Speaker 4>like one thing that's missing there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>empathy in that,</v>

1632
01:09:38.561 --> 01:09:40.720
<v Speaker 4>in that interact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever that interaction is.</v>

1633
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.620
<v Speaker 4>It's this removed story that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>making up some,</v>

1634
01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:47.350
<v Speaker 4>some like whatever you want the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1635
01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:51.520
<v Speaker 4>projecting your shit out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not actually slowing down enough</v>

1636
01:09:51.521 --> 01:09:52.840
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1637
01:09:52.841 --> 01:09:55.060
<v Speaker 4>you can sit here and give opinions or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever all day long.</v>

1638
01:09:55.061 --> 01:09:58.600
<v Speaker 4>But you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to what you said though,</v>

1639
01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.660
<v Speaker 4>it is a weird position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think the way that things are</v>

1640
01:10:01.661 --> 01:10:03.760
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we are using these tools,</v>

1641
01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:06.940
<v Speaker 4>social media to connect us and to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>messages out.</v>

1642
01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:08.800
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that the,</v>

1643
01:10:08.801 --> 01:10:12.580
<v Speaker 4>like the millennial generation is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that what they value and what they</v>

1644
01:10:12.581 --> 01:10:14.860
<v Speaker 4>want to spend their money on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's meaningful experiences,</v>

1645
01:10:14.861 --> 01:10:16.390
<v Speaker 4>which means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1646
01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.660
<v Speaker 4>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alive in person event.</v>

1647
01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.910
<v Speaker 4>And I think there is a wave of things</v>
<v Speaker 4>going back to this.</v>

1648
01:10:21.911 --> 01:10:23.230
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1649
01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:26.440
<v Speaker 4>as a tool we need that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is amazing.</v>

1650
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this platform,</v>

1651
01:10:27.761 --> 01:10:30.400
<v Speaker 4>this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have the touching so many people or</v>

1652
01:10:30.401 --> 01:10:31.540
<v Speaker 4>just twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

1653
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:36.970
<v Speaker 4>But then it can be used for incredible</v>
<v Speaker 4>good to bring two people together I</v>

1654
01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:37.481
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1655
01:10:37.481 --> 01:10:41.800
<v Speaker 4>and then so what's missing in that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In that social media interaction.</v>

1656
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.970
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1657
01:10:42.971 --> 01:10:44.230
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it balances out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it doesn't,</v>

1658
01:10:44.231 --> 01:10:46.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a message in a bottle,</v>

1659
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:48.370
<v Speaker 4>he just got to make sure it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>message.</v>

1660
01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:49.570
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to,</v>

1661
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.990
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to like be cognizantly aware</v>

1662
01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I think of how other people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>receive it without actually getting that</v>

1663
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:59.670
<v Speaker 2>perception back from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1664
01:10:59.671 --> 01:11:01.480
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where it gets real weird and</v>

1665
01:11:01.481 --> 01:11:05.050
<v Speaker 2>you have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think apply the same principle</v>

1666
01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.810
<v Speaker 4>goals that you would in communicating</v>
<v Speaker 4>with other people,</v>

1667
01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.280
<v Speaker 4>like without actually communicating</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

1668
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:14.030
<v Speaker 4>without seeing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without getting the social that look in</v>

1669
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.940
<v Speaker 2>them in the eye and</v>

1670
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:16.820
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where a weird thing,</v>

1671
01:11:16.821 --> 01:11:18.950
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this might not make sense,</v>

1672
01:11:18.951 --> 01:11:21.980
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to bring it back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>connect to the wilderness stuff.</v>

1673
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.910
<v Speaker 4>What we're talking about in this sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this sort of isolation and loneliness</v>

1674
01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:30.911
<v Speaker 4>that we have and for me in my life where</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned to connect with others,</v>

1675
01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:34.130
<v Speaker 4>where I really learned to sort of give</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up,</v>

1676
01:11:34.131 --> 01:11:37.040
<v Speaker 4>let go be present with people was in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wilderness.</v>

1677
01:11:37.041 --> 01:11:40.040
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was doing that job out in the desert</v>

1678
01:11:40.041 --> 01:11:45.041
<v Speaker 4>with kids out there for eight to 20 days</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a time with these kids were,</v>

1679
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:50.810
<v Speaker 4>that was my job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was my job to simply be with them and</v>

1680
01:11:50.811 --> 01:11:52.260
<v Speaker 4>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1681
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:54.200
<v Speaker 4>to be with them in a way that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1682
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:58.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously we had a lot of boundaries and</v>

1683
01:11:58.011 --> 01:12:00.050
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to be really real,</v>

1684
01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.890
<v Speaker 4>just to be totally real and honest and</v>
<v Speaker 4>straight forward call bullshit when we</v>

1685
01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:06.650
<v Speaker 4>saw bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be empathetic and it was just like this</v>

1686
01:12:06.651 --> 01:12:09.290
<v Speaker 4>crazy crash course in human connection.</v>

1687
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:11.870
<v Speaker 4>And I happened to be out in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wilderness,</v>

1688
01:12:11.871 --> 01:12:15.770
<v Speaker 4>but so what I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1689
01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:20.330
<v Speaker 4>it'll tie it together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for me I started to feel way,</v>

1690
01:12:20.331 --> 01:12:23.000
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way more human being out there in the</v>

1691
01:12:23.001 --> 01:12:24.600
<v Speaker 4>wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just being out there.</v>

1692
01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:27.050
<v Speaker 4>What was quiet being out there where</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1693
01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I sat on a rock,</v>

1694
01:12:29.271 --> 01:12:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I was sitting on a rock in the sun was</v>
<v Speaker 4>on me and all of my senses were engaged,</v>

1695
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:35.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very aware of my body.</v>

1696
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.390
<v Speaker 4>We were in these groups where we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>being practicing,</v>

1697
01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:41.750
<v Speaker 4>being very aware of what we felt and</v>
<v Speaker 4>being able to feel and express that.</v>

1698
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.540
<v Speaker 4>And it just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1699
01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:46.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since then for me,</v>

1700
01:12:46.341 --> 01:12:48.500
<v Speaker 4>it all comes back to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to being out in the wilderness.</v>

1701
01:12:48.501 --> 01:12:50.510
<v Speaker 4>But since then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the other things I've engaged in</v>

1702
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:53.120
<v Speaker 4>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the men's group stuff,</v>

1703
01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.120
<v Speaker 4>all the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even psychedelics,</v>

1704
01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:56.630
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

1705
01:12:56.630 --> 01:13:00.770
<v Speaker 4>All the things that I've experienced all</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me tie back to that thing and it,</v>

1706
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:06.910
<v Speaker 4>it comes down to what I feel is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>being totally as much as you can truly</v>

1707
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.050
<v Speaker 4>present.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1708
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:11.320
<v Speaker 4>Like just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just here right now.</v>

1709
01:13:11.321 --> 01:13:13.580
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can write a twitter message from</v>

1710
01:13:13.581 --> 01:13:15.260
<v Speaker 4>that place of being present.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1711
01:13:15.261 --> 01:13:16.390
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

1712
01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.710
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing necessarily wrong or bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that,</v>

1713
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.070
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't check the responses every</v>

1714
01:13:22.071 --> 01:13:25.610
<v Speaker 4>three minutes for the next six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a fucking maniac.</v>

1715
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1716
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:28.490
<v Speaker 4>it's a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>

1717
01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:31.130
<v Speaker 4>rationing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rationing some of the,</v>

1718
01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 2>some of that social media stuff are</v>
<v Speaker 2>rationing some of that online</v>

1719
01:13:35.751 --> 01:13:40.070
<v Speaker 2>interaction with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like as time has gone on,</v>

1720
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten much more of my online</v>

1721
01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.040
<v Speaker 2>interaction in like an educational forum</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like interesting articles,</v>

1722
01:13:48.851 --> 01:13:50.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Science things,</v>

1723
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:55.250
<v Speaker 2>things that don't involve like a social</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction or opinion as much as they</v>

1724
01:13:55.251 --> 01:13:57.370
<v Speaker 2>involve really fascinating facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1725
01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.513
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1726
01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.440
<v Speaker 2>something that I've found today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that North America might have</v>

1727
01:14:03.441 --> 01:14:07.190
<v Speaker 2>been settled by humans as much as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred thousand years earlier than they</v>

1728
01:14:07.191 --> 01:14:08.090
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>

1729
01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:09.230
<v Speaker 2>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

1730
01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that</v>

1731
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.200
<v Speaker 1>kind of Shit freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that kind of stuff because that</v>

1732
01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.600
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff is just pure curiosity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure wonder.</v>

1733
01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And the imagination goes wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about what it must've been like</v>

1734
01:14:24.611 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>to be one of these early humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>surviving are trying to survive.</v>

1735
01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:31.060
<v Speaker 1>And if they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be here.</v>

1736
01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1737
01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:34.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mastodon fossils,</v>

1738
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:37.210
<v Speaker 1>they found them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bones were shattered and there's</v>

1739
01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:41.380
<v Speaker 1>rocks nearby that do not seem like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were broad anywhere.</v>

1740
01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:46.180
<v Speaker 1>So it was 1992 they were doing highway</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction near San Diego and they</v>

1741
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 1>found these odd looking bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they started doing these,</v>

1742
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:50.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1743
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:52.240
<v Speaker 1>studies on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they found that their mastodon</v>

1744
01:14:52.241 --> 01:14:56.530
<v Speaker 1>bones and they didn't have the ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do carbon testing and get a real</v>

1745
01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:59.380
<v Speaker 1>accurate assessment back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they do.</v>

1746
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And so now when they're checking these</v>
<v Speaker 1>bones and the way these bones had been</v>

1747
01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:07.360
<v Speaker 1>shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty sure that they had been</v>

1748
01:15:07.361 --> 01:15:09.610
<v Speaker 1>shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposely like to get to the marrow.</v>

1749
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.231
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1751
01:15:11.231 --> 01:15:13.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a great example of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a positive benefit.</v>

1752
01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1753
01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meditated for about 80 minutes or so,</v>

1754
01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:19.894
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1755
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I sat up afterwards and I clicked on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and open facebook.</v>

1756
01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing I clicked on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say with a video of a woman in</v>

1757
01:15:27.341 --> 01:15:30.950
<v Speaker 1>slow motion who stuck her ass out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>window of a bus and just shat the</v>

1758
01:15:30.951 --> 01:15:31.784
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

1759
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:35.320
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1760
01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I had to laugh to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1761
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I was just like in the zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1762
01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I was in this beautiful place and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll open once I says,</v>

1763
01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.210
<v Speaker 1>oh my God reminded me of Calvin's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke that shitting out of the car at 80</v>

1764
01:15:46.211 --> 01:15:48.190
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that youtube video.</v>

1765
01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1766
01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely seen too many of those</v>

1767
01:15:51.131 --> 01:15:53.260
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen too many videos of people</v>

1768
01:15:53.261 --> 01:15:56.830
<v Speaker 1>getting beat up too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many videos of street fights.</v>

1769
01:15:56.831 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Too many videos of people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>skateboard accidents where they fucking</v>

1770
01:16:00.911 --> 01:16:03.550
<v Speaker 1>flip and fall on their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to not watch that though.</v>

1771
01:16:03.551 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1772
01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very hard.</v>

1773
01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>

1774
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's something to be</v>

1775
01:16:12.011 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Speaker 1>learned in those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I almost want to show my kids,</v>

1776
01:16:14.591 --> 01:16:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't try to do flips if you don't know</v>

1777
01:16:16.961 --> 01:16:17.410
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

1778
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta in your fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1779
01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the consequences and</v>

1780
01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:25.150
<v Speaker 1>having someone else do it so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from them.</v>

1781
01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:26.770
<v Speaker 1>They've already done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here learn,</v>

1782
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:29.170
<v Speaker 1>this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why you don't fuck with a tiger.</v>

1783
01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:30.131
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1784
01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:31.510
<v Speaker 1>the guy got killed by the tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1785
01:16:31.511 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why you don't do,</v>

1786
01:16:32.981 --> 01:16:36.700
<v Speaker 1>this is why you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's gotta be some educational</v>

1787
01:16:36.701 --> 01:16:38.290
<v Speaker 1>value in those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1788
01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:41.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's all I can reach a little</v>

1789
01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:42.880
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1790
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have some pretty strong instincts in</v>

1791
01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:49.750
<v Speaker 1>us to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck with the dumb kids,</v>

1792
01:16:49.751 --> 01:16:50.584
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1793
01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:55.210
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like dumb kids are there as</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational tools for the survivors.</v>

1794
01:16:55.810 --> 01:17:00.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're supposed to see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one kid poke the tiger and get mauled.</v>

1795
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.120
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1796
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he actually broke into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the zoo and now bobby's gone.</v>

1797
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:05.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bobby,</v>

1798
01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:08.950
<v Speaker 1>like I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Joseph Campbell a story.</v>

1799
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>The hero that it</v>

1800
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.790
<v Speaker 4>goes all the way back to the one person</v>
<v Speaker 4>who sacrificed their life.</v>

1801
01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And got killed by the Predator in front</v>

1802
01:17:16.371 --> 01:17:20.040
<v Speaker 4>of the tribe and so that the tribe could</v>
<v Speaker 4>survive and then they,</v>

1803
01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:22.340
<v Speaker 4>they worshiped that person for doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1804
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:23.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1805
01:17:23.421 --> 01:17:24.740
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hero goes off,</v>

1806
01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.690
<v Speaker 4>learns some lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brings it back to the community and</v>

1807
01:17:26.691 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 4>everybody's better for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or You watch the hero get mauled,</v>

1808
01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 4>he's a martyr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you escape.</v>

1809
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.700
<v Speaker 4>All the hyenas are eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things we taught or we've</v>

1810
01:17:36.701 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 4>worked with kids out in the woods was</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we call the natural consequences,</v>

1811
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:40.990
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which,</v>

1812
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.950
<v Speaker 4>which just means that when you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1813
01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:46.370
<v Speaker 4>something else happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a natural reaction and it was</v>

1814
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:48.220
<v Speaker 4>used a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1815
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.850
<v Speaker 4>in opposition or instead of of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1816
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:54.110
<v Speaker 4>penalty system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1817
01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:57.500
<v Speaker 4>So if you do something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could,</v>

1818
01:17:57.650 --> 01:18:00.380
<v Speaker 4>we could lay this punishment on top of</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1819
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:02.650
<v Speaker 4>Like what kind of stuff I made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1820
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.190
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1821
01:18:04.191 --> 01:18:05.024
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1822
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:08.720
<v Speaker 4>if somebody was going to harm themselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>or somebody else,</v>

1823
01:18:08.721 --> 01:18:11.140
<v Speaker 4>you got target,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to you,</v>

1824
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.840
<v Speaker 4>we put out a tarp and your shoes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything will be taken away from you</v>

1825
01:18:14.841 --> 01:18:16.640
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you couldn't leave the tarp like</v>

1826
01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:18.350
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was where you had to stay because</v>

1827
01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.660
<v Speaker 4>you can hurt yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't hurt anybody else.</v>

1828
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1829
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:24.050
<v Speaker 4>so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1830
01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.690
<v Speaker 4>at some of that to do with their shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ate them.</v>

1831
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.110
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you put them in your tent or</v>

1832
01:18:30.111 --> 01:18:32.090
<v Speaker 4>under your tongue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they had this day,</v>

1833
01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:34.690
<v Speaker 4>like under a tarp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the idea or a,</v>

1834
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:36.040
<v Speaker 4>if it was raining it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1835
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean otherwise it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just basically a timeout.</v>

1836
01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you got to stay here.</v>

1837
01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 4>You can interact with the group.</v>

1838
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.400
<v Speaker 4>You're by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1839
01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.320
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's actually not the best example,</v>

1840
01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:48.440
<v Speaker 4>but I'll just use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you swore you could,</v>

1841
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:53.470
<v Speaker 4>some programs would maybe have a point</v>
<v Speaker 4>system you get penalized for clients.</v>

1842
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1843
01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean that wasn't named Sol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1844
01:18:58.731 --> 01:19:01.880
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't really upheld.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reaching for a good example here.</v>

1845
01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.090
<v Speaker 4>What I'm trying to say is that if you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>something Shitty,</v>

1846
01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.790
<v Speaker 4>generally you heard others around you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and things things happen.</v>

1847
01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:11.510
<v Speaker 4>And so what we tried to show is that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids would do something shitty to,</v>

1848
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:14.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay attention and that they would see</v>

1849
01:19:14.121 --> 01:19:16.430
<v Speaker 4>the harm they're creating themselves by</v>
<v Speaker 4>courier,</v>

1850
01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 4>by harming other people rather than just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1851
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:19.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1852
01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.350
<v Speaker 4>in society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just locking a kid up for breaking the</v>

1853
01:19:24.351 --> 01:19:25.650
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1854
01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:26.690
<v Speaker 4>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1855
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.050
<v Speaker 4>maybe if you break a window,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you in this other way,</v>

1856
01:19:30.051 --> 01:19:35.051
<v Speaker 4>you would go and actually see and</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience the,</v>

1857
01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.860
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shit that other people had to do to</v>

1858
01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:38.130
<v Speaker 4>fix the window and do all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1859
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:41.200
<v Speaker 4>more repairative type of justice system</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than like a,</v>

1860
01:19:41.201 --> 01:19:43.470
<v Speaker 4>a penalty punitive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punitive.</v>

1861
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:44.151
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you did take these kids,</v>

1863
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:50.750
<v Speaker 4>like what was like the most extreme</v>
<v Speaker 4>example of someone who's like really</v>

1864
01:19:50.751 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 4>disturbed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I would imagine there would be</v>

1865
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:54.630
<v Speaker 4>like a big sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1866
01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.460
<v Speaker 4>like there was a lot of variables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some people would be kind of fucked</v>

1867
01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:00.520
<v Speaker 4>up and some people would be really</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>

1868
01:20:00.521 --> 01:20:01.640
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1869
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:02.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1870
01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very few where I would say actually</v>

1871
01:20:05.571 --> 01:20:06.500
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

1872
01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:06.900
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1873
01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.730
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very few.</v>

1874
01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:09.330
<v Speaker 4>What were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the case with most of them?</v>

1875
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:14.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were kids in families and like</v>

1876
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 4>communities that didn't know how to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>space for and deal with them.</v>

1877
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:19.830
<v Speaker 4>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mentors,</v>

1878
01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:23.180
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have people to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't have parents that,</v>

1879
01:20:23.181 --> 01:20:25.500
<v Speaker 4>that gave them the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1880
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like being a kid is,</v>

1881
01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.340
<v Speaker 4>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to test boundaries,</v>

1882
01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:29.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1883
01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:33.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's the part of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>development in your ontogeny that it's</v>

1884
01:20:33.081 --> 01:20:37.080
<v Speaker 4>like you are defining your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you defining who you are and you need to</v>

1885
01:20:37.081 --> 01:20:39.360
<v Speaker 4>test the boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1886
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the kids made,</v>

1887
01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only two.</v>

1888
01:20:43.351 --> 01:20:45.840
<v Speaker 4>I probably worked with at least a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand,</v>

1889
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:49.270
<v Speaker 4>maybe more kids altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1890
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.970
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's a stretch a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1891
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.200
<v Speaker 4>For a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long time.</v>

1892
01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:57.201
<v Speaker 4>And only one I went to bed at night</v>
<v Speaker 4>worried I might get my head kicked in</v>

1893
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:59.160
<v Speaker 4>just one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one kid.</v>

1894
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.150
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe one or two other kids that I</v>

1895
01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:06.570
<v Speaker 4>walked away actually not enjoying being</v>
<v Speaker 4>around them.</v>

1896
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:11.960
<v Speaker 4>Almost every other single one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just like walked away as you do</v>

1897
01:21:12.271 --> 01:21:14.580
<v Speaker 4>about the one that you worried about</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting your head kicked in,</v>

1898
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kind of just kind of sat with it</v>

1899
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:22.500
<v Speaker 4>and there's really nothing easy did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just like initially or through</v>

1900
01:21:22.501 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 4>the entire experience that was through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing.</v>

1901
01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:25.740
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was through the whole thing that</v>

1902
01:21:25.741 --> 01:21:27.180
<v Speaker 4>was uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

1903
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:29.070
<v Speaker 4>What happened to him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1904
01:21:29.071 --> 01:21:30.000
<v Speaker 4>he's doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1905
01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:31.530
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1906
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:33.180
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's laws and there's things</v>

1907
01:21:33.181 --> 01:21:34.740
<v Speaker 4>you don't generally get to stay in</v>
<v Speaker 4>touch.</v>

1908
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.611
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1909
01:21:35.611 --> 01:21:36.820
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was actually at a,</v>

1910
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:38.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a state program.</v>

1911
01:21:38.701 --> 01:21:39.534
<v Speaker 4>So this was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1912
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:42.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in lieu of a jail sentence that came</v>

1913
01:21:42.451 --> 01:21:42.751
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1914
01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:45.630
<v Speaker 4>so this kid was locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1915
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:48.150
<v Speaker 4>What did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>

1916
01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably stole a car or beat somebody up</v>

1917
01:21:51.181 --> 01:21:52.014
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1918
01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 4>He was just super aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't,</v>

1919
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:58.770
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if he had that he had the,</v>

1920
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:02.610
<v Speaker 4>I had the feeling that he had no empathy</v>
<v Speaker 4>for others pain.</v>

1921
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he couldn't feel that that's the,</v>

1922
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:08.760
<v Speaker 4>that's the only time it ever got any</v>
<v Speaker 4>interaction with any of those kids ever</v>

1923
01:22:08.761 --> 01:22:09.620
<v Speaker 4>got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1924
01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:11.130
<v Speaker 4>that that sent chills through me.</v>

1925
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like,</v>

1926
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:17.010
<v Speaker 4>and maybe maybe I didn't feel in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>practical sense that he was going to</v>

1927
01:22:17.011 --> 01:22:19.440
<v Speaker 4>hurt me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had the sense that if he did,</v>

1928
01:22:19.441 --> 01:22:21.390
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1929
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there wasn't that connection and</v>

1930
01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.540
<v Speaker 4>the same thing we're talking about in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>

1931
01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:26.210
<v Speaker 4>like that's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get dropped in a,</v>

1932
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:30.090
<v Speaker 4>in a group of eight boys or young men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1933
01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:32.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so funny,</v>

1934
01:22:32.371 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 4>like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1935
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:36.470
<v Speaker 4>we worked with therapists with</v>
<v Speaker 4>therapists come in,</v>

1936
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.390
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all like the fundamental thing I</v>

1937
01:22:39.391 --> 01:22:42.570
<v Speaker 4>took away from that experience was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>in order for these,</v>

1938
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.950
<v Speaker 4>for these guys to grow up and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>move on and get going in their lives,</v>

1939
01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they needed was just somebody like</v>

1940
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.900
<v Speaker 4>me to just show up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1941
01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:53.760
<v Speaker 4>because we're really not complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1942
01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:56.790
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so just let them air things out and</v>

1943
01:22:56.791 --> 01:23:00.480
<v Speaker 4>talk about better ways to do things and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of get some perspective.</v>

1944
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.110
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1945
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:05.380
<v Speaker 4>we maybe talked about this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they'd go home and not</v>

1946
01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:08.380
<v Speaker 4>necessarily have that support anymore</v>
<v Speaker 4>and be back in their old,</v>

1947
01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:11.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>arena where we're,</v>

1948
01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:12.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1949
01:23:12.971 --> 01:23:15.420
<v Speaker 4>they're old friends and their old family</v>
<v Speaker 4>dynamic and all that and it,</v>

1950
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:16.360
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1951
01:23:16.361 --> 01:23:18.070
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a hard way.</v>

1952
01:23:18.071 --> 01:23:23.071
<v Speaker 4>And so I left that whole experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just feeling very strongly that a,</v>

1953
01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:27.970
<v Speaker 4>we can as a community and society just</v>
<v Speaker 4>way better with some simple,</v>

1954
01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:30.760
<v Speaker 4>simple changes we can do better at</v>
<v Speaker 4>raising our boys.</v>

1955
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:34.180
<v Speaker 4>We just can't because done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you have someone that has no</v>

1956
01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:39.181
<v Speaker 4>empathy though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can be done to instill empathy in</v>

1957
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:41.410
<v Speaker 4>someone who lacks it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if anything?</v>

1958
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:43.620
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1959
01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.900
<v Speaker 4>if you go on that far end of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>spectrum where there's nothing,</v>

1960
01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:49.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know if that's possible,</v>

1961
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.120
<v Speaker 4>but I do know that it's a muscle we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>practice.</v>

1962
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:56.680
<v Speaker 4>Empathy is something that we can get</v>
<v Speaker 4>better at and that we can pay more</v>

1963
01:23:56.681 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up</v>

1964
01:23:58.370 --> 01:24:00.350
<v Speaker 2>young kid without empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

1965
01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:04.550
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sort of motivation do they have to</v>

1966
01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:09.080
<v Speaker 2>gain empathy if they feel like no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>has shown it towards them or I don't</v>

1967
01:24:09.081 --> 01:24:09.420
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1968
01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.810
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

1969
01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:11.693
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1970
01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:16.020
<v Speaker 4>So the motivation that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe you could show is for them to,</v>

1971
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.230
<v Speaker 4>if they could let you caring about them</v>
<v Speaker 4>really in,</v>

1972
01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:24.860
<v Speaker 4>if they could really feel cared about</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's incredibly sad but real is</v>

1973
01:24:25.921 --> 01:24:28.440
<v Speaker 4>that I think some people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow up in,</v>

1974
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:29.160
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1975
01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.060
<v Speaker 4>their brains develop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they develop as humans where they don't</v>

1976
01:24:33.061 --> 01:24:35.220
<v Speaker 4>have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the actual wiring,</v>

1977
01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:39.840
<v Speaker 4>the actual state to Ha to receive that</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't there,</v>

1978
01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:43.200
<v Speaker 4>I think that that is possible to gain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1979
01:24:43.201 --> 01:24:45.660
<v Speaker 4>there's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that a child called it,</v>

1980
01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you heard of that book?</v>

1981
01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1982
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:50.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's possible in a much,</v>

1983
01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.370
<v Speaker 4>in a less extreme cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1984
01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:58.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean in a sense that that's kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of what I do is help guys become</v>

1985
01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:07.100
<v Speaker 4>more empathetic and the not just for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit of others for the benefit of</v>

1986
01:25:10.441 --> 01:25:11.274
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1987
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.600
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I brought this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a podcast I'm on radio lab about</v>

1988
01:25:15.601 --> 01:25:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Bernie madoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1989
01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.360
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1990
01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.530
<v Speaker 2>where this guy contacted Bernie Madoff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sent him letters and then finally</v>

1991
01:25:22.531 --> 01:25:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Bernie madoff called them and they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>this interview together,</v>

1992
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:29.880
<v Speaker 2>or the way it works in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess at least the prison where Bernie</v>

1993
01:25:29.881 --> 01:25:33.630
<v Speaker 2>madoff is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get 15 minutes to talk on the phone</v>

1994
01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:37.290
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to wait 15 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he could talk again and then 15</v>

1995
01:25:37.291 --> 01:25:39.600
<v Speaker 2>minutes again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>

1996
01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:42.420
<v Speaker 2>this is how they did the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 15 minutes on,</v>

1997
01:25:42.421 --> 01:25:46.200
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after a while he sort of gained his</v>

1998
01:25:46.201 --> 01:25:51.201
<v Speaker 2>trust and he went deep into how this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole deception started and how Bernie</v>

1999
01:25:51.451 --> 01:25:52.740
<v Speaker 2>made off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know the whole story,</v>

2000
01:25:52.741 --> 01:25:57.210
<v Speaker 2>burning man off as a guy who had this</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic Ponzi scheme and stole billions</v>

2001
01:25:57.210 --> 01:26:01.740
<v Speaker 2>of dollars from people and it's called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ponzi Supernova is the a radio lab</v>

2002
01:26:01.741 --> 01:26:02.400
<v Speaker 2>episode.</v>

2003
01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2004
01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that was the most</v>

2005
01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:09.950
<v Speaker 2>chilling was how little empathy he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the people that he ripped off,</v>

2006
01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.690
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whose lives had been destroyed.</v>

2007
01:26:11.691 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 2>His son committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2008
01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:17.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like literally went from having</v>

2009
01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:21.530
<v Speaker 2>all this money to being so broke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like dumpster diving and he</v>

2010
01:26:21.531 --> 01:26:22.880
<v Speaker 2>didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't give a fuck.</v>

2011
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

2012
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had no empathy and he's a monster.</v>

2013
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

2014
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:32.990
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting to see like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's reaction to Bernie madoff's lack</v>

2015
01:26:34.581 --> 01:26:37.370
<v Speaker 2>of empathy and realizing somewhere along</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line like,</v>

2016
01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:39.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy does not care.</v>

2017
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigators had said about him,</v>

2018
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 2>that it didn't seem to bother him at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2019
01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:46.900
<v Speaker 2>That he had done this to these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>

2020
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:49.130
<v Speaker 2>what bothered him was that he had gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>caught,</v>

2021
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:54.470
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't bother him that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people had been devastated.</v>

2022
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:57.710
<v Speaker 2>What bothered him was like that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>had made money,</v>

2023
01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.400
<v Speaker 2>weren't giving that money back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'd called one guy and told him</v>

2024
01:27:01.401 --> 01:27:04.970
<v Speaker 2>the guide made like $9 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was worth $9 billion,</v>

2025
01:27:04.971 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 2>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 7 billion of it had come from</v>

2026
01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Bernie madoff's Ponzi scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he told me how to give that $7</v>

2027
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:12.440
<v Speaker 2>billion back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy had a heart attack drown in his</v>

2028
01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:16.100
<v Speaker 2>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of hilarious because you</v>

2029
01:27:16.101 --> 01:27:18.150
<v Speaker 2>can't live with 2 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2030
01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:19.641
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2031
01:27:19.641 --> 01:27:23.150
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he couldn't give back the 7</v>

2032
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:24.260
<v Speaker 2>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was impossible.</v>

2033
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:27.740
<v Speaker 2>It was tied up in real estate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>holdings and this and that and the other</v>

2034
01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:30.110
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it amazing that one person's</v>

2035
01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:33.980
<v Speaker 2>reality could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to step into his head for a</v>

2036
01:27:33.981 --> 01:27:35.000
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to,</v>

2037
01:27:35.010 --> 01:27:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Bernie made him just to see what it felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2038
01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that'd be very helpful to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to step into that because just to</v>

2039
01:27:40.371 --> 01:27:41.870
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't picture it.</v>

2040
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I just can't picture it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2041
01:27:43.701 --> 01:27:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I could also couldn't picture not being</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to live with $2 billion.</v>

2042
01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:49.130
<v Speaker 2>He like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

2043
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that weirdness of the game,</v>

2044
01:27:52.161 --> 01:27:53.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>

2045
01:27:53.041 --> 01:27:55.910
<v Speaker 2>you score a hundred points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to score a thousand point score</v>

2046
01:27:55.911 --> 01:27:57.300
<v Speaker 2>thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted score a million score,</v>

2047
01:27:57.301 --> 01:28:00.950
<v Speaker 2>1,000,001 score a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you never stop and people</v>

2048
01:28:00.951 --> 01:28:02.540
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never achieve peace.</v>

2049
01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I always used to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Bill Gates.</v>

2050
01:28:04.731 --> 01:28:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Like why the fuck is Bill Gates still</v>
<v Speaker 2>working out here about him being the</v>

2051
01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.870
<v Speaker 2>richest and now he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he really did sort of find some</v>

2052
01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:16.790
<v Speaker 2>sort of a balance and now almost all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his work is done towards humanitarian</v>

2053
01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:17.720
<v Speaker 2>efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2054
01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:18.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he donates a lot of money,</v>

2055
01:28:18.981 --> 01:28:20.420
<v Speaker 2>a lot of charities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2056
01:28:20.421 --> 01:28:25.421
<v Speaker 2>a lot of really good work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like post his Microsoft career,</v>

2057
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.930
<v Speaker 2>which is like really kind of unique that</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy sort of found his way,</v>

2058
01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.420
<v Speaker 2>found his back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept a shit load of money.</v>

2059
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2060
01:28:34.670 --> 01:28:39.560
<v Speaker 2>apparently he's got some stupid fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>house with a submarine in the Pacific</v>

2061
01:28:39.561 --> 01:28:42.230
<v Speaker 2>northwest where like if someone tries to</v>
<v Speaker 2>break into his house,</v>

2062
01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:46.290
<v Speaker 2>he could fucking escape in a submarine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kayaked by his house one second.</v>

2063
01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they let you to secret service</v>

2064
01:28:48.381 --> 01:28:50.510
<v Speaker 2>fucking swarm you and ask you where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going?</v>

2065
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>

2066
01:28:51.321 --> 01:28:52.700
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't see anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably all lunch.</v>

2067
01:28:52.710 --> 01:28:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Are you allowed to just walk by his</v>
<v Speaker 2>house?</v>

2068
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:56.420
<v Speaker 2>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2069
01:28:56.421 --> 01:28:58.570
<v Speaker 2>it was a private island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the place that I was at.</v>

2070
01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I was just told by the guy I was with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were actually throwing crab pots</v>

2071
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.480
<v Speaker 4>out of a Kayak and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2072
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:06.960
<v Speaker 4>I was just told it was his house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't if it's mean house might have</v>

2073
01:29:06.961 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 4>been one of his houses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2074
01:29:08.281 --> 01:29:08.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>

2075
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

2076
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:12.360
<v Speaker 4>50 yards off shore and it was a private</v>
<v Speaker 4>island,</v>

2077
01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.360
<v Speaker 4>private island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you're,</v>

2078
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:15.271
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul,</v>

2079
01:29:15.271 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 4>when you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on an island,</v>

2080
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:18.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does an island,</v>

2081
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Tyler Perry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that makes us shitty movies and</v>

2082
01:29:22.041 --> 01:29:23.870
<v Speaker 2>TV shows those awful shows.</v>

2083
01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:25.590
<v Speaker 4>Tyler Perry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2084
01:29:25.730 --> 01:29:27.590
<v Speaker 4>He has a private,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he has a private room where,</v>

2085
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:30.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't know if you know,</v>

2086
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.200
<v Speaker 4>I actually feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2087
01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.320
<v Speaker 4>some sadness for Bernie madoff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2088
01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.213
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2089
01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:39.013
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2090
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:41.630
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's as tortured as you know.</v>

2091
01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.640
<v Speaker 4>I think it's harder to feel empathy for</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2092
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.580
<v Speaker 4>but he's as tortured of human is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2093
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Pick anybody maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2094
01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

2095
01:29:49.251 --> 01:29:49.851
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2096
01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:50.191
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2097
01:29:50.191 --> 01:29:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm projecting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2098
01:29:51.231 --> 01:29:53.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know if you,</v>

2099
01:29:53.901 --> 01:29:55.810
<v Speaker 4>if you're hurting that many people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you,</v>

2100
01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:57.390
<v Speaker 4>are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

2101
01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:58.790
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you aren't feeling,</v>

2102
01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:00.230
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2103
01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a</v>

2104
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.520
<v Speaker 2>weird line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2105
01:30:02.521 --> 01:30:06.150
<v Speaker 2>when do you feel bad for someone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel bad for Jeffrey Dahmer?</v>

2106
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Like how did he become that cannibal</v>
<v Speaker 2>murderer guys?</v>

2107
01:30:09.961 --> 01:30:11.190
<v Speaker 2>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did that happen?</v>

2108
01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:12.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

2109
01:30:12.721 --> 01:30:15.240
<v Speaker 2>what causes someone to go from like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a boy,</v>

2110
01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:19.560
<v Speaker 2>what causes someone to go from your cute</v>
<v Speaker 2>little baby boy to being some monster?</v>

2111
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that,</v>

2112
01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:26.060
<v Speaker 2>what is it about people that makes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible for someone to go even not for</v>

2113
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.280
<v Speaker 2>to a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how about that young boy that you</v>

2114
01:30:29.281 --> 01:30:30.900
<v Speaker 2>were working with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had no empathy.</v>

2115
01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:33.350
<v Speaker 2>You worried about sleeping near like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo Hoo.</v>

2116
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:36.570
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the developmental process of a</v>

2117
01:30:36.571 --> 01:30:39.630
<v Speaker 2>human being is way more fascinating to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2118
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an adult with children than it was</v>

2119
01:30:41.851 --> 01:30:43.650
<v Speaker 2>when I was a young man when I was young</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2120
01:30:43.651 --> 01:30:45.360
<v Speaker 2>And I was single and I didn't have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

2121
01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I just thought people were fucked up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people weren't.</v>

2122
01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:51.420
<v Speaker 2>The people that are fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked him and death penalty and like</v>

2123
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:52.660
<v Speaker 2>kicked her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>

2124
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.940
<v Speaker 4>So I've been obsessed with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

2125
01:30:53.941 --> 01:30:56.370
<v Speaker 4>all my life has been absolutely like</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2126
01:30:56.371 --> 01:30:59.170
<v Speaker 4>what is this process of growing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of the novel</v>

2127
01:30:59.171 --> 01:31:02.490
<v Speaker 4>sidharth no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by Hermann Hesse Hessa I'm not sure how</v>

2128
01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:04.800
<v Speaker 4>to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a classic novel,</v>

2129
01:31:05.010 --> 01:31:06.870
<v Speaker 4>an author from Germany and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

2130
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:10.680
<v Speaker 4>it chronicles the life of a young guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>named Sid Arthur.</v>

2131
01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.020
<v Speaker 4>But the whole book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is,</v>

2132
01:31:13.021 --> 01:31:16.740
<v Speaker 4>is it goes through his entire life from</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was born until he dies.</v>

2133
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:21.270
<v Speaker 4>And in it are these like very specific</v>
<v Speaker 4>stages of life.</v>

2134
01:31:21.271 --> 01:31:21.961
<v Speaker 4>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2135
01:31:21.961 --> 01:31:25.650
<v Speaker 4>he's like young wandering years and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>he needs to work.</v>

2136
01:31:25.651 --> 01:31:28.230
<v Speaker 4>So he goes to a city and he learns from</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2137
01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.930
<v Speaker 4>from a trader and then he needs to learn</v>
<v Speaker 4>about love.</v>

2138
01:31:30.931 --> 01:31:33.650
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he gets with a prostitute but,</v>

2139
01:31:33.651 --> 01:31:38.580
<v Speaker 4>but all in these big stages and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>book did something to me at an early</v>

2140
01:31:38.581 --> 01:31:39.120
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>

2141
01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.120
<v Speaker 4>I just got obsessed with this process of</v>
<v Speaker 4>maturing.</v>

2142
01:31:42.121 --> 01:31:44.340
<v Speaker 4>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a term for it called ontogeny,</v>

2143
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:48.360
<v Speaker 4>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the process of an organism's growth over</v>

2144
01:31:48.361 --> 01:31:51.130
<v Speaker 4>their lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just this natural sort of arc,</v>

2145
01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:52.890
<v Speaker 4>a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then ontogeny of a tree is,</v>

2146
01:31:52.891 --> 01:31:54.750
<v Speaker 4>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2147
01:31:54.751 --> 01:31:58.440
<v Speaker 4>a seed that drops and then it sprouts</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it routes and then it grows and</v>

2148
01:31:58.441 --> 01:32:01.390
<v Speaker 4>then it dies and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is,</v>

2149
01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been an obsession of mine and you</v>

2150
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting thrown into that work of working</v>

2151
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:08.140
<v Speaker 4>with kids and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2152
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:08.974
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2153
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:10.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2154
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:13.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm so fascinated by it and I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously any,</v>

2155
01:32:14.370 --> 01:32:15.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>solid,</v>

2156
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.050
<v Speaker 4>here's how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2157
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:20.140
<v Speaker 4>but I've been looking into it for a long</v>
<v Speaker 4>time and,</v>

2158
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2159
01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.560
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2160
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:24.520
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the book,</v>

2161
01:32:24.521 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to read that book out loud to</v>

2162
01:32:27.011 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 4>these groups of kids I was working on.</v>

2163
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:31.090
<v Speaker 4>We'd sit around a fire at night and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>read a novel and it would be out there</v>

2164
01:32:31.091 --> 01:32:33.040
<v Speaker 4>for days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got the time to read a novel</v>

2165
01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:34.810
<v Speaker 4>out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2166
01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:36.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2167
01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 4>it's just something poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not about just the words but about</v>

2168
01:32:40.751 --> 01:32:45.751
<v Speaker 4>watching the life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's life unfold as a whole story</v>

2169
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:48.070
<v Speaker 4>and watching them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2170
01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:51.910
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow up and yeah,</v>

2171
01:32:51.911 --> 01:32:54.620
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this weird fascination I have and</v>

2172
01:32:54.621 --> 01:32:58.420
<v Speaker 4>it's specifically because in an all com</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it keeps saying it comes back to</v>

2173
01:32:58.421 --> 01:33:01.270
<v Speaker 4>that time in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I only worked with males with boys</v>

2174
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:03.070
<v Speaker 4>and it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't choose to do that.</v>

2175
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:06.070
<v Speaker 4>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a lot of girls do the same sort of</v>

2176
01:33:06.071 --> 01:33:07.150
<v Speaker 4>therapy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2177
01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they must go with women too.</v>

2178
01:33:09.511 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a problem with men going</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there with girls.</v>

2179
01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.510
<v Speaker 4>They'll do mixed a leadership group.</v>

2180
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:17.140
<v Speaker 4>So like a male and a female from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for both boys and girls.</v>

2181
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:19.060
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's always a girl with the girls.</v>

2182
01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:20.561
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2183
01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.060
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got obsessed with this.</v>

2184
01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:22.900
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2185
01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.910
<v Speaker 4>how do we grow up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it look like?</v>

2186
01:33:24.911 --> 01:33:27.190
<v Speaker 4>What's it feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come it's not happening?</v>

2187
01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:32.080
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's a big part of what I felt</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I looked around is that I think that</v>

2188
01:33:32.081 --> 01:33:36.700
<v Speaker 4>a lot of adult physically adult men walk</v>
<v Speaker 4>around with,</v>

2189
01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:39.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>parts of themselves that are still in</v>

2190
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:42.850
<v Speaker 4>their team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six to 18.</v>

2191
01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:44.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's,</v>

2192
01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:49.140
<v Speaker 4>there's this human maturation process is</v>
<v Speaker 4>human journey that we all have available</v>

2193
01:33:49.931 --> 01:33:52.660
<v Speaker 4>to us that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2194
01:33:53.410 --> 01:33:55.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're too busy a lot of times to</v>

2195
01:33:55.511 --> 01:33:57.430
<v Speaker 4>let it actually flow and happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2196
01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 4>I think that true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

2197
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:03.490
<v Speaker 4>But I also think that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>maturation process that comes from</v>

2198
01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.810
<v Speaker 4>overcoming obstacles.</v>

2199
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:07.240
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people just don't encounter,</v>

2200
01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:10.000
<v Speaker 4>they don't encounter difficulty so they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't learn about them.</v>

2201
01:34:10.001 --> 01:34:12.610
<v Speaker 4>So that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that a lot of times,</v>

2202
01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:17.890
<v Speaker 4>even if they do encounter difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't let themselves actually feel,</v>

2203
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.410
<v Speaker 4>they don't let themselves experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2204
01:34:20.411 --> 01:34:22.840
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody has shitty things happen</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>

2205
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:25.090
<v Speaker 4>But you can keep that shitty thing at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>distance from you.</v>

2206
01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:25.931
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

2207
01:34:25.931 --> 01:34:28.390
<v Speaker 4>you can like kind of address it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can sort of,</v>

2208
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>act out against it,</v>

2209
01:34:30.281 --> 01:34:34.310
<v Speaker 4>but unless you actually feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2210
01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:35.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about this,</v>

2211
01:34:35.891 --> 01:34:37.760
<v Speaker 4>this gets into things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2212
01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:42.160
<v Speaker 4>trauma and resilience and how people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to move on from hardship.</v>

2213
01:34:42.161 --> 01:34:42.994
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2214
01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:45.760
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of the research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2215
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:47.290
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2216
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:50.050
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrist called Bessel van der Kolk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never heard of him.</v>

2217
01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.640
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating dude.</v>

2218
01:34:51.641 --> 01:34:55.570
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he started working with the va in Boston</v>

2219
01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:56.320
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2220
01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.660
<v Speaker 4>worked with returning vets from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2221
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:05.500
<v Speaker 4>from Vietnam and then did this whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>lifetime of study about trauma and how</v>

2222
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:10.610
<v Speaker 4>it comes into humans and how you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>move through it and how can heal it and</v>

2223
01:35:10.611 --> 01:35:11.444
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff.</v>

2224
01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:13.220
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2225
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:15.291
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2226
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:17.520
<v Speaker 4>it basically comes down to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2227
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 4>being able like to be more resilient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to get over things to say a</v>

2228
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:25.070
<v Speaker 4>death in the family or an attack or an</v>
<v Speaker 4>assault or whatever,</v>

2229
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:30.190
<v Speaker 4>whatever that trauma could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That if you don't allow the body and</v>

2230
01:35:31.431 --> 01:35:34.190
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your system to actually go through feel</v>

2231
01:35:34.191 --> 01:35:37.100
<v Speaker 4>and process what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you lock it up,</v>

2232
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.940
<v Speaker 4>you lock it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like it.</v>

2233
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:40.783
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

2234
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2235
01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:47.760
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like it gets implanted in</v>
<v Speaker 4>you somewhere and then it just festers</v>

2236
01:35:47.761 --> 01:35:48.620
<v Speaker 4>esters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

2237
01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 4>and the cool thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the,</v>

2238
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:51.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2239
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.600
<v Speaker 4>the science now is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is showing the,</v>

2240
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.940
<v Speaker 4>the very specifics of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just,</v>

2241
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:56.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still theory,</v>

2242
01:35:56.901 --> 01:35:57.734
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

2243
01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I feel like I got off of what we were</v>

2244
01:36:01.341 --> 01:36:02.174
<v Speaker 4>talking about there.</v>

2245
01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2246
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:06.770
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>

2247
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:10.250
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being able to overcome things.</v>

2248
01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:11.630
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2249
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:14.710
<v Speaker 4>And part of that is just to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2250
01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:16.820
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking more from a male perspective</v>

2251
01:36:16.821 --> 01:36:17.870
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but part of that,</v>

2252
01:36:17.871 --> 01:36:20.390
<v Speaker 4>and I think a lot of what our culture</v>
<v Speaker 4>says is,</v>

2253
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:22.120
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is let's,</v>

2254
01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horse our way through this.</v>

2255
01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.030
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's force it,</v>

2256
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.990
<v Speaker 4>let's push harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>

2257
01:36:26.991 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 4>let's conquer our fears and our</v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings.</v>

2258
01:36:29.421 --> 01:36:30.380
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's not address it.</v>

2259
01:36:30.381 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 4>Let's just push,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2260
01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:34.100
<v Speaker 4>Run through the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically we're taking the depressants.</v>

2261
01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:36.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2262
01:36:36.081 --> 01:36:37.070
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>

2263
01:36:37.071 --> 01:36:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Then there's this other whole way to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get through hardship,</v>

2264
01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:46.340
<v Speaker 4>which is by actually surrendering to it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and letting your in this like brilliant</v>

2265
01:36:46.341 --> 01:36:49.490
<v Speaker 4>system that we have as humans to process</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and get through it.</v>

2266
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:50.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

2267
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:54.080
<v Speaker 4>that's a way to wholeness and health in</v>
<v Speaker 4>some ways,</v>

2268
01:36:54.081 --> 01:36:55.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're both important.</v>

2269
01:36:55.101 --> 01:36:56.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2270
01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:58.070
<v Speaker 4>you need to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2271
01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ignore the pain and,</v>

2272
01:37:00.341 --> 01:37:04.130
<v Speaker 4>and power your way up that mountain or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or save somebody that's getting hurt or</v>

2273
01:37:04.131 --> 01:37:06.710
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's this other part I think</v>

2274
01:37:06.711 --> 01:37:10.010
<v Speaker 4>that needs to be in balance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is accepting what's happening and</v>

2275
01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:15.320
<v Speaker 4>getting through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just a way to accept what's happening</v>

2276
01:37:15.321 --> 01:37:16.710
<v Speaker 4>and let your body do what it needs.</v>

2277
01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think there's an extreme lack of</v>

2278
01:37:18.981 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 2>discipline that a lot of people have and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the discipline,</v>

2279
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:27.050
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it comes from overcoming</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult obstacles and understanding</v>

2280
01:37:27.051 --> 01:37:29.150
<v Speaker 2>the work that's required to get things</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

2281
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Making these little leaps and bounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making these improvements in your life,</v>

2282
01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:36.440
<v Speaker 2>getting better at things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those things are really critical</v>

2283
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:37.820
<v Speaker 2>to the human mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I think the mind has desires and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big desires is it has a desire for</v>

2285
01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 2>improvement and his desire to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 2>goals.</v>

2286
01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:49.100
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of people that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>goals are laid out by other people.</v>

2287
01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:51.530
<v Speaker 2>These goals are like graduating from</v>
<v Speaker 2>third grade,</v>

2288
01:37:51.531 --> 01:37:55.040
<v Speaker 2>graduating from fourth grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of shit that you don't want to do.</v>

2289
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>So these goals are</v>

2290
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.410
<v Speaker 1>meaningless to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you never feel like you've</v>

2291
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 1>accomplished anything that you actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>

2292
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:03.510
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a 35 year old man working for an</v>

2293
01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:06.120
<v Speaker 1>insurance company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be there and you don't</v>

2294
01:38:06.121 --> 01:38:09.570
<v Speaker 1>have any real part of you that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurtured.</v>

2295
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:14.870
<v Speaker 1>You just sort of plugged you into these</v>
<v Speaker 1>other weird shapes and conform to them</v>

2296
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:18.720
<v Speaker 1>and then you just want to go fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and probably bitched about it all</v>

2297
01:38:18.721 --> 01:38:20.030
<v Speaker 1>the way along probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2298
01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.650
<v Speaker 1>you probably complained and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying and you're a whining little</v>

2299
01:38:22.651 --> 01:38:25.680
<v Speaker 1>twat and you're out there just clogging</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the freeway,</v>

2300
01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.720
<v Speaker 1>beep it at people and giving them the</v>
<v Speaker 1>finger.</v>

2301
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of humans that you run</v>

2302
01:38:29.461 --> 01:38:30.310
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of,</v>

2303
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of this life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2304
01:38:32.970 --> 01:38:37.080
<v Speaker 1>and that points directly to what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know I do and what I'm building is,</v>

2305
01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you take eight of those guys and you</v>

2306
01:38:39.571 --> 01:38:43.980
<v Speaker 1>set up a room and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right in this space right here,</v>

2307
01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:45.323
<v Speaker 1>fuck all that.</v>

2308
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:49.770
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be actually honest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what we're feeling but maybe can't</v>

2309
01:38:49.771 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 1>even really access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like all that frustration,</v>

2310
01:38:52.021 --> 01:38:53.700
<v Speaker 1>all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2311
01:38:53.701 --> 01:38:56.010
<v Speaker 1>It could be anything that's so hard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do.</v>

2312
01:38:56.011 --> 01:38:56.701
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

2313
01:38:56.701 --> 01:39:00.810
<v Speaker 1>what kind of techniques do you employ to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get someone like say if you've got some</v>

2314
01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:04.320
<v Speaker 1>guy who was closed off and it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting his way through life and</v>

2315
01:39:04.321 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden here he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this 35 year old guy that's really</v>

2316
01:39:06.721 --> 01:39:07.950
<v Speaker 1>troubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in a room with you.</v>

2317
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:12.900
<v Speaker 1>How do you get that guy to open up</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety and safety leading by example and</v>

2318
01:39:12.901 --> 01:39:16.260
<v Speaker 1>being vulnerable by example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when somebody says it's part of this</v>

2319
01:39:16.261 --> 01:39:18.060
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sitting down with somebody that if</v>

2320
01:39:18.061 --> 01:39:20.340
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after one of these last retreats,</v>

2321
01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:23.130
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys came up to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety is the new Iowasca,</v>

2322
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:28.640
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe a strange thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said he'd been all over the world</v>

2323
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.740
<v Speaker 1>doing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find growth,</v>

2324
01:39:31.741 --> 01:39:32.850
<v Speaker 1>trying to find himself.</v>

2325
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:36.600
<v Speaker 1>And when he went home and went to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat and all we did was sit down and</v>

2326
01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:37.500
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2327
01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:39.810
<v Speaker 1>our intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all we're doing what we actually are</v>

2328
01:39:39.811 --> 01:39:41.660
<v Speaker 1>doing here is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2329
01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:44.640
<v Speaker 1>making this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be,</v>

2330
01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be supported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be laughed at like,</v>

2331
01:39:48.061 --> 01:39:50.430
<v Speaker 1>like it's a safe space to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you just,</v>

2332
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:53.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dive in and lead by example and that</v>

2333
01:39:53.161 --> 01:39:55.020
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like plugs,</v>

2334
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:59.580
<v Speaker 1>others right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's this amazing like symbiotic</v>

2335
01:39:59.581 --> 01:40:00.940
<v Speaker 1>thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2336
01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:05.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people just sometimes break open,</v>

2337
01:40:05.371 --> 01:40:08.490
<v Speaker 1>sometimes cracks slowly open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2338
01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.310
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe after 35 years of only being</v>

2339
01:40:11.311 --> 01:40:15.450
<v Speaker 1>other people's program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get in touch with what you actually</v>

2340
01:40:15.451 --> 01:40:17.820
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you actually want and who you</v>

2341
01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:19.560
<v Speaker 1>actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like this fucking,</v>

2342
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:22.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for a lot of people it's really</v>

2343
01:40:22.201 --> 01:40:26.730
<v Speaker 1>difficult to try to do what you actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to because you've spent so much</v>

2344
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:31.731
<v Speaker 1>time rewarding yourself with material</v>
<v Speaker 1>items for these little accomplishments</v>

2345
01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:35.640
<v Speaker 1>that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've become in debt and you really</v>

2346
01:40:35.641 --> 01:40:38.100
<v Speaker 1>can't escape the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2347
01:40:38.101 --> 01:40:41.790
<v Speaker 1>that's totally real problem with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all the car that they're</v>

2348
01:40:41.791 --> 01:40:44.490
<v Speaker 1>leasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a house that they're renting</v>

2349
01:40:44.491 --> 01:40:46.840
<v Speaker 1>or even worse that they bought and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2350
01:40:46.841 --> 01:40:48.750
<v Speaker 1>they're stuck and then they don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck to do.</v>

2351
01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:52.320
<v Speaker 1>They have to keep this insurance company</v>
<v Speaker 1>job and they're just rotting them out</v>

2352
01:40:52.321 --> 01:40:53.160
<v Speaker 1>from the inside.</v>

2353
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2354
01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's like a whole society</v>
<v Speaker 4>built on,</v>

2355
01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:00.500
<v Speaker 4>on uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to keep you not who you are in a</v>

2356
01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:01.081
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2357
01:41:01.081 --> 01:41:02.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so what we're finding,</v>

2358
01:41:02.851 --> 01:41:06.060
<v Speaker 4>which is really amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that if you stay on that surface</v>

2359
01:41:06.061 --> 01:41:07.830
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you stay on that sort of,</v>

2360
01:41:08.190 --> 01:41:10.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2361
01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.660
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so trying to improve yourself</v>

2362
01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.770
<v Speaker 4>goes so far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's kind of like an iceberg thing,</v>

2363
01:41:16.771 --> 01:41:20.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if your goal is to make more</v>

2364
01:41:20.521 --> 01:41:21.331
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2365
01:41:21.331 --> 01:41:24.330
<v Speaker 4>And here's your goal and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>toward it and you and your,</v>

2366
01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:27.060
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to podcasts or you do all this</v>

2367
01:41:27.061 --> 01:41:28.950
<v Speaker 4>stuff and you try to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>

2368
01:41:28.951 --> 01:41:29.731
<v Speaker 4>how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do I do it?</v>

2369
01:41:29.731 --> 01:41:31.560
<v Speaker 4>How did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you keep hitting a wall,</v>

2370
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:33.150
<v Speaker 4>you keep getting sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2371
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:37.650
<v Speaker 4>thrown down and you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that underneath meanwhile is</v>

2372
01:41:37.651 --> 01:41:41.130
<v Speaker 4>this massive sort of like pent up shit.</v>

2373
01:41:41.670 --> 01:41:45.660
<v Speaker 4>And if you address that massive pent up</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2374
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:50.190
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden getting to that</v>
<v Speaker 4>goal is a whole different story.</v>

2375
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:52.590
<v Speaker 4>It's a whole different story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2376
01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:53.933
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2377
01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.410
<v Speaker 4>it's like always trimming the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you need to get rid of a tree in</v>

2378
01:41:58.411 --> 01:42:00.960
<v Speaker 4>your yard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all you do is every day you chop the</v>

2379
01:42:00.961 --> 01:42:03.300
<v Speaker 4>leaves off the leaves off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you address that,</v>

2380
01:42:03.301 --> 01:42:06.120
<v Speaker 4>the roots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deeper stuff and uh,</v>

2381
01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

2382
01:42:07.561 --> 01:42:10.080
<v Speaker 4>there's a stigma against that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially for dudes.</v>

2383
01:42:10.081 --> 01:42:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's this,</v>

2384
01:42:11.150 --> 01:42:12.570
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys don't want to go to therapy,</v>

2385
01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:16.910
<v Speaker 4>guys don't want to get into woo hippie</v>
<v Speaker 4>spiritual shift do,</v>

2386
01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.810
<v Speaker 4>and they're annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2387
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:21.450
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to get into it.</v>

2388
01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.830
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2389
01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:24.480
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2390
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:28.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I pull this off or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel fluent than in a like,</v>

2391
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:30.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>broke.</v>

2392
01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And fluent in,</v>

2393
01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've,</v>

2394
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone down that spiritual route two</v>

2395
01:42:35.591 --> 01:42:36.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2396
01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.560
<v Speaker 1>well you recognize when the spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>route is legitimate and when the</v>

2397
01:42:39.561 --> 01:42:43.910
<v Speaker 1>spiritual route is like a rose as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes even the spiritual route.</v>

2398
01:42:43.911 --> 01:42:47.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that someone has</v>
<v Speaker 1>plugged themselves into to try to find</v>

2399
01:42:47.421 --> 01:42:48.530
<v Speaker 1>some meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2400
01:42:48.531 --> 01:42:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not authentic.</v>

2401
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2402
01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:54.110
<v Speaker 1>so how are you doing this if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind me interrupting?</v>

2403
01:42:54.111 --> 01:42:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

2404
01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:57.440
<v Speaker 1>you're planning on taking guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say,</v>

2405
01:42:57.710 --> 01:43:00.950
<v Speaker 1>say if I'm that 35 year old guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>works in insurance company for example,</v>

2406
01:43:00.951 --> 01:43:03.440
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just fucked up and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going crazy,</v>

2407
01:43:03.441 --> 01:43:04.850
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do something.</v>

2408
01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seems interesting to me.</v>

2409
01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Wilderness therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean Dan Dodi,</v>

2410
01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:11.220
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I get involved in this and how do</v>

2411
01:43:11.221 --> 01:43:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get me out of this regimen?</v>

2412

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So three things we're offering right</v>

2413
01:43:14.931 --> 01:43:16.210
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2414

<v Speaker 1>pay some money,</v>

2416
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.740
<v Speaker 1>and go out in the woods and change your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2417
01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Like pretty well climb mountains will go</v>

<v Speaker 1>this community and this sense of a</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm not a therapist,</v>

2447
01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:37.950
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2448

2450
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:47.390
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't recommend it more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something about this,</v>

2451
01:44:47.391 --> 01:44:51.340
<v Speaker 4>these men's retreats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I totally understand sound on</v>

2452
01:44:51.370 --> 01:44:52.800
<v Speaker 4>attractive to a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just like,</v>

2453
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 4>sounds like a lot of butt fucking yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

2454
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:57.050
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that is,</v>

2455
01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.470
<v Speaker 4>that is your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the big first sort of response,</v>

2456
01:45:00.471 --> 01:45:01.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2457
01:45:01.210 --> 01:45:02.043
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

2458
01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Tell me more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2459
01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:06.970
<v Speaker 4>I can be open in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We what we made a,</v>

2460
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of our advertising videos for it and</v>

2461
01:45:08.961 --> 01:45:12.110
<v Speaker 4>it just starts out that a guy stands up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and says,</v>

2462
01:45:12.111 --> 01:45:14.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard about a men's retreat and I</v>

2463
01:45:14.571 --> 01:45:18.230
<v Speaker 4>thought the first thing I thought was</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is going to be fucking awful.</v>

2464
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.170
<v Speaker 4>And so I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2465
01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2466
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:27.080
<v Speaker 4>I think we're getting further enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>along where the guys that are going</v>

2467
01:45:27.081 --> 01:45:30.950
<v Speaker 4>through this or are literally coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>back with the most positive feedback</v>

2468
01:45:30.951 --> 01:45:33.050
<v Speaker 4>that I could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't write this shit like,</v>

2469
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:35.810
<v Speaker 4>like changing their lives and just like</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally,</v>

2470
01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:37.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>

2471
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:38.391
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2472
01:45:38.391 --> 01:45:41.180
<v Speaker 4>back to that thing we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're offering a place for them to</v>

2473
01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:45.560
<v Speaker 4>accept a part of themselves that's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>offline for a long time.</v>

2474
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:47.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a big fucking deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really,</v>

2475
01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:48.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

2476
01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:52.750
<v Speaker 2>it's probably also a big fucking deal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just separate from the high for a little</v>

2477
01:45:52.751 --> 01:45:57.751
<v Speaker 2>bit and just be outside of cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>range and be in the woods and just take</v>

2478
01:45:58.631 --> 01:46:00.970
<v Speaker 2>a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep breath of fresh air and look around</v>

2479
01:46:00.971 --> 01:46:03.550
<v Speaker 2>at the wilderness and just realize that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2480
01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.440
<v Speaker 2>this is reality as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>

2481
01:46:05.441 --> 01:46:09.850
<v Speaker 2>you've been plugged into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization reality,</v>

2482
01:46:09.851 --> 01:46:11.350
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this city,</v>

2483
01:46:11.351 --> 01:46:16.351
<v Speaker 2>this urban environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is entirely unnatural and is only</v>

2484
01:46:16.451 --> 01:46:19.180
<v Speaker 2>been a real thing for the past couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years.</v>

2485
01:46:19.181 --> 01:46:24.181
<v Speaker 2>Like literally didn't exist for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic swath of humanity that,</v>

2486
01:46:24.401 --> 01:46:25.930
<v Speaker 2>that existed before that.</v>

2487
01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:28.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it isn't the right word.</v>

2488
01:46:28.771 --> 01:46:32.400
<v Speaker 4>They're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it does a couple deep things.</v>

2489
01:46:32.401 --> 01:46:33.600
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it lights up this,</v>

2490
01:46:33.601 --> 01:46:34.434
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2491
01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:38.250
<v Speaker 4>this neurobiology that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that of us as social animals.</v>

2492
01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:40.470
<v Speaker 4>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to,</v>

2493
01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:43.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more of a tribal sense of living too.</v>

2494
01:46:43.051 --> 01:46:44.240
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like all of a sudden you,</v>

2495
01:46:44.250 --> 01:46:46.610
<v Speaker 4>you went from being isolated and lonely</v>
<v Speaker 4>to heaven,</v>

2496
01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:50.700
<v Speaker 4>30 dudes who would honestly fucking do</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything for you in that moment.</v>

2497
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.830
<v Speaker 4>And I got a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good buddy as a return special forces</v>

2498
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:58.920
<v Speaker 4>operator and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he sits in my men's group in Bozeman</v>

2499
01:46:58.921 --> 01:47:03.921
<v Speaker 4>with me and really struggled with coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>home and then found our group.</v>

2500
01:47:04.591 --> 01:47:07.200
<v Speaker 4>And within a month his life was back on</v>
<v Speaker 4>track.</v>

2501
01:47:07.450 --> 01:47:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Like I like just killing it man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like kicking ass.</v>

2502
01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:13.650
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there is a connection between,</v>

2503
01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.430
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say the general military,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the special forces,</v>

2504
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:19.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you read books and hear about the aspect</v>

2505
01:47:19.621 --> 01:47:21.660
<v Speaker 4>of brotherhood and how they're there for</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

2506
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:24.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is definitely a very different</v>

2507
01:47:24.331 --> 01:47:25.170
<v Speaker 4>venue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

2508
01:47:25.171 --> 01:47:29.010
<v Speaker 4>I think the bond and connection that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that has created out of it is,</v>

2509
01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

2510
01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:30.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

2511
01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.690
<v Speaker 4>from his mouth too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it's,</v>

2512
01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:35.940
<v Speaker 4>he went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2513
01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:39.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>several years in special forces w living</v>

2514
01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:42.480
<v Speaker 4>with in close connection to guys got</v>
<v Speaker 4>thrown home.</v>

2515
01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:46.290
<v Speaker 4>It was all of a sudden isolated and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>came into our group and just had this,</v>

2516
01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:50.700
<v Speaker 4>this closeness again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it just Bam,</v>

2517
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 4>just like back to back to killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2518
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:54.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2520
01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:57.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've very aware,</v>

2521
01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:01.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been scared to start speaking about</v>

2522
01:48:01.621 --> 01:48:02.520
<v Speaker 4>this for years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2523
01:48:02.521 --> 01:48:03.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

2524
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:07.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me even I look at advertising for</v>

2525

2528
01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.560
<v Speaker 2>It does seem that people need resets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need some sort of recent,</v>

2529
01:48:15.561 --> 01:48:17.180
<v Speaker 2>and we've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2530
01:48:17.181 --> 01:48:20.720
<v Speaker 2>we've both experienced those resets</v>
<v Speaker 2>through psychedelics or,</v>

2531
01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:22.760
<v Speaker 2>or through these hunting trips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2532
01:48:22.761 --> 01:48:26.600
<v Speaker 2>and these wilderness trips like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think people get caught up in the</v>

2533
01:48:26.601 --> 01:48:31.100
<v Speaker 2>momentum of their daily existence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the requirements of that daily</v>

2534
01:48:31.101 --> 01:48:33.380
<v Speaker 2>existence and they become overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2535
01:48:33.381 --> 01:48:37.130
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about like the your</v>
<v Speaker 2>lease that you have on your car or your</v>

2536
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:40.160
<v Speaker 2>mortgage that you have in your house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the credit card bills that keep coming</v>

2537
01:48:40.161 --> 01:48:43.490
<v Speaker 2>in your student loans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to eventually get to and blah.</v>

2538
01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking overwhelming grind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2539
01:48:46.730 --> 01:48:51.730
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes people need something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>removes them entirely from it for a</v>

2540
01:48:51.891 --> 01:48:54.860
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of time that allows you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the fresh air,</v>

2541
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:57.410
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just literal flesh air,</v>

2542
01:48:57.411 --> 01:49:02.411
<v Speaker 2>but the metaphorical fresh air of</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing you to just separate from the</v>

2543
01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:08.080
<v Speaker 2>all these weird influences and all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird energy and momentum,</v>

2544
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:11.810
<v Speaker 2>the momentum of the life that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>created or that's been created for you,</v>

2545
01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:12.950
<v Speaker 2>that you're sort of trapped in.</v>

2546
01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2547
01:49:14.871 --> 01:49:15.704
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>

2548
01:49:15.710 --> 01:49:17.300
<v Speaker 2>Aye Fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that reset thing,</v>

2549
01:49:17.301 --> 01:49:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2550
01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:23.410
<v Speaker 4>I think I want a warning is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>start getting a reset,</v>

2551
01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean from my own experience I needed</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty regularly.</v>

2552
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:27.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2553
01:49:27.371 --> 01:49:30.820
<v Speaker 4>so the actually the biggest goal of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this,</v>

2554
01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:35.020
<v Speaker 4>of every man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the organization I founded is to,</v>

2555
01:49:35.170 --> 01:49:39.340
<v Speaker 4>our goal is to get a million guys in</v>
<v Speaker 4>man's groups because that is the same.</v>

2556
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:42.640
<v Speaker 4>And it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this last retreat had 30 guys show</v>

2557
01:49:42.641 --> 01:49:43.474
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2558
01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 4>about 20 of them wanted to immediately</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a weekly group</v>

2559
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.100
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to basically continuing regularly</v>

2560
01:49:51.101 --> 01:49:53.230
<v Speaker 1>experienced the same thing gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a hit,</v>

2561
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like too about men in this culture where</v>

2562
01:49:57.041 --> 01:49:59.860
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of sympathy towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>men that are struggling.</v>

2563
01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.420
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like there's this thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that men are the patriarchy and we're</v>

2564
01:50:04.421 --> 01:50:07.840
<v Speaker 1>dominating the world and we're almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sub human.</v>

2565
01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:11.050
<v Speaker 1>We're responsible for all these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So men with issues like,</v>

2566
01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cry me a fucking river.</v>

2567
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:15.700
<v Speaker 1>What about women with issues?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about Trans people with issues?</v>

2568
01:50:15.701 --> 01:50:18.070
<v Speaker 1>What about gay people with issues?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about black?</v>

2569
01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

2570
01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Like a regular white guy with issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your issues are bullshit.</v>

2571
01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:24.580
<v Speaker 1>They can't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2572
01:50:24.581 --> 01:50:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You are who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't change the fact that you're a</v>

2573
01:50:27.131 --> 01:50:29.500
<v Speaker 1>white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a white guy with problems,</v>

2574
01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:32.500
<v Speaker 1>nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't they see that it all connects</v>

2575
01:50:32.501 --> 01:50:32.830
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

2576
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:35.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't see that white makes</v>

2577
01:50:35.201 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 1>everybody else unhappy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the dope man they don't because</v>

2578
01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:42.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not convenient for their narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narratives that you're responsible</v>

2579
01:50:42.491 --> 01:50:45.460
<v Speaker 1>for all the problems in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you're just Dan Dodi from</v>

2580
01:50:45.461 --> 01:50:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Bozeman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

2581
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:48.101
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2582
01:50:48.101 --> 01:50:48.911
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

2583
01:50:48.911 --> 01:50:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the most powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the podcast that I'm launching is a</v>

2584
01:50:53.291 --> 01:50:58.120
<v Speaker 1>self improvement podcasts for guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead of going to experts and</v>

2585
01:50:58.510 --> 01:50:59.380
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2586
01:50:59.410 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best morning routine that you</v>

2587
01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:03.760
<v Speaker 1>can do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Designing a routine or whatever.</v>

2588
01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to regular guys and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and asking them to share more vulnerable</v>

2589
01:51:10.121 --> 01:51:13.240
<v Speaker 1>than they would normally would because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens in these scenarios</v>

2590
01:51:13.241 --> 01:51:16.480
<v Speaker 1>is that we learn from each other just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple human fucking beings.</v>

2591
01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.100
<v Speaker 1>We're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2592
01:51:18.101 --> 01:51:21.520
<v Speaker 1>like one guy might share that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>having trouble with his son,</v>

2593
01:51:21.730 --> 01:51:23.200
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his kid,</v>

2594
01:51:23.201 --> 01:51:24.070
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know how to do it.</v>

2595
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:27.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no matter what,</v>

2596
01:51:27.001 --> 01:51:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a bunch of other guys will say</v>

2597
01:51:30.671 --> 01:51:32.350
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2598
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was the only one feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2599
01:51:34.631 --> 01:51:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's just all of a sudden you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's back this isolation thing,</v>

2600
01:51:37.481 --> 01:51:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you think that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're fucking special,</v>

2601
01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all think that we're still unique and</v>

2602
01:51:43.061 --> 01:51:45.610
<v Speaker 1>the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we actually took the time to connect</v>

2603
01:51:45.611 --> 01:51:47.140
<v Speaker 1>with one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>

2604
01:51:47.170 --> 01:51:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot.</v>

2605
01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:53.140
<v Speaker 1>And just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that is enough to,</v>

2606
01:51:53.570 --> 01:51:56.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drastically change somebody's Day.</v>

2607
01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And what is motivating you to venture</v>
<v Speaker 1>off because you were working for 0.0 is</v>

2608
01:52:01.541 --> 01:52:06.280
<v Speaker 1>big production company and they make no</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat eater and Anthony Bourdain's show</v>

2609
01:52:06.281 --> 01:52:09.550
<v Speaker 1>and all these different shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's motivating you to step away from</v>

2610
01:52:09.551 --> 01:52:12.970
<v Speaker 1>that and start doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I've always wanted to do</v>

2611
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:17.200
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what compels you?</v>

2612
01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I want to help guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

2613
01:52:21.670 --> 01:52:22.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2614
01:52:22.451 --> 01:52:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that I can,</v>

2615
01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's just one guy,</v>

2616
01:52:25.930 --> 01:52:28.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but working out there with these kids</v>

2617
01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:30.700
<v Speaker 1>and seeing all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

2618
01:52:30.701 --> 01:52:32.980
<v Speaker 1>it just left me with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deepest,</v>

2619
01:52:32.981 --> 01:52:36.640
<v Speaker 1>deepest satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment,</v>

2620
01:52:36.670 --> 01:52:38.950
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also a sense of purpose.</v>

2621
01:52:38.951 --> 01:52:40.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I tell you what,</v>

2622
01:52:40.421 --> 01:52:40.931

<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

2623
01:52:40.931 --> 01:52:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I had a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a son last year and when he came</v>

2624
01:52:44.291 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 1>out and there was something inside me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that said,</v>

2625
01:52:46.461 --> 01:52:49.850
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't act on what you know,</v>

2626
01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you can bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if fuck you,</v>

2627
01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.710
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is your key.</v>

2628
01:52:54.810 --> 01:52:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there is,</v>

2629
01:52:57.710 --> 01:52:58.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2631
01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2632
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 1>a fairly sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feel I was born a sensitive kid,</v>

2633
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:05.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feel other people's pain.</v>

2634
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2635
01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:09.920
<v Speaker 1>working with these kids and now these</v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

2636
01:53:09.921 --> 01:53:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

2637
01:53:11.610 --> 01:53:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want good for people,</v>

2638

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want good for you.</v>

2639
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I want good for my family and I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for,</v>

2640
01:53:18.051 --> 01:53:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel connected and I,</v>

2641
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:21.410
<v Speaker 1>and I want to do it right.</v>

2642
01:53:22.110 --> 01:53:24.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a noble purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just curious about like what,</v>

2643
01:53:24.810 --> 01:53:25.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2644
01:53:25.291 --> 01:53:29.190
<v Speaker 2>you have a very promising career in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lucrative career with 0.0.</v>

2645
01:53:29.191 --> 01:53:33.120
<v Speaker 2>So for you to leave that it has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really compelling sort of a,</v>

2646
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:34.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2647
01:53:34.371 --> 01:53:39.371
<v Speaker 1>that job and that career was an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild ride and in some ways felt like,</v>

2648
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:42.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2649
01:53:42.741 --> 01:53:46.190
<v Speaker 1>a temporary sidebar from what I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant to do.</v>

2650
01:53:46.191 --> 01:53:46.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

2651
01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I've been writing for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2652
01:53:50.630 --> 01:53:51.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2653
01:53:51.831 --> 01:53:54.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever this thing is that I'm doing</v>

2654
01:53:54.321 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it chose me somehow or I don't know.</v>

2655
01:53:57.051 --> 01:53:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true or not,</v>

2656
01:53:58.801 --> 01:54:03.350
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long can you ignore the thing inside</v>

2657
01:54:03.351 --> 01:54:06.800
<v Speaker 1>you that screams at you that says you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do this,</v>

2658
01:54:06.801 --> 01:54:08.470
<v Speaker 1>you have to do this or you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2659
01:54:08.490 --> 01:54:09.230

2660
01:54:09.230 --> 01:54:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely shouldn't.</v>

2661
01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's obviously beneficial and so</v>

2662
01:54:13.591 --> 01:54:16.340
<v Speaker 1>obviously something you're compelled to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and it's obviously something that you</v>

2663
01:54:16.341 --> 01:54:18.770
<v Speaker 1>feel is very fulfilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why ignore it?</v>
