00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:21.864
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd let my lungs fucking hill from the </v>

00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 2>abuse I have inflicted on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last 30 fucking edibles.</v>

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 2>What about spring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

11
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.674
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had another bull since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I broke it in Boston September </v>

12
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 2>29th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So out of respect for Sobrato,</v>

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't do another book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done that at booth.</v>

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.913
<v Speaker 2>Something was wrong with my stomach so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out how I was a lactose </v>

15
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 2>intolerant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lactose intolerant.</v>

16
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I fucking eat much cheese or milk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking up,</v>

17
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nightmare.</v>

18
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 2>So I had to cut that out of my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No much without cheese.</v>

19
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 2>American cheese now know Swiss no more.</v>

<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

21
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 2>And then I had to cut out the edibles </v>
<v Speaker 2>that give me a weird feeling like he had</v>

22
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.013

<v Speaker 2>just gone somewhere else and I didn't </v>

66
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.543
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

<v Speaker 2>A coke on top of it.</v>

72
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could drink two cokes for breakfast.</v>

73
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember I grew up in the east coast and</v>

74
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I caught a bad habit early on after my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother died.</v>

75
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I caught that and I wouldn't eat it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would leave and eat at the Deli.</v>

76
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I went on the member one fucking cream </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese and jelly on a.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Clear cheese and jelly.</v>

79
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:14.914
<v Speaker 2>For breakfast I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to open up with cream cheese and </v>

80
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:18.514
<v Speaker 2>jelly on a poppy seed role with a 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>ounce of coke for breakfast for years </v>

81
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 2>and I was in shape that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

82
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:27.090

<v Speaker 2>you can't be with liver.</v>

83
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.203

<v Speaker 2>Nobody eats cream cheese and jelly for </v>

84
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 2>breakfast on a roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more cream cheese and jelly.</v>

85
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.090

<v Speaker 2>muffins.</v>

88
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:43.000

<v Speaker 2>on them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

113
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.073

<v Speaker 2>I used to have to work out with ear </v>

114
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 2>plugs on and I get high and go throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks with Jesus.</v>

115
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't what life is when you had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ear infection.</v>

116
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>The earplugs kept your equilibrium and </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

117

<v Speaker 2>I don't know what life is.</v>

118
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 2>When you're working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hear your heartbeat,</v>

119
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 2>but yet pump pump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's trippy shit.</v>

120
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.913
<v Speaker 2>You know everlast has a ticker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got an artificial valve and he put </v>

121
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:17.860
<v Speaker 2>the microphone up to his chassis here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

122
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna hear that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck you tripping in there for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he say?</v>

124
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Like 18 years I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 2>He had a heart attack a long ass time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

126
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Bad Valve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

128
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 2>But if I was clean of off we for 29 </v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

129
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I might as well go for it for at least a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

130
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's run around marijuana.</v>

131
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Just make a comeback just to see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>would it be like.</v>

132
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.253
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one thing that did happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>last year when we did sober October and </v>

133
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 2>it took a month off when I started back </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

134
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I'd get nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real nervous,</v>

135
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 2>scared to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd go on stage.</v>

136
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel real strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody once told me,</v>

137
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 2>a great woman once told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

138
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 2>if you think getting high in life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird with you,</v>

139
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.983
<v Speaker 2>stop getting high and it's a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking adventure and she's truly a lot </v>

140
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 2>of aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called you I one October,</v>

141
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 2>second one night I got home from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store.</v>

142
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 2>You know when you get home from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original room dog,</v>

143
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.553
<v Speaker 2>especially when you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those nights when I went </v>

144
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 2>in there and that was rocky Balboa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just touched gloves and I measured and</v>

145
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 2>I just started going through the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 15 minutes.</v>

146
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember driving up Laurel Canyon </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

147
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do with myself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went home.</v>

148
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:38.030
<v Speaker 2>It was like October second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was 1130.</v>

149
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.883
<v Speaker 2>I started smoking reefer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the calm down a little bit and I went </v>

150
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:42.254
<v Speaker 2>down and I started with sign of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>times by Prince and I just left it on </v>

151
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:46.634
<v Speaker 2>auto play and they just took me into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prince fucking cave and I ended up on </v>

152
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 2>beautiful ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he starts singing,</v>

153
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 2>do you want him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I called you up.</v>

154
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:57.374
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why I can't do sober October </v>

155
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 2>because I get so high and mighty.</v>

156
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Come down off the stage and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to upstage.</v>

157
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 2>You need something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since I don't drink,</v>

158
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared to come up that hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drinking.</v>

159
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I have to smoke reefer to come down at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and music.</v>

160
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that calms me down</v>
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>

161
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Do write at night after your sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write about what happened.</v>

162
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to about how lucky I am that I'm</v>

163
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 2>still performing at the store at 55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I right about that.</v>

164
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I ate a bag of Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll get them tomorrow night,</v>

165
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>

166
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Whatever just is flowing through my head</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I have music on.</v>

167
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:37.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm drinking a water and I'm just going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to back and fucking Toca fucking 22 hits</v>

168
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 2>off a bike and I love listening to music</v>
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>

169
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 2>That's my hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing to like when you get out of</v>

170
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:44.534
<v Speaker 2>the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing to sit yourself down and </v>

171
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.890
<v Speaker 2>make yourself work and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

172
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 2>because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

173
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a good set in.</v>

174
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the best time to write.</v>

175
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I think everything's popping while go </v>
<v Speaker 2>home and make corrections.</v>

176
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.083
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I said that fuck too early or </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I said that and I shouldn't have </v>

177
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 3>said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

178
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.403
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't try to ride it and I'm gone at </v>

179
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:08.460
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might drive unless something's really.</v>

180
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I think my brain is shot at night </v>
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>

181
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Is it because you did your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>fucking kid,</v>

184
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.193

<v Speaker 3>did a podcast talk to people all day </v>

185
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:24.940
<v Speaker 3>about shit that doesn't matter by night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the,</v>

186
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 3>I liked to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I play with mercy.</v>

187
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 3>I talked to my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do a protein shake,</v>

188
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll drop mercy off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go home and then I go to the coffee</v>

189
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 3>shop and for 30 minutes I'll call my </v>
<v Speaker 3>peeps in jersey,</v>

190
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:42.594

<v Speaker 3>and then I'll get eggs at the coffee </v>

<v Speaker 3>Once my breakfast is gun,</v>

192
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.793
<v Speaker 3>I write my page down for the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I take my ipad up and I either </v>

193
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:55.134
<v Speaker 3>write a chapter in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to write towards the book and </v>

194
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 3>while I'm writing another book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're writing a book,</v>

195
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:00.234
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying,</v>

196
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long have you been doing this?</v>

197
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 3>Twenty two fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>

198
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 3>Twenty two fucking years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

199
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I forced myself and with the IPAD,</v>

200
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a whole thing on,</v>

201
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.243
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole writing thing so I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>just turn that chapter off and go to </v>

202
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:18.684
<v Speaker 3>another document and click on the post </v>
<v Speaker 3>netflix material and then I got a thing </v>

203
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 3>that we're working with immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality.</v>

204
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.210
<v Speaker 3>So I think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to that.</v>

205
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 3>So now my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all great.</v>

206
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I think just doing that exercise every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day is good for me.</v>

207
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:33.864
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to write comedy every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather just go down to the store to </v>

208
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 3>throw something out there and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>get excited.</v>

209
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 3>And like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going anywhere else no more than</v>

210
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back to the school,</v>

211
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.173
<v Speaker 3>no Improv soft spots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially after I shot the Netflix </v>

212
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:54.920
<v Speaker 3>special and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all came to me after they had that 10</v>

213
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 3>years and especially after she died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

214
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:57.624
<v Speaker 3>people you ever go to like an acting </v>
<v Speaker 3>class and people refer to Stanislavski </v>

215
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.523
<v Speaker 3>and all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten years from now people going to be </v>

216
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:04.614
<v Speaker 3>referring to the Mitzi shore technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was something that every I was </v>

217
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 3>talking to Duncan about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to rob about it.</v>

218
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>I know she said something to us at one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point that we were like,</v>

219
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something</v>

220
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was telling him this on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

221
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>that there was a time she didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that in the cobit and wouldn't let</v>

222
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 2>me do it in the main room in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original fucking crazy is that,</v>

223
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 2>that's to show you a genius in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she was like,</v>

224
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could light yourself on fire and the</v>

225
00:11:37.241 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 2>original,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck,</v>

226
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 2>but in the main room you can't do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're killing my room.</v>

227
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Like the comics afterwards just could </v>
<v Speaker 2>not follow it.</v>

228
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Like they could just not following that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesson right there.</v>

229
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 2>That was about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was brilliant,</v>

230
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.560
<v Speaker 2>but it</v>

231
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.013
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no good versions of that bit </v>

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.383
<v Speaker 2>He took boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled them up with bricks and just </v>

347
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Speaker 2>stuck them in a warehouse and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>went public,</v>

348
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.403
<v Speaker 2>so he got everybody to come down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all his inventory and all these </v>

349
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:34.704
<v Speaker 2>fact checkers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're checking boxes as a brick sort </v>

350
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:38.450
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

351
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.353
<v Speaker 2>And he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean five fucking warehouses all </v>

352
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:42.174
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will all fake and he got all this </v>

353
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:44.154
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fled to Israel and he fled for a </v>

354
00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:48.210
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they knew he was a pussy hound.</v>

355
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they got them like Escobar style.</v>

356
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Speaker 2>They got them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 2>on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to a store or something.</v>

358
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:56.724
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they did was they put a blonde </v>

359
00:18:58.621 --> 00:18:59.454
<v Speaker 2>on the side of the road with a mini </v>
<v Speaker 2>skirt and they knew eventually he would </v>

360
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 2>drive by and stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

361
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.593
<v Speaker 2>he stopped.</v>

362
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.853
<v Speaker 2>That's how they nailed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the Google the way the richest </v>

363
00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 2>woman in the world where they got their </v>
<v Speaker 2>money from.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

389
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:35.574
<v Speaker 2>are you a rancher?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am Radio show from New York City like </v>

390
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.850
<v Speaker 2>this got fucked up and they were paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

391
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was on for a while and he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>nappy headed hoes and they're like,</v>

392
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.960
<v Speaker 2>cut that sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

393
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 4>called people nappy headed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to compete with stern.</v>

394
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was.</v>

395
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.030
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was definitely some of that.</v>

396
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.130
<v Speaker 4>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

397
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.840
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to be outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even before Stern,</v>

398
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.170
<v Speaker 4>I believe it just wasn't at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>

399
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:07.470
<v Speaker 4>Sterns outrageousness was nationwide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ims was really like an east coast thing,</v>

400
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:08.763
<v Speaker 4>like people knew about them in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had never heard about him in New York </v>

401
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 4>or in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had heard about stern.</v>

402
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.460
<v Speaker 4>We all knew about stern but nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody really knew about it.</v>

403
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Never made it there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

404
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.850
<v Speaker 4>And then when I came to New York it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end,</v>

405
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.713
<v Speaker 4>like when stern was already the king and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm us was just sort of like this guy </v>

406
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:28.830
<v Speaker 4>that he hated and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is this man?</v>

407
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.440
<v Speaker 4>Who is this I guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he had a TV show for awhile and</v>

408
00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:35.530
<v Speaker 4>then during the TV show we'd see him in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the studio and it was,</v>

409
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no disrespect,</v>

410
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 4>but it was really fucking boring.</v>

411
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.490
<v Speaker 4>It was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was no life to them.</v>

412
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.680
<v Speaker 4>Like their opinions weren't that </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

413
00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:45.514
<v Speaker 4>It was him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was another guy there that </v>

414
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.210
<v Speaker 4>looked like it was just waiting for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buzzer,</v>

415
00:21:48.211 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 4>the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's waiting to go home.</v>

416
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:51.390
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a woman that was with</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

417
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.300
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

418
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 4>There was no life in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like can you watch the stern show?</v>

419
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.253
<v Speaker 4>There'd be midgets shooting bottle </v>
<v Speaker 4>rockets out of their ass halls and porn </v>

420
00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:02.350
<v Speaker 4>stars riding dildos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was chaos.</v>

421
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Speaker 4>There was a plastic all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grounds.</v>

422
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Girls would be squirting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just madness like no one had ever</v>

423
00:22:07.841 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that that's good or bad,</v>

424
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.170
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was exciting.</v>

425
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.330
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're driving to work in the morning,</v>

426
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.313
<v Speaker 4>you're hearing some girl freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she's riding on some fucking </v>

427
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 4>that Sybian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd make girls right on.</v>

428
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.520
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was madness.</v>

429
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:22.563
<v Speaker 4>So like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like you had never heard anything </v>

430
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 4>like that on the radio before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you would hear about ims and I'm</v>

431
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.653
<v Speaker 4>as a rural water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We brought her to this warning or like </v>

432
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 4>what's the hr just be at the end?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>

433
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 4>it was in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so it was dead.</v>

434
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.423
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was dry and I said on stern it was </v>

435
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.670
<v Speaker 4>great flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Flavor.</v>

436
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.660
<v Speaker 4>The one time on Stern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's so many great steroids to</v>

437
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.030
<v Speaker 4>already was so great back already was </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best party was fucking the May.</v>

438
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 4>Have you listened to an old already when</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had just gotten off the subway.</v>

439
00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.830
<v Speaker 4>He just shot heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had sunglasses on.</v>

440
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:02.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fall asleep.</v>

441
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking insane.</v>

442
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.590
<v Speaker 4>And he said that they encouraged him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

443
00:23:08.591 --> 00:23:09.424
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do when a guy's </v>

444
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.240
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

445
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.073
<v Speaker 4>You're going to help them if you help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with people that are that </v>

446
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:20.170
<v Speaker 4>fucked up is the only thing that ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>helps them is themselves.</v>

447
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.093
<v Speaker 4>The only thing it's like they have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit rock bottom and then they have to </v>

448
00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 4>decide they're going to do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

449
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 4>but when you do get a lot of love for </v>
<v Speaker 4>being fucked up,</v>

450
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 4>that is kind of a problem because you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>start to think,</v>

451
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.380
<v Speaker 4>this is my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My thing is being a fucked up guy.</v>

452
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 4>People love me when I'm fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I do.</v>

453
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can fall into that.</v>

454
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.440
<v Speaker 4>Couple Belushi had the same.</v>

455
00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Speaker 2>The other guy got arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had the same problem.</v>

456
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a neat you fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was a pizza parlor when</v>

457
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name was nick,</v>

458
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:57.890
<v Speaker 2>the Greek fucking tremendous pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though he was Greek,</v>

459
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:01.870
<v Speaker 2>like we let it slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put the Sicilian by the window and it</v>

460
00:24:01.871 --> 00:24:05.720

<v Speaker 6>The first self made woman on the list is</v>

588
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.513
<v Speaker 6>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how to say this woman's </v>

589
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:16.721
<v Speaker 6>name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Z,</v>

590
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:19.750
<v Speaker 6>h o u.</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's one word.</v>

591
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.033
<v Speaker 6>Q,</v>
<v Speaker 6>U I n f e I zoo wouldn't fee who was </v>

592
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:28.720
<v Speaker 6>born to a poor family of China,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dropped out of school at 16.</v>

593
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:34.020
<v Speaker 6>She went on to found in an enormously </v>
<v Speaker 6>successful technology company.</v>

594
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:36.483
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you put men back into the </v>

595
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:38.494
<v Speaker 6>equation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's only 198th richest person in the </v>

596
00:30:40.511 --> 00:30:44.010
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No matter how you feel about the concept</v>

597
00:30:44.011 --> 00:30:44.844
<v Speaker 6>of few people hoarding enormous wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The notion that women can only access </v>

598
00:30:47.771 --> 00:30:51.970
<v Speaker 6>money and power through their families </v>
<v Speaker 6>or husbands seems medieval at best.</v>

599
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.710
<v Speaker 6>Yet we see it occur at the very top of </v>
<v Speaker 6>many professions outside of the business</v>

600
00:30:56.711 --> 00:30:57.544
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

601
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 6>Most people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you read the next stuff?</v>

602
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A recent high profile examples.</v>

603
00:31:05.471 --> 00:31:07.570
<v Speaker 6>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 6>during her presidential campaign,</v>

604
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.613
<v Speaker 6>the first female major party nominee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she campaigned on a ticket of </v>

605
00:31:11.771 --> 00:31:12.604
<v Speaker 6>empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yet although she is accomplished in her </v>

606
00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:17.560
<v Speaker 6>own right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she entered politics as the wife of Bill</v>

607
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.393
<v Speaker 6>Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And his undoubtedly benefited from his </v>

608
00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:22.260
<v Speaker 6>prestige and connections.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

609
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.050
<v Speaker 6>Well that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But also it was,</v>

610
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.903
<v Speaker 6>it was a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't mean for you to read that she </v>

611
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:28.110
<v Speaker 6>was a lawyer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

612
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.680
<v Speaker 6>she was a senator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

613
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.440
<v Speaker 6>oprah is up there as the world's richest</v>
<v Speaker 6>women,</v>

614
00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:33.274
<v Speaker 6>period.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's a weird thing because they're </v>

615
00:31:35.571 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 6>saying I'm not a big fan of Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 6>Clinton.</v>

616
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:43.030
<v Speaker 6>But by saying she definitely entered </v>
<v Speaker 6>because she was,</v>

617
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was married to him,</v>

618
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.950
<v Speaker 6>but she was a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

619
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:49.510
<v Speaker 6>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's an accomplished person.</v>

620
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 6>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's educated.</v>

621
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:52.030
<v Speaker 6>Accomplish who's a senator.</v>

622
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate when people say,</v>

623
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I ain't know what you at the right place</v>

624
00:31:57.551 --> 00:31:58.690
<v Speaker 6>at the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bitch.</v>

625
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 6>I know you jumped in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you jumped,</v>

626
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 6>you jumped bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's the problem.</v>

627
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm not mad at nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't say she got into.</v>

628
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 6>She may be a little help.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A push here,</v>

629
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:11.200
<v Speaker 6>a call here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But she jumped.</v>

630
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.000
<v Speaker 6>There's a great book I'm reading right </v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

631
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.760
<v Speaker 6>It's called outliers by Malcolm </v>
<v Speaker 6>Mcdowell.</v>

632
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.653
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's all about what makes people </v>

633
00:32:19.661 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 6>successful and why they were successful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there are a lot of factors,</v>

634
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:24.904
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of factors in when you </v>

635
00:32:25.871 --> 00:32:27.550
<v Speaker 6>were born,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what?</v>

636
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:30.640
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of it he goes on about hockey</v>
<v Speaker 6>players,</v>

637
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:31.563
<v Speaker 6>about professional hockey players that </v>
<v Speaker 6>almost all of them were born at a </v>

638
00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:38.530
<v Speaker 6>certain time so that they were at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>end of the age cutoff.</v>

639
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 6>Like say if</v>

640
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.850
<v Speaker 4>you're between 10 and 11 when you go </v>
<v Speaker 4>into what is that fifth grade?</v>

641
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.300
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're one of the oldest kids,</v>

642
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 4>you have a way better chance of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful at hockey because your body's</v>

643
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:53.054
<v Speaker 4>more mature than whether you're one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the youngest kids that goes into sixth </v>

644
00:32:56.301 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 4>grade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with your fifth grade or sixth grade,</v>

645
00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 4>like what year you were born is a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>factor.</v>

646
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.820
<v Speaker 4>So the kids that were born later so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're older rather the kids over there</v>

647
00:33:06.821 --> 00:33:07.654
<v Speaker 4>that are older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they enter into the fifth grade or </v>

648
00:33:09.231 --> 00:33:10.064
<v Speaker 4>sixth grade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like across the board </v>

649
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.670
<v Speaker 4>unanimously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the top level professionals.</v>

650
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:21.790
<v Speaker 4>We're all older kids in younger grades </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that they're planning against smaller</v>

651
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get more time,</v>

652
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're better,</v>

653
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 4>so they get more coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beget more hours playing.</v>

654
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.333
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a lot of factors in like one of the </v>

655
00:33:31.461 --> 00:33:32.294
<v Speaker 4>things about Bill Gates that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole great chapter on Bill </v>

656
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.970
<v Speaker 4>Gates and about when Bill Gates was </v>
<v Speaker 4>young,</v>

657
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 4>the school that he went to had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer class that,</v>

658
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed him to do coding and then he got</v>

659
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:47.180
<v Speaker 4>into the University of Washington.</v>

660
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:51.230
<v Speaker 4>They would let him get into their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their computer room from 3:00</v>

661
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.011
<v Speaker 4>AM to 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>AM.</v>

662
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:52.844
<v Speaker 4>They had this open block,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so him and his friends would sneak into </v>

663
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:56.750
<v Speaker 4>that place at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning.</v>

664
00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.170
<v Speaker 4>So all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different factors that lead to</v>

665
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 4>someone being like super successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that you work hard,</v>

666
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.030
<v Speaker 4>it's sometimes you get these weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantages in life.</v>

667
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:12.530
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure hard work plays a factor.</v>

668
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.430
<v Speaker 4>If you don't do nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just sit around and,</v>

669
00:34:15.431 --> 00:34:16.264
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and woe is me and cry and think the </v>

670
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 4>world's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going anywhere.</v>

671
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.910
<v Speaker 4>But the people that make it to the very </v>
<v Speaker 4>top,</v>

672
00:34:22.911 --> 00:34:24.380
<v Speaker 4>that Bill Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Steve Jobs,</v>

673
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.420
<v Speaker 4>they have a bunch of things going for </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

674
00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:29.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not just hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also circumstance,</v>

675
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.520
<v Speaker 4>fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they are,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

677
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:33.490

<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

678
00:34:33.491 --> 00:34:35.330
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who encourages them.</v>

679
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.253
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of and what time they </v>

<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

683
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of factors.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you look at the two of them in the </v>

894
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 2>but that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell because Keith Richards</v>

<v Speaker 2>is smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should go out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>21 year olds out of the audience.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Those,</v>

1036
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those fucking guys.</v>

1037
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:34.004
<v Speaker 6>That's a hard style.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very hard style isn't a GSP stone was </v>

1038
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:40.454
<v Speaker 6>so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1039
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:46.570
<v Speaker 6>I think you almost killed Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure they really hard hitting</v>

1040
00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:50.320
<v Speaker 6>motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a very hard kicks.</v>

1041
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 6>Lot of wheel kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What they do in the tournament's.</v>

1042
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.850
<v Speaker 6>Kilkee shouldn't tournament's they'd </v>
<v Speaker 6>punch to the body full blast,</v>

1043
00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.800
<v Speaker 6>but kick to the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the head,</v>

1044
00:52:57.801 --> 00:52:58.634
<v Speaker 6>the body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're standing right in front of </v>

1045
00:52:59.631 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 6>each other and beat the fuck out of each</v>
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>

1046
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:02.234
<v Speaker 6>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like kind of the opposite of </v>

1047
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:09.970
<v Speaker 6>taekwondo was a lot of kicks and punches</v>
<v Speaker 6>only to the body too.</v>

1048
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:12.760
<v Speaker 6>But Kyoko Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1049
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:13.623
<v Speaker 6>they through leg kicks in there and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there wasn't a lot of foot work with </v>

1050
00:53:16.221 --> 00:53:17.060
<v Speaker 6>most of those guys.</v>

1051
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 6>Most of those guys stood in front of </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other and battery each other.</v>

1052
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:21.283
<v Speaker 6>But a lot of killed Christian guys went </v>
<v Speaker 6>on to be really successful in </v>

1053
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 6>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

1054
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.420
<v Speaker 6>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1055
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.493
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the Holland influence in </v>
<v Speaker 6>kickboxing came from qcc shouldn't </v>

1056
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.113
<v Speaker 6>background,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they started out with kewill </v>

1057
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 6>cushion and kickboxing and then they </v>
<v Speaker 6>learned Thai Thai techniques as well.</v>

1058
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 6>But a lot of those guys had a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an influence of a cube auction.</v>

1059
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:47.290
<v Speaker 6>Karate is very big in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Started in martial arts.</v>

1060
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:49.830
<v Speaker 6>The big thing was just sweep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sweep,</v>

1061
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 6>delay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Early seventies,</v>

1062
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:56.510
<v Speaker 6>everybody swept to high kicks and even </v>
<v Speaker 6>if it was a spinning back kick your,</v>

1063
00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 6>the third one was a sweep and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>motherfucker was gone.</v>

1064
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:02.603
<v Speaker 6>I used to go to all those karate </v>
<v Speaker 6>tournament and that was my shit I throw </v>

1065
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:06.323

<v Speaker 6>So he doesn't even want them to hit </v>

1066
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.920
<v Speaker 6>sweeps allergenic and nobody's sweeps </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

1067
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 6>Nobody sweeper still do an MMA and more </v>
<v Speaker 6>tied to a little bit,</v>

1068

<v Speaker 6>Never made,</v>

1069
00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:19.920
<v Speaker 6>but not as much as I'd expect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good sweep with a good fucking leg.</v>

1070
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.100
<v Speaker 6>If you set them up with good old </v>
<v Speaker 6>fashioned and sweep.</v>

<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1075
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.333
<v Speaker 6>the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>John Jones has it to all those </v>

1076
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:35.214
<v Speaker 6>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does that show that little sweep that I </v>

1077
00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:38.640
<v Speaker 6>liked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that little sweet,</v>

1078
00:54:38.641 --> 00:54:39.474
<v Speaker 6>but I'm talking about from the fighters </v>
<v Speaker 6>position to just coming to you with a </v>

1079
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:45.600

<v Speaker 6>Monday.</v>

1080
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 6>It takes a bunch of fakes or I'm here </v>
<v Speaker 6>with them.</v>

1081
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.820
<v Speaker 6>It's basically off like blah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blah blah.</v>

1082
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:54.530
<v Speaker 6>And instead of the elbow coming around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your leg comes around and sleeps.</v>

1083
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.393
<v Speaker 6>That guy off his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He lands on his back and you went back </v>

1084
00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.140
<v Speaker 6>with your left.</v>

1085
00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:58.973
<v Speaker 6>There's still some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some guys that are really good at </v>

1086
00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:02.070
<v Speaker 6>sweeps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thing about mma is just,</v>

1087
00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:03.720
<v Speaker 6>there's so many different things going </v>
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

1088
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:04.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in Moy,</v>

1089
00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:08.220
<v Speaker 6>Tai sweeps are huge and more tied to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>big part of the sport.</v>

1090
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:09.163
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's why I got cast when fights in </v>

1091
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:13.263
<v Speaker 6>Bellator,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's so high level and more now he's </v>

1092
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 6>getting into mma and he's fucking guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>up,</v>

1093
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:20.010
<v Speaker 6>not just with sweeps and spinning </v>
<v Speaker 6>elbows,</v>

1094
00:55:20.011 --> 00:55:21.760
<v Speaker 6>all sorts of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is,</v>

1095
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.130
<v Speaker 6>that his level of more tie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1096
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 6>more time involves a lot of grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot,</v>

1097
00:55:26.521 --> 00:55:27.354
<v Speaker 6>a lot of weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Listen to Kenny Florian one time and he </v>

1098
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:31.510
<v Speaker 6>goes that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1099
00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.553
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more tire even as a couple of aspects </v>

1100
00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:37.260
<v Speaker 6>from Jujitsu in it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess not Jujitsu,</v>

1101
00:55:37.261 --> 00:55:40.190
<v Speaker 6>but something Roman Greco Roman </v>
<v Speaker 6>mountains.</v>

1102
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:41.063
<v Speaker 6>Right behind that though is clenching.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of clench work and those </v>

1103
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:45.684
<v Speaker 6>guys develop really strong cores and </v>
<v Speaker 6>knacks that grabbing her by the back of </v>

1104
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 6>the neck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>moving each other around,</v>

1105
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 6>sweeping each other all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so much involved in framing with</v>

1106
00:55:55.441 --> 00:55:58.980
<v Speaker 6>your forearms and sweeping the legs out </v>
<v Speaker 6>and twisting and,</v>

1107
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.053
<v Speaker 6>and changing angles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a great one when you learn the </v>

1108
00:56:03.901 --> 00:56:08.160
<v Speaker 6>other aspects of wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you learn takedowns and control and</v>

1109
00:56:08.161 --> 00:56:08.994
<v Speaker 6>then when you learn Jiu Jitsu and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these other like having that background </v>

1110
00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:12.834
<v Speaker 6>from the clench or Moitai is so gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 6>because so many different things opened </v>

1111
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.873
<v Speaker 6>up from their elbows open up from their </v>
<v Speaker 6>knees to the body open up from their us </v>

1112
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 6>in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wrestled one year in high school.</v>

1113
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.913
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you wrestle for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was still doing taekwondo at </v>

1114
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:29.940
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to figure out what.</v>

1115
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
<v Speaker 2>What was more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1116
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.000
<v Speaker 2>what was more important to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

1117
00:56:34.001 --> 00:56:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too exhaust.</v>

1118
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.000
<v Speaker 2>That wrestling shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

1119
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.680
<v Speaker 2>he used to have that fucking weight room</v>
<v Speaker 2>down 290.</v>

1120
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.593
<v Speaker 2>They were doing the yoga before Hatha </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga was invented that room and it was </v>

1121
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 2>hotter than bestest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Covered off the ceiling.</v>

1122
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.320
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is covering these pipes?</v>

1123
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:55.150
<v Speaker 2>No one's checked these pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1124
00:56:55.151 --> 00:56:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't want cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening in this?</v>

1125
00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:02.370
<v Speaker 2>The fucking best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those that we breathe as best as I paint</v>

1126
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:06.580
<v Speaker 2>chips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a guide and all the water had led.</v>

1127
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.110
<v Speaker 2>It didn't have land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

1128
00:57:08.111 --> 00:57:09.970
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the park yesterday,</v>

1129
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 2>my daughter and there was a lady next to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and she asked me where I was from and</v>

1130
00:57:14.201 --> 00:57:15.034
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her father was from Brooklyn and we </v>

1131
00:57:15.821 --> 00:57:16.654
<v Speaker 2>started talking and she had beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>two year old and a two year old got </v>

1132
00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:20.794
<v Speaker 2>caught on one of the monkey bars and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>father had to go over and help her and </v>

1133
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:24.903
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember going up to my father's </v>

1134
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.380
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and seeing this play art </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were nothing like these are.</v>

1135
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.200
<v Speaker 2>I still remember coming from Cuba and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

1136
00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:33.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in monkey bars,</v>

1137
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:34.443
<v Speaker 2>but then you get so good that you put </v>
<v Speaker 2>your legs up and you hang by your knees </v>

1138
00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:42.070
<v Speaker 2>and one day Brian and hanging right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I landed on that concrete.</v>

1139
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.850
<v Speaker 2>There was no rubber in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just straight up concrete.</v>

1140
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Half the first grade I fucking torched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I switched the first grade.</v>

1141
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I landed right on my fucking neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got on a monkey bar.</v>

1142
00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:55.943
<v Speaker 2>Got Break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of kids don't fuck around with </v>

1143
00:57:58.901 --> 00:57:59.734
<v Speaker 2>monkey bars at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thought I broke my arm in the monkey </v>

1144
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:02.374
<v Speaker 2>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My daughter broke her arm in a monkey </v>

1145
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:04.414
<v Speaker 2>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My another kid in my daughter's class </v>

1146
00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 2>broke her arm in a monkey body down with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a monkey bar.</v>

1147
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:11.710

1151
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:24.340
<v Speaker 2>You're six years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you grabbing ahold of bars and you're</v>

1152
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:25.174
<v Speaker 2>swinging and you just don't really have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dexterity of the hand strength and </v>

1155
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:38.920
<v Speaker 2>She does it until my hands bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dog little blisters.</v>

1156
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:41.290
<v Speaker 2>The mother's got to put a bandaid on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fierce.</v>

1157
00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that about it.</v>

1158
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.290
<v Speaker 2>She's fierce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take it to.</v>

1159
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:49.600
<v Speaker 2>I put a lot of time into that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1160
00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird because of the cabinet</v>

1161
00:58:52.531 --> 00:58:56.320
<v Speaker 2>on situation and the Harvey Weinstein </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

1162
00:58:56.321 --> 00:58:57.790
<v Speaker 2>You're a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dad.</v>

1163
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 2>It's different than how you got to raise</v>
<v Speaker 2>your daughter.</v>

1164
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has affected me in a way.</v>

1165
00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:03.183
<v Speaker 2>The capital thing was pissing me off for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few weeks because I don't like the </v>

1166
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:07.384
<v Speaker 2>idea that they could come back to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>for something you did in high school </v>

1167
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:13.480
<v Speaker 2>that that's just not right in my world.</v>

1168
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Unless I fucked you in the ass in </v>
<v Speaker 2>highschool and covered your mouth.</v>

1169
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:19.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1170
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the thing he did do </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1171
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:24.890
<v Speaker 2>He did cover covered amount or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who knows what really happened?</v>

1172
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows.</v>

1173
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was 36 years ago.</v>

1174
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.713
<v Speaker 2>I know for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known you for 20 and I've seen you </v>

1175
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.970
<v Speaker 2>sweeten up over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all change.</v>

1176
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:37.760
<v Speaker 2>You're not the same Joe Rogan I met 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1177
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not the same guy was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>highschool school.</v>

1178
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Come on please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was a.</v>

1179
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:43.933
<v Speaker 2>He was a guy that was hanging around </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of drunk jocks and we all </v>

1180
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:48.770
<v Speaker 2>remember drunk and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1181
00:59:48.771 --> 00:59:49.221
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1182
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:50.740
<v Speaker 2>that environment that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1183
00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:53.790
<v Speaker 2>that sort of in the environment of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>around a bunch,</v>

1184
00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of drunk guys who are constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>one upping each other,</v>

1185
00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that's a sketchy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

1186
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's the frat houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1187
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:04.010
<v Speaker 2>the Yale thing scared me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought.</v>

1188
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys that rich kids,</v>

1189
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:07.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened was I got a little bit of </v>

1190
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:08.744
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's been covered up all their </v>

1191

1192
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.524
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1193
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.510
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew this girl,</v>

1194
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 2>they used to call them Monday and Friday</v>
<v Speaker 2>nights to get in a car and they drive it</v>

1195
01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:23.210
<v Speaker 2>to like fucking Connecticut and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet to suck all the decks to get home.</v>

1196
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.463
<v Speaker 2>God knows of that poor girl is today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last time I saw it was 1993 getting </v>

1197
01:00:28.221 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 2>coconut building in Harlem and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1198
01:00:30.471 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you gotta save big with some guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

1199
01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1200
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:36.470
<v Speaker 2>listen bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking to my car.</v>

1201
01:00:36.471 --> 01:00:41.060
<v Speaker 2>I never saw you before my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God.</v>

1202
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I bumped into an cop house on 181st </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

1203
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:47.083
<v Speaker 2>10 years after high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a fucking fourth floor with some </v>

1204
01:00:50.151 --> 01:00:50.984
<v Speaker 2>Dominican's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking down the stairs and there's </v>

1205
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.740
<v Speaker 2>mindy had and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing here?</v>

1206
01:00:54.741 --> 01:00:55.574
<v Speaker 2>The same thing you're fucking doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They obviously what's fucked up is for </v>

1207
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 2>some people their experiences in high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school define them.</v>

1208
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just watched that.</v>

1209
01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:09.320
<v Speaker 2>A Stephen King movie it the most recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>one with the clown.</v>

1210
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty fucking good.</v>

1211
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking when I was watching it was like</v>

1212
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:18.770
<v Speaker 2>how fucking mean kids are in school to </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1213
01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:20.243
<v Speaker 2>I guess you kind of forget about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you watch one of those movies </v>

1214
01:01:23.631 --> 01:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>about people being mean to people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1215
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.000
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember going around to get away from</v>

1216
01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 2>a guy that was picking on me that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck with me.</v>

1217
01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.013
<v Speaker 2>And like you would be scared of running </v>
<v Speaker 2>into him at the bus stop and scared of </v>

1218
01:01:35.841 --> 01:01:36.674
<v Speaker 2>seeing them after school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I got into martial arts </v>

1219
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got tired of being scared,</v>

1220
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.560
<v Speaker 2>scared of people's judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was still fucking kid.</v>

1221
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you the funniest thing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie.</v>

1222
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:52.430
<v Speaker 2>It was so they fuck with clowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two months later,</v>

1223
01:01:52.431 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of clowns and got together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>went on strike.</v>

1224
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.020
<v Speaker 2>They went downtown and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>parade,</v>

1225
01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.240
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a Perretta,</v>

1226
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:00.930
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it when people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and.</v>

1227
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.353
<v Speaker 2>And they fucking have science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is right after that movie was </v>

1228
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>released.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever that movie was released,</v>

1229
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.670
<v Speaker 2>a month later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two months later,</v>

1230
01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:11.923
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of clowns in the California area</v>
<v Speaker 2>got together downtown and picketed </v>

1231
01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Stephen King because they will lose work</v>
<v Speaker 2>as clowns Christ.</v>

1232
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Because they had lost a bunch of clowns </v>
<v Speaker 2>got canceled.</v>

1233
01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>They lost all their clown season work or</v>
<v Speaker 2>some shit.</v>

1234
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 6>I read the book a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which one?</v>

1235
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.900
<v Speaker 6>I remember I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Gonna make a movie out of this.</v>

1237
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:32.963
<v Speaker 6>And they made a movie out of it way back</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the day with John boy from the </v>

1238
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:37.104
<v Speaker 6>waltons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the dude with the mole on his </v>

<v Speaker 6>Talented.</v>

1240
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:41.183
<v Speaker 6>I watched it the other night on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just flipping through the channels it </v>

1241
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:44.574
<v Speaker 6>was on and it was after a couple of days</v>
<v Speaker 6>after I'd seen the most recent version </v>

1242
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:50.460
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was hilariously bad.</v>

1243
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.110
<v Speaker 6>Who is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was John boy with the Waltons in.</v>

1244

<v Speaker 6>Might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many versions of that it movie?</v>

1245
01:02:59.081 --> 01:03:02.860
<v Speaker 6>Did they make that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was it just two?</v>

1246
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.050
<v Speaker 6>The first one was the first one with </v>
<v Speaker 6>Tim.</v>

1247
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.320

<v Speaker 6>show that will allow.</v>

1248
01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.170

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1249
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.400
<v Speaker 6>It was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they had to go back and forth,</v>

1260
01:03:41.991 --> 01:03:42.824
<v Speaker 2>like we don't need just what I just tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>you if I go on Sunday and I had to ride </v>

1261
01:03:47.631 --> 01:03:50.510
<v Speaker 2>my motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he played a creepy guy that makes you</v>

1262
01:03:50.511 --> 01:03:53.540
<v Speaker 2>disappear after they kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1263
01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.433
<v Speaker 2>Like he comes in and measure like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were on the floor dead and he walked in </v>

1264
01:03:57.851 --> 01:04:00.260
<v Speaker 2>and measure you and tell you what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>

1265
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I need a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need some gasoline.</v>

1266
01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I need a club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also need a selection of Seventies.</v>

1267
01:04:05.721 --> 01:04:06.554
<v Speaker 2>Classic rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you disappeared when you come </v>

1268
01:04:09.771 --> 01:04:11.570
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing there.</v>

1269
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.390
<v Speaker 2>And they walk them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tells you what you want.</v>

1270
01:04:14.391 --> 01:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>800.</v>

1271
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:18.170
<v Speaker 2>You pay on the 800.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you only have six,</v>

1272
01:04:18.171 --> 01:04:21.170
<v Speaker 2>he'll look around the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just take like a statue.</v>

1273
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Just walk out of your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ties a statue on the motorcycle.</v>

1274
01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:30.520
<v Speaker 2>He was classic Sunday Attic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1275
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1276
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:35.970
<v Speaker 6>the crazy thing about him was his battle</v>
<v Speaker 6>coming back from getting hit by that guy</v>

1277
01:04:36.321 --> 01:04:39.290
<v Speaker 6>in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a walking,</v>

1278
01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.150
<v Speaker 6>I think it was in Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1279
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.373
<v Speaker 6>It was walking and some guy wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>paying attention and fucking hit him in </v>

1280
01:04:45.621 --> 01:04:49.520
<v Speaker 6>his car and just destroyed his body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like just destroyed his body.</v>

1281
01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:52.670
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he was fucked up for long.</v>

1282
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:55.010
<v Speaker 6>The motorcycle and a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He was walking.</v>

1285
01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 6>He was just walking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then we got hit by a guy in a van talk.</v>

1286
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:04.760
<v Speaker 6>When I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you turned me onto it.</v>

1287
01:05:04.761 --> 01:05:05.594
<v Speaker 6>When I read that chapter on Carrie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how he got written half a carry and </v>

1288
01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:15.281
<v Speaker 6>threw it away and his wife found him </v>
<v Speaker 6>finish it and it was about a girl with a</v>

1289
01:05:16.011 --> 01:05:17.900
<v Speaker 6>period or something and</v>

1290
01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.190
<v Speaker 2>like I was in shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Book.</v>

1291
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Carrie is a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carrie and Cujo,</v>

<v Speaker 2>my favorite Stephen King books who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1293
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:27.034
<v Speaker 2>till this day I have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at it and I respected the site </v>

1294
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.320
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even open that book.</v>

1295
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I just look at it and touch it from time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to time and I go,</v>

1296
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:36.703
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I want to get into that </v>

1297
01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:38.310
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1298
01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:42.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a great book that they like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie version of it.</v>

1299
01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:42.854
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1300
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>was pet cemetery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pet cemetery is a book.</v>

1301
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Here's some things about books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1302
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:51.400
<v Speaker 2>I hate the cliche that books are better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1303
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:52.234
<v Speaker 2>the book's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is interesting about books is </v>

1304
01:05:56.501 --> 01:05:59.260
<v Speaker 2>there certain things that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really see?</v>

1305
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>You should only imagine like they work </v>
<v Speaker 2>out better in,</v>

1306
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:05.950
<v Speaker 2>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your imagination,</v>

1307
01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.813
<v Speaker 2>like there's something much creepier </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them in your imagination and pet </v>

1308
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:11.430
<v Speaker 2>cemetery.</v>

1309
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Think he was right about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>creepy.</v>

1310
01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:13.813
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whenever I have a hard time </v>

1311
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:18.250
<v Speaker 2>sleeping or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's going on with me.</v>

1312
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>So instead of sitting in bed and having </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called insomnia,</v>

1313
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I get up and I write it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you read that back,</v>

1314
01:06:25.241 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like when I write about something I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did as a kid,</v>

1315
01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:30.210
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Robin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddy at Putnam field.</v>

1316
01:06:30.211 --> 01:06:31.044
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to rob this gas station every </v>

1317
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 2>eight weeks and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I was in West Palm Beach,</v>

1318
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:40.630
<v Speaker 2>your kids showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kid showed up in my school when I was in</v>

1319
01:06:40.631 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 2>West Palm Beach and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will have something,</v>

1320
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.270
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a map you drew of us.</v>

1321
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:50.110
<v Speaker 2>We're about to rob a gas station in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1981.</v>

1322
01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:54.340
<v Speaker 2>He still had the map with me with stick </v>
<v Speaker 2>man grabbed this.</v>

1323
01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:57.190
<v Speaker 2>We would rob this gas station every six </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eight weeks.</v>

1324
01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Come in from the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from the north.</v>

1325
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point I'm trying to make was,</v>

1326
01:07:02.591 --> 01:07:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I forgot it somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right about things that you did that</v>

1327
01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:08.200
<v Speaker 2>were even when I write about that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you read them,</v>

1328
01:07:08.201 --> 01:07:09.180
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iphone.</v>

1329
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reading is fucking phenomenal.</v>

1330
01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.313
<v Speaker 2>Build imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why when you read silence of the </v>

1331
01:07:16.211 --> 01:07:17.044
<v Speaker 2>lambs and you watched a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get everybody in that room </v>

1332
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:23.200
<v Speaker 2>and give him a big hug because they kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>it honest.</v>

1333
01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:24.034
<v Speaker 2>They kept it real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you read William Blake leaves the </v>

1334
01:07:26.441 --> 01:07:27.274
<v Speaker 2>excesses and then the emphasis has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>on for the last two weeks on AMC and </v>

1335
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I've been watching bits and pieces of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can upload it more.</v>

1336
01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:36.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fucking great.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He played the newspaper reporter.</v>

1345
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.220
<v Speaker 2>That's his fucking father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Damien,</v>

1346
01:07:57.221 --> 01:07:59.800
<v Speaker 2>charisse plays the priest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Jackie gleason,</v>

1347
01:07:59.801 --> 01:08:01.480
<v Speaker 2>his son in law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He married Jackie gleason,</v>

1348
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:02.314
<v Speaker 2>his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because last week I was </v>

1349
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:08.140
<v Speaker 2>in my office typing and my wife called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

1350
01:08:08.141 --> 01:08:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna be home in 20 minutes with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>

1351
01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.350
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1352
01:08:13.351 --> 01:08:14.680
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want the living room.</v>

1353
01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.053
<v Speaker 2>I turned the TV on just to be out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because unless you're going to want to </v>

1354
01:08:18.851 --> 01:08:19.684
<v Speaker 2>watch cartoons or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw the exorcisms and I turned it </v>

1355
01:08:22.461 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 2>on and dog it came on when the priest </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes through the door,</v>

1356
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.573
<v Speaker 2>which if I bump into that director,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will take this deck out and suck it </v>

1357
01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.860
<v Speaker 2>because that's what real directing is he</v>
<v Speaker 2>scheduled without showing you anything.</v>

1358
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:38.383
<v Speaker 2>When the priest comes through the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you see is an image and you don't </v>

1359
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:45.230
<v Speaker 2>see what his face looked like and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>scares you,</v>

1360
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.333
<v Speaker 2>but when he walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes this motherfucker and the guy </v>

1361
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 2>says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I get you something?</v>

1362
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 2>How was your trip?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I get you something?</v>

1363
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want some coffee?</v>

1364
01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:55.694
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1365
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:59.930
<v Speaker 2>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy's a psychiatrist.</v>

1366
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.840
<v Speaker 2>You have to watch the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's a psychiatrist.</v>

1367
01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Not only is he a priest and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping and psycho and the priest looks</v>

1368
01:09:07.141 --> 01:09:08.270
<v Speaker 2>over and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock it off.</v>

1369
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:10.620
<v Speaker 2>The devil is cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1370
01:09:10.621 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 2>tack your psychological like nobody else</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not listen to him.</v>

1371
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:18.020
<v Speaker 2>And he just breaks it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy says to him,</v>

1372
01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:21.260
<v Speaker 2>do you want to know the three levels of </v>

<v Speaker 2>on my lap and she's a Bible beater.</v>

1378

1382
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Even though she goes to fucking public </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

1383
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.350
<v Speaker 2>she'll come home and they didn't talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about God today.</v>

1384
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:55.663
<v Speaker 2>So she's watching this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of these two priests </v>

1385
01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:00.634
<v Speaker 2>talking about God is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is going to kill Satan and all of a </v>

1386
01:10:05.271 --> 01:10:09.680
<v Speaker 2>sudden they walk into the room and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting up and she's like,</v>

1387
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.733

<v Speaker 2>Took like 30 seconds to just look at me </v>

1388
01:10:16.641 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 2>and she just ran out of the room like </v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't know who Satan is,</v>

1389
01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:21.890
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1390
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 2>She just ran out of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the scariest movies.</v>

1391
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:29.960
<v Speaker 2>One of the finest movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She elevates himself.</v>

1392
01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:31.483
<v Speaker 2>Comes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about when they say they do the </v>

1393
01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 2>first thing they walk out and what about</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they walked back in and he's a,</v>

1394
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:38.143
<v Speaker 2>he's a doctor so he's checking her heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she turns into the mother and the </v>

01:10:41.451 --> 01:10:46.420
<v Speaker 2>hospital and start saying bme while you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do this to me and,</v>

1396
01:10:46.421 --> 01:10:47.254
<v Speaker 2>and the priest told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to them that the devil's </v>

1397
01:10:49.101 --> 01:10:50.590
<v Speaker 2>cunning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1398
01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.090
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about when he comes in?</v>

1399
01:10:52.091 --> 01:10:52.924
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>before the devil came and some guy was </v>

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:39.803
<v Speaker 2>was a dinner party and then a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>nights later they found the guy on the </v>

01:11:42.011 --> 01:11:44.850
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it couldn't have been a girl because</v>

<v Speaker 2>Then you show that in the movie theater.</v>

1436
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:32.423
<v Speaker 2>Shame on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I could sue the union city </v>

1437
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:38.220
<v Speaker 2>cinema today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sue them because they didn't check</v>

1438
01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:40.530
<v Speaker 2>my id.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't give a fuck.</v>

1439
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.220
<v Speaker 2>They took my $2 and let me threw me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking walls.</v>

1440
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.670
<v Speaker 2>But I also saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was her name again?</v>

1441
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Linda Blair Blair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She showed up.</v>

1442
01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years later she started hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with Rick James.</v>

1443
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>

1444
01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.300
<v Speaker 2>She shown up 20 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard.</v>

1445
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what Linda Blair is doing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1446
01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.713
<v Speaker 2>but I hope they paid her a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she never really recovered from </v>

1447
01:13:02.001 --> 01:13:04.220
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She never really worked after that.</v>

1448
01:13:04.221 --> 01:13:06.530
<v Speaker 2>It's something at work after you put a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross in your pussy.</v>

1449
01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:07.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's Ginger Lynn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to get a commercial for </v>

1450
01:13:12.381 --> 01:13:13.700
<v Speaker 2>fucking bounce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1451
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also.</v>

1452
01:13:14.901 --> 01:13:17.480
<v Speaker 2>People never forget you were that </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1453
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:18.343
<v Speaker 2>Like it's very difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a changed perception was she walks </v>

1454
01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:22.364
<v Speaker 2>down the stairs backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about when a head spins around in </v>

1455
01:13:25.491 --> 01:13:29.180
<v Speaker 2>front of the priests?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too out there for a movie.</v>

1456
01:13:29.181 --> 01:13:30.014
<v Speaker 2>They could never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think of remaking that every once </v>

1457
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:37.750
<v Speaker 2>in awhile and they looked at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1458
01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.000
<v Speaker 2>That was a creepy fucking movie and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of realize that back then there was</v>

1459
01:13:46.001 --> 01:13:51.001
<v Speaker 2>nothing like this before this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this movie was so extreme like there had</v>

1460
01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:55.960
<v Speaker 2>been horror movies before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like Frankenstein or Dracula.</v>

1461
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.033
<v Speaker 2>They were kind of scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the warm blooding though there was </v>

1462
01:14:00.071 --> 01:14:00.904
<v Speaker 2>nothing like this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This movie was so over the top and </v>

1463
01:14:05.021 --> 01:14:05.854
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people at the time or like </v>

1464
01:14:07.631 --> 01:14:08.464
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie represented something and </v>

1465
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.850
<v Speaker 2>representative of boundaries that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1466
01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:13.684
<v Speaker 2>these young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people today like what the fuck </v>

1470
01:14:24.311 --> 01:14:25.960

<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1471

<v Speaker 2>This was a great movie data and they let</v>

1486
01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:16.750
<v Speaker 2>you in and they played the last movie at</v>
<v Speaker 2>1130.</v>

1487
01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:17.584
<v Speaker 2>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how many times I saw enter the </v>

1488
01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:19.114
<v Speaker 2>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They man,</v>

1489
01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:21.840
<v Speaker 2>the late movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother let me walk up there.</v>

1490
01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 2>It was on 48th street and my mother's </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother was on 29th street and she'd go,</v>

1491
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:30.280
<v Speaker 2>go and I saw everything that fist of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fury,</v>

1492
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:35.350
<v Speaker 2>the outlaw Josey Wales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those fucking movies.</v>

1493
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even when they played,</v>

1494
01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:38.164
<v Speaker 2>I just go there as a Spanish kid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch and learn the language and loved </v>

1495
01:15:42.461 --> 01:15:44.140
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had limitations,</v>

1496
01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:45.003
<v Speaker 2>what they could do with special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so because of that you had to </v>

1497
01:15:48.161 --> 01:15:51.880
<v Speaker 2>accomplish much more with even with </v>
<v Speaker 2>American Werewolf in London,</v>

1498
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:53.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The original.</v>

1499
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.730
<v Speaker 2>The original.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year was that made?</v>

1500
01:15:56.250 --> 01:16:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I want to say 81.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to guess.</v>

1501
01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Look at what year was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it 81?</v>

1502
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm the special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though they were groundbreaking for</v>

1503
01:16:09.071 --> 01:16:09.904
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when he's lying on the floor and </v>

1504
01:16:11.591 --> 01:16:15.340
<v Speaker 2>his body stretching Isaac and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned into the wolf.</v>

1505
01:16:15.341 --> 01:16:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Like that shit when his face is </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretching out.</v>

1506
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean those are groundbreaking special </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

1507
01:16:20.471 --> 01:16:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one had ever seen anything like that.</v>

1508
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:25.720
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed.</v>

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:29.140
<v Speaker 2>It's watching a movie now and 30 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>when she got caught with heroin,</v>

1521
01:16:52.991 --> 01:16:55.060

<v Speaker 2>Thailand.</v>

1522

<v Speaker 2>It goes with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with her and Claire Danes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Kate beckinsale something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both fell in love with the same guy</v>

1525
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:07.360
<v Speaker 2>and he put heroin on him and they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in a prison.</v>

1526
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 2>So I was flipping through the channels </v>
<v Speaker 2>while I was broke down palace</v>

1527
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.241
<v Speaker 4>when uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1528
01:17:11.241 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 4>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was doing that,</v>

1529
01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:15.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing this fucking fitness channel,</v>

1530
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:16.453
<v Speaker 4>this fitness challenge with Ari and Bert</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Tom and I just watching anything I </v>

1531
01:17:20.661 --> 01:17:21.494
<v Speaker 4>can on TV while I'm on the elliptical </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine or the rower or whatever the </v>

1532
01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:27.920
<v Speaker 4>fuck I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was watching one of the underworld</v>

1533
01:17:27.921 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 4>movies and I realized there's like 10 of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1534
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:33.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many fucking underwear world movies.</v>

1535
01:17:33.621 --> 01:17:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Is there been more than that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many is.</v>

1536
01:17:36.711 --> 01:17:40.100
<v Speaker 4>She's been all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's the main star.</v>

1537
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:44.510
<v Speaker 4>They're so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fucking one that I saw,</v>

1538
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:45.643
<v Speaker 4>I've been deep in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She has a daughter now and there's five </v>

1539
01:17:48.891 --> 01:17:50.750
<v Speaker 4>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know which one I saw,</v>

1540
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.733
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the first two and I think the one </v>

1541
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 4>that was watching a lot of control for </v>
<v Speaker 4>me that was,</v>

1542
01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.680
<v Speaker 4>I think I was watching blood wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so dumb.</v>

1543
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:03.860
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the CGI,</v>

1544
01:18:03.861 --> 01:18:07.100
<v Speaker 4>the Werewolf's are so corny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They show you too much.</v>

1545
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 4>It looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about an American Werewolf</v>

1546
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:10.184
<v Speaker 4>in London is they showed you a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>quick snippets of the thing before we'd </v>

1547
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:17.870
<v Speaker 4>kill people and it was just enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>likely that they look so stupid.</v>

1548
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 4>It just looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Cgi just does not look.</v>

1549
01:18:23.751 --> 01:18:24.584
<v Speaker 4>And that was something that Pat Mcgee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who made that the werewolf out </v>

1550
01:18:27.831 --> 01:18:30.380
<v Speaker 4>there in the lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's what he had told me.</v>

1551
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:31.910
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see your,</v>

1552
01:18:31.911 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 4>your brain can tell that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even if it looks really good,</v>

1553
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:38.630
<v Speaker 4>your brain can tell it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1554
01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.493
<v Speaker 4>what your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your brain sees special effects like </v>

1555
01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:44.210
<v Speaker 4>makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that kind of stuff.</v>

1556
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.021
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1557
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a face that's been done with prosthetics</v>

1558
01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:50.300
<v Speaker 4>and teeth and fangs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your brain says,</v>

1559
01:18:50.301 --> 01:18:51.500
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a real thing.</v>

1560
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that's right in front </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you.</v>

1561
01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.133
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1562
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:57.760
<v Speaker 4>these worlds are so corny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they're running,</v>

1563
01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.330
<v Speaker 4>it looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's shadows.</v>

1564
01:18:59.331 --> 01:19:02.810
<v Speaker 4>Look fake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but pull up scene from American Werewolf</v>

1565
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:03.880
<v Speaker 4>in London like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1566
01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:07.760
<v Speaker 4>like the actual werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had very,</v>

1567
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.540
<v Speaker 4>very quick scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't see much of the Werewolf.</v>

1568
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:14.420
<v Speaker 4>It was very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you see running through the streets</v>

1569
01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 4>of London.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see it snapping it.</v>

1570
01:19:16.221 --> 01:19:17.054
<v Speaker 4>Things like in that one that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning when they first got jack by </v>

1571
01:19:20.241 --> 01:19:21.410
<v Speaker 4>the war.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It puts it back.</v>

1574
01:19:30.001 --> 01:19:31.560
<v Speaker 4>It up for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bag it up.</v>

1575
01:19:31.561 --> 01:19:34.160
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're running.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're really scared me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shithead going to help me up.</v>

1577
01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1578
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:20.840
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't see much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.690
<v Speaker 2>It's 1981 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing Joe Rogen.</v>

1581
01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 2>You said it best a couple of minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1582
01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.790
<v Speaker 2>That the thing that pisses me off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most is.</v>

1583
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:35.880
<v Speaker 2>And today's the whole movie business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up on the movies.</v>

1584
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking immigrant kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love movies.</v>

1585
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Remember when they have Tony Montana in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking detention thing and he goes,</v>

1586
01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:44.850
<v Speaker 2>how'd you learn how to speak Spanish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>English?</v>

1587
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Because I watched a movie set Gleesa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1588
01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.373
<v Speaker 2>What Cubans?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody Philippe's bars have told me </v>

1589
01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:52.610
<v Speaker 2>that learned from watching TV by </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

1590
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.453
<v Speaker 2>So you watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem that happened somewhere </v>

1591
01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.713
<v Speaker 2>between 85,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 87 today is the disconnect of the </v>

1592
01:21:03.451 --> 01:21:07.080
<v Speaker 2>director and you asking me Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the disconnected?</v>

1593
01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:09.600
<v Speaker 2>The director,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the imagination.</v>

1594
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:11.813
<v Speaker 2>I just watched something on scarface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost called you because it was so </v>

1595
01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:18.930
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the dilemmas they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>scarface.</v>

1596
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:24.350
<v Speaker 2>When they gave it an x rating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scarface came out.</v>

1597
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Pachino said that at the release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the party,</v>

1598
01:21:27.771 --> 01:21:30.030
<v Speaker 2>a scarface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just sank.</v>

1599
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:33.300
<v Speaker 2>People were getting up and leaving 20 at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch.</v>

1600
01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:36.360
<v Speaker 2>They took Joan Collins aside and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1601
01:21:36.361 --> 01:21:38.070
<v Speaker 2>the gentleman's Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you think of the movie?</v>

1602
01:21:38.071 --> 01:21:40.190
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left after I know.</v>

1603
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.063
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think $100 bucks is enough flux for a </v>

1604
01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:47.960
<v Speaker 2>person's lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they it.</v>

1605
01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:48.873
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they showed that's enough of </v>

1606
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:53.070
<v Speaker 2>persons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I left,</v>

1607
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:57.000
<v Speaker 2>that they counted how many fucks he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this stuff.</v>

1608
01:21:57.001 --> 01:22:01.920
<v Speaker 2>But that's not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is that when they,</v>

1609
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.533
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that directed that had to go in </v>

1610
01:22:04.651 --> 01:22:09.651
<v Speaker 2>front of a board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big difference about me showing a</v>

1611
01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:13.163
<v Speaker 2>chainsaw going through your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you seeing it and then seeing your </v>

1612
01:22:17.191 --> 01:22:19.980
<v Speaker 2>face and you bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You follow me,</v>

1613
01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:22.260
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>

1614
01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:24.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why they had to go to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was better.</v>

1615
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.610
<v Speaker 2>That yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1616
01:22:26.611 --> 01:22:28.280
<v Speaker 2>they have the x rating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1617
01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:29.990
<v Speaker 2>when it's a beautiful story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1618
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.850
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and him.</v>

1619
01:22:32.851 --> 01:22:37.020
<v Speaker 2>And he's supposed to make the decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>to direct abroad violence specialist,</v>

1620
01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:40.080
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but thought he brought 100 witnesses.</v>

1621
01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:42.600
<v Speaker 2>They were there all fucking day to prove</v>
<v Speaker 2>his point.</v>

1622
01:22:42.601 --> 01:22:45.930
<v Speaker 2>That take it from an x rated movie to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>r rated movie.</v>

1623
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:49.770
<v Speaker 2>When you watch once upon a time and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>West,</v>

1624
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Sergio Leone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the king of the directors because</v>

1625
01:22:53.761 --> 01:22:58.470
<v Speaker 2>he gave you the decision to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you with me?</v>

1626
01:22:58.471 --> 01:23:01.810
<v Speaker 2>He gave it to you when Charles Bronson </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets off the train,</v>

1627
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:06.830
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of once upon a time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America and the street dudes waiting and</v>

1628
01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:08.194
<v Speaker 2>the train goes by and all of a sudden it</v>
<v Speaker 2>stops and all of a sudden you hear a </v>

1629
01:23:11.141 --> 01:23:11.974
<v Speaker 2>harmonica and he hit Charles Bronson </v>
<v Speaker 2>going and they look up when they see </v>

1630
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Charles Bronson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>

1631
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:20.613
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1632
01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:24.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not focusing on Charles Bronson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sir.</v>

1633
01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.293
<v Speaker 2>Got All these fucking with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He keeps showing you this fucking thing </v>

1634
01:23:28.661 --> 01:23:32.440
<v Speaker 2>that keeps going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take me back,</v>

1635
01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Sir Joey only let me watch this </v>
<v Speaker 2>gunfight.</v>

1636
01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.730
<v Speaker 2>He gave you a imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Directors gave you an imagination.</v>

1637
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
<v Speaker 2>They gave you a split second to decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether what was going to happen.</v>

1638
01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Now I know the story before it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The director was something special.</v>

1639
01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:54.160
<v Speaker 2>That's why Sergio Leone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1640
01:23:54.161 --> 01:23:58.500
<v Speaker 2>guys don't spaghetti westerns with </v>
<v Speaker 2>genius because they gave you.</v>

1641
01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Are you with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gave me a second to split the side.</v>

1642
01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about what's going on.</v>

1643
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I did that scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have put it in his arm or showed</v>

1644
01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Pachino his face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They fall down.</v>

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.070
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Janie put Google.</v>

1660
01:24:43.071 --> 01:24:43.904
<v Speaker 6>Clint Eastwood comes back as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>High Plains drifter just isn't in the </v>

1661
01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.810
<v Speaker 6>description.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1662
01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:55.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm parked ghost story part revenge West</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing about that movie is like you don't</v>

1663
01:24:55.281 --> 01:24:56.114
<v Speaker 6>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like they don't spell it out for </v>

1664
01:24:59.151 --> 01:24:59.984
<v Speaker 6>the dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that he's a ghost six cents then now </v>

1665
01:25:04.110 --> 01:25:06.980
<v Speaker 6>like you have to figure it out at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>end of the movie.</v>

1666
01:25:06.981 --> 01:25:09.770
<v Speaker 6>If I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's been a long time since I saw it,</v>

1667
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:11.840
<v Speaker 6>but at the end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the end of the film,</v>

1668
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:13.430
<v Speaker 6>they sort of lay it out in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>beginning,</v>

1669
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:14.690
<v Speaker 6>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they show,</v>

1670
01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:17.270
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might be wrong here.</v>

1671
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:18.583
<v Speaker 6>I feel like at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie is them beating him and killing </v>

1672
01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:22.124
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They whipped him at the end of the </v>

1673
01:25:23.691 --> 01:25:27.500
<v Speaker 6>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You kind of realize it's him coming back</v>

1674
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:28.423
<v Speaker 6>towards the end of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not like specifically spelled </v>

1675
01:25:31.161 --> 01:25:35.930
<v Speaker 6>out like it was a curse and he came back</v>
<v Speaker 6>to haunt this town and kill everyone.</v>

1676
01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.053
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't that cornball.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you go back to like the older </v>

1677
01:25:40.431 --> 01:25:42.640
<v Speaker 6>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd go back to like,</v>

1678
01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:43.923
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a Frankenstein or Dracula type </v>

1679
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.633
<v Speaker 6>film.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They spelled things out like they </v>

1680
01:25:49.011 --> 01:25:49.844
<v Speaker 6>treated you like you were a dumb ass and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they spell things out and then they </v>

1681
01:25:52.701 --> 01:25:53.534
<v Speaker 6>eventually stopped doing that and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>put mystery and imagination and films </v>

1682
01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.900
<v Speaker 6>and then somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least with modern blockbusters.</v>

1683
01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 6>If</v>

1684
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.933
<v Speaker 4>I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say part of the problem is </v>

1685
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.940
<v Speaker 4>there's so much money involved in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies.</v>

1686
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:12.043
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to make a film and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know it's some gigantic thing with </v>

1687
01:26:17.151 --> 01:26:21.920
<v Speaker 4>special effects and the studio's dumping</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of millions of dollars into it,</v>

1688
01:26:21.921 --> 01:26:25.360
<v Speaker 4>they want a return on their money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw people discussing that.</v>

1689
01:26:25.361 --> 01:26:27.740
<v Speaker 4>I think Johnny Depp was just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicked off,</v>

1690
01:26:27.741 --> 01:26:28.574
<v Speaker 4>isn't the right word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's not going to be in the next </v>

1691
01:26:29.241 --> 01:26:30.074
<v Speaker 4>pirates movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess discussing under like in the </v>

1692
01:26:32.511 --> 01:26:33.344
<v Speaker 4>comments section like it was the word </v>
<v Speaker 4>last one was the worst one that of the </v>

1693
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:37.034
<v Speaker 4>of the lot and they spent $330,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the budget but it made $800 million </v>

1694
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:43.060
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a failure.</v>

1695
01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.660
<v Speaker 4>Some people were saying like that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>failure.</v>

1696
01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for them it's a failure of $100.</v>

1697
01:26:46.641 --> 01:26:48.290
<v Speaker 4>Million is a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1698
01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:50.450
<v Speaker 4>Johnny's off the rails right now.</v>

1699
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:52.790
<v Speaker 4>He shaved his head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Depp.</v>

1700
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:55.730
<v Speaker 4>He looks like he weighs 35 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He shaved his head.</v>

1701
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.903
<v Speaker 4>He's fallen out of his jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you get like two tattoos of a </v>

1702
01:27:00.861 --> 01:27:01.694
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only been married to for like six </v>

1703
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:05.240
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are all bad signs.</v>

1704
01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:06.463
<v Speaker 4>Joking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a very rough town to live egos </v>

1705
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.083
<v Speaker 4>and motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People blowing smoke up your ass as a </v>

1706
01:27:12.741 --> 01:27:13.574
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this guy is spending a half a </v>

1707
01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.430
<v Speaker 4>million dollars a month on wind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1708
01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.710
<v Speaker 4>know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't quote me on that,</v>

1709
01:27:21.711 --> 01:27:23.280
<v Speaker 4>but I know that when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the accounts,</v>

1710
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:28.460
<v Speaker 4>I read the caption that said that he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>spending $30,000</v>

1711
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.353
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>around about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a lot more than that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's almost,</v>

1770
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:01.704
<v Speaker 6>there's no turning back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you get like Michael Jackson type </v>

1786
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I lived on 40 4:35,</v>

1787
01:30:41.101 --> 01:30:43.920
<v Speaker 3>far away road and snowmass village,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado.</v>

1788
01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:49.200
<v Speaker 3>I have sat and the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two years I was there,</v>

1789
01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:53.520
<v Speaker 3>he came a week and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came for three days and his daughters</v>

1790
01:30:53.521 --> 01:30:56.610
<v Speaker 3>came for three days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They spent 2000 on booze.</v>

1791
01:30:57.150 --> 01:31:01.730
<v Speaker 3>They all got drunk and they left two </v>
<v Speaker 3>days later and I was talking to the door</v>

1792
01:31:01.731 --> 01:31:02.521
<v Speaker 3>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1793
01:31:02.521 --> 01:31:06.380
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad's got houses all over the place.</v>

1794
01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.440
<v Speaker 3>He had three in Colorado alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like crusty crested butte,</v>

1795
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:12.053
<v Speaker 3>snowmass village,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had a house on the other side to </v>

1796
01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:18.210
<v Speaker 3>ski over there because he liked to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different types of powders.</v>

1797
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:21.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ,</v>

1798
01:31:22.730 --> 01:31:25.840
<v Speaker 6>that world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when people get that famous,</v>

1799
01:31:25.841 --> 01:31:28.030
<v Speaker 6>when they get that rich,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they get that,</v>

1800
01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.080
<v Speaker 6>the point where they live in some sort </v>
<v Speaker 6>of weird la La land.</v>

1801
01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:36.490
<v Speaker 6>He had a brand new jeep delivered every </v>
<v Speaker 6>year</v>

1802
01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:38.593
<v Speaker 3>and part of my agreement was I had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>driver like 50 miles a month to keep </v>

1803
01:31:42.891 --> 01:31:43.724
<v Speaker 3>make sure because when he came to town </v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want no problems with none of </v>

1804
01:31:46.671 --> 01:31:47.504
<v Speaker 3>his houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had a different fucking house </v>

1805
01:31:50.211 --> 01:31:53.660
<v Speaker 3>sitter at every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if the background check on,</v>

1806
01:31:53.661 --> 01:31:55.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to me,</v>

1807
01:31:55.791 --> 01:31:56.624
<v Speaker 3>I fucking grandfathered in to the house </v>
<v Speaker 3>because my buddy from had it and his </v>

1808
01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:04.420
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend came up to visit and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked her up but the guy was difficult</v>

1809
01:32:04.421 --> 01:32:06.730
<v Speaker 3>to get ahold of because he was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>England and whatnot.</v>

1810
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.073
<v Speaker 3>So my friend just said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just move and don't say Dick when </v>

1811
01:32:11.381 --> 01:32:12.214
<v Speaker 3>he comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll see it to you and tell him I had </v>

1812
01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:16.030
<v Speaker 3>to leave and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep my deposit.</v>

1813
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.200
<v Speaker 3>So I stayed there for like two months </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he came and he's like,</v>

1814
01:32:20.230 --> 01:32:21.160
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you?</v>

1815
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:22.833
<v Speaker 3>And I told them what had happened and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we couldn't get ahold of him </v>

1816
01:32:24.551 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 3>because he was in England and he asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>me for a couple of names.</v>

1817
01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I had already lived in snowmass for </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a year.</v>

1818
01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:34.893
<v Speaker 3>I left and then came back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had a couple of nights references </v>

1819
01:32:37.931 --> 01:32:38.764
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave me the thing and then left and I </v>

1820
01:32:40.781 --> 01:32:41.614
<v Speaker 3>was not allowed in this home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So part of the deal was I had an </v>

1821
01:32:45.011 --> 01:32:49.600
<v Speaker 3>apartment over the garage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could use this car and it was 18 hours</v>

1822
01:32:49.601 --> 01:32:54.601
<v Speaker 3>a month to be the shoveling snow or 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 hours a month of work or.</v>

1823
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.233
<v Speaker 3>So it was essentially a shoveling snow </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the winter and the along in the </v>

1824
01:33:01.751 --> 01:33:02.584
<v Speaker 3>summer he would give me little </v>

<v Speaker 3>weeks in 1984,</v>

01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:11.490
<v Speaker 3>that in 84 was when he went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every night he'd worked out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was a good looking dude that kept in </v>
<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>

1845
01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:15.983
<v Speaker 3>He had 20 different cars and every night</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gives her the guy at the door to </v>

1846
01:34:19.930 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 3>start the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That night the guy took the night off.</v>

1847
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:26.670
<v Speaker 3>He started his own car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put a pipe bomb in his car and blew</v>

1848
01:34:26.671 --> 01:34:28.300
<v Speaker 3>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lived,</v>

1849
01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:33.330
<v Speaker 3>he made it all the way to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something went so deep or possess it</v>

1850
01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:34.750
<v Speaker 3>just bled to death.</v>

1851
01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:38.773
<v Speaker 3>So left this gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy approached him and then he </v>

1852
01:34:41.241 --> 01:34:41.711
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1853
01:34:41.711 --> 01:34:42.544
<v Speaker 3>these people are mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to do business with cotton </v>

1854
01:34:46.050 --> 01:34:49.630
<v Speaker 3>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had to talk to them and they said,</v>

1855
01:34:49.631 --> 01:34:50.500
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you to buy.</v>

1856
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:51.403
<v Speaker 3>We never do a face to face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have an aspen club and have a </v>

1857
01:34:56.261 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 3>place called the CEO of the Aspen Club</v>

1858
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.210
<v Speaker 2>is through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1859
01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.570
<v Speaker 2>in those days these places were thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars a month to walk it.</v>

1860
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.273
<v Speaker 2>And I knew a girl that used to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aspen club and she used to telling me </v>

1861
01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:08.340
<v Speaker 2>she used to take showers right next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barbie,</v>

1862
01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Barbie Barbie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben had a beautiful Bush.</v>

1863
01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.113
<v Speaker 2>She would tell me every night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bobby Benton's got a beautiful fucking </v>

1864
01:35:16.101 --> 01:35:16.934
<v Speaker 2>bullshits perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the Aspen Club in the </v>

1865
01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:21.560
<v Speaker 2>snowmass clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No mass club as golfing,</v>

1866
01:35:21.561 --> 01:35:23.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>condos around the thing.</v>

1867
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:26.720
<v Speaker 2>It was like $900 a month to be a member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't have been a member.</v>

1868
01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:30.280
<v Speaker 2>So the only way I could become a member </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my being a volunteer fireman,</v>

1869
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:34.100
<v Speaker 2>then they'd give you admission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for 90 days I had a train,</v>

1870
01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:35.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up two flights,</v>

1871
01:35:35.911 --> 01:35:36.744
<v Speaker 2>this thing I'll add a carry a rope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically it was putting out when </v>

1872
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:43.580
<v Speaker 2>tourists come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know how to fucking turn on a</v>

1873
01:35:43.581 --> 01:35:44.420
<v Speaker 2>fireplace.</v>

1874
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.883
<v Speaker 2>So they clean out the showers and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in and then these people would </v>

1875
01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:50.980
<v Speaker 2>put them in a dumpster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 10,</v>

1876
01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:54.290
<v Speaker 2>10 or you're doing this dumpster fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all you're doing,</v>

1877
01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.690
<v Speaker 2>but you've got access to the snowmass </v>
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>

1878
01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 2>So basically I was walking to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment has club give the girl a $10,000,</v>

1879
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:04.500
<v Speaker 2>but I need gym clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout.</v>

1880
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:07.360
<v Speaker 2>By the time he got back to your locker </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in the locker.</v>

1881
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 2>It was all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were all.</v>

1882
01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:13.280
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was involved.</v>

1883
01:36:13.281 --> 01:36:14.114
<v Speaker 2>So the girl that worked there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was getting a piece of whoever knew </v>

1884

1886
01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.160

<v Speaker 2>And then later on I go into the locker,</v>

1887
01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.590
<v Speaker 2>the coke would be that I get like a </v>

01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:46.230
<v Speaker 3>And Are you hooked up in the city?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a,</v>

1939
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:49.200
<v Speaker 3>but we walked around the city and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>snow had just started the snow,</v>

1940
01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the time I got up the next </v>

1941
01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:52.770
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no like a foot.</v>

1942
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was a kid in jersey,</v>

1943
01:38:56.701 --> 01:38:57.534
<v Speaker 3>if it snowed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit was the light that should </v>

1944
01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.500
<v Speaker 3>stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stay.</v>

1945
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.333
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no school stacked up on the </v>

1946
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:07.350
<v Speaker 3>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Snow Bro.</v>

1947
01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:10.830
<v Speaker 3>My town by the fucking ounce of snow </v>
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>

1948
01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Not An inch really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking tremendous that night.</v>

1949
01:39:15.181 --> 01:39:20.181
<v Speaker 3>The roads would clean the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget how when I left Jersey</v>

1950
01:39:20.701 --> 01:39:23.670
<v Speaker 3>and 83,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it snowed,</v>

1951
01:39:23.671 --> 01:39:26.280
<v Speaker 3>like let's say if it snowed and I'd had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take the bus up here,</v>

1952
01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I would just call you and say Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which smeller you'd expect me to 11.</v>

1953
01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:32.003
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was late whenever it snowed </v>

1954
01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:34.634
<v Speaker 3>in Jersey.</v>

1955
01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.610
<v Speaker 3>He is this big metropolitan area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York City and it snowed.</v>

1956
01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:41.000
<v Speaker 3>The crippled the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know how to handle it.</v>

1957
01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:45.570
<v Speaker 3>Loose papers wouldn't come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People get pissed off the New York Post.</v>

1958
01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:51.040
<v Speaker 3>And I remember moving to snowmass and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting a job at aspen electric and that</v>

1959
01:39:51.691 --> 01:39:54.600
<v Speaker 3>meant they had a gun on the bus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>snowmass go to the bottom of the hill,</v>

1960
01:39:54.601 --> 01:39:59.601
<v Speaker 3>transfer and shoot the bus to snowmass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this and I remember the first time</v>

1961
01:39:59.671 --> 01:40:03.600
<v Speaker 3>we got woke up one day and you know in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado you wake up more than this.</v>

1962
01:40:03.601 --> 01:40:05.070
<v Speaker 3>12 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just another day.</v>

1963
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Just another day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember the 1983,</v>

1964
01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.433
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't fucking clean up New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll never forget that morning </v>

1965
01:40:13.921 --> 01:40:17.060
<v Speaker 3>waking up and asked him like at 6:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>in snowmass and going,</v>

1966
01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:19.890
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to expect me to about </v>
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>

1967
01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.750
<v Speaker 3>And I walked in there at 10 people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck have you met?</v>

1968
01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:26.070
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it snowed out.</v>

1969
01:40:26.071 --> 01:40:27.450
<v Speaker 3>The buses are running late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

1970
01:40:28.190 --> 01:40:30.870
<v Speaker 3>everybody don't say came on a bus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they all got here on time.</v>

1971
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.333
<v Speaker 3>They'd fucking busted me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ride out like Colorado was that far </v>

1972
01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 3>ahead of the game while they're just so </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to it.</v>

1973
01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.633
<v Speaker 3>It was so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like here I was living in this big </v>

1974
01:40:41.401 --> 01:40:44.880
<v Speaker 3>metropolitan city that four inches </v>
<v Speaker 3>crippled,</v>

1975
01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.010
<v Speaker 3>didn't Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they throw down salt,</v>

1976
01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:50.070
<v Speaker 3>they throw down something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1977
01:40:50.071 --> 01:40:52.800
<v Speaker 3>They throw it out on something because </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you wash your car in Colorado,</v>

1978
01:40:52.801 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 3>they push to</v>

1979
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:56.890
<v Speaker 6>do the underwater carrots to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>prevention.</v>

1980
01:40:56.891 --> 01:40:57.724
<v Speaker 6>Because Russ Russ travels fast and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Colorado in Boston to that salt </v>

1981
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.720
<v Speaker 6>assaulted puts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'd be you'd buy old cars and uh,</v>

1982
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:08.230
<v Speaker 6>in the fenders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1983
01:41:08.231 --> 01:41:10.000
<v Speaker 6>in the back of the fenders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like at the corner,</v>

1984
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:13.060
<v Speaker 6>that's where the salt would pile up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you always have rust there.</v>

1985
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.430
<v Speaker 6>He'd always have like these big pockets </v>
<v Speaker 6>of rust.</v>

1986
01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:18.670
<v Speaker 6>The corner of Morocco.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1987
01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:19.713
<v Speaker 6>That's why California cars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody was wanting to rust free </v>

1988
01:41:22.391 --> 01:41:24.790
<v Speaker 6>California car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're buying a muscle car,</v>

1989
01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:26.510
<v Speaker 6>like an older,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1990
01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:29.980
<v Speaker 6>hot rod,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd find a rust free California Kar,</v>

1991
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:31.000
<v Speaker 6>Woo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>California.</v>

1992
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:33.100
<v Speaker 6>I mean salt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big thing with salt,</v>

1993
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.590
<v Speaker 6>destroy cars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>destroy that frame,</v>

1994
01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.750
<v Speaker 6>destroy everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's salt.</v>

1995
01:41:37.751 --> 01:41:38.584
<v Speaker 6>Get up in there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just sit there and just rot away the </v>

1996
01:41:41.051 --> 01:41:44.260
<v Speaker 6>metal guy to take the metal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>buffet that with edge it out.</v>

1997
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:48.040
<v Speaker 6>And then you would have to spray </v>
<v Speaker 6>rustoleum on it and then you'd have.</v>

1998
01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:48.893
<v Speaker 6>Because I would see the guys in Colorado</v>
<v Speaker 6>how they would fix the cars and they </v>

1999
01:41:50.991 --> 01:41:55.060
<v Speaker 6>would take like a missing bumper colored</v>
<v Speaker 6>strategically welded in.</v>

2000
01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 6>And then you bumped that in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You colored your buffed,</v>

2001
01:41:58.690 --> 01:42:02.210
<v Speaker 6>you kept putting primer on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's how they got the rust.</v>

2002
01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.950
<v Speaker 6>Died in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 6>got a bike.</v>

2003
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:06.850
<v Speaker 6>Jersey Bodywork,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2004
01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:10.090
<v Speaker 6>Lot of east coast cars had a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 6>amount of body work.</v>

2005
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:13.150
<v Speaker 6>If you wanted a constant job fixing </v>
<v Speaker 6>cars,</v>

2006
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.110
<v Speaker 6>bodywork was always good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not just because accidents,</v>

2007
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:16.953
<v Speaker 6>but also just because of the rust work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now is the rest of the product of the </v>

2008
01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:23.330
<v Speaker 6>humidity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Also on the east coast,</v>

2009
01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:24.503
<v Speaker 6>Colorado wasn't that human.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See a little bit of rest from the </v>

2010
01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.350
<v Speaker 6>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You getting it from the moisture,</v>

2011
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:32.590
<v Speaker 6>you getting it from Saul.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure if they salt the roads,</v>

2012
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:34.530
<v Speaker 6>but the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you definitely getting more.</v>

2013
01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.210
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a variety of factors that caused</v>

2014
01:42:37.211 --> 01:42:42.211
<v Speaker 6>cars to rust out older cars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you can find an old rust free car</v>

2015
01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 6>now that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what everybody wants.</v>

2016
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:46.263
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you find out 1968 Camaro that's rust </v>

2017
01:42:48.791 --> 01:42:50.710
<v Speaker 6>free.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like whoa.</v>

2018
01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:53.020
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's beautiful thing about corvettes.</v>

2019
01:42:53.021 --> 01:42:55.150
<v Speaker 6>They didn't rust.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are made out of fiberglass,</v>

2020
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:56.343
<v Speaker 6>so you get an old corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of the bodies were pretty good if </v>

2021
01:42:58.511 --> 01:43:01.570
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't cracked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wasn't damaged because they didn't rust.</v>

2022
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:04.103
<v Speaker 6>I'm cutting myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm one of those fiberglass quote vetch </v>

2023
01:43:06.241 --> 01:43:07.074
<v Speaker 6>one time my leg or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My ran past them because this is the </v>

2024
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:10.870
<v Speaker 6>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2025
01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:16.090
<v Speaker 6>The fiberglass,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my 65 corvette.</v>

2026
01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.140
<v Speaker 6>That things fiberglass.</v>

2027
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:20.103
<v Speaker 6>Why did they fight boot glass to make </v>
<v Speaker 6>make it lighter and because they could </v>

2028
01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:27.160
<v Speaker 6>make cooler shapes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you look at a 1965 corvette,</v>

2029
01:43:27.161 --> 01:43:29.420
<v Speaker 6>that shape is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We look at it,</v>

2030
01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:30.723
<v Speaker 6>pull up mine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I have an idea how it looks </v>

2031
01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:34.120
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks like a sportster.</v>

2032
01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2033
01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:39.430
<v Speaker 6>That's the one that 65 to six.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well the defenders have curves to them.</v>

2034
01:43:39.431 --> 01:43:40.264
<v Speaker 6>Everything has curves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like such a curvy car and if you </v>

2035
01:43:42.761 --> 01:43:43.594
<v Speaker 6>had to do that all by banging out metal </v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's mine look fucking humps in </v>

2036
01:43:47.981 --> 01:43:50.650
<v Speaker 6>the curves and that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just offenders alone,</v>

2037
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:54.050
<v Speaker 6>like there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when I had my gross old wheels.</v>

2038
01:43:56.250 --> 01:43:59.730
<v Speaker 6>I got rid of those stupid wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

2039
01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:00.451
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2040
01:44:00.451 --> 01:44:02.580
<v Speaker 6>the shape of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2041
01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:05.220
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they could do that with metal,</v>

2042
01:44:05.221 --> 01:44:07.410
<v Speaker 6>but there are so many complicated curves</v>
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>

2043
01:44:07.411 --> 01:44:10.190
<v Speaker 6>It just occurred over the door to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fender.</v>

2044
01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.300
<v Speaker 6>The back fender.</v>

2045
01:44:12.730 --> 01:44:14.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're a fan of the car.</v>

2046
01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:19.330
<v Speaker 6>Is this car compare as a drive?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's not a,</v>

2047
01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:22.080
<v Speaker 6>that's not a real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you,</v>

2048
01:44:22.081 --> 01:44:24.600
<v Speaker 6>if you drove a regular 19,</v>
<v Speaker 6>65 corvette,</v>

2049
01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:28.200
<v Speaker 6>they're sloppy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're suspension sloppy.</v>

2050
01:44:28.201 --> 01:44:30.030

<v Speaker 3>a loser in 1982.</v>

2097
01:47:03.361 --> 01:47:06.000
<v Speaker 3>A Tattoo was not a work of art.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Razi.</v>

01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Ceo I was doing for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm both hands housing.</v>

2105
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.790
<v Speaker 3>This is a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pro Walking to the tattoo place.</v>

2106
01:47:35.791 --> 01:47:36.624
<v Speaker 3>It was in cliffside park and how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight they put on high school and like </v>

2107
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I quit high school my junior year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was I good at it?</v>

2108
01:47:45.121 --> 01:47:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very good at it.</v>

2109
01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:47.483
<v Speaker 3>I was very good at school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had to quit school because of </v>

2110
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.843
<v Speaker 3>necessity.</v>

2111
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:51.623
<v Speaker 3>I had no parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how to quit fucking high </v>

2112
01:47:53.011 --> 01:47:53.910
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2113
01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:55.513
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird how many people over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>years I've read and the only reason why </v>

2114
01:47:58.051 --> 01:47:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I got my ged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>

2115
01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I refuse to get my ged because if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would've failed my ged I would've killed</v>

2116
01:48:05.311 --> 01:48:06.144
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you quit high school and then </v>

2117
01:48:07.771 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 3>failure ged you're really doing from </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2118
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even want to know about the ged</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2119
01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.153
<v Speaker 3>but when I got arrested you got to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a ged because you got an extra point to </v>

2120
01:48:19.111 --> 01:48:22.960
<v Speaker 3>your sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thing like this is a variable that I had</v>

2121
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.470
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You not going to prison for that long.</v>

2122
01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:29.790
<v Speaker 3>So if you get arrested and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a ged and you're not working at the</v>

2123
01:48:29.791 --> 01:48:30.624
<v Speaker 3>time of your arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this all counts towards your sentencing </v>

2124
01:48:33.001 --> 01:48:33.834
<v Speaker 3>guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the only reason why that ged fucking </v>

2125
01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:38.513
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was petrified to taking the </v>

2126
01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan because once you fail your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ged,</v>

2127
01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.770
<v Speaker 3>they ain't no coming back.</v>

2128
01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:49.040
<v Speaker 3>So I got a tattoo on my fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking quit high school and I fucking</v>

2129
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:52.560
<v Speaker 3>failed the first ged thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would have died.</v>

2130
01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Like I studied hard for my ged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought the fucking thing.</v>

2131
01:48:56.611 --> 01:48:58.290
<v Speaker 3>I took a night class with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2132
01:48:58.291 --> 01:49:00.660
<v Speaker 3>didn't speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I studied hard.</v>

2133
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:01.583
<v Speaker 3>I passed my ged with flying colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's so weird how they put such a </v>

2134
01:49:06.211 --> 01:49:09.180
<v Speaker 3>stress on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was growing up and I know tons of</v>

2135
01:49:09.181 --> 01:49:10.014
<v Speaker 3>kids that sophomore year said my father </v>
<v Speaker 3>owns a fucking mechanic garage or we </v>

2136
01:49:15.061 --> 01:49:15.894
<v Speaker 3>have a fruit company or my father was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stock market and he's got me a job </v>

2137
01:49:19.461 --> 01:49:21.240
<v Speaker 3>and I know these kids and they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2138
01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:22.373
<v Speaker 3>I just saw one in West Palm beach that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was one of the first guys to quit </v>

2139
01:49:25.141 --> 01:49:27.230
<v Speaker 3>school when I was like worried about my </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2140
01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.120
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck the quit school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing fine.</v>

2141
01:49:30.150 --> 01:49:31.770
<v Speaker 3>He's rich as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2142
01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:32.693
<v Speaker 3>quitting an education like getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>quitting learning is what's really </v>

2143
01:49:38.481 --> 01:49:40.190
<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quitting school.</v>

2144
01:49:40.210 --> 01:49:43.830
<v Speaker 3>The problem with school is school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standardized education,</v>

2145
01:49:43.831 --> 01:49:44.664
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The education that they would like you </v>

2146
01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 3>to get is you go through</v>

2147
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.930
<v Speaker 6>school,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get out of high school,</v>

2148
01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:50.793
<v Speaker 6>you go to a good college,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get a degree and then you go to </v>

2149
01:49:52.631 --> 01:49:55.180
<v Speaker 6>graduate school and then your real </v>
<v Speaker 6>success,</v>

2150
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:58.930
<v Speaker 6>but there's a lot of people that did </v>
<v Speaker 6>that that there was no job for them.</v>

2151
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 6>They have graduate degrees and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not doing well and it's just.</v>

2152
01:50:03.581 --> 01:50:05.200
<v Speaker 6>It's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not a guarantee,</v>

2153
01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:07.450
<v Speaker 6>and especially in this weird fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>economy.</v>

2154
01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:12.400
<v Speaker 6>The problem with a guy like you or a </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem with a guy like me is that we're</v>

2155
01:50:12.401 --> 01:50:15.640
<v Speaker 6>never going to have regular jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was never going to work.</v>

2156
01:50:15.670 --> 01:50:18.370
<v Speaker 6>We're too fucked up for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for both.</v>

2157
01:50:18.371 --> 01:50:21.780
<v Speaker 6>Fucked up for different reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I quit every fucking job,</v>

2158
01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:24.220
<v Speaker 6>every job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never had a job for days.</v>

2159
01:50:24.221 --> 01:50:27.180
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>label and make 50 bucks.</v>

2160
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:30.910
<v Speaker 6>I got to wash dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wash dishes for four months,</v>

2161
01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:35.940
<v Speaker 6>but nobody recognized that you had the </v>
<v Speaker 6>potential to be an entertainer.</v>

2162
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:38.620
<v Speaker 6>Nobody ever says like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could be an entertainer.</v>

2163
01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:40.100
<v Speaker 6>You're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 6>entertaining guy.</v>

2164
01:50:40.101 --> 01:50:43.120
<v Speaker 6>Nobody ever brings that up as a viable </v>
<v Speaker 6>job option.</v>

2165
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:47.020
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's obviously a giant job option.</v>

2166
01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.400
<v Speaker 6>All of our friends that are like you are</v>

<v Speaker 6>we're all fuck ups in high school.</v>

2168
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:56.260
<v Speaker 6>They all barely made it through whatever</v>
<v Speaker 6>job they had.</v>

2169
01:50:56.261 --> 01:50:58.810
<v Speaker 6>They hated every second of it and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>all thought they were losers.</v>

2170
01:50:59.050 --> 01:50:59.883
<v Speaker 6>That's one thing we all have in common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were all worried that we were going </v>

2171
01:51:02.301 --> 01:51:03.960
<v Speaker 6>to be a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but none,</v>

2172
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:06.250
<v Speaker 6>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>none of us had someone who said,</v>

2199
01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.500

<v Speaker 6>I knew one thing about my life that I </v>

2208
01:52:33.641 --> 01:52:38.530
<v Speaker 6>was not taking a day job because the </v>

<v Speaker 3>There was 7:00</v>

2215

<v Speaker 3>Then she worked until three.</v>

2216
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:57.673
<v Speaker 3>I had no problem with working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first big job was bartending from </v>

2217
01:53:00.891 --> 01:53:05.890

<v Speaker 3>I liked that I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be opposite of everybody </v>

2219

<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>

2225
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Some people's personalities that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go somewhere with,</v>

2226
01:53:27.471 --> 01:53:30.290
<v Speaker 3>someone tells them what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to sit in a very safe,</v>

2227
01:53:30.291 --> 01:53:32.630
<v Speaker 3>structured environment and do boring </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2228
01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

2229
01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:36.390
<v Speaker 3>There's a company in my town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may pa Anthony Impairment Torah.</v>

2230
01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:39.290
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>APA fed everybody.</v>

2231
01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:44.420
<v Speaker 3>The deal was you went down in 1982,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say it was a 1750 an hour.</v>

2232
01:53:46.670 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 3>So you shaped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever shape.</v>

2233
01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:51.200
<v Speaker 3>What's that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shape is you just go down there and they</v>

2234
01:53:51.201 --> 01:53:54.200
<v Speaker 3>look at you like Marlin Brando on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>waterfront.</v>

2235
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:56.870
<v Speaker 3>You stand there like a fucking moron and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come up to you.</v>

2236
01:53:56.871 --> 01:53:58.900
<v Speaker 3>We need six people tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2237
01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.773
<v Speaker 3>you look pretty strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You and there's 30 people going to </v>

2238
01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 3>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape up work.</v>

2239
01:54:03.411 --> 01:54:04.244
<v Speaker 3>You got to go sign up at the hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a long shoreman all that </v>

2240
01:54:07.371 --> 01:54:08.960
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have work,</v>

2241
01:54:08.961 --> 01:54:09.794
<v Speaker 3>you'd go do shape up work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just go down there and wait for </v>

2242
01:54:12.051 --> 01:54:15.260
<v Speaker 3>your badge number to be called and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they give you a work.</v>

2243
01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:20.480
<v Speaker 3>So I used to work at APA is a shape guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got on Apa,</v>

2244
01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:23.570
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the first night Joe Rogan picks me.</v>

2245
01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:26.810
<v Speaker 3>He sees I'm a fucking meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a meal,</v>

2246
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:31.070
<v Speaker 3>like you ain't going to break me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shift started at seven and they went</v>

2247
01:54:31.071 --> 01:54:33.470
<v Speaker 3>through a six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes it's six,</v>

2248
01:54:33.471 --> 01:54:34.304
<v Speaker 3>a load of fucking Volkswagen engine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She came in and here you are with </v>

2249
01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:41.240
<v Speaker 3>another fucking gorilla picking up </v>
<v Speaker 3>Volkswagen engines.</v>

2250
01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:42.463
<v Speaker 3>So I used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I used to do was you couldn't work </v>

2251
01:54:44.901 --> 01:54:47.510
<v Speaker 3>more than six days a month or they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to put you in the unit.</v>

2252
01:54:49.150 --> 01:54:52.940
<v Speaker 3>So I would work apa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a white truck route,</v>

2253
01:54:52.941 --> 01:54:53.721
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

2254
01:54:53.721 --> 01:54:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Three different companies that you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape for.</v>

2255
01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:01.520
<v Speaker 3>So what you did was to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>union was once I found that Joe was cool</v>

2256
01:55:01.730 --> 01:55:04.910
<v Speaker 3>and Joe knew I worked at drew joe a </v>
<v Speaker 3>yardstick.</v>

2257
01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:06.590
<v Speaker 3>I agree a 100.</v>

2258
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:07.423
<v Speaker 3>So I had guarantee two days a week work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is still $18 an hour plus </v>

2259
01:55:12.351 --> 01:55:13.184
<v Speaker 3>overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did shapeup work and then if you </v>

2260
01:55:17.271 --> 01:55:20.840
<v Speaker 3>complete it like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they made a mistake and that gave you</v>

2261
01:55:20.841 --> 01:55:21.674
<v Speaker 3>12 days in a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they had a high year full time and </v>

2262
01:55:24.441 --> 01:55:26.840
<v Speaker 3>your life changed forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apa,</v>

2263
01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:29.990
<v Speaker 3>that guy in tour that owns it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody owns now.</v>

2264
01:55:29.991 --> 01:55:31.860
<v Speaker 3>The fucking fairy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2265
01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:33.770
<v Speaker 3>Like the ferry that goes back to New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jersey,</v>

2266
01:55:33.771 --> 01:55:35.600
<v Speaker 3>back and forth from Jersey and New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>City.</v>

2267
01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.090
<v Speaker 3>That's imperatore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't stop growing,</v>

2268
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:40.970
<v Speaker 3>but when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his facility,</v>

2269
01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:45.690
<v Speaker 3>he took such care of his employees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his gym.</v>

2270
01:55:46.110 --> 01:55:51.110
<v Speaker 3>When the New York mets went from a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>island to New Jersey,</v>

2271
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:54.660
<v Speaker 3>that's where they practiced the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You were allowed to use that gym.</v>

2274
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:03.960
<v Speaker 3>He already had shit that nobody had.</v>

2275
01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:08.280
<v Speaker 3>He had fiberglass backboards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had water weights.</v>

2276
01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:11.870
<v Speaker 3>He had shit that nobody had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like at that time I saw.</v>

2277
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:15.840
<v Speaker 3>But my point being that that was what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had in high school.</v>

2278
01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:16.763
<v Speaker 3>I could do shape work and I could still </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a living and eventually somebody </v>

2279
01:56:20.241 --> 01:56:23.550
<v Speaker 3>was gonna hire me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to work like a fucking meal,</v>

2280
01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:29.040
<v Speaker 3>but I'd still be making $1,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>a week when you're in 1980,</v>

2281
01:56:29.041 --> 01:56:31.020
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which wasn't a lot of money back then,</v>

2282
01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:32.703
<v Speaker 3>which wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the guys that buy the boats </v>

2283
01:56:34.141 --> 01:56:34.974
<v Speaker 3>and they go to Atlantic city and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wear white shoes on the weekends more </v>

2284
01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:39.354
<v Speaker 3>than everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you've made great money down </v>

2285
01:56:41.191 --> 01:56:41.900
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2286
01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:42.733
<v Speaker 3>so you shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could also do that as long shoreman </v>

2287
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:46.703
<v Speaker 3>you go down to Newark and stay there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then after 15 days if they get the </v>

2288
01:56:49.801 --> 01:56:52.770
<v Speaker 3>union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll charge you $500 for a book,</v>

2289
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:55.870
<v Speaker 3>which is means that you get $5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and unit,</v>

2290
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:59.190
<v Speaker 3>but you got benefits the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life insurance and a pension and.</v>

2291
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:01.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you realize that you weren't going </v>

2292
01:57:02.221 --> 01:57:04.080
<v Speaker 3>to work in a cubicle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>

2293
01:57:04.081 --> 01:57:07.110
<v Speaker 3>I knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I liked that might load and shit.</v>

2294
01:57:07.111 --> 01:57:09.780
<v Speaker 3>You don't know how many nights I walked </v>
<v Speaker 3>home on route three with no money.</v>

2295
01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:12.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm a days after loading a truck all </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

2296
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:17.520
<v Speaker 3>walking home on route three because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have enough money for the bus.</v>

2297
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.290
<v Speaker 3>I just had enough money for a breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would walk up and get breakfast at</v>

2298
01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:26.400
<v Speaker 3>a diner and I go wherever I was sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucking go to sleep.</v>

2299
01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:27.293
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedy didn't come into my radar to a </v>

2300
01:57:31.441 --> 01:57:36.270
<v Speaker 3>month before I went to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a month before I got locked up,</v>

2301
01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:38.850
<v Speaker 3>a month before I got arrested for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime,</v>

2302
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:39.743
<v Speaker 3>nevermind prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a salesman they hired and I </v>

2303
01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:46.020
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did not get along.</v>

2304
01:57:46.050 --> 01:57:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Me and him as Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had this,</v>

2305
01:57:49.050 --> 01:57:49.883
<v Speaker 3>he was American Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece of them was American Indian and </v>

2306
01:57:52.291 --> 01:57:56.550
<v Speaker 3>he even had that Charles Bronson look in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his eyes and one day me and him got into</v>

2307
01:57:56.551 --> 01:57:57.750
<v Speaker 3>a beef over a customer.</v>

2308
01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:59.183
<v Speaker 3>He said the customers would say is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was mine and me and him banged up </v>

2309
01:58:02.731 --> 01:58:04.620
<v Speaker 3>face to face and they had to break us </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

2310
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:06.383
<v Speaker 3>but about a week later I was on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point that means you're outside waiting </v>

2311
01:58:08.731 --> 01:58:11.580
<v Speaker 3>for a customer to try to get a customer </v>
<v Speaker 3>on point.</v>

01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:13.860
<v Speaker 3>And he came out and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget that man,</v>

2315

<v Speaker 3>if I was 25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was about 40 something 44,</v>

2316
01:58:24.541 --> 01:58:28.380
<v Speaker 3>45 and I had to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2317
01:58:28.381 --> 01:58:29.214
<v Speaker 3>I was doing drugs and I had the tough </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy mentality and I rang and I would </v>

2318
01:58:33.511 --> 01:58:34.344
<v Speaker 3>never raise my hand to some of the old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I went after him that </v>

2319
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:37.583
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he came up to me and put on his </v>

2320
01:58:39.331 --> 01:58:39.811
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No Damn Bae.</v>

2325
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:48.543
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the entertainment coordinator for </v>

2326

<v Speaker 3>Casino in Las Vegas.</v>

<v Speaker 3>comedy and I was listening to him.</v>

2331
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:07.990
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should really give it a try.</v>

2332
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking crazy.</v>

2333
01:59:10.481 --> 01:59:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Freddy Prince.</v>

2334
01:59:13.451 --> 01:59:15.760
<v Speaker 3>I like David Brandon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Richard Pryor,</v>

2335
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:19.180
<v Speaker 3>but some fucking criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this shit.</v>

2336
01:59:19.690 --> 01:59:20.523
<v Speaker 3>Not a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got arrested and then when I came </v>

2337
01:59:23.141 --> 01:59:27.580
<v Speaker 3>out I didn't think about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I fucking came out for reals,</v>

2338
01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:29.553
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy that loosened a pismo </v>
<v Speaker 3>beach now and he used to talk to me </v>

2339
01:59:36.731 --> 01:59:37.301
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2340
01:59:37.301 --> 01:59:39.610
<v Speaker 3>you ever been to the standup comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I will come on though.</v>

2341
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Leave me the fuck alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a drug addict in stand up comedy.</v>

2342
01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know standup comedy was about </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2343
01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:51.020
<v Speaker 3>I thought that Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just call it the comedy store.</v>

2344
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:54.060
<v Speaker 3>Should have a camera in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna be down and you take an hour.</v>

2345
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:56.760
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that you had to work 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>months to get an hour.</v>

2346
01:59:56.761 --> 01:59:57.594
<v Speaker 3>Our material.</v>

2347
01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:00.840
<v Speaker 6>Lucky what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought.</v>

2348
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:01.703
<v Speaker 6>That's how fucking off I was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just thought that when I saw John </v>

2349
02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:06.420
<v Speaker 6>Leguizamo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he just went down it.</v>

2350
02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:09.530
<v Speaker 6>He just went down into the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2351
02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:12.720
<v Speaker 6>that's what I thought for all that time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're perceptions of it,</v>

2352
02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:13.913
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing about it is that it's a </v>

2353
02:00:15.811 --> 02:00:18.600
<v Speaker 6>possibility and no one ever says that </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a possibility.</v>

2354
02:00:18.930 --> 02:00:20.970
<v Speaker 6>It's not an easy possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's an.</v>

2355
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.430
<v Speaker 6>It's an option.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But being a fucking physicians,</v>

2356
02:00:23.431 --> 02:00:25.710
<v Speaker 6>not an easy possibility either,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he tells someone,</v>

2357
02:00:25.711 --> 02:00:26.544
<v Speaker 6>you want to be a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't look at you like you're </v>

2358
02:00:27.361 --> 02:00:29.490
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The amount of work,</v>

2359
02:00:29.491 --> 02:00:30.324
<v Speaker 6>it's probably pretty similar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of work involved in being </v>

2360
02:00:32.341 --> 02:00:33.174
<v Speaker 6>a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a path that's been taken by </v>

2361
02:00:36.031 --> 02:00:38.310
<v Speaker 6>many people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's clearly established.</v>

2362
02:00:38.311 --> 02:00:39.900
<v Speaker 6>You go through school,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go through medical school,</v>

2363
02:00:39.901 --> 02:00:40.734
<v Speaker 6>you go through your residency.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's all these different steps that </v>

2364
02:00:42.331 --> 02:00:46.470
<v Speaker 6>you have to take that everybody's really</v>
<v Speaker 6>aware of with the standup comedy career.</v>

2365
02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:49.200
<v Speaker 6>No one who's other than the people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>have done it.</v>

2366
02:00:49.290 --> 02:00:53.910
<v Speaker 6>No one knows what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You and I both know that in order to be,</v>

2367
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.070
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say I'm a physicist,</v>

2368
02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:58.440
<v Speaker 6>you have to go through a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 6>of education.</v>

2369
02:00:58.460 --> 02:00:58.980
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

2370
02:00:58.980 --> 02:00:59.813
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you had.</v>

2371
02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:02.670
<v Speaker 6>Oh Tim son,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's really smart.</v>

2372
02:01:02.671 --> 02:01:07.290
<v Speaker 6>He wants to work for space x,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wants to build rocket ships.</v>

2373
02:01:07.291 --> 02:01:07.830
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2374
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:09.450
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a possibility.</v>

2375
02:01:09.451 --> 02:01:11.070
<v Speaker 6>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're really smart.</v>

2376
02:01:11.071 --> 02:01:12.750
<v Speaker 6>You go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get a good education,</v>

2377
02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:15.120
<v Speaker 6>you follow through you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you eventually.</v>

2378
02:01:15.121 --> 02:01:15.954
<v Speaker 6>There's a path there with comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like no one knows that path other than </v>

2379
02:01:18.421 --> 02:01:19.254
<v Speaker 6>people like you were at people that have</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually done that path and make a </v>

2380
02:01:21.421 --> 02:01:23.220
<v Speaker 6>living doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know it,</v>

2381
02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:24.870
<v Speaker 6>but for everybody on the outside it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2382
02:01:24.871 --> 02:01:25.704
<v Speaker 6>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And sometimes you need someone to come </v>

2383
02:01:28.141 --> 02:01:31.500
<v Speaker 6>along and tell you like the guy who you </v>
<v Speaker 6>were working with.</v>

2384
02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:32.753
<v Speaker 6>For me it was my friend Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dr Steve Graham for he was my friend </v>

2385
02:01:36.811 --> 02:01:37.700
<v Speaker 6>when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2386
02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.940
<v Speaker 6>he was telling me this when I was like </v>
<v Speaker 6>19 and he's like,</v>

2387
02:01:40.941 --> 02:01:43.430
<v Speaker 6>you're really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you should be a comedian.</v>

2388
02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:47.870
<v Speaker 6>Funny to you have like other people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to think I'm an asshole.</v>

2389
02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:50.030
<v Speaker 6>That's all I was thinking is that I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

2390
02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:54.440
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't big on public speaking but got </v>
<v Speaker 6>me into public speaking.</v>

2391
02:01:54.441 --> 02:01:57.140
<v Speaker 6>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What helped me was teaching,</v>

2392
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:58.603
<v Speaker 6>when I was teaching martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had to teach in front of all these </v>

2393
02:02:01.311 --> 02:02:03.770
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had never spoken in front of groups of</v>

2394
02:02:03.771 --> 02:02:04.604
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I was really good at the time at </v>

2395
02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:10.050
<v Speaker 6>teaching classes I had learned from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2396
02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:13.520
<v Speaker 6>my instructor and there was a way to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2397
02:02:13.730 --> 02:02:16.010
<v Speaker 6>I was very enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Obviously it was my life,</v>

2398
02:02:16.011 --> 02:02:16.844
<v Speaker 6>so it was very intense about doing it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I got used to speaking publicly in </v>

2399
02:02:19.881 --> 02:02:20.714
<v Speaker 6>front of these large groups of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was because I was speaking about </v>

2400
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:23.474
<v Speaker 6>something that I was good at and then I </v>
<v Speaker 6>would teach at Boston University and </v>

2401
02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:28.730
<v Speaker 6>when I would go there and teach the </v>
<v Speaker 6>classes,</v>

2402
02:02:29.090 --> 02:02:31.100
<v Speaker 6>I'd start off the classes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2403
02:02:31.190 --> 02:02:34.580
<v Speaker 6>and I basically said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

2404
02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:37.010
<v Speaker 6>you take this class,</v>
<v Speaker 6>try hard.</v>

2405
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:39.110
<v Speaker 6>You're going to get an a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pass fail a.</v>

2406
02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:42.860
<v Speaker 6>It actually counts for your GPA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this is an easy a,</v>

2407
02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.310
<v Speaker 6>I don't want you to be fucking Bruce Lee</v>
<v Speaker 6>or Jackie Chan.</v>

2408
02:02:46.311 --> 02:02:48.170
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just want you to try.</v>

2409
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.990
<v Speaker 6>If you come here and try,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get an a that's simple and so,</v>

2410
02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:52.993
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>became friends with a lot of the kids </v>

2411
02:02:53.841 --> 02:02:56.780
<v Speaker 6>because they were like my age.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of them were even older than me and</v>

2412
02:02:56.781 --> 02:02:57.614
<v Speaker 6>I was teaching them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that was how I got into public </v>

2413
02:02:59.601 --> 02:03:00.040
<v Speaker 6>speaking.</v>

2414
02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:03.520
<v Speaker 3>When was the first time to think before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you even answer,</v>

2415
02:03:03.730 --> 02:03:05.830
<v Speaker 3>besides standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you ever,</v>

2416
02:03:05.831 --> 02:03:06.664
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever on the stage before that Improv </v>

2417
02:03:08.711 --> 02:03:12.190
<v Speaker 3>troupe in grammar school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a play in high school,</v>

2418
02:03:12.191 --> 02:03:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Playing Grammar School?</v>

2419
02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:14.760
<v Speaker 6>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In College I took.</v>

2420
02:03:14.761 --> 02:03:15.690
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't do any.</v>

2421
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:17.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think I ever did anything.</v>

2422
02:03:17.221 --> 02:03:18.840
<v Speaker 6>Like maybe if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember,</v>

2423
02:03:18.841 --> 02:03:22.260
<v Speaker 6>but I in college I took a course on </v>
<v Speaker 6>public speaking.</v>

2424
02:03:22.290 --> 02:03:23.970
<v Speaker 6>It was like some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2425
02:03:25.170 --> 02:03:30.170
<v Speaker 6>it was some sort of course where we </v>
<v Speaker 6>would do like little play was terrible.</v>

2426
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:31.223
<v Speaker 6>The teacher was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was just this short little lazy </v>

2427
02:03:34.561 --> 02:03:36.660
<v Speaker 6>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was so lazy.</v>

2428
02:03:36.661 --> 02:03:40.860
<v Speaker 6>Like the way she would give classes was </v>
<v Speaker 6>says it was continuing education program</v>

2429
02:03:40.861 --> 02:03:42.750
<v Speaker 6>at Umass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was just terrible.</v>

2430
02:03:43.110 --> 02:03:43.943
<v Speaker 6>And there was the people in the class </v>
<v Speaker 6>where it was very loosely organized and </v>

2431
02:03:47.670 --> 02:03:50.790
<v Speaker 6>explain the lessons very well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2432
02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:51.653
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we had to put together some little play </v>

2433

<v Speaker 6>I remember was me and this girl and this</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy we put together,</v>

2434
02:03:58.201 --> 02:04:02.790

<v Speaker 6>We wrote it together.</v>

2435
02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:04.093
<v Speaker 6>It was around the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was probably thinking about doing </v>

2436
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:08.520
<v Speaker 6>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was probably 19 or 20 at the time.</v>

2437
02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I never was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always shunned from all that stuff.</v>

2438
02:04:13.711 --> 02:04:14.544
<v Speaker 3>I was always embarrassed and my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got thrown out of the Catholic </v>

2439
02:04:20.341 --> 02:04:21.960
<v Speaker 3>school in the sixth grade,</v>

<v Speaker 3>class.</v>

02:07:25.530 --> 02:07:28.050
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be an A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Janet Jackson had one of the 50.</v>

2501
02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2502
02:07:29.410 --> 02:07:30.243
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need a guy to give you a stab </v>

2503
02:07:32.971 --> 02:07:34.820
<v Speaker 2>in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generate everything at the same time,</v>

2504
02:07:34.890 --> 02:07:36.250
<v Speaker 2>be back a lot</v>

2505
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:39.700
<v Speaker 6>of loads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just keep those loads for weeks.</v>

2506
02:07:39.970 --> 02:07:41.830
<v Speaker 6>No jerking off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no nothing,</v>

2507
02:07:41.831 --> 02:07:46.810
<v Speaker 6>no wet dreams for weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then just release the hounds</v>

2508
02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:53.430
<v Speaker 3>48 as a woman after 48.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From what I've read,</v>

2509
02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:56.460
<v Speaker 3>46,</v>
<v Speaker 3>47,</v>

2510
02:07:56.580 --> 02:07:59.820
<v Speaker 3>your chances of that child having autism</v>
<v Speaker 3>have very high.</v>

2511
02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:03.270
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of chances to have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of little things going wrong.</v>

2512
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Chances are with the male,</v>

2513
02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:05.333
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2514
02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:08.640
<v Speaker 6>really over 50 [inaudible] yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with men.</v>

2515
02:08:08.670 --> 02:08:09.503
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch of factors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one of the factors is also the age </v>

2516
02:08:11.911 --> 02:08:12.744
<v Speaker 6>of the father.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why you see more autistic kids </v>

2517
02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:18.030
<v Speaker 6>these days than before as people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>putting off,</v>

2518
02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:22.350
<v Speaker 6>having children and having careers later</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's complications.</v>

2519
02:08:22.351 --> 02:08:24.840
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the theories as to why this </v>
<v Speaker 6>more autistic kids.</v>

2520
02:08:25.290 --> 02:08:28.680
<v Speaker 6>Another theory is that there's not more </v>
<v Speaker 6>autistic kids would just.</v>

2521
02:08:28.681 --> 02:08:29.514
<v Speaker 6>We're just better at diagnosing what the</v>
<v Speaker 6>issue is with children than we used to </v>

2522
02:08:33.391 --> 02:08:35.880
<v Speaker 6>be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Before I say we very loosely,</v>

2523
02:08:35.881 --> 02:08:39.390
<v Speaker 6>obviously Bridgette Nielsen look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2524
02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:42.450
<v Speaker 6>so she had her first kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is her fifth.</v>

2525
02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:44.730
<v Speaker 6>She had her first kid when she was young</v>
<v Speaker 6>and vibrant,</v>

2526
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:47.970
<v Speaker 6>and the fifth kid when she's basically a</v>
<v Speaker 6>monster,</v>

2527
02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:52.620
<v Speaker 3>bless her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God bless her.</v>

2528
02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:57.410
<v Speaker 3>God fucking blephs and 55 healthy baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for her.</v>

2529
02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:58.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My.</v>

2530
02:08:58.050 --> 02:09:00.180
<v Speaker 3>My little girl was born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept looking at her eyes.</v>

2531
02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Her Age was 55.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>

2532
02:09:03.570 --> 02:09:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I kept looking at my daughter's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

2533
02:09:05.210 --> 02:09:06.043
<v Speaker 3>she was stoned because God knows tac was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my rifle and I shut that load of </v>

2534

2536
02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:16.121
<v Speaker 6>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2537
02:09:16.121 --> 02:09:16.954
<v Speaker 6>when you just think about the window of </v>
<v Speaker 6>time that you have to get pregnant and </v>

2538
02:09:20.471 --> 02:09:23.560
<v Speaker 6>impregnate someone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just so you know,</v>

2539

2543
02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:32.653
<v Speaker 6>Just wears on people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't think about it when you see </v>

2544

<v Speaker 6>people day in,</v>

<v Speaker 3>What happened was the car that didn't </v>

2578
02:11:15.981 --> 02:11:18.740
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't even get pissed off,</v>

2580
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:22.360
<v Speaker 3>what's happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The car,</v>

2581
02:11:22.860 --> 02:11:23.693
<v Speaker 3>we walked 50 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a cab and that was the end of </v>

2582
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:27.890
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

02:11:27.891 --> 02:11:29.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you that.</v>

2584
02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:29.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying,</v>

2585
02:11:29.530 --> 02:11:30.161
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2586
02:11:30.161 --> 02:11:32.080
<v Speaker 6>it's perception.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2587
02:11:32.410 --> 02:11:33.243
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you showed Brigitte Nielsen a photo </v>

2588
02:11:36.611 --> 02:11:37.444
<v Speaker 6>of her today when she was 20 and said </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to look like this and five </v>

2589
02:11:40.421 --> 02:11:43.270
<v Speaker 6>minutes she'd probably freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably be terrified,</v>

2590
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:45.550
<v Speaker 6>but now that she's 55,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's like,</v>

2591
02:11:45.551 --> 02:11:47.020
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I look like.</v>

<v Speaker 6>we all become j Dot Howard,</v>

2594
02:11:50.141 --> 02:11:50.974

<v Speaker 6>We all were going to go this so much </v>

2595
02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:56.890
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't stay beautiful forever.</v>

2596
02:11:56.891 --> 02:12:00.670
<v Speaker 6>This is going to be an amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 6>where your body just stops working.</v>

2597
02:12:00.671 --> 02:12:01.504
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And your tissue starts to hang off your </v>

2598
02:12:03.671 --> 02:12:06.910
<v Speaker 6>face and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is what it is and it's perception.</v>

2599
02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:08.700
<v Speaker 6>A lot of it is perception.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You broke it down</v>

2600
02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:10.220
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

2604
02:12:17.661 --> 02:12:18.494
<v Speaker 3>beauty mark.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Who was married to Richard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2607
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:29.540

<v Speaker 3>but the end of that song and said,</v>

2608
02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:32.120
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran into her six months ago.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't smoke at night when I drive </v>

2624
02:13:22.401 --> 02:13:24.350
<v Speaker 3>because I can't see at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Radio personalities were different thing</v>
<v Speaker 6>men.</v>

2704
02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:39.553
<v Speaker 6>It's like you would become accustomed to</v>
<v Speaker 6>listening to someone's voice and that </v>

2705
02:17:44.241 --> 02:17:47.030
<v Speaker 6>was the person who wanted to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember a certain Radio Djs,</v>

<v Speaker 3>talk sports and people call it.</v>

2728
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love it.</v>

2729
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:54.040
<v Speaker 3>The Yankees should've beat one last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

2730
02:18:54.041 --> 02:18:56.740
<v Speaker 3>It was a rough job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit drives me fucking crazy.</v>

2731
02:18:57.060 --> 02:19:00.190
<v Speaker 3>But by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>congratulations on the Boston red sox.</v>

2732
02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:03.850
<v Speaker 3>They will fuck the tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tough.</v>

2733
02:19:03.930 --> 02:19:06.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch baseball throughout the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time,</v>

2734
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.863
<v Speaker 3>but the Cuban once September comes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the art form Joe Rowe and it's a </v>

2735
02:19:11.831 --> 02:19:13.450
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2736
02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:14.313
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got left back and I got to read the </v>

2737
02:19:15.610 --> 02:19:16.443
<v Speaker 3>album only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only Cuban like and play </v>

2738
02:19:17.861 --> 02:19:21.610
<v Speaker 3>baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm possibly the only Cuban that was the</v>

2739
02:19:21.611 --> 02:19:23.380
<v Speaker 3>worst baseball player in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2740
02:19:23.381 --> 02:19:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Even my mother's have gone to the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

2741
02:19:26.651 --> 02:19:30.140
<v Speaker 3>I embarrass the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was terrible,</v>

2742
02:19:30.590 --> 02:19:34.160
<v Speaker 3>but during the playoffs I watched that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit religiously.</v>

2743
02:19:34.850 --> 02:19:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I talked to my uncle and he fills me in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My uncle's tremendous.</v>

2744
02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:42.110
<v Speaker 3>My uncle fucking knows he's eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been watching,</v>

2745
02:19:42.111 --> 02:19:42.944
<v Speaker 3>but he knows so I'd get on the phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him during the playoffs and he'll </v>

2746
02:19:46.370 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 3>be watching and I've talked to him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2747
02:19:49.101 --> 02:19:49.934
<v Speaker 3>he said he's ratting me off in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the way he throws the ball and </v>

2748
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:55.770
<v Speaker 3>look at his finger how it's whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just.</v>

2749
02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:59.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a different art and Boston was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>too tough.</v>

2750
02:19:59.270 --> 02:20:00.290
<v Speaker 3>This year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogen,</v>

2751
02:20:00.291 --> 02:20:03.510
<v Speaker 3>they had thieves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball player with the years.</v>

2752
02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:04.353
<v Speaker 3>It's tough to play against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why me and your old partner at </v>

2753
02:20:07.791 --> 02:20:11.990
<v Speaker 3>the UFC with tight Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're both Cincinnati red fans.</v>

2754
02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:16.610
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by theme?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People still basis people still basis.</v>

2755
02:20:16.611 --> 02:20:20.210
<v Speaker 3>I love these because they don't let the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitcher get into a rhythm.</v>

2756
02:20:21.070 --> 02:20:21.903
<v Speaker 3>They get into the pitcher's head and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they start dwindling their arms and now </v>

2757
02:20:24.771 --> 02:20:25.604
<v Speaker 3>the pitch has got to keep looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show and if you ever get a chance to </v>

2758
02:20:28.221 --> 02:20:31.010
<v Speaker 3>watch an old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sincerely red bull park,</v>

2759
02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:32.720
<v Speaker 3>a good game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I find one,</v>

2760
02:20:32.721 --> 02:20:35.620
<v Speaker 3>I'll send it to you and you watch what </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the pit.</v>

2761
02:20:35.650 --> 02:20:38.570
<v Speaker 3>You're not wanting to read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The coach comes out and get,</v>

2762
02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:39.553
<v Speaker 3>takes the ball from the guy and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>walks off and they call a reliever with </v>

2763
02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:44.093
<v Speaker 3>Cincinnati reds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The coach would come on the pitch would </v>

2764
02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:48.500
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take this fucking boy.</v>

2765
02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to pitch again because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cincinnati was the king of bunting.</v>

2766
02:20:52.930 --> 02:20:53.763
<v Speaker 3>Get on first and then playing with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head start and they would steal second </v>

2767
02:20:57.710 --> 02:21:00.380
<v Speaker 3>and they would hit a single.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Cincinnati reds one.</v>

2768
02:21:00.381 --> 02:21:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Those all those years where Pete rose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pete rose was in the home run hitter.</v>

2769
02:21:03.890 --> 02:21:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Pete rose was headed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means every time he came up to bat,</v>

2770
02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:08.933
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a problem and him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and concepcion and Morgan and all those </v>

2771
02:21:14.271 --> 02:21:15.800
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just single hitters.</v>

2772
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:18.110
<v Speaker 3>Those are the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least a home run.</v>

2773
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:19.243
<v Speaker 3>I know where I stand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these motherfuckers that club you </v>

2774
02:21:21.531 --> 02:21:22.364
<v Speaker 3>with singles and doubles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a different game and then I'm </v>

2775
02:21:24.711 --> 02:21:25.544
<v Speaker 3>stealing from you to really get down </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm stealing second and stealing </v>

2776
02:21:28.671 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 3>third that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

2777
02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:32.420
<v Speaker 3>that sparky Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that movie.</v>

2778
02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:34.910
<v Speaker 3>I know you've never watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it was about.</v>

2779
02:21:34.911 --> 02:21:37.820
<v Speaker 3>The movie with Brad Pitt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did about baseball.</v>

2780
02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:44.080
<v Speaker 3>That's a great movie because he explains</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you that it's on base percentage.</v>

2781
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:47.630
<v Speaker 3>All that other shit is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2782
02:21:47.631 --> 02:21:49.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy walks a lot,</v>

2783
02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:52.400
<v Speaker 3>but they get on base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's all about.</v>

2784
02:21:52.970 --> 02:21:55.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's the center and Boston play </v>
<v Speaker 3>that same game.</v>

2785
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:57.440
<v Speaker 3>The thieves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they steal.</v>

2786
02:21:57.620 --> 02:21:58.453
<v Speaker 3>It was heart attack baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't watch it if you bet the </v>

2787
02:22:01.671 --> 02:22:04.660
<v Speaker 3>last five games got blusher brush and </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to attack.</v>

2788
02:22:04.970 --> 02:22:07.100
<v Speaker 3>I got back to my room and cleaned the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tutoring in the morning.</v>

2789
02:22:07.101 --> 02:22:09.680
<v Speaker 3>They were still planning to die in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

2790
02:22:09.681 --> 02:22:11.540
<v Speaker 3>I went to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dodger game was still on.</v>

2791
02:22:12.770 --> 02:22:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Its tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the time of the year that I love</v>

2792
02:22:16.011 --> 02:22:18.050
<v Speaker 3>playing baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it starts in April,</v>

2793
02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:19.131
<v Speaker 3>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2794
02:22:19.131 --> 02:22:20.900
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch none of that shit.</v>

2795
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 3>None of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played baseball</v>

2796
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.420
<v Speaker 6>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tara.</v>

2797
02:22:27.450 --> 02:22:30.150
<v Speaker 6>I stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I got into martial arts,</v>

2798
02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:33.300
<v Speaker 6>I found out about taekwondo because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was waiting for a red sox game,</v>

2799
02:22:33.301 --> 02:22:36.720
<v Speaker 6>waiting for the tea to get home and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a big ass line to get to the t</v>

2800
02:22:36.730 --> 02:22:41.730
<v Speaker 6>because the fenway park would let out </v>
<v Speaker 6>and walking back from fenway park to the</v>

2801
02:22:41.941 --> 02:22:44.910
<v Speaker 6>train station.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw the taekwondo school and I went up</v>

2802
02:22:44.911 --> 02:22:45.744
<v Speaker 6>there and there's this guy named John </v>
<v Speaker 6>Leaves a national heavyweight champion </v>

2803
02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:48.953
<v Speaker 6>light heavyweight champion at the time </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he was about to go to the World Cup </v>

2804
02:22:52.650 --> 02:22:53.483
<v Speaker 6>and he was up there kicking the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the heavy bag and I'd never seen </v>

2805
02:22:56.011 --> 02:22:59.280
<v Speaker 6>anything like it in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would here in the sounds of it,</v>

2806
02:22:59.281 --> 02:23:02.250
<v Speaker 6>I was walking up the stairs at hearing </v>
<v Speaker 6>lump Chink,</v>

2807
02:23:03.470 --> 02:23:08.130
<v Speaker 6>Chink in the womp was him kicking the </v>
<v Speaker 6>bank and the bank was the chain.</v>

2808
02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:12.090
<v Speaker 6>As the bag would go flying through the </v>
<v Speaker 6>air and slammed against the chain.</v>

2809
02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:14.640
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is the craziest fucking sound,</v>

2810
02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.710
<v Speaker 6>and I walked in and there was this guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>who was just at the peak of his physical</v>

2811
02:23:19.711 --> 02:23:20.544
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was just at his very best and he was </v>

2812
02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:27.500
<v Speaker 6>training for a world tournament and just</v>
<v Speaker 6>watching him do that was so terrifying.</v>

2813
02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:30.360
<v Speaker 6>Thinking like if someone kicked me like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2814
02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:31.373
<v Speaker 6>like what it would do to my body and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's how I got into martial arts </v>

2815
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:37.140
<v Speaker 6>because before I wasn't in the team </v>
<v Speaker 6>sports man.</v>

2816
02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:40.290
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the reasons why I got into</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestling and Lisa wrestling,</v>

2817
02:23:40.291 --> 02:23:43.350
<v Speaker 6>it's me against that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hated team sports.</v>

2818
02:23:43.351 --> 02:23:44.184
<v Speaker 6>I hated the fact that we were losers </v>
<v Speaker 6>because a little billy dropped the ball </v>

2819
02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:49.290
<v Speaker 6>like I didn't and I didn't play for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>team either.</v>

2820
02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:51.750
<v Speaker 6>Like they would tell her heart Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go try to get a single.</v>

2821
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:52.151
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2822
02:23:52.151 --> 02:23:52.770
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2823
02:23:52.770 --> 02:23:54.180
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

2824
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:55.383
<v Speaker 6>I swung.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I either got a home run or I struck out </v>

2825
02:23:58.440 --> 02:23:59.273
<v Speaker 6>every fucking time I was at bat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I either could cause I got a home run </v>

2826
02:24:03.210 --> 02:24:04.650
<v Speaker 6>once and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2827
02:24:04.651 --> 02:24:06.840
<v Speaker 6>that is so much better than getting a </v>
<v Speaker 6>single.</v>

2828
02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:10.170
<v Speaker 6>You could suck Dick for the rest of your</v>
<v Speaker 6>life or singles.</v>

2829
02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:11.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a fuck about a single.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Didn't.</v>

2830
02:24:11.930 --> 02:24:16.050
<v Speaker 6>I felt bad if I go on base and I got a </v>
<v Speaker 6>single because I connected once,</v>

2831
02:24:16.290 --> 02:24:19.680
<v Speaker 6>cock Kirouac and that ball and I can hit</v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty hard.</v>

2832
02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:20.783
<v Speaker 6>Not Bald,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wet fucking full lion and it went into </v>

2833
02:24:23.641 --> 02:24:25.800
<v Speaker 6>the stands and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2834
02:24:25.860 --> 02:24:26.693
<v Speaker 6>this is what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's about doing that is the only thing </v>

2835
02:24:29.631 --> 02:24:32.760
<v Speaker 6>that's any good about the stupid fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>that and catching balls.</v>

2836
02:24:32.761 --> 02:24:34.380
<v Speaker 6>So many cracks went out there and catch </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2837
02:24:34.381 --> 02:24:35.214

<v Speaker 3>before I went to physical therapy,</v>

2952
02:30:07.371 --> 02:30:08.204
<v Speaker 3>I want them to try the club bats because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have all the way down the end of </v>

2953
02:30:11.421 --> 02:30:14.390
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Helps pull that shoulder all the way the</v>

2954
02:30:14.391 --> 02:30:15.820
<v Speaker 3>fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for me to do anything.</v>

2955
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:16.663
<v Speaker 3>I had to stretch my shoulder before and </v>
<v Speaker 3>after really deep I had to go to law </v>

2956
02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:20.493
<v Speaker 3>against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the guy brought on Alberto </v>

2957
02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Magaziney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Galena,</v>

2958
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:25.930
<v Speaker 3>glossy.</v>

2959
02:30:25.930 --> 02:30:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of his little warmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great workouts and even,</v>

2960
02:30:29.390 --> 02:30:30.223
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

2961
02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:31.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2962
02:30:31.821 --> 02:30:35.480
<v Speaker 3>It's got that Kettlebell six Kendall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six winds of transformation.</v>

2963
02:30:35.810 --> 02:30:37.910
<v Speaker 3>They got some great stuff on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy send it to me,</v>

2964
02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:40.760
<v Speaker 3>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call it something else instead of a</v>

2965
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:43.280
<v Speaker 3>warm up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call it something else.</v>

2966
02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] name is Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Josh Wolfe,</v>

2967
02:30:46.060 --> 02:30:46.970
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Wolfe,</v>

2968
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.870
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both good.</v>

2969
02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:49.460
<v Speaker 3>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>

2970
02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic clubs is that they're not that</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy,</v>

2971
02:30:51.891 --> 02:30:52.724
<v Speaker 3>but they're odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like you're holding onto the end of </v>

2972
02:30:54.441 --> 02:30:55.274
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way it is isn't the other end </v>

2973
02:30:57.320 --> 02:31:01.340
<v Speaker 3>and it's this long thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's very awkward and you could get a</v>

2974
02:31:01.341 --> 02:31:04.250
<v Speaker 3>really good work on with 15 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really can't.</v>

2975
02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:05.860
<v Speaker 3>That's all I use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen and 10.</v>

2976
02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:07.033
<v Speaker 3>I got a five on it to break my wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a five and you really could </v>

2977
02:31:11.511 --> 02:31:14.360
<v Speaker 3>really break the flash on your risks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the five,</v>

2978
02:31:14.810 --> 02:31:17.930
<v Speaker 3>they have an exercise that you go over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had a full set of them out here.</v>

2979
02:31:17.931 --> 02:31:19.740
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to use your men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tremendous.</v>

2980
02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Tremendous.</v>

2981
02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:22.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was doing wrong.</v>

2982
02:31:22.591 --> 02:31:25.650
<v Speaker 2>The kettlebell class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I swinging the gorilla?</v>

2983
02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:29.400
<v Speaker 2>Why am I swinging the fucking gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you swinging the grill?</v>

2984
02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:30.273
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you turned me onto Steve </v>

2985
02:31:32.220 --> 02:31:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Maxwell steady five pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I do 35 and 44 pounds.</v>

2986
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I love Stephen Maxwell stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I keep.</v>

2987
02:31:39.090 --> 02:31:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I keep Steve Max and then you will have </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2988
02:31:41.490 --> 02:31:43.860
<v Speaker 2>I called you with the last dilemma and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

2989
02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:45.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>

2990
02:31:45.450 --> 02:31:47.370
<v Speaker 2>So now I do three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three and three,</v>

2991
02:31:47.371 --> 02:31:48.750
<v Speaker 2>and I'm out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2992
02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:49.753
<v Speaker 2>Do three Turkish getups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three fucking set to cleans and three </v>

2993
02:31:52.441 --> 02:31:54.600
<v Speaker 2>swings out while they believe often with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2994
02:31:54.690 --> 02:31:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Just do it a few days a week yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2995
02:31:56.881 --> 02:31:59.670
<v Speaker 2>if I'm on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most hotels now have kettlebells.</v>

2996
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most hotels are starting to come around.</v>

2997
02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I go to a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I check in,</v>

2998
02:32:04.471 --> 02:32:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I go up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rolled a joint,</v>

2999
02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:07.680
<v Speaker 2>I go downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoke on the way back.</v>

3000
02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I checked by the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I see Kettlebells,</v>

3001
02:32:09.511 --> 02:32:10.344
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I keep it to that read three and </v>

3002
02:32:13.021 --> 02:32:16.770
<v Speaker 2>three because over 50 it should just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>three days a week.</v>

3003
02:32:16.771 --> 02:32:18.510
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot for you to recuperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3004
02:32:18.511 --> 02:32:22.890
<v Speaker 2>it's also that you can get in more reps </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the week.</v>

3005
02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:25.470
<v Speaker 2>That's really what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do a lot of reps in one day,</v>

3006
02:32:25.471 --> 02:32:27.180
<v Speaker 2>the problem is you're destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards,</v>

3007
02:32:27.450 --> 02:32:30.510
<v Speaker 2>but if you do the same amount of reps </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the course of five days,</v>

3008
02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:33.090
<v Speaker 2>just do shorter workouts and do many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3009
02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:35.910
<v Speaker 2>You don't get ever get destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's fine.</v>

3010
02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:38.130
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do all the other things you do too,</v>

3011
02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:41.190
<v Speaker 2>and I think you become more consistent </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

3012
02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:45.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to do to kickboxing.</v>

3013
02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Conditionings to Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3014
02:32:48.251 --> 02:32:49.084
<v Speaker 2>my Jujitsu incorporates my Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporates the class during the </v>

3015
02:32:52.861 --> 02:32:54.810
<v Speaker 2>technique and three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five minute roles.</v>

3016
02:32:55.350 --> 02:32:56.183
<v Speaker 2>After that I get up and walk away </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then anything after that is </v>

3017
02:32:57.820 --> 02:32:59.490
<v Speaker 2>defeating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating the purpose.</v>

3018
02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I hit the bed twice a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially on Sunday.</v>

3019
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:05.590
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Nova.</v>

3020
02:33:05.591 --> 02:33:06.750
<v Speaker 2>So a bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>

3021
02:33:06.930 --> 02:33:09.330
<v Speaker 2>The a bed is the one I told you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time.</v>

3022
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I think they sent you some information </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we were discussing it last time.</v>

3023
02:33:12.631 --> 02:33:14.460
<v Speaker 2>It's The red light therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3024
02:33:14.461 --> 02:33:15.294
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the know Victoria bed twice a </v>

3025
02:33:16.441 --> 02:33:18.510
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nova?</v>

3026
02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nova.</v>

3027
02:33:19.801 --> 02:33:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Thor bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at up to Nova.</v>

3028
02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:26.390
<v Speaker 2>So a bed twice a week especially on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday to take all the oxidation.</v>

3029
02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:27.930
<v Speaker 2>That thing right there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3030
02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:28.741
<v Speaker 2>Thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fitter,</v>

3031
02:33:28.741 --> 02:33:29.580
<v Speaker 2>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happier.</v>

3032
02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:31.150
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3033
02:33:31.330 --> 02:33:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I go in the Cryo therapy two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>times a week.</v>

3034
02:33:34.981 --> 02:33:39.510
<v Speaker 2>So what I did was I shortened my workout</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I could do it more often.</v>

3035
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:40.503
<v Speaker 2>Me going to a Jujitsu class and fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie because that does nothing for </v>

3036
02:33:44.701 --> 02:33:45.430
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3037
02:33:45.430 --> 02:33:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3038
02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:49.440
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not going to do that because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to be able to row for three or</v>

3039
02:33:49.441 --> 02:33:50.970
<v Speaker 2>four more days now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3040
02:33:50.971 --> 02:33:51.804
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing is recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really went online and right after 50 </v>

3041
02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:58.370
<v Speaker 2>and I number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go,</v>

3042
02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:02.640
<v Speaker 2>you got over 50 strength strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh,</v>

3043
02:34:02.730 --> 02:34:05.210
<v Speaker 2>that's tough too because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sarcopenia.</v>

3044
02:34:05.211 --> 02:34:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when you start getting punchy</v>

3045
02:34:07.771 --> 02:34:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and we all become our grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you do stand up,</v>

3046
02:34:11.390 --> 02:34:12.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

3047
02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:15.960
<v Speaker 2>You just got to be stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went back,</v>

3048
02:34:15.961 --> 02:34:19.290
<v Speaker 2>I meet these guys a week and we pack it </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

3049
02:34:19.310 --> 02:34:20.143
<v Speaker 2>I'll even go on what you put on there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it gives me anxiety and we open </v>

3050
02:34:23.231 --> 02:34:26.710
<v Speaker 2>up with a squat to really get the system</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a fucking frenzy.</v>

3051
02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:29.200
<v Speaker 2>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no jumping jacks.</v>

3052
02:34:29.201 --> 02:34:32.110
<v Speaker 2>There's no bench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We opened up warm up first.</v>

3053
02:34:32.290 --> 02:34:33.580
<v Speaker 2>I will do a little warm up.</v>

3054
02:34:33.610 --> 02:34:36.370
<v Speaker 2>And the first two sets I see the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>devil.</v>

3055
02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:40.390
<v Speaker 2>It's on a stopwatch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sets.</v>

3056
02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:42.710
<v Speaker 2>It's on a stopwatch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

3057
02:34:43.210 --> 02:34:46.180
<v Speaker 2>So he'll go four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four minutes go.</v>

3058
02:34:46.570 --> 02:34:49.870
<v Speaker 2>So four minutes of squatting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squatting for three minutes,</v>

3059
02:34:49.871 --> 02:34:51.940
<v Speaker 2>three minutes or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times squatting,</v>

3060
02:34:51.970 --> 02:34:54.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's 10 seconds up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 seconds back.</v>

3061
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:56.680
<v Speaker 2>The last two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking.</v>

3062
02:34:56.840 --> 02:34:57.673
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about getting a heart </v>

3063
02:34:59.321 --> 02:35:00.370
<v Speaker 2>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole thing.</v>

3064
02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.940
<v Speaker 2>And then right from there I go to a pull</v>

02:40:15.810 --> 02:40:16.643
<v Speaker 6>It's the most I've ever worked out is I </v>
<v Speaker 6>did six and a half hours and I got a </v>

3179
02:40:22.590 --> 02:40:24.240
<v Speaker 6>thousand points.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did five and a half hours.</v>

3180
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:25.463
<v Speaker 6>I got 900 points and then I did another </v>
<v Speaker 6>hour just to sort of like at the end of </v>

3181
02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:32.250
<v Speaker 6>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just to loosen everything up,</v>

3182
02:40:32.251 --> 02:40:34.890
<v Speaker 6>which just hit the bag for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just I just.</v>

3183
02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:38.510
<v Speaker 6>Because Bert was talking so much shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3184
02:40:39.410 --> 02:40:42.480
<v Speaker 10>where am I going to put the bill?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Who doesn't want to double</v>

3185
02:40:42.980 --> 02:40:44.380
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3186
02:40:44.690 --> 02:40:46.190
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll see.</v>

3187
02:40:46.850 --> 02:40:51.850
<v Speaker 6>We'll say he went hiking with Ari and </v>
<v Speaker 6>was quitting while he was hiking.</v>

3188
02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:56.040
<v Speaker 6>Hiking is walking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's walking.</v>

3189
02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:57.233
<v Speaker 6>These guys are walking and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting tired and he's talking about </v>

3190
02:40:59.251 --> 02:41:02.100
<v Speaker 6>beating me in a fitness contest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's outrageous.</v>

3191
02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:06.960
<v Speaker 6>Plus he's enormously overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The one who is the real issue is Ari.</v>

3192
02:41:07.050 --> 02:41:10.020
<v Speaker 6>Ari is a sneaky fuck are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might try to pull it out.</v>

3193
02:41:10.170 --> 02:41:11.003
<v Speaker 6>Even though it's 2000 points behind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he might try to murder himself over the </v>

3194
02:41:13.411 --> 02:41:14.244
<v Speaker 6>next two days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get to 2000 points and then put another </v>

3195
02:41:16.801 --> 02:41:19.020
<v Speaker 6>$1,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>to beat me on the third day.</v>

3196
02:41:19.021 --> 02:41:20.970
<v Speaker 6>He.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He literally might try to do that,</v>

3197
02:41:21.570 --> 02:41:26.280
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not going to let them know we're</v>
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

3198
02:41:26.281 --> 02:41:27.230
<v Speaker 6>We're queer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're there,</v>

3199
02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:30.180
<v Speaker 6>so they're fighting for second place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good luck boys.</v>

3200
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:34.140
<v Speaker 6>I let them get close up until a while </v>
<v Speaker 6>ago,</v>

3201
02:41:34.530 --> 02:41:38.130
<v Speaker 6>up until about a week and a half ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I just turned it on.</v>

<v Speaker 6>motherfucking miles for 600 points.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Doesn't want to lose and doesn't want to</v>

3239
02:43:22.691 --> 02:43:26.170
<v Speaker 4>lose the bird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you only comes in third place,</v>

3240
02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:30.000
<v Speaker 4>as long as he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as he beats Bert.</v>

3241
02:43:30.130 --> 02:43:32.860
<v Speaker 4>That's where everybody's at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because burt talked so much shit.</v>

3242
02:43:33.070 --> 02:43:34.820

<v Speaker 4>burt loses.</v>

3243
02:43:34.850 --> 02:43:35.683
<v Speaker 4>He's got the Dimaggio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thinks he can just half ass his way </v>

3244
02:43:40.901 --> 02:43:44.230
<v Speaker 4>through something that's an actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition because he's just,</v>

3245
02:43:44.530 --> 02:43:46.120
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can push himself,</v>

3246
02:43:46.121 --> 02:43:46.954
<v Speaker 4>but there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing yourself and pushing yourself </v>

3247
02:43:49.751 --> 02:43:53.500
<v Speaker 4>for a whole month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where he's falling apart and he's</v>

02:44:26.860 --> 02:44:30.460
<v Speaker 4>already held onto his stats and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to do that.</v>

3258
02:44:30.610 --> 02:44:32.050
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not supposed to do that.</v>

3259
02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:32.913
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to look.</v>

3261
02:44:38.530 --> 02:44:42.970

<v Speaker 4>already is obviously a sneaky fuck.</v>

3262
02:44:43.210 --> 02:44:44.043
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3263
02:44:45.551 --> 02:44:46.384
<v Speaker 4>worked out the least out of all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he at one point in time stored up a </v>

3264
02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:51.873
<v Speaker 4>thousand points and had them on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>device and then released him and Bert </v>

3296
02:46:07.870 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 4>it's a rigged game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>karate with mercy.</v>

3304
02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:35.890

<v Speaker 2>but look just like burt with a hat on.</v>

3308
02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I put my pizza down and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go a cock sucker.</v>

3309
02:46:49.310 --> 02:46:50.143

<v Speaker 2>like he got a six pack or whatever </v>

3310
02:46:52.350 --> 02:46:53.183
<v Speaker 2>holding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He turned around and waved at me and </v>

3311
02:46:55.971 --> 02:46:58.490
<v Speaker 2>kept walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Bert Kreischer,</v>

3312
02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:00.910
<v Speaker 2>right Christ.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3314
02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I figured he'd come back and talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the next day Lee tells me,</v>

3315
02:47:08.031 --> 02:47:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I tell Lee that like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he didn't come and talk to me.</v>

3318
02:47:12.380 --> 02:47:13.213
<v Speaker 2>Lee puts down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leads sells me that burt put down a </v>

3319
02:47:15.351 --> 02:47:18.200
<v Speaker 2>tweet that one of his fans yelled at </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3320
02:47:18.690 --> 02:47:21.680
<v Speaker 2>They saw someone he didn't know who it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was and he didn't know who it was.</v>

3321
02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:24.740
<v Speaker 2>And he kept walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew who the fuck it dog.</v>

3322
02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:27.230
<v Speaker 2>If I yell at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll know it's fucking me.</v>

3323
02:47:27.231 --> 02:47:29.390
<v Speaker 2>If I say cock suck at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

3324
02:47:29.391 --> 02:47:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3325
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:32.510
<v Speaker 6>let me look what else burt does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

3326
02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:35.630
<v Speaker 6>Burton knows he's behind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's staggering amount.</v>

3327
02:47:35.930 --> 02:47:38.390
<v Speaker 6>He put in the most bitch ass workout </v>
<v Speaker 6>today.</v>

3328
02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:40.940
<v Speaker 6>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is this?</v>

3329
02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:45.770
<v Speaker 6>A 149 points that is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is not enough.</v>

3330
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:48.260
<v Speaker 6>He worked out for an hour and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes.</v>

3331
02:47:48.261 --> 02:47:50.960
<v Speaker 6>You've got 149 points because look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the end,</v>

3332
02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:52.850
<v Speaker 6>see the end.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All those grades,</v>

3333
02:47:52.851 --> 02:47:55.300
<v Speaker 6>maybe it stayed on or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He kept his.</v>

3334
02:47:55.301 --> 02:47:57.590
<v Speaker 6>He kept a strap on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He worked out.</v>

3335
02:47:57.591 --> 02:47:58.424
<v Speaker 6>It says an hour for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He worked there for 40 minutes and he </v>

3336
02:48:00.351 --> 02:48:02.840
<v Speaker 6>kept a strap on for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Trying to get some extra.</v>

3337
02:48:02.841 --> 02:48:03.674
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he's dying so it was hard to </v>

3338
02:48:04.771 --> 02:48:05.604
<v Speaker 6>elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you get some points for having an </v>

3339
02:48:07.371 --> 02:48:09.080
<v Speaker 6>elevated heart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But look at this.</v>

3340
02:48:09.081 --> 02:48:11.630
<v Speaker 6>All this gray shit at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See folks,</v>

3341
02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:14.480
<v Speaker 6>see all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can barely see it.</v>

3342
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:17.750
<v Speaker 6>You can't sit here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me do something here.</v>

3343
02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll show people here all this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3344
02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:25.213
<v Speaker 2>To work</v>

3345
02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:29.820
<v Speaker 6>you get for 80 percent of your heart </v>
<v Speaker 6>rate.</v>

3346
02:48:30.090 --> 02:48:34.860
<v Speaker 6>You get yellow for 90 percent of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>Max heart rate.</v>

3347
02:48:34.861 --> 02:48:38.070
<v Speaker 6>You get read.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried to go all read the first day.</v>

3348
02:48:38.071 --> 02:48:39.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to kill them.</v>

3349
02:48:39.121 --> 02:48:44.121
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to sprint for half an </v>
<v Speaker 6>hour and just make these guys catch up.</v>

3350
02:48:44.191 --> 02:48:45.024
<v Speaker 6>There's no way to catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then Ari and his fucking ingenious and </v>

3351
02:48:48.091 --> 02:48:48.924
<v Speaker 6>devious ways found out that you get just</v>
<v Speaker 6>as many points for 80 percent is good </v>

3352
02:48:52.311 --> 02:48:55.650
<v Speaker 6>for 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We figured so that they avoid lawsuits.</v>

3353
02:48:56.520 --> 02:48:57.353
<v Speaker 6>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3354
02:48:57.570 --> 02:48:59.790
<v Speaker 6>so it seems like the sweet spot is an 80</v>
<v Speaker 6>percent,</v>

3355
02:48:59.910 --> 02:49:03.420
<v Speaker 6>so just stick to 80 percent so you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>do that.</v>

3356
02:49:03.421 --> 02:49:08.220
<v Speaker 6>Or You could be like Bert and burt </v>
<v Speaker 6>barely gets to 70 percent,</v>

3357
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:12.510
<v Speaker 6>mostly stays in the 60 percent range,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is gray.</v>

3358
02:49:12.690 --> 02:49:14.280
<v Speaker 6>And then 80 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is.</v>

3359
02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:18.720
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>60 percent is like there's 50,</v>

3360
02:49:18.721 --> 02:49:21.870
<v Speaker 6>60 and 70 and seventies green.</v>

3361
02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:23.520
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3362
02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:24.780
<v Speaker 6>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>green.</v>

3363
02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:29.010
<v Speaker 6>And then blue is 60.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So He's mostly blue.</v>

3364
02:49:29.340 --> 02:49:32.970
<v Speaker 6>Sixty percent of his mass heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which by the way I might be at right now</v>

3365
02:49:33.630 --> 02:49:36.300
<v Speaker 6>because I'm getting angry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you've got mad,</v>

3366
02:49:36.450 --> 02:49:39.990
<v Speaker 6>you'd be in the blue and you get two </v>
<v Speaker 6>points in a minute for the blue,</v>

3367
02:49:40.170 --> 02:49:41.880
<v Speaker 6>you get four points a minute for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>yellow,</v>

3368
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:45.660
<v Speaker 6>what do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sixty percent to 70 percent you get?</v>

3369
02:49:45.661 --> 02:49:50.661
<v Speaker 6>Blue Bird is almost all gray and blue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you look at this fucking slobbery</v>

3370
02:49:51.541 --> 02:49:52.350
<v Speaker 6>workout,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got,</v>

3371
02:49:52.350 --> 02:49:53.183
<v Speaker 6>look at all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's 60 percent and lower most of his </v>

3372
02:49:57.871 --> 02:49:58.704
<v Speaker 6>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that means most of the workout that </v>

3373
02:50:00.991 --> 02:50:01.824
<v Speaker 6>he did for an hour and 49 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's him with a fucking thing on just </v>

3374
02:50:05.581 --> 02:50:07.560
<v Speaker 6>sitting around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's an hour and 30 minutes.</v>

3375
02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:10.380
<v Speaker 6>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of it is him with the thing on just</v>

3376
02:50:10.381 --> 02:50:12.330
<v Speaker 6>sitting there being fat.</v>

3377
02:50:12.750 --> 02:50:14.310
<v Speaker 6>It's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So let me ask you this.</v>

3378
02:50:14.311 --> 02:50:15.780
<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is this called?</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's a.</v>

3383
02:50:23.070 --> 02:50:23.903
<v Speaker 6>Once I snap this in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll start measuring my heart rate and </v>

3384
02:50:26.131 --> 02:50:27.570
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to put it on when I get out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

3385
02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:31.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to start working out and today</v>
<v Speaker 6>these are the three days of death.</v>

3386
02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:37.080

<v Speaker 6>Tuesday and Wednesday we'd go crazy.</v>

3388
02:50:38.731 --> 02:50:39.564
<v Speaker 6>I work out to 1159 and then at 1159 I </v>
<v Speaker 6>pop that off and walk away at 1159 and </v>

3389
02:50:49.050 --> 02:50:51.510
<v Speaker 6>then I go have a glass of wine because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it hits midnight.</v>

3390
02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:53.790
<v Speaker 6>No wait.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Qualifications on this?</v>

3392
02:50:54.610 --> 02:50:55.390
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3393
02:50:55.390 --> 02:50:57.690
<v Speaker 6>There's no losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I probably fucking gained weight.</v>

3394
02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:02.130
<v Speaker 6>I haven't lost any weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've eaten everything that moves.</v>

3395
02:51:02.430 --> 02:51:03.263
<v Speaker 6>I've put in zero dietary restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I ate a whole carrot cake the other day </v>

3396
02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:09.900
<v Speaker 6>because the amount of calories that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>burning is fucking insane.</v>

3397
02:51:10.110 --> 02:51:10.940
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3402
02:51:20.850 --> 02:51:22.950
<v Speaker 6>14 calories,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one workout,</v>

3403
02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:24.570
<v Speaker 6>three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 6>25 minutes.</v>

3404
02:51:25.290 --> 02:51:29.310
<v Speaker 6>And then the day before that 1,930</v>
<v Speaker 6>calories.</v>

3405
02:51:30.210 --> 02:51:32.670
<v Speaker 6>The day before that there was two </v>
<v Speaker 6>workouts.</v>

3406
02:51:32.910 --> 02:51:37.110
<v Speaker 6>One was 1,876</v>
<v Speaker 6>calories,</v>

3407
02:51:37.290 --> 02:51:39.720
<v Speaker 6>one was 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 6>210 calories.</v>

3408
02:51:39.970 --> 02:51:43.380
<v Speaker 6>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this insane amount of calories.</v>

3409
02:51:43.381 --> 02:51:44.214
<v Speaker 6>One workout I had was 4,900.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's that entail when you get your </v>

3410
02:51:48.290 --> 02:51:50.550
<v Speaker 6>heart up to add is at the running?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3411
02:51:50.580 --> 02:51:51.180
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the lifting.</v>

3412
02:51:51.180 --> 02:51:52.920
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't just do one thing.</v>

3413
02:51:52.921 --> 02:51:56.580
<v Speaker 6>I go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll get bored so I lift,</v>

3414
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:59.790
<v Speaker 6>but the lift doesn't give me much lift </v>
<v Speaker 6>is like blue and green.</v>

3415
02:51:59.910 --> 02:52:04.590
<v Speaker 6>That's all you ever get from lifting his</v>
<v Speaker 6>wings or chin ups.</v>

3416
02:52:04.690 --> 02:52:08.530
<v Speaker 6>Presses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cleans and presses windmills.</v>

3417
02:52:08.740 --> 02:52:09.573
<v Speaker 6>A clean press squats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a renegade rows or Kettle Bell Hell </v>

3418
02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:17.560
<v Speaker 6>kettlebells and obviously doesn't give </v>
<v Speaker 6>you much.</v>

3419
02:52:17.561 --> 02:52:22.090
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't give me my Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu would probably be pretty good,</v>

3420
02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:25.570
<v Speaker 6>but this thing we get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If anybody mounted you at crack,</v>

3421
02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:27.130
<v Speaker 6>this thing would crack.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't.</v>

3422
02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:29.320
<v Speaker 6>If you lost this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

3423
02:52:29.321 --> 02:52:31.870
<v Speaker 6>it'd be death.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I could break this with my finger.</v>

3424
02:52:32.350 --> 02:52:35.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure I could break this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feels like time a lot.</v>

3425
02:52:35.410 --> 02:52:36.940
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the number one.</v>

3426
02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:39.680
<v Speaker 6>Did an hour and a half bag yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3427
02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:43.420
<v Speaker 6>because I have the gym at home so I went</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking hog on the.</v>

3428
02:52:43.421 --> 02:52:45.880
<v Speaker 6>On the pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I put fights on once I put fights on and</v>

3429
02:52:45.881 --> 02:52:46.714
<v Speaker 6>get fired up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3430
02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:50.410
<v Speaker 6>just start fucking wailing on that bag </v>
<v Speaker 6>and keeping the party going.</v>

3431
02:52:50.770 --> 02:52:53.800
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but see if I,</v>

3432
02:52:53.890 --> 02:52:56.860
<v Speaker 6>if I got cocky right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these fucks could catch me,</v>

3433
02:52:56.980 --> 02:53:00.210
<v Speaker 6>especially Ari because he's probably </v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna sand back some more and,</v>

3434
02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:01.113
<v Speaker 6>and hide his numbers because he just </v>
<v Speaker 6>wants to beat Bert because he got super </v>

3435
02:53:04.661 --> 02:53:05.620
<v Speaker 6>pissed at Tom.</v>

3436
02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:06.613
<v Speaker 6>Like the fuck Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because tom put up all those points </v>

3437
02:53:08.621 --> 02:53:09.454
<v Speaker 6>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Six hundred points in a day is a lot of </v>

3438
02:53:10.901 --> 02:53:12.430
<v Speaker 6>points.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But like I said,</v>

3439
02:53:12.490 --> 02:53:13.870
<v Speaker 6>dude ran,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3440
02:53:13.871 --> 02:53:14.704
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He ran 13 fucking miles in his </v>

3441
02:53:18.131 --> 02:53:20.260
<v Speaker 6>neighborhood and this is after being </v>
<v Speaker 6>sick.</v>

3442
02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:22.680
<v Speaker 6>But he's feeling it today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3443
02:53:23.130 --> 02:53:25.870
<v Speaker 6>Today it gets 145 points.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not good.</v>

3444
02:53:26.660 --> 02:53:29.310
<v Speaker 6>You're not going to win with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

3445
02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:32.850
<v Speaker 6>they're not trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to beat people.</v>

3446
02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:34.773
<v Speaker 6>I know that one day he was a US crowd </v>
<v Speaker 6>therapy because I want to purchase left </v>

3447
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:41.080
<v Speaker 6>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I knew he was doing something,</v>

3448
02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:43.300
<v Speaker 6>but I know he hasn't been going </v>
<v Speaker 6>consistently.</v>

3449
02:53:43.450 --> 02:53:45.820
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't do anything consistently,</v>

3450
02:53:46.030 --> 02:53:48.640
<v Speaker 6>but he doesn't watch his diet either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem with burke.</v>

3451
02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:50.830
<v Speaker 6>He's not watching his diet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not eating,</v>

3452
02:53:51.090 --> 02:53:52.850
<v Speaker 6>not an eater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the boos.</v>

3453
02:53:53.390 --> 02:53:55.330
<v Speaker 6>That is a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

3454
02:53:55.540 --> 02:53:59.020
<v Speaker 6>That shit turns into sugar at night </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'll kill you.</v>

3455
02:53:59.350 --> 02:54:00.560
<v Speaker 6>You know what else kills you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

3456
02:54:00.561 --> 02:54:03.040
<v Speaker 6>how you both people think that that </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking hell.</v>

3457
02:54:03.220 --> 02:54:05.370
<v Speaker 6>There's a ton of shit that fucking kills</v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

3458
02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:09.020
<v Speaker 6>Just stick to what happened on a banana.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I try,</v>

3459
02:54:09.070 --> 02:54:09.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love us.</v>

3460
02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:10.833
<v Speaker 6>I eat bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dog.</v>

3461
02:54:11.170 --> 02:54:13.710
<v Speaker 6>They make them my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my house or Chia seeds and Juju.</v>

3462
02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:17.200
<v Speaker 6>But I'll tell you what I read when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the middle of these brutal workouts.</v>

3463
02:54:17.201 --> 02:54:18.034
<v Speaker 6>I'll drink the whole soda and the work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I drank a cream soda yesterday in the </v>

3464
02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:23.440
<v Speaker 6>middle of a workout.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I needed sugar.</v>

3465
02:54:23.470 --> 02:54:25.750
<v Speaker 6>I needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know you need it because I felt</v>

3466
02:54:25.751 --> 02:54:28.030
<v Speaker 6>like I needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was fucking.</v>

3467
02:54:28.450 --> 02:54:31.780
<v Speaker 6>I'm burning so many calories and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3468
02:54:31.781 --> 02:54:34.600
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my blood sugar is crashing so hard.</v>

3469
02:54:34.601 --> 02:54:36.160
<v Speaker 6>I mean fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3470
02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:37.253
<v Speaker 6>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the one day that I worked out where I </v>

3471
02:54:38.921 --> 02:54:41.740
<v Speaker 6>did five and a half hours,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was eating boxes,</v>

3472
02:54:41.741 --> 02:54:42.970
<v Speaker 6>animal crackers.</v>

3473
02:54:43.270 --> 02:54:47.230
<v Speaker 6>I was eating everything I could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I do is what you told me to do when</v>

3474
02:54:47.231 --> 02:54:51.220
<v Speaker 6>I get home from Thai or lifting and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>make a protein shake,</v>

3475
02:54:51.790 --> 02:54:53.380
<v Speaker 6>I put,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I swear to God,</v>

3476
02:54:53.381 --> 02:54:54.214
<v Speaker 6>I take a Hershey's syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He told me just a little bit and I just </v>

3477
02:54:58.661 --> 02:55:03.500
<v Speaker 6>go tick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not even a second of it.</v>

3478
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:05.970
<v Speaker 6>And with the Mexican chocolate works </v>
<v Speaker 6>perfect.</v>

3479
02:55:05.971 --> 02:55:07.430
<v Speaker 6>That tastes like fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3480
02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:11.240
<v Speaker 6>So I do that with the protein drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I try to avoid sugar.</v>

3481
02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:14.720
<v Speaker 6>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no more sugar,</v>

3482
02:55:14.721 --> 02:55:16.760
<v Speaker 6>but see what's happening with these </v>
<v Speaker 6>workouts.</v>

3483
02:55:17.450 --> 02:55:18.283
<v Speaker 6>You're dealing with an extreme loss of </v>
<v Speaker 6>electrolytes and extreme loss of </v>

3484
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:24.200
<v Speaker 6>glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3485
02:55:24.201 --> 02:55:27.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm putting salt in all my water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm drinking.</v>

3486
02:55:28.350 --> 02:55:29.183
<v Speaker 6>Bought a bunch of these nalgene.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what a nalgene bottle is like </v>

3487
02:55:31.761 --> 02:55:33.830
<v Speaker 6>with a twist top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a thick,</v>

3488
02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:34.970
<v Speaker 6>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>plastic,</v>

3489
02:55:34.971 --> 02:55:35.804
<v Speaker 6>32 ounce bottle of water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm drinking three and four of those in </v>

3490
02:55:39.141 --> 02:55:39.974
<v Speaker 6>a workout in those I'm putting the </v>
<v Speaker 6>electrolytes and then I'm putting </v>

3491
02:55:43.250 --> 02:55:46.700
<v Speaker 6>sprinkles of Himalayan salt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm putting like a little,</v>

3492
02:55:46.730 --> 02:55:47.563
<v Speaker 6>like a half a teaspoon of Himalayan salt</v>
<v Speaker 6>in each one of them shaking it up </v>

3493
02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:53.660
<v Speaker 6>because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am losing insane amounts of water.</v>

3494
02:55:53.810 --> 02:55:56.450
<v Speaker 6>I sweat so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I set off the fucking alarm.</v>

3495
02:55:56.750 --> 02:56:00.110
<v Speaker 6>I set off my fire alarm in my gym from </v>
<v Speaker 6>sweat,</v>

3496
02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:05.300
<v Speaker 6>from my steam room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The whole room was like a shower for me.</v>

3497
02:56:05.301 --> 02:56:10.020
<v Speaker 6>Steven and I put it up on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the kind of workout I'm doing.</v>

3498
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:14.840
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm pushing hard because they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not making it easy.</v>

3499
02:56:14.841 --> 02:56:16.160
<v Speaker 6>These guys are actually doing it.</v>

3500
02:56:25.790 --> 02:56:26.720
<v Speaker 11>Fire alarm,</v>

3501
02:56:28.590 --> 02:56:30.690
<v Speaker 6>that's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those puddles on the ground.</v>

3502
02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:33.660
<v Speaker 6>That's not for me pissing my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all sweat.</v>

3503
02:56:34.500 --> 02:56:35.400
<v Speaker 6>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

3504
02:56:35.450 --> 02:56:40.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm sweating so much because I'm staying</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the 80,</v>

3505
02:56:40.990 --> 02:56:44.850
<v Speaker 6>80 percent of your Max heart rate range </v>
<v Speaker 6>for hours.</v>

3506
02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:46.253
<v Speaker 6>I'm staying there for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So my thought was there's no way they </v>

3507
02:56:50.281 --> 02:56:52.200
<v Speaker 6>can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to do that.</v>

3508
02:56:53.070 --> 02:56:56.220
<v Speaker 6>There's no way they're not going to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>that for five hours.</v>

3509
02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:00.090
<v Speaker 6>That's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like if I did one day like that,</v>

3510
02:57:00.091 --> 02:57:05.091
<v Speaker 6>I felt like one day where I did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got 935 points in one workout and then</v>

3511
02:57:05.731 --> 02:57:07.740
<v Speaker 6>another 100 points afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3512
02:57:07.741 --> 02:57:11.040
<v Speaker 6>one day like that will separate me from </v>
<v Speaker 6>the pack.</v>

3513
02:57:11.100 --> 02:57:14.280
<v Speaker 6>Just one day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just put feed fear in there.</v>

3514
02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:17.400
<v Speaker 6>Let me just ask you something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just to be fair with everybody here.</v>

3515

<v Speaker 6>One hundred percent helps.</v>

3517
02:57:25.410 --> 02:57:27.260

<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>All those.</v>

3519
02:57:31.550 --> 02:57:35.160
<v Speaker 6>I gave them my doctor's information.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I told them what they should do,</v>

3520
02:57:35.540 --> 02:57:39.180
<v Speaker 6>but I'm also at least eight years older </v>
<v Speaker 6>than all of them.</v>

<v Speaker 6>your system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you don't have it in your system,</v>

<v Speaker 6>This is 2018.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Hormone replacement therapy exists for a</v>
<v Speaker 6>reason,</v>

<v Speaker 6>replacement therapy.</v>

3545
02:58:54.060 --> 02:58:55.980
<v Speaker 6>The key to doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those that do it correctly,</v>

3546
02:58:56.310 --> 02:58:59.100
<v Speaker 6>he's supposed to go to a doctor that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to test your blood levels,</v>

<v Speaker 6>and adjust your diet first.</v>

3548
02:59:02.520 --> 02:59:03.353
<v Speaker 6>The first thing that happens is they </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to find out how much you're </v>

3549
02:59:04.981 --> 02:59:06.670
<v Speaker 6>sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 6>house to house,</v>

3550

02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:10.013
<v Speaker 6>how much water you're drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you getting the proper amount of </v>

3552
02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:15.240
<v Speaker 6>protein and vegetables you eating </v>

<v Speaker 6>the else is before they do anything,</v>

3555
02:59:22.110 --> 02:59:22.943
<v Speaker 6>so they put you that this is a many,</v>
<v Speaker 6>many months process that I went through </v>

<v Speaker 6>with a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get you off all these different </v>

3557
02:59:28.801 --> 02:59:29.634
<v Speaker 6>things and you make these adjustments </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they start adding a little </v>

3558
02:59:31.681 --> 02:59:32.514
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>add a little bit of growth hormone at a </v>

3559
02:59:33.811 --> 02:59:34.890
<v Speaker 6>little bit of testosterone.</v>

3560
02:59:35.100 --> 02:59:37.740
<v Speaker 6>First it was cream and then it became </v>
<v Speaker 6>injections.</v>

3561
02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:38.633
<v Speaker 6>Takes a little bit of time to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 6>what works best and then you get to a </v>

3562
02:59:41.851 --> 02:59:45.060
<v Speaker 6>point where you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have the hormone levels of a healthy</v>

<v Speaker 6>young man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He don't want to elevate.</v>

3564
02:59:46.980 --> 02:59:49.650
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to be higher than that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when you run into problems.</v>

3565
02:59:49.920 --> 02:59:54.090
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to be in like some crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Vito Belfort,</v>

3566

<v Speaker 6>when he got popped from Nevada and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>was like super human levels.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Nate Marquardt levels are really high in</v>

3571
03:00:10.201 --> 03:00:12.080
<v Speaker 6>Pittsburgh that night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

3572
03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:15.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was in danger.</v>

3573
03:00:15.810 --> 03:00:16.730
<v Speaker 6>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

3574
03:00:16.840 --> 03:00:19.560
<v Speaker 6>There is dangerous to his health,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the levels,</v>

3575
03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:21.480
<v Speaker 6>but he says that was his doctor.</v>

3577
03:00:22.770 --> 03:00:24.780
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the whole idea.</v>

3578
03:00:24.900 --> 03:00:25.950
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a difference between.</v>

3579
03:00:25.951 --> 03:00:26.784
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a big difference in someone </v>

3580
03:00:27.320 --> 03:00:28.153
<v Speaker 6>who's competing in mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Obviously you have to worry about your </v>

3581
03:00:31.441 --> 03:00:35.310
<v Speaker 6>opponent getting hurt because of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that your enhanced,</v>

3582
03:00:35.370 --> 03:00:37.110
<v Speaker 6>and these are young guys that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

3583
03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:39.540
<v Speaker 6>When nate was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was like 30 years old,</v>

3584
03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:40.433
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you are talking about just general </v>

3585
03:00:42.901 --> 03:00:46.680
<v Speaker 6>health and wellness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>testosterone replacement therapy,</v>

3586
03:00:46.681 --> 03:00:47.514
<v Speaker 6>hormone replacement therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a reason why a lot of older </v>

3587
03:00:49.531 --> 03:00:51.480
<v Speaker 6>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially guys who can afford it,</v>

3588
03:00:51.481 --> 03:00:52.740
<v Speaker 6>they have money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're doing it.</v>

3589
03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:54.900
<v Speaker 6>It makes you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just does,</v>

3590
03:00:55.170 --> 03:00:56.610
<v Speaker 6>and if you don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's fine.</v>

3591
03:00:56.850 --> 03:00:59.320
<v Speaker 6>There's ways of elevating your </v>
<v Speaker 6>testosterone natural.</v>

3592
03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:00.633
<v Speaker 6>They just don't work as well with </v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's dead lifts are running </v>

3593
03:01:03.131 --> 03:01:04.240
<v Speaker 6>hills,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing sprints.</v>

3594
03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:05.253
<v Speaker 6>They work a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It works a little bit better than </v>

3595
03:01:07.241 --> 03:01:09.640
<v Speaker 6>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if there's lots of very good.</v>

3596
03:01:09.690 --> 03:01:11.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they released it but not enough for what</v>

3597
03:01:11.861 --> 03:01:12.790
<v Speaker 6>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3598
03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:17.050
<v Speaker 6>there's gonna be a difference as they </v>
<v Speaker 6>could raise them through acupuncture.</v>

3599
03:01:17.170 --> 03:01:21.100
<v Speaker 6>I know that she's discussed raising </v>
<v Speaker 6>Melissa Testosterone.</v>

3600
03:01:21.250 --> 03:01:23.470
<v Speaker 6>Acupuncture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would like to see studies on that.</v>

3601
03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:26.000
<v Speaker 6>The problem is it's really painful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Axondria,</v>

3602
03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:28.930
<v Speaker 6>same phone for that real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That sits in your feet.</v>

3603
03:01:29.350 --> 03:01:31.360
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like to see studies on that.</v>

3604
03:01:31.361 --> 03:01:32.680
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if that's really been </v>
<v Speaker 6>proven.</v>

3605
03:01:32.681 --> 03:01:34.290
<v Speaker 6>If that was really proven.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

3606
03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:36.580
<v Speaker 6>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's ways to raise it.</v>

3607
03:01:36.900 --> 03:01:37.733
<v Speaker 6>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The chick I was with for years told me </v>

3608
03:01:40.270 --> 03:01:42.760
<v Speaker 6>different case studies that she had been</v>
<v Speaker 6>involved in.</v>

3609
03:01:43.390 --> 03:01:44.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She called me.</v>

3610
03:01:44.471 --> 03:01:47.500
<v Speaker 6>A guy came in once that found the </v>
<v Speaker 6>younger girlfriend.</v>

3611
03:01:47.560 --> 03:01:48.393
<v Speaker 6>His wife passed and they found the </v>
<v Speaker 6>younger girlfriend and he couldn't keep </v>

3612
03:01:50.531 --> 03:01:51.364
<v Speaker 6>up and he couldn't keep up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so he came into the car and she did a </v>

3613
03:01:54.251 --> 03:01:55.930
<v Speaker 6>bunch of stuff and put them on a t.</v>

3614
03:01:56.690 --> 03:01:59.290
<v Speaker 6>He came back a week later and said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>turn that shit off.</v>

3615
03:02:00.260 --> 03:02:04.060
<v Speaker 6>Dick will not shut down like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But she told me,</v>

3616
03:02:04.061 --> 03:02:06.400
<v Speaker 6>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could raise your testosterone levels,</v>

3617
03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:09.430
<v Speaker 6>but it has to be needling for your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3618
03:02:09.450 --> 03:02:11.380
<v Speaker 6>you're going to find that a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 6>uncomfortable.</v>

3619
03:02:11.410 --> 03:02:12.243
<v Speaker 6>And I was like leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to fucking walk around all </v>

3620
03:02:15.611 --> 03:02:19.330
<v Speaker 6>this stuff that we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's hormone replacement therapy</v>

3621
03:02:19.331 --> 03:02:21.080
<v Speaker 6>or squats or deadlifts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are all these.</v>

3622
03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:24.730
<v Speaker 6>All these things will help hormone </v>
<v Speaker 6>replacement therapy helps them.</v>

3623
03:02:25.850 --> 03:02:28.330
<v Speaker 6>The thing about this kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>competition that we're doing now,</v>

3624
03:02:28.510 --> 03:02:32.740
<v Speaker 6>we're not doing anything that you need </v>
<v Speaker 6>massive amounts of testosterone.</v>

3625
03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:36.180
<v Speaker 6>What this is about is willpower </v>
<v Speaker 6>willpower for a month,</v>

3626
03:02:36.220 --> 03:02:37.320
<v Speaker 6>30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So totally.</v>

3627
03:02:37.350 --> 03:02:42.130
<v Speaker 6>But a lot of it is discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 6>willpower and if that has any advantage,</v>

3628
03:02:42.260 --> 03:02:43.093
<v Speaker 6>it's that I have a gym in my house and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>have a gym in my studio and I run with </v>

3629
03:02:47.531 --> 03:02:51.250
<v Speaker 6>my dog almost everyday in the hills and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been doing that for years.</v>

3630
03:02:51.610 --> 03:02:53.860
<v Speaker 6>I've been taking that dog running since </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was six months old.</v>

3631
03:02:54.430 --> 03:02:56.140
<v Speaker 6>He runs in the hills with me all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

3632
03:02:56.141 --> 03:02:58.240
<v Speaker 6>You Fall in love with running.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love it.</v>

3633
03:02:58.720 --> 03:02:59.860
<v Speaker 6>You know why I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joey,</v>

3634
03:02:59.890 --> 03:03:04.890
<v Speaker 6>here's a big thing because it makes me </v>
<v Speaker 6>feel better in terms of my mental state.</v>

3635
03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:09.280
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm happier when I run all the time</v>
<v Speaker 6>this whole month.</v>

3636
03:03:10.180 --> 03:03:13.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel great and I don't just feel great</v>

3637
03:03:13.481 --> 03:03:18.150
<v Speaker 6>because I'm not smoking pot like I made.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's helped.</v>

3638
03:03:18.220 --> 03:03:19.053
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's good in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's good to not smoke pot even </v>

3639
03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:23.153
<v Speaker 6>though I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's not good to smoke as much as </v>

3640
03:03:24.431 --> 03:03:25.430
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to smoke now?</v>

<v Speaker 6>I probably won't smoke.</v>

3644
03:03:31.660 --> 03:03:33.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean I might smoke a little over the </v>
<v Speaker 6>weekend.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

3647
03:03:39.911 --> 03:03:42.140
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the thing that really helps because</v>

3648
03:03:42.150 --> 03:03:42.983
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing insane amounts of exercise </v>

3649
03:03:45.070 --> 03:03:45.903
<v Speaker 6>hours and hours of exercise a day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't give a fuck about normal </v>

3650

<v Speaker 6>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like all the chatter,</v>

3651
03:03:52.810 --> 03:03:55.630
<v Speaker 6>all the negative chatter in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That shit goes away.</v>

3652
03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:57.890
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't care.</v>

3653
03:03:58.250 --> 03:04:00.920
<v Speaker 6>I'm super calm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No anxiety.</v>

3654
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:05.300
<v Speaker 6>Anxiety goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm not a depressed person.</v>

3655
03:04:05.330 --> 03:04:06.163
<v Speaker 6>I don't suffer from depression,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we had Tyson fury on the podcast </v>

<v Speaker 6>He's a brave man.</v>

3659
03:04:16.071 --> 03:04:20.640
<v Speaker 6>The way he opened up about her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read the comments and what not held up</v>

3660
03:04:20.660 --> 03:04:22.870
<v Speaker 6>about his suicidal thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 6>depression.</v>

3661
03:04:22.990 --> 03:04:24.030
<v Speaker 6>That goal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that helps.</v>

3662
03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:26.840
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't just help.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It helps fucking tremendous.</v>

3663
03:04:26.841 --> 03:04:28.700
<v Speaker 6>If I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I found a drug,</v>

3664
03:04:28.701 --> 03:04:30.950
<v Speaker 6>if a doctor put me on medication,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3665
03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:32.150
<v Speaker 6>doc,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm fine.</v>

3666
03:04:32.151 --> 03:04:33.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything's good.</v>

3667
03:04:33.411 --> 03:04:34.244
<v Speaker 6>The doctors like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would just like you to just try this </v>

3668
03:04:35.661 --> 03:04:37.880
<v Speaker 6>for a while and tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tell me how it makes you feel.</v>

3669
03:04:38.180 --> 03:04:39.013
<v Speaker 6>Just put me on something and I had to </v>
<v Speaker 6>take a pill a day and I felt as good as </v>

3670
03:04:42.021 --> 03:04:43.670
<v Speaker 6>I feel right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting in front of you.</v>

3671
03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:44.960
<v Speaker 6>I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

3672
03:04:44.961 --> 03:04:48.860
<v Speaker 6>you were right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel better with this exists,</v>

3673
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:51.980
<v Speaker 6>but it only gets you through discipline </v>
<v Speaker 6>and nobody.</v>

3674
03:04:51.981 --> 03:04:52.814
<v Speaker 6>You can't give someone something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>forces them to work out almost every </v>

3675
03:04:57.351 --> 03:04:59.510
<v Speaker 6>fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I worked out this month.</v>

3676
03:04:59.511 --> 03:05:03.920
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want to do it almost every day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only thing that kept me doing it is</v>

3677
03:05:04.350 --> 03:05:06.490
<v Speaker 3>going a double with Joel does</v>

3678
03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:09.850
<v Speaker 6>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That got me angry,</v>

3679
03:05:09.940 --> 03:05:12.450
<v Speaker 6>that got my competitive juices stirred </v>
<v Speaker 6>and just the.</v>

3680
03:05:12.520 --> 03:05:16.780
<v Speaker 6>The idea that these guys I've been </v>
<v Speaker 6>working out my whole life,</v>

3681
03:05:17.230 --> 03:05:18.063
<v Speaker 6>these guys barely work out like they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to beat me in some sort of a </v>

3682
03:05:19.820 --> 03:05:21.580
<v Speaker 6>fitness competition that involves </v>
<v Speaker 6>willpower.</v>

3683
03:05:21.581 --> 03:05:23.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not going to happen.</v>

3684
03:05:23.710 --> 03:05:26.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to put in more time than you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to.</v>

3685
03:05:27.430 --> 03:05:31.000
<v Speaker 6>But all that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I did do it,</v>

3686
03:05:31.150 --> 03:05:34.390
<v Speaker 6>just doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel fucking fantastic.</v>

3687
03:05:34.460 --> 03:05:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>member of the tapes,</v>

3688
03:05:35.391 --> 03:05:38.730
<v Speaker 3>you made a man in the house of Blues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were concerned.</v>

3689
03:05:38.870 --> 03:05:40.360
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to live no more.</v>

3690
03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't working out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3691
03:05:43.880 --> 03:05:44.713
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do something four days a week minimum </v>

3692
03:05:46.971 --> 03:05:47.804
<v Speaker 3>since I've been on weight watchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hit the plateau one week </v>

3693
03:05:50.330 --> 03:05:51.163
<v Speaker 3>because I was on antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a rash on my leg and so when I </v>

3694
03:05:54.021 --> 03:05:56.630
<v Speaker 3>left there I felt a little weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still did everything else.</v>

3695
03:05:56.690 --> 03:06:00.930
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to exercise on antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt that lifting squats,</v>

3696
03:06:01.130 --> 03:06:02.730
<v Speaker 3>I had to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We stopped,</v>

3697
03:06:03.380 --> 03:06:04.570
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I in fact,</v>

3698
03:06:04.580 --> 03:06:05.840
<v Speaker 3>that went off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3699
03:06:05.841 --> 03:06:06.674
<v Speaker 3>I can't live this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very few things that will kill your </v>

3700
03:06:08.121 --> 03:06:08.954
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

3701
03:06:09.450 --> 03:06:10.283
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that's a real wake up call for </v>

3702
03:06:12.711 --> 03:06:15.080
<v Speaker 3>people that don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits of probiotics</v>

3703
03:06:15.750 --> 03:06:19.930
<v Speaker 6>was probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like taking acidophilus or eating Kimchi</v>

3704
03:06:19.940 --> 03:06:21.670
<v Speaker 6>or in eating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything that's going to help your,</v>

3705
03:06:21.680 --> 03:06:25.190
<v Speaker 6>your microbiome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so beneficial to your,</v>

3706

<v Speaker 6>your wellbeing,</v>

<v Speaker 6>your vitality and all that stuff is </v>

3708
03:06:31.041 --> 03:06:31.874
<v Speaker 6>connected.</v>

3709
03:06:32.290 --> 03:06:34.450
<v Speaker 3>I like yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yogurt's fucking grateful.</v>

3710
03:06:34.451 --> 03:06:36.550
<v Speaker 3>I Love Yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yogurt a lot.</v>

3711
03:06:36.640 --> 03:06:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the Greek as much as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other one.</v>

3712
03:06:38.441 --> 03:06:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I get the low point one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a cheap guy.</v>

3713
03:06:41.500 --> 03:06:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I eat that shit every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that shit juice,</v>

3714
03:06:45.580 --> 03:06:47.860

<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

3715
03:06:48.580 --> 03:06:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I guess I got a two point can put you </v>

3717
03:06:53.470 --> 03:06:55.210

<v Speaker 3>That's not bad.</v>

3718
03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:56.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad.</v>

3719
03:06:56.230 --> 03:06:58.740
<v Speaker 6>It's not bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beneficial though.</v>

3720
03:06:58.800 --> 03:07:01.410
<v Speaker 6>Very beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can Be [inaudible] fucking amazing.</v>

3721
03:07:01.411 --> 03:07:05.460
<v Speaker 6>It's really good at avoiding sicknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but with this exercise,</v>

3722
03:07:05.461 --> 03:07:08.220
<v Speaker 6>the amount of exercise that I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll drink bottles of that shit.</v>

3723
03:07:08.221 --> 03:07:09.054
<v Speaker 6>I don't worry about nothing that there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of benefit in that to me just to </v>

3724
03:07:12.061 --> 03:07:14.910
<v Speaker 6>be able to eat whatever the fuck I want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3725
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:17.700
<v Speaker 6>I had been eating everything in front of</v>
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>

03:07:17.701 --> 03:07:18.534
<v Speaker 6>man this whole month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I've doubled how much food I eat </v>

3727
03:07:22.470 --> 03:07:25.230
<v Speaker 6>because eating fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

3728
03:07:25.231 --> 03:07:27.270
<v Speaker 6>How much longer you got to watch </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

3729
03:07:27.900 --> 03:07:29.220
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get,</v>

3730
03:07:29.221 --> 03:07:30.054
<v Speaker 6>I don't touch me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I'm doing is not sustainable that </v>

3731
03:07:32.281 --> 03:07:33.750
<v Speaker 6>night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Salmon's good.</v>

3732
03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:38.840
<v Speaker 6>I do a lot of chicken breast and my meat</v>
<v Speaker 6>intake is cut just to a third.</v>

3733
03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:41.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't take any more,</v>

3734
03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:43.433
<v Speaker 6>especially at night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't fuck with that shit at night no </v>

3735
03:07:45.571 --> 03:07:45.900
<v Speaker 6>more.</v>

3736
03:07:45.900 --> 03:07:48.240
<v Speaker 6>If I eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's maybe three times a week.</v>

3737
03:07:48.600 --> 03:07:51.630
<v Speaker 6>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I still crave a fucking stake,</v>

3738
03:07:51.631 --> 03:07:54.000
<v Speaker 6>but if I take my wife out on the day </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the state,</v>

3739
03:07:54.001 --> 03:07:54.834
<v Speaker 6>the first thing I'd do with color and I </v>

<v Speaker 3>He's not thinking about the $30 million </v>

3855
03:13:26.021 --> 03:13:27.200
<v Speaker 3>he made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nobody.</v>

3856
03:13:27.530 --> 03:13:29.690
<v Speaker 3>You're telling them about the mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that got you there,</v>

3857
03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:30.583
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was weird that I didn't think I </v>

3858
03:13:33.471 --> 03:13:36.530
<v Speaker 3>did that well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Netflix special,</v>

3859
03:13:36.531 --> 03:13:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I guess personally I want to do better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3860
03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:41.113
<v Speaker 3>but it.</v>

3861
03:13:41.150 --> 03:13:45.770
<v Speaker 3>But ever since that you can't ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since you're a July to June 30th,</v>

3862
03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I have been a different level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was a standup comic.</v>

3863
03:13:49.340 --> 03:13:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I went back to the Mitzi shore </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>

3864
03:13:52.850 --> 03:13:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck and 55,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't like me.</v>

3865
03:13:56.121 --> 03:13:59.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck if I offend you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't give a fuck.</v>

3866
03:14:00.020 --> 03:14:04.580
<v Speaker 3>This is who I am and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been having some tremendous sets in</v>

3867
03:14:04.581 --> 03:14:07.070
<v Speaker 3>the original benefit of doing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3868
03:14:07.071 --> 03:14:09.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck the benefit of doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>these specials.</v>

3869
03:14:09.321 --> 03:14:10.154
<v Speaker 3>As you grow it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned all the material and then you </v>

3870
03:14:12.441 --> 03:14:15.880
<v Speaker 3>forced to regroup and you forced to look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the material and look at your set,</v>

3871
03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:18.380
<v Speaker 3>see what you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people never do that,</v>

3872
03:14:18.381 --> 03:14:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they never grow because of that.</v>

3873
03:14:20.060 --> 03:14:23.060
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the growth I've had since June four,</v>

3874
03:14:24.230 --> 03:14:27.750
<v Speaker 3>I feel like Dustin Puri and Max Holloway</v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

3875
03:14:27.800 --> 03:14:30.520
<v Speaker 3>like I see it like in the original room.</v>

3876
03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm back to rear for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I finally,</v>

3877
03:14:33.530 --> 03:14:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I had a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just just got in my head.</v>

3878
03:14:37.940 --> 03:14:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I had a watch couple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some Red Fox specials.</v>

3879
03:14:42.010 --> 03:14:46.520
<v Speaker 3>I cop a couple of they bruce bachelor's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back to my favorite.</v>

3880
03:14:46.521 --> 03:14:47.354
<v Speaker 3>I got all the vinyl from Richard Pryor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I went back and listened to what I </v>

3881
03:14:49.941 --> 03:14:53.060
<v Speaker 3>came to the conclusion that what was I </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving a fuck about?</v>

3882
03:14:53.780 --> 03:14:56.840
<v Speaker 3>I can't give a fuck about audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is who the fuck I am.</v>

3883
03:14:57.440 --> 03:14:58.273
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to unleash the wrath of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking God on you and we come out of </v>

3884
03:15:02.481 --> 03:15:04.370
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see what the fuck it is.</v>

3885
03:15:04.620 --> 03:15:05.453
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing I did was a week before </v>

3886
03:15:08.210 --> 03:15:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Jim Norton says something that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bothered me.</v>

3887
03:15:10.671 --> 03:15:11.504
<v Speaker 3>Once I understood after he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he didn't watch people specials </v>

3888
03:15:16.790 --> 03:15:18.950
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like watching comedy specials.</v>

3889
03:15:19.460 --> 03:15:20.293
<v Speaker 3>I love watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the week before my special that the </v>

3890
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:25.520
<v Speaker 3>worst thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched John Malaney special,</v>

3891
03:15:26.450 --> 03:15:29.780
<v Speaker 3>who's a great writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a great writer.</v>

3892
03:15:29.960 --> 03:15:33.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a great ride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was me and my energy,</v>

3893
03:15:33.111 --> 03:15:36.770
<v Speaker 3>so I wanted to be John Malaney and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I felt.</v>

3894
03:15:37.400 --> 03:15:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Looking back now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I got it all out of a way.</v>

3895
03:15:40.840 --> 03:15:43.700
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what the fuck I am and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in trouble.</v>

3896
03:15:43.701 --> 03:15:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking into murky waters now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every show,</v>

3897
03:15:47.240 --> 03:15:50.160
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to say something to offend</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's</v>

3898
03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:52.320
<v Speaker 2>who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to talk this dirty shit.</v>

3899
03:15:52.770 --> 03:15:53.603

<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck what anybody thinks </v>
