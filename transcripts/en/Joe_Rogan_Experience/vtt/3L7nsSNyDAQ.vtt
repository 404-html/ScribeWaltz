<v Speaker 1>iTunes.</v>

13
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:56.260
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just fucking around.</v>

14
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>what started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it Anthony [inaudible] show?</v>

16
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I remember a while ago when Justin TV</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>

17
00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>we used to always be on the road in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greenroom and I always tried to like set</v>

18
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>up like a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the green room thing.</v>

19
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>We did it a few times at Joey Diaz and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Jody has got pissed and twisted my</v>

20
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that he got mad cause you</v>

21
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>didn't want the camera on anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he grabbed my hand and started</v>

22
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>twisting my finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

23
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Like he got really upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey.</v>

24
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I think Joey has to be funny all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and his eyes and when Joey's</v>

25
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>backstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's just sitting there like,</v>

26
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do?</v>

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm not even hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he doesn't want people to see</v>

28
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want people to see the normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>average everyday Joe.</v>

30
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>He just wants Joey when he's on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

31
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

32
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:37.401
<v Speaker 1>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

33
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>that incident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

34
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this anymore.</v>

35
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>And then we try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

36
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Joey's a lot more sensitive than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think he has.</v>

37
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey said something to me.</v>

39
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I came down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

40
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 1>when we were headed to the show in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland and Joey got mad.</v>

41
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was ridiculous.</v>

42
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>That came out of nowhere too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just me and him sitting there</v>

43
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 1>waiting for you to come down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really weird.</v>

44
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line was I had to take a</v>

45
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:01.300
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes who's that,</v>

46
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Amelia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably,</v>

47
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>it's probably me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you have to tell you shit</v>

48
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you all the time it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes like you're running out</v>

49
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

50
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I got to go.</v>

51
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Let me just see if I can get it out real</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

52
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh.</v>

53
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

54
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I do have to take a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

55
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had enough lettuce today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that.</v>

56
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>That when you have to speed up a shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst,</v>

57
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 1>that's not cool at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That healthy.</v>

58
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>The worst is when you thinking about not</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a shit and then you do and you</v>

59
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:29.541
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>around for the next couple hours of that</v>

<v Speaker 1>let her know it's a commodity.</v>

71
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>You didn't look through my camera by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that I left it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>my gut just kind of sits on her ass when</v>

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>with like big arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had like,</v>

118
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>she would wear Larry the cable guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

119
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would wear like sleeveless shirts,</v>

120
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>like sleeveless vest and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>And she had these like these big floppy</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck driver arms,</v>

122
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was,</v>

123
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>she was a dyke and there's no getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>

124
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>She was much was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 1>my friend did not want to come clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

126
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I so want to be normal,</v>

127
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to be normal.</v>

128
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>You remember Joey Diaz or stories about</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be a white kid?</v>

129
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not white.</v>

130
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he,</v>

131
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's kind of ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called a slurp.</v>

132
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate him.</v>

133
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>You make that slurping noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't you turn your microphone up?</v>

134
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

135
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>When I was listening to episode number</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in the car,</v>

136
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>that was another thing that the mic</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucks so bad.</v>

137
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>There was parts where things were</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping and just blew your speakers out</v>

138
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty annoying.</v>

139
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I didn't know is a lot of</v>

140
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.570
<v Speaker 1>say why you stitcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>

142
00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to the president recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were talking about the whole</v>

143
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:37.200
<v Speaker 1>incident and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The incidence,</v>

144
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>the RSS incident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a beer and now he said a lot of</v>

145
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>things that I had no idea that stitcher</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

146
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And one thing was that stitcher</v>
<v Speaker 1>normalizes the whole audio.</v>

147
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>So when there's big loud burst and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

148
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 1>which is what we should be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be doing,</v>

149
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 1>we actually used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

150
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it made the audio too quiet because</v>

151
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>if for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

152
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.123
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an audio,</v>

153
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

154
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need compression.</v>

155
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I heard that compression was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the way to go though.</v>

156
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>A lot of audio engineers that work at</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio stations here in La actually told</v>

157
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>me that that's not the way to go is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.190
<v Speaker 1>to use software post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who knows host.</v>

159
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to edit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to put it through posts before.</v>

161
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a plugin in what the</v>

162
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>program I use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is logic and it automatically just</v>

163
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

164
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>But you have to run it through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>program and you can't do it live.</v>

165
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it live.</v>

166
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it live.</v>

167
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And I guess was written by saying there,</v>

168
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.030
<v Speaker 2>talking about the Adam Carolla show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have podcast envy.</v>

169
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I went to his setup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so dope he's got,</v>

170
00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's something cool about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I are just chilling in my</v>

171
00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:38.550
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always do it this way and it's either</v>

172
00:06:38.551 --> 00:06:40.120
<v Speaker 2>in your office or in my office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

173
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something cool about that,</v>

174
00:06:41.881 --> 00:06:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but his is set up is pretty fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweet.</v>

175
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except that you doing a radio show,</v>

176
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.510
<v Speaker 1>you actually got this one of the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>mix that you use as I guess Mark Marin</v>

177
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>and him both use and we tried it out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't sound as good.</v>

178
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Well ours is a lot louder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a part of that is the show</v>

179
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 2>is a little more unstructured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's people leaning back and</v>

180
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 2>yelling and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really any of that going on in</v>

181
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Marin show and there's not really any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that going on the Kroll show,</v>

182
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for our purposes these are</v>

183
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:09.910
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

184
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you listen to any podcasts besides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.900
<v Speaker 1>or do you just kind of here and there?</v>

186
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh listen to this info.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to psychedelic salon.</v>

187
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic salon is kind of cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a podcast,</v>

188
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 2>but really it's a bunch of old audio</v>
<v Speaker 2>recordings,</v>

189
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 2>like old Terence Mckenna recordings or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I listened to that stuff.</v>

191
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:32.621
<v Speaker 2>But honestly I tried to listen to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>news or I listened to talk radio for two</v>

192
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:34.371
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

193
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see if there's anybody that I agree</v>

194
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 2>with and two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see if there's anybody that's just</v>

195
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 2>completely out to lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I listened at Patriot on Sirius</v>

196
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 2>satellite radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why we're listening to it,</v>

197
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all fucking bananas.</v>

198
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 2>It's all these crazy assholes that want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Barrick gold and they're ready for</v>

199
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.980
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing to come tumbling down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got their guns ready and this will</v>

200
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.420
<v Speaker 2>bomb on what he's trying to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>niche.</v>

201
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Eric Andre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know to those guys,</v>

202
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't fall for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

203
00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.980
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't get in the back of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head like,</v>

204
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:00.791
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

205
00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:03.070
<v Speaker 1>We need to collect gold and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

206
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't follow her.</v>

207
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

208
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I think if the shit hits the fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gold's not what we're going to need.</v>

209
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.250
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make bullets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gasoline.</v>

210
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullets,</v>

211
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 2>gasoline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns,</v>

212
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 2>places to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere to go where there's no</v>

213
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 2>radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the shit hits the fan,</v>

214
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>there's so many human beings have</v>
<v Speaker 2>device,</v>

215
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:24.220
<v Speaker 2>so many ways to fuck each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That if something ever really Keanna cap</v>

216
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>and at this point in time where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>really went into like nuclear warfare,</v>

217
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the golden going to help you dog</v>

218
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 1>every time I'm away from La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the reasonable,</v>

219
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.120
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that maybe we should</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave la someday because every time I'm</v>

220
00:08:37.121 --> 00:08:39.250
<v Speaker 1>away from La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was out of town this weekend when</v>

221
00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I was away I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now's a good time.</v>

222
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.990
<v Speaker 1>If Shit was to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be a good time because I'm</v>

223
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:47.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of out of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could escape easier,</v>

224
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:48.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there's not a whole bunch of</v>

225
00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:53.020
<v Speaker 1>traffic and soul vein and like I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a whole suitcase of shit.</v>

226
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I have my computers and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at a certain</v>

227
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 2>point in time it becomes completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary to be in such a large group</v>

228
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only benefit of it is that because</v>

229
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

230
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And especially because it's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a desired area.</v>

231
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 2>You get a lot of fascinating people</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

232
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like if you moved to Denver,</v>

233
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 1>like what are you gonna do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast flight?</v>

234
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Freddy Lockhart out on a plane</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

235
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 2>could do is there's three comedy clubs</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Denver.</v>

236
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 2>There's two comedy works and there's one</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Improv.</v>

237
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I could talk to the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in for that.</v>

238
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I can interview them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it like a radio show kind of.</v>

239
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's local comics.</v>

240
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a strong local comic scene in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denver so I could always like have those</v>

241
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 2>guys come on and we could do Skype too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did an Ariel Helwani,</v>

242
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 2>his MMA show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it yesterday and I did it through</v>

243
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Skype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad ass man.</v>

244
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 2>How did it sound?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds he sounds great.</v>

245
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I use that stupid snow snowball</v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone.</v>

246
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's kind of fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>though is that you can't hear your own</v>

247
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

248
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm still waiting to set it up that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could definitely,</v>

249
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.190
<v Speaker 2>you could use these mics as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

250
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.680
<v Speaker 2>And if I had it set up like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in like if I had it set up like</v>

251
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 2>this in Colorado and you had it set up</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this in California and we just</v>

252
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 2>skyped it together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do a podcast,</v>

253
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 2>it'd be pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then once I show you how sweet</v>

254
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:11.630

<v Speaker 3>there's only one way to do it.</v>

332
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 3>You've got to go gang busters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta like put together an act.</v>

333
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.070
<v Speaker 3>You've got a rare opportunity man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're on the road with me all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>these giant crowds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>looking as it in a career and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I ever want to do it as a career</v>

340
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:13.241
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

341
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I think if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a workout for this podcast.</v>

342
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.400
<v Speaker 1>make you more comfortable and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and you know,</v>

344
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.630
<v Speaker 1>thinking of funny ideas and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>being creative,</v>

345
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if I'm not doing this,</v>

346
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 1>then I'm painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I have to be doing something and now,</v>

347
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:29.580
<v Speaker 1>right now it's just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed it to concentrate and,</v>

466
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.423
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

467
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's speed,</v>

468
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't think you're going to last very</v>

469
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 2>long on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like what it feels</v>

470
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.440
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a cup of coffee during the</v>

471
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:55.200
<v Speaker 1>podcast and a cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Cup of coffee is fine,</v>

472
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>but if I have two cups of coffee during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast,</v>

473
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 1>after the podcast is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel all amped up.</v>

474
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I don't feel shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel that at all.</v>

475
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 1>The only get like there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy in your system.</v>

476
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

477
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 1>But what I do notice is that I clinch</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

478
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when instead of feeling that energy,</v>

479
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll find myself like reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clenching my teeth really hard.</v>

480
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of nowhere,</v>

481
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed on the way home yesterday</v>

482
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:21.320
<v Speaker 1>because I had two cups of coffee here</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and it was,</v>

483
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I was driving and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I clenching my teeth?</v>

484
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like it's all going to my,</v>

485
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Speaker 1>my jaw dude.</v>

486
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.430
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be one of the weirdest</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers have ever met.</v>

487
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.811
<v Speaker 1>I do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

488
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 1>if you look back at old use dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see like this line on my,</v>

489
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I do this and I bite my cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And are you thinking about anything</v>

490
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 1>where you're doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing it?</v>

491
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like clenching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have this energy that you got to get</v>

492
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:45.840
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah and my mouth squeeze off around.</v>

493
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have some like unaddressed</v>

494
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:52.780
<v Speaker 1>energy issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

495
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you like started doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like like throwing the discus</v>

496
00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.540
<v Speaker 1>or something like really physical you</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you would like feel much better.</v>

497
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to Xbox at dance game</v>
<v Speaker 1>on connected.</v>

498
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.630
<v Speaker 1>It works pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

499
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.440
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a martial arts game where</v>

500
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.200
<v Speaker 1>like a robot does certain moves and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can kick it,</v>

501
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get like moves forward and you can leg</v>

502
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:16.560
<v Speaker 1>kick and it moves forward.</v>

503
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Your Punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to do much this to be a</v>

504
00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:20.530
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this connect thing,</v>

505
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know what connect</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

506
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Webcam thing that they put,</v>

507
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you put it on top of your TV and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>detects your body.</v>

508
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.570
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

509
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't played that much,</v>

510
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 1>but the games I've played fucking bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

511
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like a where you just hold up your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

512
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you can even do Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're streaming through movies going</v>

513
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 1>like this with your hand moving it left</v>
<v Speaker 1>or right your string through movies and</v>

514
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 1>if you want to pick one you pull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push your,</v>

515
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 1>pull your hand out and grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of like a whatever</v>

516
00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.740
<v Speaker 1>minority report or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

517
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.690
<v Speaker 1>but they have games to where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any controllers anymore.</v>

518
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.640
<v Speaker 1>So how of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how accurate is it?</v>

519
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.820
<v Speaker 1>How effective is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

520
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best,</v>

521
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:56.460
<v Speaker 1>but I have never noticed it not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

522
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

523
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the long as you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing like a first person shooter or</v>

524
00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.300
<v Speaker 1>something where you'd have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good enough for that.</v>

525
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really based on lighting</v>

526
00:20:06.661 --> 00:20:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and clothing and w because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

527
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the girl I was with was wearing a dress</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it couldn't detect separate legs.</v>

528
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.960
<v Speaker 1>So it was kind of fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she took off her dress and then it</v>

529
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:17.140
<v Speaker 1>worked perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

530
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a trick and wanted you to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whore.</v>

531
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.300
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I told her.</v>

532
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Cause you have a dress on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much clothes on.</v>

533
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing over there?</v>

534
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now if you're using it as a first</v>

535
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 1>person shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you pull triggers?</v>

536
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

537
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't played a first person shooter,</v>

538
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 1>but what I would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

539
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.470
<v Speaker 1>That'd be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they're going to do it.</v>

540
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.780
<v Speaker 1>We can't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't talk about that one thing,</v>

541
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:42.300
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a crazy first person shooter</v>

542
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:44.520
<v Speaker 1>that we can't talk about something now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

543
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Not because I don't think it's known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody tell us this.</v>

544
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

545
00:20:49.351 --> 00:20:51.530
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the video that I showed you that Kevin</v>

546
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Prayer it might've showed us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

547
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:53.711
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

548
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:54.161
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

549
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

550
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think Cognito,</v>

551
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the fuck you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

552
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he got to think of a guy.</v>

553
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:01.780
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing a first person shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>

554
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.190
<v Speaker 2>you got to deal with two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

555
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:06.430
<v Speaker 2>how do you simulate movement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you go forward,</v>

556
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running,</v>

557
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 2>how do you go on forward and how does</v>
<v Speaker 2>the machine know you're running back?</v>

558
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.610
<v Speaker 2>But because you're not moving forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

559
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good with your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like because with the dance game,</v>

560
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 2>it was like you did like something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

561
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:18.520
<v Speaker 2>That means forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go like this and you shake your hand</v>

562
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 2>to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you're shooting.</v>

563
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideally what you want is like a giant</v>

564
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 2>dome or a ball rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you be inside that ball like a</v>

565
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 2>hamster ball and that ball you have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a three d helmet on like a</v>

566
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 2>complete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.550
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

568
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete virtual reality helmet on.</v>

569
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 2>And then you would be walking around</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this ball.</v>

570
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:40.870
<v Speaker 2>You could walk in any direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

571
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:43.660
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't feel totally real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you would kind of be realizing that</v>

572
00:21:43.661 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 2>you're on a ball and then you're stuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

573
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:47.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this thing.</v>

574
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 2>But that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

575
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 2>other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck else could you simulate</v>

576
00:21:51.401 --> 00:21:54.640
<v Speaker 2>movement unless you just did it inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the virtual reality,</v>

577
00:21:54.641 --> 00:21:57.610
<v Speaker 2>then I wouldn't even be virtual anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to do it inside,</v>

578
00:21:57.611 --> 00:21:58.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

579
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.660
<v Speaker 2>put a program and then make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a program the exact parameters of</v>

580
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:05.350
<v Speaker 2>say an airplane hangar and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an empty airplane hangar and they walk</v>

581
00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 2>around inside that hanger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

582
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.760
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all wired and you could do it that</v>

583
00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:11.170
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then that kind of defeats the whole</v>

584
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 2>purpose of virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

585
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that you're supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do it wherever you are.</v>

586
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you ever go to burning man?</v>

587
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.513
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

588
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Too many hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned about hippies when I moved to</v>

589
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 2>boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked him in theory.</v>

590
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked him in theory,</v>

591
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a lot of people that are</v>

592
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 2>asking for money all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that shouldn't be very annoying.</v>

593
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't like people playing shitty songs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wanting a dollar.</v>

594
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

595
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 2>for the most part that cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

596
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too much of that hippie movement</v>

597
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.310
<v Speaker 2>that wants people to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

598
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:50.260
<v Speaker 2>And this is how I feel about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I felt like everybody was on the ball</v>

599
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 2>and everybody was doing their best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

600
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm a generous person and I think one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things about being generous is if</v>

601
00:22:57.671 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 2>you have the opportunity to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels really good to be generous,</v>

602
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 2>especially if it doesn't affect you.</v>

603
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're being generous in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hurting you.</v>

604
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.250
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's,</v>

605
00:23:07.251 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 2>it's important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in passing,</v>

606
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.330
<v Speaker 2>like say you're passing love to the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a big circle of people,</v>

607
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real promise was a lot of fucking</v>

608
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:20.650
<v Speaker 2>people that never keep passing the love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take it and then they walk away.</v>

609
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.621
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

610
00:23:21.621 --> 00:23:24.430
<v Speaker 2>there's some people that are always</v>
<v Speaker 2>there for you.</v>

611
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.150
<v Speaker 2>There's some people and they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>their best and they're there.</v>

612
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:31.110
<v Speaker 2>They're living their life and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing your best and you're living your</v>

613
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.620
<v Speaker 2>life and you're helping each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

614
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:33.880
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I borrow your truck?</v>

615
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I've got to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah man.</v>

616
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Come on over it dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you got my shit,</v>

617
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

618
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 2>we're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You help me,</v>

619
00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all together.</v>

620
00:23:40.241 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Speaker 2>But we all know those the few people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't contribute,</v>

621
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 2>they always need something and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't contribute.</v>

622
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 2>And my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my experience with hippies.</v>

623
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.200
<v Speaker 2>That's my experience with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people that you know,</v>

624
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 2>are like really into like socialist</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideals.</v>

625
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.310
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is because they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy man.</v>

626
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking lazy and they don't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hard and they don't do their part</v>

627
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.720
<v Speaker 2>and they somehow or another field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the whole system's unfair man.</v>

628
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Which fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it is.</v>

629
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's corrupt.</v>

630
00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not why you're a loser.</v>

631
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>losers.</v>

632
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Most people are losers because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy as shit and they want to blame</v>

633
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:23.180
<v Speaker 2>other people for that and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>blame society and they want to blame.</v>

634
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>society is completely fucked.</v>

635
00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 2>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's one person that</v>

636
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:30.110
<v Speaker 2>makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the whole thing is it's fuck cause</v>

637
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 2>it's on a foundation of bullshit.</v>

638
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But knowing that you see what it is,</v>

639
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 2>make your path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make your path.</v>

640
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Figure out something that you can do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed yourself.</v>

641
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figuring out something you can do to put</v>

642
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 2>a roof over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just figure it out,</v>

643
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking figure it out.</v>

644
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.280
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you have to be a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

645
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:51.860
<v Speaker 2>To be successful doesn't mean you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a part of the system,</v>

646
00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:53.960
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now just dot.</v>

647
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Stop asking people for money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop being a fucking Mooch.</v>

648
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Get your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

649
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.820
<v Speaker 2>That's my problem with hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My plan with hippies is part of the</v>

650
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:05.240
<v Speaker 2>whole idea of being a hippie as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really nice and being really</v>

651
00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:07.850
<v Speaker 2>relaxed and sometimes life does not call</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

652
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes life calls for you gotta get</v>
<v Speaker 2>off your fucking ass and make something</v>

653
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:12.134
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

654
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

655
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot.</v>

656
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.660
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who was his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

657
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.240
<v Speaker 2>His girlfriend was having a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was many,</v>

658
00:25:17.241 --> 00:25:21.110
<v Speaker 2>many years ago and I had a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>scream at this guy.</v>

659
00:25:21.111 --> 00:25:23.960
<v Speaker 2>This guy was unemployed and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

660
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.170
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't get his shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't make something happen.</v>

661
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:29.660
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to be a comedian for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>while that didn't work out,</v>

662
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 2>and then he was trying to do some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

663
00:25:31.191 --> 00:25:34.190
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to do some radio and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>budget and we have this conversation and</v>

664
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

665
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you got to realize you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become that fucking guy.</v>

666
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 2>You're going to become that unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathetic guy who can't feed his kids.</v>

667
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to fucking do something,</v>

668
00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:45.590
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to make something happen.</v>

669
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

670
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:47.900
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

671
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 2>we really need some food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you could help us?</v>

672
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the hippie approach to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and you've got to make your own</v>

673
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:55.730
<v Speaker 2>fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've gotta make your own way.</v>

674
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.270
<v Speaker 2>And that was my problem with boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would ultimately,</v>

675
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:00.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it'd be my problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland,</v>

676
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.740
<v Speaker 2>and it's a bit of my problem with San</v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco and it's not that I'm not a</v>

677
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:05.480
<v Speaker 2>kind person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very kind person,</v>

678
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.350
<v Speaker 2>but I recognize the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's in need and someone who's</v>

679
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:11.930
<v Speaker 2>fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of people that just</v>

680
00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:14.060
<v Speaker 2>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're weak is shit man.</v>

681
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 2>And they have no philosophy to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life by,</v>

682
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.030
<v Speaker 2>they have no discipline that they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed over years of trying to</v>

683
00:26:20.031 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 2>accomplish things to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this sense of,</v>

684
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 2>of personal sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can take care of themselves.</v>

685
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:26.660
<v Speaker 2>And I like occasionally everybody needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>

686
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 2>But if somebody will help you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they know that you're the type of</v>

687
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:32.200
<v Speaker 2>person that will help them and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you're the type of person that</v>

688
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 2>does their best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The what drives me nuts is when someone</v>

689
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 2>wants help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like motherfucker,</v>

690
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 2>you're not even helping yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

691
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:42.170
<v Speaker 2>look what you're doing for yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want someone else to step in and</v>

692
00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 2>manage your fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

693
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.780

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

744
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 1>so when it turns and you have a flashing</v>
<v Speaker 1>light that just flashes at a certain</v>

745
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 1>rate,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it's fucking trippy.</v>

755
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.920
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically they've done is animation.</v>

756
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

757
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And just like the old claymation models</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to use for like King Kong and</v>

758
00:28:57.961 --> 00:28:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

759
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Or like a old flip book where you draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a flip book and he flipped it.</v>

760
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>That's bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

761
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm down with the artistic end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

762
00:29:04.051 --> 00:29:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm down with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of a,</v>

763
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.010
<v Speaker 1>all these artists getting together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing cool shit.</v>

764
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I just think there'd be a lot of stinky</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

765
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder why I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they have.</v>

766
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't a collection of people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

767
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:16.920

<v Speaker 1>Because that is huge,</v>

769
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather know perform there.</v>

770
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.440

<v Speaker 1>I'd want to,</v>

771
00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I just want to hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fun.</v>

772
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I got a foreign name magic performing</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the Woodstock of comedy,</v>

773
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.730
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be so much mushrooms and so</v>

<v Speaker 1>much everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much fun.</v>

775
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.850

<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

776
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to be talking on stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a microphone.</v>

777
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the last thing you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're on shrooms.</v>

778
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:41.080

785
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

786
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Freddy Soto used to say this back in the</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I don't only do comedy clubs,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

794
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.850
<v Speaker 2>You go to these bars and everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking and you can't do your act right.</v>

795
00:30:08.851 --> 00:30:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Your rush it because you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get their attention.</v>

796
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.870
<v Speaker 2>And he was totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

797
00:30:12.871 --> 00:30:15.840
<v Speaker 2>he's totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda how I am right now.</v>

798
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I only do shows I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my show I'm doing,</v>

799
00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:20.670

<v Speaker 2>There's no hassles.</v>

803
00:30:25.231 --> 00:30:28.020
<v Speaker 2>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're just doing a fucking look,</v>

804
00:30:28.021 --> 00:30:31.740
<v Speaker 2>you're in a tent with some speakers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on this stage and all these</v>

805
00:30:31.741 --> 00:30:34.110
<v Speaker 2>people are all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all fucked out of their minds</v>

806
00:30:34.111 --> 00:30:36.030
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should they pay attention to you?</v>

807
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.430
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would feel illegitimate standing</v>

808
00:30:38.431 --> 00:30:40.440
<v Speaker 2>there asking them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you knew that everyone in the crowd</v>

00:30:40.441 --> 00:30:42.180
<v Speaker 2>was on mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have nothing to say.</v>

810
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.920
<v Speaker 2>They look it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless I'm on mushrooms to,</v>

811
00:30:43.921 --> 00:30:46.230
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to tell you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tell you shit,</v>

812
00:30:46.231 --> 00:30:47.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're communicating with the ear,</v>

813
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.360
<v Speaker 2>the alien overlords right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know these beings that have come on</v>

814
00:30:51.361 --> 00:30:54.240
<v Speaker 2>asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their spores of infested this earth.</v>

815
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.220
<v Speaker 2>You're communicating with them through</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating them.</v>

816
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.680
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you some stupid Dick</v>

817
00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Jokes.</v>

818
00:30:58.770 --> 00:30:59.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

819
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:02.130
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty pretty known for being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychic psychedelic speaker.</v>

820
00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always do the marijuana shows here</v>

821
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:06.390
<v Speaker 1>in town and stuff like that for the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to the same kind of people.</v>

822
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing part of being into</v>

823
00:31:08.751 --> 00:31:11.840
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics and understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics and I've had psychedelic</v>

824
00:31:11.841 --> 00:31:15.710
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of negates any idea of you</v>

825
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 2>wanting that sort of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

826
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Like doing a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're doing a show,</v>

827
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:21.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beautiful thing about a show is that</v>

828
00:31:21.831 --> 00:31:24.380
<v Speaker 2>people enjoy and they have a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking time that comes to your comedy</v>

829
00:31:24.381 --> 00:31:26.120
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what you want to do when</v>

830
00:31:26.121 --> 00:31:28.950
<v Speaker 2>you're jazzed out of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

831
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.120
<v Speaker 2>if you're on psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to go see a comedy show,</v>

832
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see anything structured</v>

833
00:31:34.131 --> 00:31:37.070
<v Speaker 2>and I certainly don't want someone on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage like forcing there.</v>

834
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of things you say on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage in a comedy show that's just to</v>

835
00:31:41.301 --> 00:31:42.530
<v Speaker 2>get a laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

836
00:31:42.531 --> 00:31:45.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's there for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there to spice up the show to have</v>

837
00:31:45.411 --> 00:31:48.020
<v Speaker 2>more fun and those things will stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

838
00:31:48.021 --> 00:31:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking wet shits in your</v>

839
00:31:50.481 --> 00:31:51.314
<v Speaker 2>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just like,</v>

840
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.030
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

841
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.480

<v Speaker 2>every like jokey joke that you have,</v>

842
00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:57.314

854
00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:26.610
<v Speaker 1>what's kind of like an act?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like an Andrew dice clay kind of</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like he was doing it.</v>

857
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't think he was the the crazy</v>

858
00:32:31.921 --> 00:32:34.860
<v Speaker 1>stoner in just after hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that first night.</v>

859
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

861
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.950
<v Speaker 1>every five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

862
00:32:37.951 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to your hotel room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>about someone in their joint.</v>

863
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Those guys like to go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

864
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:44.150
<v Speaker 2>this is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some dudes who go real deep.</v>

865
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Those guys in involved in the medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>

866
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 2>like those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those look like normal and the toss guys</v>

867
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 2>goes so deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were not normal,</v>

868
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cannabis cup,</v>

869
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:58.220
<v Speaker 2>that was the deepest that I've ever been</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was an inn on Melrose in</v>

870
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the judges and it was at a</v>

871
00:33:01.121 --> 00:33:03.440
<v Speaker 2>a head shop and they'd close the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>shop down.</v>

872
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:05.720
<v Speaker 2>They papered up the window so no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>could see inside.</v>

873
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.820
<v Speaker 2>They put a doorman in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lock the front,</v>

874
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.280
<v Speaker 2>and then they turned the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this Cannabis Cup party.</v>

875
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Really fucking bold movement because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did this shit in the middle of</v>

876
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood and the place was just filled</v>
<v Speaker 2>with weed.</v>

877
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was unbelievable and no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>

878
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 2>They just kept going deeper and deeper</v>
<v Speaker 2>and deeper until I left there and went</v>

879
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:25.270
<v Speaker 2>to get something to eat.</v>

880
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

881
00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:29.360
<v Speaker 2>no way I can drive home right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got to hang out for a few hours.</v>

882
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I had to hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

883
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:34.100
<v Speaker 2>most of the time when you're high</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving is not an issue because driving</v>

884
00:33:34.101 --> 00:33:35.960
<v Speaker 2>is not any more complicated than</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking.</v>

885
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.950
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

886
00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:37.460
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

887
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.010
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're not smoking Endeca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're not smoking some</v>

888
00:33:40.011 --> 00:33:40.844
<v Speaker 2>dopey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd,</v>

889
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:41.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

890
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 2>if you're driving and you're high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

891
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:44.930
<v Speaker 2>just be extra careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch what you're doing.</v>

892
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:46.520
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't affect your hand eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordination.</v>

893
00:33:46.521 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean I do Jujitsu on weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kickbox and waiting is not a problem</v>

894
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was so high that I was like,</v>

895
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 2>no fucking way man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just no way I'm going to drive</v>

896
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 2>this thing and risk not being in control</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my senses.</v>

897
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:02.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a cup of coffee and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some food and just fucking sit back</v>

898
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 2>and read myself over a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go over my notes,</v>

899
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit down for a bit before I drove home.</v>

900
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It was too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was too stupid cause like you get to</v>

901
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:14.720
<v Speaker 2>a certain point when when people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

902
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.780
<v Speaker 2>everybody's handing you cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a vaporizer bag.</v>

903
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Hit this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

904
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.720
<v Speaker 2>this is a new blank paper that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed,</v>

905
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:23.420
<v Speaker 2>hit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's passing joints left to</v>

906
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:26.360
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a never ending like a cyclone</v>

907
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.600
<v Speaker 2>of joints getting passed around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking ridiculous.</v>

908
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.080
<v Speaker 2>But you get to this point where you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even high anymore.</v>

909
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're high anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not there.</v>

910
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:39.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were in a room and you know the,</v>

911
00:34:39.271 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 2>the room has one window and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>circular window and the room is like</v>

912
00:34:42.921 --> 00:34:44.560
<v Speaker 2>four by four wide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even move.</v>

913
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I even toilet in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you,</v>

914
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that room and that circular window</v>

915
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.000
<v Speaker 2>and that circular window is now how you</v>
<v Speaker 2>view the rest of the world.</v>

916
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.930
<v Speaker 2>You're looking out that window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

917
00:34:51.931 --> 00:34:55.250
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is crazy.</v>

918
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what's happening out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

919
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're,</v>

920
00:34:58.871 --> 00:35:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you're detached from the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're so high,</v>

921
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.560
<v Speaker 2>you're detached,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

922
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 2>But those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anybody ever wanted like some sort of</v>

923
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:10.110
<v Speaker 2>argument against the cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>that podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>98.</v>

969
00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.960
<v Speaker 3>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you just need some muck.</v>

00:36:59.961 --> 00:37:02.250
<v Speaker 3>We immediately after smoking weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was great.</v>

971
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every podcast 98 Aka the disaster</v>

972
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.940
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Whittaker apparently is very upset</v>

973
00:37:08.941 --> 00:37:13.080
<v Speaker 3>with the depictions of him from that</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast tweeting mean things to you.</v>

974
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started attacking me on Twitter just</v>

975
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:16.440
<v Speaker 3>like today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

976
00:37:16.441 --> 00:37:17.610
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

977
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:22.690
<v Speaker 3>The thing I'm saying is I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that people that are at home</v>

978
00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 3>can listen to this podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what's going on.</v>

979
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Instead of having a million people</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking at once.</v>

980
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:30.660
<v Speaker 3>It was no attack on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand what you're saying.</v>

981
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:33.290
<v Speaker 3>So for the people that don't know about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that podcast and it's not worth</v>

982
00:37:33.291 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 3>listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a good one.</v>

983
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

986
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.490
<v Speaker 3>be on a podcast.</v>

987
00:37:41.491 --> 00:37:43.570
<v Speaker 3>other people are talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

988
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have a chance to prepare.</v>

989
00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 3>It just got thrown into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

990
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.360
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even know he was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

991
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:49.890
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about him too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>taught out there for a pimp.</v>

994
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.330

<v Speaker 3>band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause people well that whenever you do</v>

1003
00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:18.960
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you do comedy,</v>

1004
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.760
<v Speaker 3>people look at it and got it looks so</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>

1005
00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I can do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you ain't even funny.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But then the,</v>

1007
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:24.884
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>videos or something.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fucking I can do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1010
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.050
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at someone who's in a nice</v>

1011
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 3>spot and what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1012
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't that in me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's hard to not jealous man.</v>

1013
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:36.340
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>

1014
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 2>some ingrained shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what my kids,</v>

1015
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the three year old and the one year old</v>

1016
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes a three year old would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset at the one year old,</v>

1017
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 2>the one year old getting too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

1018
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 2>She'll take things from her and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like they just,</v>

1019
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:50.920
<v Speaker 2>it's just nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature wants you that you want to</v>

1020
00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:52.860
<v Speaker 2>collect all that love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1021
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.880
<v Speaker 2>That's why people develop great</v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities.</v>

1022
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 2>They develop great personalities cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realized somewhere along the line,</v>

1023
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a rewards is that,</v>

1024
00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:01.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a great personality,</v>

1025
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 2>the reward is people are always nice to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1026
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 2>You get all this nice energy that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be around you.</v>

1027
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason why great</v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities getting invented because</v>

1028
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 2>people become a horse for other people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

1029
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.980
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what really what it is.</v>

1030
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful thing in both ways,</v>

1031
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 2>but really the root of it all is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people really want positive attention.</v>

1032
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 2>So when you see like little jealousy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little kids and then you see</v>

1033
00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:24.970
<v Speaker 2>jealousy and like grown adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see like really petty shit and</v>

1034
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.700
<v Speaker 2>haters and I love to go on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1035
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:28.923
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is this thing that the flavor is</v>

1153
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:42.430
<v Speaker 2>all combining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I've gotten like a,</v>

1154
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:46.790
<v Speaker 2>like Matt Lichtenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy is a huge one fanatic.</v>

1155
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:48.470
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1156
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 2>he's a wine geek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he has this crazy wine cellar and</v>

1157
00:43:51.801 --> 00:43:55.400
<v Speaker 2>his home with some insane amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money worth of wine in it and he's one</v>

1158
00:43:55.401 --> 00:43:59.690
<v Speaker 2>of those guys that can tell you why a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine is good and what year it's good and</v>

1159
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.300
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what part of the country had comes from</v>

1160
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 2>and all that kind of shit.</v>

1161
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're around a guy like that and</v>

1162
00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know so much about why,</v>

1163
00:44:07.401 --> 00:44:09.490
<v Speaker 2>then you start to sort of appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1164
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.101
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1165
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>this is some weird tasting art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're trying to create this</v>

1166
00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:19.250
<v Speaker 2>ultimate taste and it's a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>taste and if you're not,</v>

1167
00:44:19.251 --> 00:44:21.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole idea of acquired taste.</v>

1168
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you acquire a taste for</v>

1169
00:44:24.831 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 2>something like caviar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking stuff,</v>

1170
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you know it's super expensive and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>really kind of tastes like shit when you</v>

1171
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.830
<v Speaker 2>first take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you just,</v>

1172
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:32.730
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1173
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.170
<v Speaker 2>it tastes like shit forever and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is what it is.</v>

1174
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I now have to worry about it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

1175
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.010
<v Speaker 2>people get into it and then they start</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting more and more expensive tastes</v>

1176
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:43.200
<v Speaker 2>and you're getting stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of dollars.</v>

1177
00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 2>She's salty fucking stupid fish eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well wine is kind of like that too.</v>

1178
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.510
<v Speaker 2>And that like the first time you try</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine and I nearly a little kid or</v>

1179
00:44:51.511 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 2>something like who the fuck would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into that?</v>

1180
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:58.490
<v Speaker 2>But when you really like get a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>peanut and war and a delicious steak and</v>

1181
00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 2>you're cut into that stigma and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a sip of the wine,</v>

1182
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:05.310
<v Speaker 2>like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the flavors together,</v>

1183
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.060
<v Speaker 2>it takes a while to appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But knowing someone who knows as much</v>

1184
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:11.820
<v Speaker 2>about wine as I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he tells me so much about,</v>

1185
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1186
00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about like how they put it in,</v>

1187
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:18.720
<v Speaker 2>what kind of barrels they use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>store it and how they store it and how</v>

1188
00:45:18.721 --> 00:45:21.930
<v Speaker 2>long they store it and how long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long has it been bottled for.</v>

1189
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:22.490
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1190
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:24.420
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the wineries I went to,</v>

1191
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:27.980
<v Speaker 1>they did cheese pairings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is cool because you never,</v>

1192
00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:28.641
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1193
00:45:28.641 --> 00:45:30.440
<v Speaker 1>they're going to mix this cheese with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wine.</v>

1194
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to just taste like if I still</v>

1195
00:45:32.661 --> 00:45:34.640
<v Speaker 1>use the word Faggot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't,</v>

1196
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I might throw it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right there.</v>

1197
00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tasting?</v>

<v Speaker 2>an obvious subject for a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chances are someone's already done a</v>

1380
00:52:31.741 --> 00:52:33.270
<v Speaker 2>hundred jokes on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1381
00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I looked up the other day,</v>

1382
00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:35.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1383
00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing this chapter in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1384
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:40.410
<v Speaker 2>and it has to do with porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why,</v>

1385
00:52:40.411 --> 00:52:42.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about the moment that I</v>

1386
00:52:42.721 --> 00:52:45.810
<v Speaker 2>realized that the Internet was taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>porn to a whole new level was the</v>

1387
00:52:45.811 --> 00:52:47.940
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was,</v>

1388
00:52:47.941 --> 00:52:50.730
<v Speaker 2>it might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duncan sent me an email and the email</v>

1389
00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:53.880
<v Speaker 2>heading said home run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I opened up the email and it</v>

1390
00:52:53.881 --> 00:52:56.820
<v Speaker 2>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love people in all capital letters and</v>

1391
00:52:56.821 --> 00:52:59.340
<v Speaker 2>a link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I clicked the link and it opens up,</v>

1392
00:52:59.341 --> 00:53:02.340
<v Speaker 2>it's Bella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donna on all fours with a baseball bat</v>

1393
00:53:02.341 --> 00:53:06.810
<v Speaker 2>stuffed in her asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's stuffed in there and fat and</v>

1394
00:53:06.811 --> 00:53:08.790
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't even think was possible</v>

1395
00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.410
<v Speaker 2>and I remember doubled face palming like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the home alone kid and going,</v>

1396
00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.600
<v Speaker 2>this bitch is just taking shit to</v>
<v Speaker 2>another level.</v>

1397
00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.110
<v Speaker 2>She stuffed at baseball and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about it or is she taking it to</v>

1398
00:53:19.111 --> 00:53:22.560
<v Speaker 2>another level?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went and did a Google search and</v>

1399
00:53:22.561 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>there's 2,000,800 hits</v>

1400
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.110

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1403
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:33.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she,</v>

1404
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she did that,</v>

1405
00:53:34.171 --> 00:53:34.621
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1406
00:53:34.621 --> 00:53:38.640

<v Speaker 1>stretching it out for like a whole week.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I got a big anal scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1408
00:53:40.501 --> 00:53:43.590

<v Speaker 1>and she just spent the week getting</v>

1409
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:46.220
<v Speaker 1>ready for doing shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

1411
00:53:48.631 --> 00:53:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I heard she retired.</v>

1412
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Well she had that really sad interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what it was for,</v>

1413
00:53:53.761 --> 00:53:56.790
<v Speaker 2>whether it was Nightline or one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

1414
00:53:56.791 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1416
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:00.810
<v Speaker 2>they made her feel bad about it and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1417
00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 2>and they asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1418
00:54:01.711 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 2>what happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you become this porn star?</v>

1419
00:54:04.591 --> 00:54:06.660
<v Speaker 2>And they kind of like go over her past</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit like that.</v>

1420
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1422
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:12.990
<v Speaker 2>And then they found out afterward that</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had done some more movies after that</v>

1423
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.540
<v Speaker 2>after she said that it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1424
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1425
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:19.890
<v Speaker 2>get out of it and then she's still in it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

1426

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking not everybody can be a ballet</v>

<v Speaker 2>some people are going to be porn stars</v>

1429
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:30.450
<v Speaker 2>and by the time they're that age where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna be porn stars,</v>

1430
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the least of their problems,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What have you become that you're letting</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone put a baseball bat and your ass</v>

<v Speaker 2>what has happened to you to get you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this point?</v>

1436
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not the bad itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the real issue.</v>

1437
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:48.490
<v Speaker 2>It's who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

<v Speaker 2>who are you?</v>

<v Speaker 2>and there's a giant log in it,</v>

1441
00:54:55.381 --> 00:55:00.381
<v Speaker 2>a big fucking bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's 2,800,000 hits of that.</v>

1442
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But didn't you also think about if that</v>

1443
00:55:03.531 --> 00:55:05.150
<v Speaker 1>only is bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look,</v>

1444
00:55:05.151 --> 00:55:06.740
<v Speaker 1>if you think it is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1445
00:55:06.741 --> 00:55:08.900
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's good for anybody.</v>

1446
00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:10.340
<v Speaker 1>If it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1448
00:55:11.091 --> 00:55:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

1449
00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can put baseball bat and my ass that</v>

1450
00:55:14.001 --> 00:55:15.980
<v Speaker 1>equals $20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1451
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they get paid that much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't think they do.</v>

1452
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do either.</v>

1453
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:22.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a couple of grand if they're lucky</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that might have been during</v>

1454
00:55:22.501 --> 00:55:23.450
<v Speaker 2>the Hay day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think nowadays I don't,</v>

1456
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:25.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1457
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 2>those girls were getting like half</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar vivid deals.</v>

1458
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:31.070
<v Speaker 2>You remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember hanging out with Gemma</v>

1459
00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Jamison's husband and he was a producer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was giving me the whole skinny on</v>

1460
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.180
<v Speaker 2>how much money there is in the porn</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

1461
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:37.080
<v Speaker 2>And this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1462
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 2>he had all the numbers and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad is incredible.</v>

1463
00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Like there was so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the net came along,</v>

1464
00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:46.150
<v Speaker 2>the Internet just robbed them all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucked it all away.</v>

1465
00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:47.003
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1466
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.270
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do you make money?</v>

1467
00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:49.580
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing porn I think.</v>

1468
00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely still money</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1469
00:55:51.971 --> 00:55:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It's more of you just have to do more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know a lot of these girls they'll</v>

1470
00:55:55.241 --> 00:55:55.961
<v Speaker 1>do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1471
00:55:55.961 --> 00:55:58.630
<v Speaker 1>like a spanking video and make 500 then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

1472
00:55:58.631 --> 00:56:00.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do another video later that day where</v>

1473
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:04.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just them masturbating and they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand you know,</v>

1474
00:56:04.211 --> 00:56:05.830
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think of it that way.</v>

1475
00:56:05.831 --> 00:56:08.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just made $2,000 today and is it for</v>

1476
00:56:08.261 --> 00:56:09.320
<v Speaker 1>a website?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it spends?</v>

1477
00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Most of these are websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1478
00:56:10.721 --> 00:56:13.150
<v Speaker 1>fetters websites or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchanging content.</v>

1479
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1480
00:56:14.081 --> 00:56:16.480
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest thing about knowing all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these porn stars,</v>

1481
00:56:16.481 --> 00:56:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the saddest thing is not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1482
00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.670
<v Speaker 1>how they got into it or that they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I don't have a problem with it.</v>

1483
00:56:21.671 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Is that their future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of them don't have</v>

1484
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.080
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An idea once that one.</v>

1485
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like fighters.</v>

1486
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean is that where you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1487
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 2>like a truck stop and that really older</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman then you're just like,</v>

1488

1491
00:56:39.401 --> 00:56:43.030

<v Speaker 2>door to the point where there's way,</v>

1492
00:56:43.031 --> 00:56:45.040
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more porn stars than there ever were</v>

1493
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:46.450
<v Speaker 2>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1494
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 2>And porn is so much more available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>

1495
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.820
<v Speaker 2>there was the way you got porn was</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazines.</v>

1496
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.000
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>VHS has came out while I was in high</v>

1497
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:56.080
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember we got one,</v>

1498
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:58.270
<v Speaker 2>it was like a big deal at our house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1499
00:56:58.271 --> 00:57:00.880
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad had a couple of my step father,</v>

1500
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:03.910
<v Speaker 2>a couple of porns laying around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>house too and got to watch those too.</v>

1501
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is this?</v>

1502
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:06.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go from like,</v>

1503
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.130
<v Speaker 2>it never existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or every now and then you saw a magazine</v>

1504
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:13.610
<v Speaker 2>and the weird thing about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazines where they had rules so you</v>

1505
00:57:13.611 --> 00:57:16.780
<v Speaker 2>would buy a porn magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was rules and one of the rules</v>

1506
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 2>was the man couldn't have a hard on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still have those roles really?</v>

1507
00:57:20.921 --> 00:57:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like word,</v>

1508
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:25.180
<v Speaker 2>they can't show insertion and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>in certain magazines and magazines they</v>

1509
00:57:25.181 --> 00:57:26.014
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1510
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:29.230
<v Speaker 2>But back then it was all magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back then there was no magazines that</v>

1511
00:57:29.231 --> 00:57:33.020
<v Speaker 2>showed hard ons and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean none that you could find and it</v>

1512
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.641
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1513
00:57:33.641 --> 00:57:35.650
<v Speaker 2>you'd asked the guy at the counter if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were bold,</v>

1514
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bookstore,</v>

1515
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.740
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't really want to ask them</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1516
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:40.030
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come nobody's Dicks hard?</v>

1517
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.340
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1518
00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't really bring it up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was always like these weird</v>

1519
00:57:44.621 --> 00:57:49.120
<v Speaker 2>poses where there would be in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just one but like 20 different</v>

1520
00:57:49.121 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 2>poses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in each one of them,</v>

1521
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:54.760
<v Speaker 2>the girls like moaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she's an XC and the dude doesn't</v>

1522
00:57:54.761 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 2>have a hard on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1523
00:57:56.201 --> 00:57:57.160
<v Speaker 2>every one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1524
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.740
<v Speaker 2>what is the message that the trend is</v>
<v Speaker 2>send you?</v>

1525
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the message that they're trying</v>

1526
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:05.050
<v Speaker 2>to send you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it that this is just how the universe</v>

1527
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 2>works and that women that are way hotter</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you could ever possibly imagine?</v>

1528
00:58:08.381 --> 00:58:11.440
<v Speaker 2>We'll always wind up with gay guys and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be alone by yourself,</v>

1529
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:13.340
<v Speaker 2>jerking off on to pictures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1530
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the message?</v>

1531
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Why can't they have hard ons?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're naked and they're there and then</v>

1532
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:21.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surreality of it all comes into play</v>

1533
00:58:21.971 --> 00:58:25.630
<v Speaker 2>because you see all these 20 different</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenes like this pitch is not giving up</v>

1534
00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.010
<v Speaker 2>in every scene.</v>

1535
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:30.280
<v Speaker 2>She's super enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She seems nonjudgmental.</v>

1536
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:32.800
<v Speaker 2>This guy can't get it up and she's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything for him.</v>

1537
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:35.140
<v Speaker 2>She's posing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got her ass up in the air.</v>

1538
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:37.150
<v Speaker 2>She's lying on her back with her legs</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread,</v>

1539
00:58:37.151 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 2>sucking on her fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's letting him pick her up and he's</v>

1540
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 2>holding her by the hand and his dick</v>
<v Speaker 2>still limp.</v>

1541
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.810
<v Speaker 2>It's still limp and this bitch is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore him the whole way.</v>

1542
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:49.810
<v Speaker 2>She's like soup somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually he's going to get a hard on.</v>

1543
00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:52.540
<v Speaker 2>I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just keep posing for him until she's</v>

1544
00:58:52.541 --> 00:58:55.780
<v Speaker 2>in all these weird poses and never loses</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>

1545
00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Never has the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1546
00:58:57.101 --> 00:58:58.960
<v Speaker 2>it should be like at least the 18th or</v>
<v Speaker 2>19th posts.</v>

1547
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.310
<v Speaker 2>She should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1548
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why do you have my legs split</v>

1549
00:59:02.861 --> 00:59:06.070
<v Speaker 2>spread and you know you're laying your</v>
<v Speaker 2>limp dick on my pelvis.</v>

1550
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1551
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.450
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a drowning victim just pulled the</v>

1552
00:59:10.451 --> 00:59:12.430
<v Speaker 2>shore and it was just like slop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1553
00:59:12.431 --> 00:59:14.620
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got his limp Dick and he's laying</v>

1554
00:59:14.621 --> 00:59:16.990
<v Speaker 2>it on her pelvis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who is that for?</v>

1555
00:59:16.991 --> 00:59:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Like W W who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't want hard dicks?</v>

1556
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Like who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was there?</v>

1557
00:59:21.611 --> 00:59:23.750
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where it says why we draw the</v>

1558
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll want to get all naked and crazy</v>

1559
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:28.940
<v Speaker 2>and pretend you're fucking so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to look at a dick who was</v>

1560
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:31.580
<v Speaker 2>either hard or lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would pick hard all the time.</v>

1561
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:34.850
<v Speaker 2>If I had to look at a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>

1562
00:59:34.851 --> 00:59:38.600
<v Speaker 2>If competing off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last thing you want to do is be</v>

1563
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:42.960
<v Speaker 2>beating off to a dude with a limp Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would rather have a hard dick.</v>

1564
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Can't even imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would feel good.</v>

1565
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:49.460
<v Speaker 2>You'd feel like that the guy would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed and that it feels pointless</v>

1566
00:59:49.461 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 2>and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't feel good because he's not</v>

1567
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Speaker 2>even excited.</v>

1568
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a lot of like weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken on there.</v>

1569
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.110
<v Speaker 2>At least if the guy has an erection</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's feeling good,</v>

1570
00:59:57.111 --> 00:59:57.950
<v Speaker 2>it feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Elise,</v>

1571
00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:59.750
<v Speaker 2>she's happy that she can give him an</v>
<v Speaker 2>erection.</v>

1572
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a much more positive experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it harder for you if the tick is</v>

1573
01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:06.350
<v Speaker 2>black or white?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really relate to black decks.</v>

1574
01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.480
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always like,</v>

1575
01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I can relate to a black dick if it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

1576
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a little tiny micro white dick.</v>

1577
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have hard black Dick fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>a girl because for some reason to me</v>

1578
01:00:16.101 --> 01:00:18.000
<v Speaker 2>that's more naughtier or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1579
01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Take that big black Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1580
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1581
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you find yourself saying that as</v>

1582
01:00:22.761 --> 01:00:24.700
<v Speaker 2>you're doing the stroking moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why whisper it</v>

1583
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 2>for real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes you,</v>

1584
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 2>it makes it more naughty deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:33.150
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1586
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.900
<v Speaker 2>you're getting fucked for realsies.</v>

1587
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I remember some girls for real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some girl came to the comedy store one</v>

1588
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.810
<v Speaker 2>night and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1589
01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.780
<v Speaker 2>gave us the rules of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1590
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.820
<v Speaker 2>of being a porn star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was with,</v>

1591
01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I think she was with Ron Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was like,</v>

1592
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rule number one is don't fuck black guys</v>

1593
01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:50.270
<v Speaker 2>until they pay you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

1594
01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:52.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fuck them until they pay you.</v>

1595
01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Rule number two is no angel for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1596
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 2>You've got to keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep it to yourself.</v>

1597
01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have strategies on what you'll hold</v>

1598
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 2>back when you do a porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1599
01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a business.</v>

1600
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1602
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they strategize when to give up</v>

1603
01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:10.280
<v Speaker 2>for the black deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just right away start fucking</v>

1604
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:11.280
<v Speaker 2>black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1605
01:01:11.281 --> 01:01:11.961
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1606
01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:13.280
<v Speaker 2>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Settle into that.</v>

1607
01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:14.660
<v Speaker 2>A little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some girls,</v>

1608
01:01:14.661 --> 01:01:16.580
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Jenna Jameson never fucked a black</v>

1609
01:01:16.581 --> 01:01:16.770
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1610
01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Important.</v>

1611
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Once you go black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually considered different.</v>

1612
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Thrilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you did.</v>

1613
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why do girls,</v>

1614
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.980
<v Speaker 2>why did any girls do black guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

1615
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their career.</v>

1616
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:27.680
<v Speaker 2>Why do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1617
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:29.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1618
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I just easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1619
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:33.140
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want to fuck black guys,</v>

1620
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:33.711
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1621
01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they don't care.</v>

1622
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're there for equal rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess a lot of the porn buyers are</v>

1623
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.470
<v Speaker 2>southern and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you fuck a black line,</v>

1624
01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that stupid slut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>

1625
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:46.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a disproportionate amount of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>interracial porn sold in the deep South</v>

1626
01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.630
<v Speaker 2>said no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a whole junk about that.</v>

1627
01:01:48.631 --> 01:01:50.510
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true story.</v>

1628
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:53.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a true statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disproportionate amount.</v>

1629
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>So then it's not black guys buying him</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

1630
01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:56.450
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1631
01:01:56.450 --> 01:02:00.830
<v Speaker 2>it's scared white guys don't where</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] oh man.</v>

1632
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe what he's doing,</v>

1633
01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:03.160
<v Speaker 2>or nude or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1634
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll stop looking at me in the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop,</v>

1635
01:02:05.961 --> 01:02:09.150
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

1636
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1637
01:02:11.321 --> 01:02:13.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole black white thing,</v>

1638
01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>eventually it's going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all going to be like one</v>

1639
01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:18.680
<v Speaker 2>strange shade of gray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1640
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.680
<v Speaker 2>when Moca one something Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be Mexican.</v>

1641
01:02:21.681 --> 01:02:25.830
<v Speaker 2>We're going to imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the black white thing can't</v>

1642
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 2>last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It only lasted back when people couldn't</v>

1643
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 2>move to other places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were stuck in China and</v>

1644
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:34.200
<v Speaker 2>everybody else was in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you fed off the same gene pool</v>

1645
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:35.970
<v Speaker 2>and you produce Chinese people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1646
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:37.710
<v Speaker 2>but once the Africans got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1647
01:02:37.711 --> 01:02:40.620
<v Speaker 2>the northern Africa and Egypt and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>started getting weird and they took</v>

1648
01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:41.290
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1649
01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Cairo and then they move into other</v>
<v Speaker 2>places and then the Moore's hit Sicily</v>

1650
01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:48.330
<v Speaker 2>and then all these fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Spaniards come over on boats and</v>

1651
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 2>fuck the American Indians.</v>

1652
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.770
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually we are going to be a world</v>

1653
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see how you can keep people</v>

1654
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.530
<v Speaker 2>from interbreeding for the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>millennia.</v>

1655
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the next thousand years we're</v>

1656
01:03:01.771 --> 01:03:03.450
<v Speaker 2>all going to be one shade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1657
01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.610
<v Speaker 2>they think that's what happened when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the you,</v>

1658
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.400
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the talls got assimilated into the</v>

1659
01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to think they went extinct,</v>

1660
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.830
<v Speaker 2>but now they think they sort of went</v>
<v Speaker 2>extinct because women wouldn't fuck</v>

1661
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:16.050
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But men would fuck the women.</v>

1662
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human men would fuck neanderthal women</v>

1663
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 2>and make babies with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Nanda tall men were like,</v>

1664
01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:23.820
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1665
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just got on the outs.</v>

1666
01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't be weird.</v>

1667
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.480
<v Speaker 2>What would that one final specie look</v>
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>

1668
01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both the end of the road,</v>

1669
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.440
<v Speaker 2>once you make Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's got probably going to look</v>

1670
01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:36.240
<v Speaker 2>like aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1671
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look at the gray alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the model alien,</v>

1672
01:03:38.821 --> 01:03:41.070
<v Speaker 2>this big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big head and you know,</v>

1673
01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:44.010
<v Speaker 2>sexless body and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no muscle tone.</v>

1674
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:48.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably the next stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1675
01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:51.420
<v Speaker 2>if you look at monkeys and then you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at us and what is the difference?</v>

1676
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are our heads,</v>

1677
01:03:52.351 --> 01:03:55.980
<v Speaker 2>aren't the monkeys have smaller heads or</v>
<v Speaker 2>heads are bigger,</v>

1678
01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:58.170
<v Speaker 2>our muscles aren't as big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were softer.</v>

1679
01:03:58.171 --> 01:03:58.801
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not.</v>

1680
01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:00.540
<v Speaker 2>We last longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>

1681
01:04:00.541 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and information and all that</v>

1682
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:05.130
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but physically were far weaker than the</v>

1683
01:04:05.131 --> 01:04:06.270
<v Speaker 2>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1684
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.640
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then they're going to be more weak</v>

1685
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>than us with bigger heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're heads are going to be bigger.</v>

1686
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1687
01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:17.100
<v Speaker 2>more smooth and less muscular insinuate</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not going to need that.</v>

1688
01:04:17.101 --> 01:04:19.680
<v Speaker 2>They're never going to be in combat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>never going to be fighting for their</v>

1689
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:22.830
<v Speaker 2>life against other bodies and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take down animals to eat them.</v>

1690
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:23.790
<v Speaker 2>They're moved way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1691
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:25.080
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way past that shit.</v>

1692
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:26.780
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1693
01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.880
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human alien connection,</v>

1694
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:31.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people,</v>

1695
01:04:31.081 --> 01:04:33.780
<v Speaker 2>they believe that what they're alien</v>
<v Speaker 2>image represents,</v>

1696
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:37.380
<v Speaker 2>whether it's real or imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it represents is humans from the</v>

1697
01:04:37.381 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 2>future and that the eventual</v>
<v Speaker 2>metamorphosis of the human animal,</v>

1698
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:46.020
<v Speaker 2>the morphing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evolving will ultimately lead to</v>

1699
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:47.010
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1700
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.920
<v Speaker 2>we look at inherently all our issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1701
01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:53.460
<v Speaker 2>first of all with sexual issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have emotional issues.</v>

1702
01:04:53.461 --> 01:04:54.121
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1703
01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:56.130
<v Speaker 2>anger issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have all these things,</v>

1704
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1705
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 2>all the depictions of the aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gone completely passed all that</v>

1706
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:03.450
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You eliminate all your,</v>

1707
01:05:03.451 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>your sexual issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can reproduce,</v>

1708
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of a,</v>

1709
01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a male female environment.</v>

1710
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:11.870
<v Speaker 2>If you're able to reproduce completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1711
01:05:11.871 --> 01:05:13.650
<v Speaker 2>in laboratories or in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1712
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.930
<v Speaker 2>petri dishes or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

1713
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1714
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:19.540
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the human animal moves past</v>

1715
01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>reproduction in a natural way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1716
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 2>that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if they found out that babies were</v>

1717
01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent smarter and they live</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice as long and they were,</v>

1718
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:31.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five times more resistant to diseases.</v>

1719
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.320
<v Speaker 2>If you raise them in a test tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everybody raised them outside of the</v>

1720
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 2>womb and some new machine that someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>created,</v>

1721
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone would want that.</v>

1722
01:05:38.381 --> 01:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want your kid to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid?</v>

1723
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to carry it around</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside you.</v>

1724
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.750
<v Speaker 2>You selfish cunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the baby in the machine,</v>

1725
01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they would do.</v>

1726
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to eventually come up with</v>

1727
01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:51.310
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human body can only do so much.</v>

1728
01:05:51.311 --> 01:05:53.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human body there are already</v>

1729
01:05:53.261 --> 01:05:56.830
<v Speaker 2>figuring out artificial parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They already devised artificial hearts.</v>

1730
01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:59.890
<v Speaker 2>They've come up with artificial leaves</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make photosynthesis.</v>

1731
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have artificial wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>official electricity,</v>

1732
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's artificial trees going to be able</v>

1733
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:06.940
<v Speaker 2>to make electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1734
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:08.050
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be able to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>electricity.</v>

1735
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.550
<v Speaker 2>The solar power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it does.</v>

1736
01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Another thing that I got from</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent man that uh,</v>

1737
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:14.080
<v Speaker 2>the w the Ray Kurzwell documentary that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched,</v>

1738
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:18.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking awesome shit man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he talks about the upcoming advances</v>

1739
01:06:18.071 --> 01:06:19.890
<v Speaker 2>in solar power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solar power is going to be the Shim.</v>

1740
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.520
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be driving cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1741
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have solar powered cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the next 20,</v>

1742
01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:24.520
<v Speaker 2>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1743
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:28.330
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all eventually is moving us towards</v>

1744
01:06:28.331 --> 01:06:32.230
<v Speaker 2>the aliens man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they really might be the ideas</v>

1745
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.430
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe,</v>

1746
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe they exist or that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't exist.</v>

1747
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1748
01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:41.530
<v Speaker 2>people were really seeing flying saucers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't believe that everything that</v>

1749
01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:43.890
<v Speaker 2>people see is a government spacecraft</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1750
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:46.300
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be something from another</v>

1751
01:06:46.301 --> 01:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>dimension or something from another</v>
<v Speaker 2>world or something from some,</v>

1752
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 2>some even even Hokey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous cliche description from like</v>

1753
01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 2>a 1950 Scifi movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not discounting the possibility of</v>

1754
01:06:56.351 --> 01:06:58.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've looked at all these different</v>

1755
01:06:58.361 --> 01:07:00.600
<v Speaker 2>people that all their stories and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>their d,</v>

1756
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.100
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't jive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't jive to me.</v>

1757
01:07:03.101 --> 01:07:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an awesome bullshit detector.</v>

1758
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm currently reading this John Mac book</v>

1759
01:07:07.631 --> 01:07:11.080
<v Speaker 2>and John Mack was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a professor at Harvard who a</v>

1760
01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:13.480
<v Speaker 2>start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had started doing posts,</v>

1761
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:14.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1762
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:15.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>past life,</v>

1763
01:07:15.821 --> 01:07:18.410
<v Speaker 2>a hypnotic regression shit with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1764
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:19.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnotic regression,</v>

1765
01:07:19.871 --> 01:07:20.621
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not past life,</v>

1766
01:07:20.621 --> 01:07:23.380
<v Speaker 2>but in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their past like abduction stuff.</v>

1767
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Cause he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was dealing with all these different</v>

1768
01:07:25.721 --> 01:07:28.330
<v Speaker 2>people that had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar,</v>

1769
01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:31.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences where they were abducted,</v>

1770
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly over many times in their</v>

1771
01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:35.050
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1772
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:37.030
<v Speaker 2>But I'm looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1773
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.710
<v Speaker 2>the work and I'm reading this stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1774
01:07:38.711 --> 01:07:40.330
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so embarrassing.</v>

1775
01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like squirrely work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this guy has,</v>

1776
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:45.640
<v Speaker 2>he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's made a conclusion in his mind</v>

1777
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he's doing in his work is not</v>

1778
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 2>like he's not exploring all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>

1779
01:07:52.361 --> 01:07:54.790
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of like pushing towards this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>

1780
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the latest one that I'm reading is like,</v>

1781
01:07:57.101 --> 01:08:01.030
<v Speaker 2>it's so sloppy cause he's telling all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories about all these people and</v>

1782
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:03.280
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are depictions of their</v>

1783
01:08:03.281 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you tell me how crazy that</v>

1784
01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:08.200
<v Speaker 2>person isn't a one to 10 tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask me what do they,</v>

1785
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:11.800
<v Speaker 2>what do they think about astrology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they think about Tarot cards?</v>

1786
01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:13.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they think about crystals or</v>

1787
01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:15.410
<v Speaker 2>mind reading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they think about the loch ness</v>

1788
01:08:15.411 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>monster?</v>

1789
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to know a lot of other shit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>

1790
01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know about what their</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience was like.</v>

1791
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:22.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first when I was eight,</v>

1792
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:23.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was alone in a cabin.</v>

1793
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 2>I knew something was there with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the dark eyes in the corner of the</v>

1794
01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:29.510
<v Speaker 2>room really were yon lithium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We you crazy.</v>

1795
01:08:29.511 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Are you crazy at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was anyone else in your family crazy?</v>

1796
01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a lot of crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers out there and they tell</v>

1797
01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:39.791
<v Speaker 2>some crazy stories and all you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know about this whole Ufo abduction</v>

1798
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:43.550
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one most important point is that it</v>

1799
01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>all happens at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1800
01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:49.820
<v Speaker 2>when the fuck are you dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the fuck do you have the most</v>

1801
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 2>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre dreams?</v>

1802
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>The other night I had some crazy fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

1803
01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I was on a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading from these scrolls that</v>

1804
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.430
<v Speaker 2>the words would light up on fire as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>read them.</v>

1805
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:02.970
<v Speaker 2>So you could only read it once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1806
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 2>this is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1807
01:09:04.371 --> 01:09:06.950
<v Speaker 2>cool ass dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a fucking dream.</v>

1808
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:09.140
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really obvious to me what I woke</v>

1809
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:09.920
<v Speaker 2>up like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1810
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.720
<v Speaker 2>what a crazy ass dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1811
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:13.340
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is a dream?</v>

1812
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:17.060
<v Speaker 2>What a dream is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As your mind reaches a certain state in</v>

1813
01:09:17.061 --> 01:09:21.980
<v Speaker 2>rem sleep or rapid eye movement takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>place and all sorts of crazy chemicals,</v>

1814
01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:25.790
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic chemicals start being</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced by your body and they all pass</v>

1815
01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:29.930
<v Speaker 2>the blood brain barrier and you have all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these nutty fucking experiences and you</v>

1816
01:09:29.931 --> 01:09:32.630
<v Speaker 2>and your cousin Mikey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're on sleds and you're running</v>

1817
01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:33.530
<v Speaker 2>from God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zillow.</v>

1818
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that real sleds?</v>

1819
01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Should we investigate whether there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleds in space and whether Godzilla is</v>

1820
01:09:39.641 --> 01:09:40.390
<v Speaker 2>real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1821
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1822
01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:42.620
<v Speaker 2>You should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did this happen?</v>

1823
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sleeping.</v>

1824
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were dreaming,</v>

1825
01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1826
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:46.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

1827
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:49.790
<v Speaker 2>When were you abducted by aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I was in bed.</v>

1828
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you were dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1829
01:09:52.011 --> 01:09:53.630
<v Speaker 2>it was so real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1830
01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.060
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's write a book on how real it was.</v>

1831
01:09:56.450 --> 01:10:00.180
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta you gotta say no go real</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1832
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:01.220
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1833
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.390
<v Speaker 2>the interviews that they do with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>are so telling they're,</v>

1834
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.830
<v Speaker 2>they're really fascinating and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily that the people are stupid</v>

1835
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not even necessarily that they're,</v>

1836
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:10.670
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're lying.</v>

1837
01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Cause a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think our line,</v>

1838
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I think what a lot of them are is first</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>

1839
01:10:15.261 --> 01:10:18.770
<v Speaker 2>people live some boring ass fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty lives.</v>

1840
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 2>They're boring as fuck and if something</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens and all of a sudden that's</v>

1841
01:10:22.221 --> 01:10:24.950
<v Speaker 2>something gives your life meaning like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1842
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:28.750
<v Speaker 2>it instead of it being some sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>paralysis thing where your,</v>

1843
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:33.350
<v Speaker 2>your brain has his indogenous dump of</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic chemicals that are natural</v>

1844
01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:34.790
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the brain anyway,</v>

1845
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.430
<v Speaker 2>instead of that being the case like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1846
01:10:37.431 --> 01:10:38.030
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1847
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I've been visited and I have information</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have to give to the people of the</v>

1848
01:10:41.661 --> 01:10:42.320
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1849
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:42.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1850
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:46.040
<v Speaker 2>if you have a natural psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience or if you have a real</v>

1851
01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:49.190
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience where you take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug and you know you're planning it out</v>

1852
01:10:49.191 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 2>and either one is going to give you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar experience and that</v>

1853
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:55.490
<v Speaker 2>experience is what you're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally wrong.</v>

1854
01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to get your shit together.</v>

1855
01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:01.610
<v Speaker 2>How about an analysis of yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of life on the planet and let's</v>

1856
01:11:01.611 --> 01:11:03.260
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than the way we're looking at it</v>

1857
01:11:03.261 --> 01:11:04.790
<v Speaker 2>right now because this obviously isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

1858
01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.950
<v Speaker 2>This is the theme to every mushroom trip</v>
<v Speaker 2>to theme,</v>

1859
01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 2>to every acid trip to theme to every</v>
<v Speaker 2>time you eat a pot Brownie,</v>

1860
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>you want to reconstruct the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put it back together in a way that's</v>

1861
01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 2>rational and that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1862
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:17.140
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1863
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this experience of these people are</v>

1864
01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:19.531
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>

1865
01:11:19.531 --> 01:11:22.020

<v Speaker 2>the Djs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a radio station in Houston</v>

1949
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:41.920
<v Speaker 2>that apparently is still mad at me for</v>
<v Speaker 2>being on their radio show back in,</v>

1950
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was like fear factor days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 2002 or 2003.</v>

1951
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:47.710
<v Speaker 2>And they apparently still talk shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about me.</v>

1952
01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:51.790
<v Speaker 2>They had me on and I remember they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted me and I was probably tired and</v>

1953
01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.740
<v Speaker 2>if I came off rude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean to,</v>

1954
01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 2>but they wanted me to eat some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first of all they wanted me to eat</v>

1955
01:14:56.981 --> 01:14:58.390
<v Speaker 2>some big hamburger they had and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1956
01:14:58.391 --> 01:14:59.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no thank you.</v>

1957
01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Like I kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watch what I eat and also in the</v>

1958
01:15:02.591 --> 01:15:06.700
<v Speaker 2>morning I have hypothyroidism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I take a thyroid medication and when</v>

1959
01:15:06.701 --> 01:15:08.440
<v Speaker 2>I take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't eat anything for like an hour.</v>

1960
01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 2>And so I was on this radio show and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get me to eat this</v>

1961
01:15:11.111 --> 01:15:13.180
<v Speaker 2>stupid thing that they made an easy bake</v>
<v Speaker 2>oven.</v>

1962
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually filmed that digital people</v>

1963
01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:17.770
<v Speaker 2>are mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you still that there's still talk</v>

1964
01:15:17.771 --> 01:15:19.420
<v Speaker 2>shit about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm the worst person they've ever</v>

1965
01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:21.220
<v Speaker 2>had on their show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't even know that.</v>

1966
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know they had an issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I left.</v>

1967
01:15:23.711 --> 01:15:26.500
<v Speaker 2>And apparently they were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>me when I wasn't there when I was there.</v>

1968
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:29.350
<v Speaker 2>They were nice as pie to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I left they started</v>

1969
01:15:29.351 --> 01:15:31.000
<v Speaker 2>talking like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was so rude.</v>

1970
01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:35.740
<v Speaker 2>They had a gag and I wasn't into their</v>
<v Speaker 2>gag and I didn't know it was stupid</v>

1971
01:15:35.741 --> 01:15:36.970
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is stupid.</v>

1972
01:15:36.971 --> 01:15:38.380
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not comedians,</v>

1973
01:15:38.381 --> 01:15:39.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>

1974
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:42.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're not on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my vibe [inaudible] on my frequency.</v>

1975
01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.910
<v Speaker 2>They're on their own frequency and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it'd be fun.</v>

1976
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:46.150
<v Speaker 2>They thought it'd be cool if I played</v>
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

1977
01:15:46.151 --> 01:15:48.130
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want to eat their thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't adjust.</v>

1978
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.570
<v Speaker 2>They didn't adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I'm like,</v>

1979
01:15:49.571 --> 01:15:51.340
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>

1980
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:52.121
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1981
01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:54.430
<v Speaker 2>when you do radio stations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different kinds of</v>

1982
01:15:54.431 --> 01:15:55.180
<v Speaker 2>radio DJ's.</v>

1983
01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are really cool and easy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do and easy to do their shows and other</v>

1984
01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:02.020
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want more attention than you and</v>

1985
01:16:02.021 --> 01:16:04.450
<v Speaker 2>they're a little squirrely and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like the fact that you're on TV</v>

1986
01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:06.220
<v Speaker 2>and they're on the radio and they get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be cunty.</v>

1987
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:07.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get to be weird and they're looking</v>

1988
01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:09.490
<v Speaker 2>for something to be wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

1989
01:16:09.491 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 2>if you're coming from some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>television show and you won't eat their</v>

1990
01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:14.920
<v Speaker 2>stupid easy bake oven thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become an asshole instead of,</v>

1991
01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:16.810
<v Speaker 2>if that was me and I had a guest on</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1992
01:16:16.811 --> 01:16:17.261
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy,</v>

1993
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:18.780
<v Speaker 2>easy bake oven and he won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1994
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't what kind of an idiot am I</v>

1995
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.560
<v Speaker 2>getting this gotta eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all I have planned for this</v>

1996
01:16:23.561 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be asking him a million</v>

1997
01:16:25.421 --> 01:16:28.210
<v Speaker 2>interesting questions like we be talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all kinds of crazy stuff,</v>

1998
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:31.720
<v Speaker 2>but instead I'm pissed that he won't eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fucking tuna casserole out of a</v>

1999
01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:32.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking easy bake oven.</v>

2000
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.140
<v Speaker 2>So these people apparently are still</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset at me.</v>

2001
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you used to,</v>

2002
01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.800
<v Speaker 2>it used to have to deal with those kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people in the past.</v>

2003
01:16:38.801 --> 01:16:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>

2004
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Every show that I do now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do nothing for no press.</v>

2005
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did Preston and Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called up,</v>

2006
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:47.801
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Philly,</v>

2007
01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:49.090
<v Speaker 2>but it was after the shows are already</v>
<v Speaker 2>sold out.</v>

2008
01:16:49.091 --> 01:16:50.770
<v Speaker 2>But I did it because I like them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're cool guys.</v>

2009
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:54.550
<v Speaker 2>But like when we do these shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we have our own radio station.</v>

2010
01:16:54.551 --> 01:16:57.910
<v Speaker 2>We have our own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our own ability to promote the shows.</v>

2011
01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Probably more listeners than ever then</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to that radio station that</v>

2012
01:17:01.601 --> 01:17:02.530
<v Speaker 2>hates you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2013
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:05.950
<v Speaker 2>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all 100% your fans,</v>

2014
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.390
<v Speaker 2>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate that word.</v>

2015
01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% people who your work,</v>

2016
01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:11.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they already are enjoying what you</v>

2017
01:17:11.871 --> 01:17:12.110
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2018
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 2>They already enjoy your podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2019
01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:15.380
<v Speaker 2>they're already there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like you,</v>

2020
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:18.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they want to come to the shows as</v>

2021
01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:19.011
<v Speaker 2>opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2022
01:17:19.011 --> 01:17:22.010
<v Speaker 2>doing a radio show and trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>people out there to listen and like you.</v>

2023
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's why people like those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mediocre folks in Houston,</v>

2024
01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.410
<v Speaker 2>that's why they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2025
01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:28.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like this,</v>

2026
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:31.070
<v Speaker 2>that's why they have power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're their only power was that</v>

2027
01:17:31.071 --> 01:17:33.740
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones who get to talk on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio show when you mind would it,</v>

2028
01:17:33.741 --> 01:17:34.970
<v Speaker 2>they're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no talent.</v>

2029
01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:36.920
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just talking people.</v>

2030
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.070
<v Speaker 2>They're just dumb dumbs that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they play music.</v>

2031
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>They sorta hijack your attention span</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a few minutes while you wait for the</v>

2032
01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:44.840
<v Speaker 2>next cool song to start planning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're just sitting there and</v>

2033
01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:46.410
<v Speaker 2>reading your Wikipedia page most of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

2034
01:17:46.411 --> 01:17:50.060
<v Speaker 2>if it's still Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that to be a problem for me.</v>

2035
01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2036
01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they're still upset at</v>

2037
01:17:52.911 --> 01:17:55.040
<v Speaker 2>me because apparently this is some</v>
<v Speaker 2>recent interview.</v>

2038
01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know about,</v>

2039
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know where the station is.</v>

2040
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:01.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2041
01:18:01.131 --> 01:18:03.590
<v Speaker 2>if it's all these years and you're still</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset that I wouldn't eat your thing</v>

2042
01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 2>that's on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's on you.</v>

2043
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 2>100% I didn't do anything to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't break your window.</v>

2044
01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Didn't like your bathroom on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2045
01:18:09.081 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 2>If I just didn't eat your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on you.</v>

2046
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.850
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole world is filled with different</v>

2047
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:14.571
<v Speaker 2>kinds of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

2048
01:18:14.571 --> 01:18:18.200
<v Speaker 2>and if you try to make everybody happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will fucking go crazy.</v>

2049
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I know when I've been a douchebag and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

2050
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I know when I've done things where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have made this go smoother,</v>

2051
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I could have just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't one of those things.</v>

2052
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.740
<v Speaker 2>This is just stupidity and I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with stupidity.</v>

2053
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.340
<v Speaker 2>You're going to Texas soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you?</v>

2054
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Like August or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back to,</v>

2055
01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.910

<v Speaker 2>August.</v>

2057
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.970

<v Speaker 2>That'll be fun.</v>

2058
01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing that September again in the</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2060
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always a good time.</v>

2061
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 2>And plus now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2062
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:49.760
<v Speaker 2>it looks like I'm recording the special</v>
<v Speaker 2>in June.</v>

2063
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2064
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.210
<v Speaker 2>if that happens then um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have,</v>

2065
01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:55.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to have all new shit by the</v>

2066
01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:58.370
<v Speaker 2>time September rolls around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've got a lot of work to do.</v>

2067
01:18:58.570 --> 01:18:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exciting man.</v>

2068
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I've been writing a lot lately man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm trying to finish this book.</v>

2069
01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I've been writing like crazy man writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so fucking satisfying.</v>

2070
01:19:06.801 --> 01:19:08.630
<v Speaker 2>It might be one of my favorite things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2071
01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea that you just sit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of that computer and these ideas</v>

2072
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:15.530
<v Speaker 2>just start dancing in your head.</v>

2073
01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.710
<v Speaker 2>There's Ted dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2074
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:21.070
<v Speaker 2>they start arranging themselves on paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then sometimes like when a,</v>

2075
01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.120
<v Speaker 2>when an idea will come out and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>another idea,</v>

2076
01:19:23.121 --> 01:19:25.400
<v Speaker 2>we'll follow it and I'll like a step</v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

2077
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.560
<v Speaker 2>a step back and look and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2078
01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.860
<v Speaker 2>it's this crazy thing that just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened through me.</v>

2079
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:32.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this crazy idea that you know,</v>

2080
01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:36.730
<v Speaker 2>just happened through me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it all like puts itself onto</v>

2081
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:39.050
<v Speaker 2>paper and then the next thing you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a hundred pages and actually,</v>

2082
01:19:39.051 --> 01:19:40.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 200 pages.</v>

2083
01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2084
01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a fascinating process,</v>

2085
01:19:43.611 --> 01:19:46.010
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The creative process of actually sitting</v>

2086
01:19:46.011 --> 01:19:48.350
<v Speaker 2>down and writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing,</v>

2087
01:19:48.351 --> 01:19:49.430
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried last night,</v>

2088
01:19:49.431 --> 01:19:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I was going to write just for like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and then get in the tank.</v>

2089
01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.220
<v Speaker 2>But once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes every now and then you tap</v>

2090
01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:57.140
<v Speaker 2>into a vein and you've got to stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2091
01:19:57.170 --> 01:19:58.520
<v Speaker 2>You can't go anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2092
01:19:58.521 --> 01:20:02.270
<v Speaker 2>And I just had one idea that I needed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>write down before I went into the tank.</v>

2093
01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.390
<v Speaker 2>And as I was writing that idea down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about writing,</v>

2094
01:20:05.391 --> 01:20:07.130
<v Speaker 2>like say if you're thinking about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>

2095
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.330
<v Speaker 2>like if you're writing the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

2096
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:12.720
<v Speaker 2>it takes longer to write that word than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is to think of the concept of</v>

2097
01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it allows you to deeply consider</v>

2098
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:18.210
<v Speaker 2>everything that you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then oftentimes like when you're</v>

2099
01:20:18.211 --> 01:20:21.060
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can seem so much smarter writing than</v>

2100
01:20:21.061 --> 01:20:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I ever could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just talking.</v>

2101
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:23.610
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:20:23.710 --> 01:20:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely,</v>

2103
01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean you talk very like smart.</v>

2104
01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm wasted.</v>

2105
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm way smarter writing that I am</v>

2106
01:20:31.991 --> 01:20:36.190
<v Speaker 2>talking cause you can consider</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything much more.</v>

2107
01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a chance to look at it.</v>

2108
01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:38.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2109
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:41.080
<v Speaker 2>you really get to know someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2110
01:20:41.081 --> 01:20:42.910
<v Speaker 2>and that's another beautiful thing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this podcast.</v>

2111
01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:46.600
<v Speaker 2>You get to know someone when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to them for a long time.</v>

2112
01:20:46.601 --> 01:20:48.430
<v Speaker 2>You get to know like how their brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

2113
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:50.320
<v Speaker 2>You know like you could write things</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2114
01:20:50.321 --> 01:20:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what that was used to drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>me crazy about presidential speeches and</v>

2115
01:20:53.471 --> 01:20:55.750
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they have people writing them for</v>

2116
01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:57.550
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so fucked up.</v>

2117
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:59.000
<v Speaker 1>It's his time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2118
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Cause they have to give it like a speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every fucking day almost.</v>

2119
01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Can you just speak from the heart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:21:05.121 --> 01:21:06.290
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's probably things they have to</v>

2121
01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:08.360
<v Speaker 1>just touch on their property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like writers.</v>

2122
01:21:08.361 --> 01:21:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Like this is what you have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more of like taking your ideas and</v>

2123
01:21:11.271 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 1>making an his speech for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>

2124
01:21:12.661 --> 01:21:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean they literally have to do like</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably two or three speeches a day.</v>

2125
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:19.320
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at Obama's like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he do two or three of them?</v>

2126
01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.280
<v Speaker 1>They're always going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges are talking here with</v>

2127
01:21:22.281 --> 01:21:23.480
<v Speaker 1>representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2128
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:25.910
<v Speaker 1>they're always doing speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at his schedule,</v>

2129
01:21:25.911 --> 01:21:28.880
<v Speaker 1>like there's that one time where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed him around for a week or I</v>

2130
01:21:28.881 --> 01:21:31.820
<v Speaker 1>forget what program did it and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like his schedule is pretty much</v>

2131
01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:33.010
<v Speaker 1>from when you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2132
01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.360
<v Speaker 1>just going from one place to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving a speech,</v>

2133
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:36.860
<v Speaker 1>giving a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving a speech.</v>

2134
01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your own speech speeches,</v>

2135
01:21:40.371 --> 01:21:42.530
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he does actually.</v>

2136
01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:45.430
<v Speaker 2>And one of his most famous speeches is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that he wrote,</v>

2137
01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.650
<v Speaker 2>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones when he was running for office.</v>

2138
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:51.710
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a smart guy and he's a very good</v>

2139
01:21:51.711 --> 01:21:55.610
<v Speaker 2>speech writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the whole idea of having a speech</v>

2140
01:21:55.611 --> 01:21:59.360
<v Speaker 2>written out for you by a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's kind of offensive to me it's</v>

2141
01:21:59.361 --> 01:22:00.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

2142
01:22:00.441 --> 01:22:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Being the leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got all these people telling</v>

2143
01:22:02.301 --> 01:22:05.330
<v Speaker 2>you exactly what to say and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're following all these charts and</v>

2144
01:22:05.331 --> 01:22:08.420
<v Speaker 2>graphs and this is what the people want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so let's give them this and this is</v>

2145
01:22:08.421 --> 01:22:10.940
<v Speaker 2>sort of in the middle and we'll lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>the expectations,</v>

2146
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.710
<v Speaker 2>expectations with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll hit them.</v>

2147
01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.090
<v Speaker 2>We'll hit them with this to make them</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

2148
01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like so obvious that were being</v>

2149
01:22:16.641 --> 01:22:17.800
<v Speaker 2>played,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2150
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:19.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what drives me nuts about speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>

2151
01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:21.320
<v Speaker 2>about the idea of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was like,</v>

2152
01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.660
<v Speaker 2>they're not even trying to pretend that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not playing.</v>

2153
01:22:23.661 --> 01:22:26.300
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even try to pretend that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy wrote the shit himself.</v>

2154
01:22:26.770 --> 01:22:28.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just up there reading off a fucking</v>

2155
01:22:28.641 --> 01:22:32.630
<v Speaker 2>teleprompter and you're just going you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nothing changes.</v>

2156
01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't never do that.</v>

2157
01:22:34.571 --> 01:22:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I could never do speeches or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2158
01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:38.990
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to give speeches on</v>

2159
01:22:38.991 --> 01:22:42.140
<v Speaker 2>podcasting or speeches on something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know a lot about,</v>

2160
01:22:42.141 --> 01:22:44.810
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to give speeches on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a good video editor,</v>

2161
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.060
<v Speaker 2>you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could easily do like a seminar in</v>

2162
01:22:47.061 --> 01:22:47.990
<v Speaker 2>video editing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2163
01:22:47.991 --> 01:22:51.050
<v Speaker 2>if you ever wanted to like if people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're anti your internet videos and</v>

2164
01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you could come up with a bunch of bolts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and points of things that you need to</v>

2165
01:22:54.411 --> 01:22:55.041
<v Speaker 2>consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2166
01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brevity,</v>

2167
01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2168
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:58.670
<v Speaker 2>you want to make it under 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want this,</v>

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:03.650
<v Speaker 2>this is my best video and this is why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the good thing about this video is</v>

2171
01:23:03.651 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 2>it starts off in one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it goes back in time,</v>

2172
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:08.200
<v Speaker 3>then it brings you forward again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2173
01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 3>and then you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

2174

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could easily do something like that.</v>

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:18.960
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear that flip video is no more</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Cisco bought flipped video and they</v>

<v Speaker 3>asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they killed it.</v>

2179
01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:24.520
<v Speaker 3>I always thought for some reason flipped</v>
<v Speaker 3>video was very successful and a big</v>

2180
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:26.670
<v Speaker 3>moneymaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like everybody's got flip videos.</v>

01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Raul Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the hunter s Thompson character</v>

<v Speaker 2>not the novel is sort of based very</v>

2245
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 2>loosely</v>

2246
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.140
<v Speaker 3>on him and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2249
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:15.770
<v Speaker 3>this guy from Doonesbury just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>co-opted that character sort of stole</v>

2250
01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:18.320
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stole his intellectual property and</v>

<v Speaker 3>70% of all pornography gets washed</v>
<v Speaker 3>during nine to five hours.</v>

2333

<v Speaker 3>on average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only 12.</v>

2336
01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But 70% being,</v>

<v Speaker 3>nine to five.</v>

<v Speaker 3>struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make shit happen.</v>

2344
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:12.810
<v Speaker 3>There's too much porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at this point it's almost like</v>

2349
01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.250

<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>

2350
01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:25.230
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like about magazines,</v>

2352
01:30:26.941 --> 01:30:28.770

2353
01:30:28.771 --> 01:30:30.870
<v Speaker 3>for the back shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2354

<v Speaker 3>nowadays.</v>

2356
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:39.840
<v Speaker 3>You could just specialize on one</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular type of pornography.</v>

2357
01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be like a Weirdo foot guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2374
01:31:19.230 --> 01:31:20.320
<v Speaker 3>it was on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read it.</v>

2375
01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Of course people are doing it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

2376
01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 3>an old Kinison bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people doing it and a morticians office</v>

2377
01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.000
<v Speaker 3>and the mortuary that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2378
01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.820
<v Speaker 3>remember that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see that happening.</v>

2379
01:31:29.821 --> 01:31:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That bit is what got me into Kennison</v>

2380
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:33.240
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've told this story before,</v>

2381
01:31:33.241 --> 01:31:36.660
<v Speaker 3>but in the interest of brevity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a girl that I was working with did the</v>

2382
01:31:36.661 --> 01:31:40.170
<v Speaker 3>bit for me cause he was telling me how</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny he was and she was lying on her</v>

2383
01:31:40.171 --> 01:31:41.490
<v Speaker 3>stomach in the parking lot on it.</v>

2384
01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh you mean live keeps fucking you in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ass even after your dad never ends.</v>

2385
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.720
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2386
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:51.120
<v Speaker 3>what does this guy like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy must be the funniest guy ever.</v>

2387
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:54.390
<v Speaker 3>And then I got ahold of is a HBO special</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got a chance to see it.</v>

2388
01:31:54.391 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 3>That's what that was probably the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment when I was 19 years old,</v>

2389
01:31:58.951 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 3>but girl on her stomach</v>

2390
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.960
<v Speaker 2>and the parking lot telling me that Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the,</v>

2391
01:32:02.961 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 2>the one moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the few moments in my life were a</v>

2392
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:08.980
<v Speaker 2>spark went off in my head like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should do that.</v>

2393
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should be a fucking comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when I was 19 I had no idea</v>

2394
01:32:12.431 --> 01:32:13.750
<v Speaker 2>what the hell was going to happen in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

2395
01:32:13.751 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what what I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2396
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.290
<v Speaker 2>but I was already starting to think like</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2397
01:32:17.291 --> 01:32:19.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I have to find something.</v>

2398
01:32:19.181 --> 01:32:20.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not martial arts.</v>

2399
01:32:20.591 --> 01:32:22.030
<v Speaker 2>I have to find like something else to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2400
01:32:22.031 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe it was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking guy's on his stomach,</v>

2401
01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend to get fucked in the ass like,</v>

2402
01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>but there was nothing like that back</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

2403
01:32:28.631 --> 01:32:31.660
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think his joke was based on a true</v>

2404
01:32:31.661 --> 01:32:32.980
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in la,</v>

2405
01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:37.810
<v Speaker 2>so some people got arrested for paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morticians to spend a few hours</v>

2406
01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:40.030
<v Speaker 2>undisturbed with the freshest male</v>
<v Speaker 2>corpses.</v>

2407
01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

2408
01:32:41.970 --> 01:32:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if I was a mortician,</v>

2409
01:32:44.490 --> 01:32:49.260
<v Speaker 3>and I think if you get a hot chick that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be some times you're sitting in</v>

2410
01:32:49.261 --> 01:32:50.520
<v Speaker 3>this basement by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

2411
01:32:50.521 --> 01:32:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely going to touch this</v>
<v Speaker 3>video's online.</v>

2412
01:32:52.651 --> 01:32:54.930
<v Speaker 3>There's photos online of guys fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead bodies.</v>

2413
01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

2414
01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:59.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a voting photo online of a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this where,</v>

2415
01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's still up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was years ago.</v>

2416
01:33:01.791 --> 01:33:05.660
<v Speaker 2>This was in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early two thousands and there was a</v>

2417
01:33:05.661 --> 01:33:10.460
<v Speaker 2>whole sequence of photos from start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>finish of this woman up being on the</v>

2418
01:33:10.461 --> 01:33:12.260
<v Speaker 2>slab.</v>

2419
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:15.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know him putting his penis</v>

2420
01:33:15.711 --> 01:33:18.050
<v Speaker 2>inside of her and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>whoa dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2422
01:33:19.581 --> 01:33:23.660

<v Speaker 2>someone's daughter and someone's sister,</v>

2423
01:33:23.661 --> 01:33:26.540
<v Speaker 2>someone's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucked her and took pictures of it</v>

2424
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:29.670
<v Speaker 2>and then put it online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2425
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:34.700
<v Speaker 2>some fucking crazy shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many people who get into</v>

2426
01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:36.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what the,</v>

2427
01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:38.840
<v Speaker 2>what the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people get into being a</v>

2428
01:33:38.841 --> 01:33:41.320
<v Speaker 2>mortician or being how many of them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sex?</v>

2429
01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking around with bodies.</v>

2430
01:33:43.650 --> 01:33:44.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's very high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2431
01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm never surprised at the things I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear.</v>

2432
01:33:47.191 --> 01:33:48.960
<v Speaker 3>And I think if you were in to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead bodies,</v>

2433
01:33:48.961 --> 01:33:50.250
<v Speaker 3>that would be the number one thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2434
01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.370
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How good is the meat and the dead body</v>

2435
01:33:53.371 --> 01:33:55.020
<v Speaker 3>as it is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's,</v>

2436
01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's juicy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's here.</v>

2437
01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2438
01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:01.440
<v Speaker 3>get mowed persons rigor mortis set in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they,</v>

2439
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:05.100
<v Speaker 3>can they fix that too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They is there a way that they can have</v>

2440
01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.990
<v Speaker 3>remorse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knots in like what happens when they</v>

2441
01:34:06.991 --> 01:34:09.480
<v Speaker 3>embalm them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't they pump out all the,</v>

2442
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.210
<v Speaker 3>what is Rigor Mortis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that come from?</v>

2443
01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what it comes from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's when you die.</v>

2444
01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:15.240
<v Speaker 3>The body just difference up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think it's,</v>

2445
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:17.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it took me a squirrel off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>

2446
01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2447
01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:19.650
<v Speaker 3>you get to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a case.</v>

2448
01:34:19.650 --> 01:34:21.210
<v Speaker 3>It takes a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2449
01:34:21.230 --> 01:34:23.730
<v Speaker 3>So maybe if you get the person right</v>
<v Speaker 3>after they died,</v>

2450
01:34:23.731 --> 01:34:25.380
<v Speaker 3>they'd be still pliable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2451
01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.210
<v Speaker 3>but don't you like when you die you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>

2452
01:34:27.211 --> 01:34:29.400
<v Speaker 3>you just automatically piss and shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and all that crap.</v>

2453
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Just cleaned them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2454
01:34:30.361 --> 01:34:32.520
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to fuck a dead body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have high standards.</v>

2455
01:34:32.521 --> 01:34:36.570
<v Speaker 3>So I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of have to warm him up.</v>

2456
01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:40.290
<v Speaker 3>Maybe get some lamps are heated blanket</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let them sit in there for awhile or</v>

2457
01:34:40.291 --> 01:34:42.390
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put them in a warm tub,</v>

2458
01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:45.770
<v Speaker 3>not warm enough to cook them or how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2459
01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:49.050
<v Speaker 3>the cool thing is that you could just</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much fucking rip skin if you</v>

2460
01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to fuck that ass really hard.</v>

2461
01:34:51.031 --> 01:34:54.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just never have to worry about are</v>

2462
01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:54.954
<v Speaker 3>getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2463
01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

2464
01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could think it that way.</v>

2465
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 2>She's a gagger going right through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back of your throat.</v>

2466
01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Something about disrespecting dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

2467
01:35:07.071 --> 01:35:10.100
<v Speaker 2>It's particularly offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly unsavory.</v>

2468
01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:12.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of disrespecting someone's</v>

2469
01:35:12.651 --> 01:35:15.020
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their vessel while they're gone.</v>

2470
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:16.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so like,</v>

2471
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 2>it's so inhuman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2472
01:35:18.471 --> 01:35:20.750
<v Speaker 2>there's something about it that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very creepy,</v>

2473
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:23.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the creepiest things that an</v>

2474
01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.750
<v Speaker 2>eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating someone's body after they're</v>

2475
01:35:26.751 --> 01:35:29.420
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They had them on the radio though he</v>

2480
01:35:36.471 --> 01:35:38.340
<v Speaker 2>might be dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had a,</v>

2481
01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:43.420
<v Speaker 2>he was there playing a once from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>1970s I was in Philly and Philly has</v>

2482

<v Speaker 2>it was like the Donner party.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they were headed to the west coast and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got stuck in the mountains of</v>

2510
01:36:52.641 --> 01:36:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Colorado and they ran out of food and</v>

01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:56.960
<v Speaker 2>some people die and they ate the dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies to stay alive.</v>

2512

<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2629
01:41:43.031 --> 01:41:47.410
<v Speaker 2>it's an awesome service and I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just another avenue for us to get heard</v>

2630
01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.900
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not even getting paid for it.</v>

2631
01:41:48.901 --> 01:41:50.490
<v Speaker 2>The same thing as like stitcher and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2632
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for all of those things and the more</v>

2633
01:41:53.021 --> 01:41:55.300
<v Speaker 2>of these things that we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it,</v>

2634
01:41:55.301 --> 01:41:56.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it it like,</v>

2635
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I've never had this many people come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my shows.</v>

2636
01:41:58.811 --> 01:42:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I've never had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is obviously,</v>

2637
01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:02.160
<v Speaker 2>this is a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2638
01:42:02.161 --> 01:42:06.040
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious that there's a benefit for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me in that and the promotional aspect of</v>

2639
01:42:06.041 --> 01:42:09.040
<v Speaker 2>it and is a benefit in people that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get this free entertainment man.</v>

2640
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:10.780
<v Speaker 2>And it's a benefit for us too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2641
01:42:10.810 --> 01:42:13.360
<v Speaker 2>over the course of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that we've been doing this.</v>

2642
01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:16.140
<v Speaker 2>One of the coolest things that it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>made me appreciate it.</v>

2643
01:42:16.150 --> 01:42:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I was bummed out when I had to come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>here from Colorado.</v>

2644
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:20.161
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2645
01:42:20.161 --> 01:42:23.800
<v Speaker 2>I have this idea of raising my kids in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place where it's a little more calm,</v>

2646
01:42:23.801 --> 01:42:26.170
<v Speaker 2>there's less people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's less of the pressures of</v>

2647
01:42:26.171 --> 01:42:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2648
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:29.390
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of the bullshit materialism</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2649
01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.270
<v Speaker 2>of this area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this part of the country.</v>

2650
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:33.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a silly part of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of cool people here,</v>

2651
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a very silly part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2652
01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:37.720
<v Speaker 2>So I was bummed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2653
01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:41.470
<v Speaker 2>when the dog got eaten by the mountain</v>
<v Speaker 2>line and when Mrs Rogan got pregnant,</v>

2654
01:42:41.471 --> 01:42:42.370
<v Speaker 2>we had to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2655
01:42:42.371 --> 01:42:43.720
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it was like,</v>

2656
01:42:43.721 --> 01:42:45.010
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was gone.</v>

2657
01:42:45.011 --> 01:42:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I made it out of this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2658
01:42:46.421 --> 01:42:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had escaped and now I'm back again.</v>

2659
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:54.030
<v Speaker 2>But what really like made me appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 2>this place was this podcast and was</v>

2660
01:42:55.631 --> 01:42:57.700
<v Speaker 2>having all these cool people come over</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

2661
01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Having Ari over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having eddy over,</v>

2662
01:43:00.101 --> 01:43:01.480
<v Speaker 2>having Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we over Evan,</v>

2663
01:43:01.630 --> 01:43:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer and Russell Peters and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Green.</v>

2664
01:43:04.181 --> 01:43:04.841
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2665
01:43:04.841 --> 01:43:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I sit back and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2666
01:43:06.101 --> 01:43:08.350
<v Speaker 2>this is so much fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2667
01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:13.380
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another we have like a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>legit national radio show and not even</v>

2668
01:43:13.601 --> 01:43:18.220
<v Speaker 2>national man worldwide because we had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck load of podcast fans in Australia</v>

2669
01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.530
<v Speaker 2>that's on the other side of the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

2670
01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.420
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I asked them about the podcast,</v>

2671
01:43:22.421 --> 01:43:23.890
<v Speaker 2>they went nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

2672
01:43:23.891 --> 01:43:25.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a worldwide sort of a thing,</v>

2673
01:43:25.841 --> 01:43:26.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2674
01:43:26.861 --> 01:43:31.270
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knew when we did this that</v>

2675
01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:34.240
<v Speaker 2>it would be what it is now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knew that every week would be in</v>

2676
01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:34.751
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2677
01:43:34.751 --> 01:43:37.450
<v Speaker 2>the top five of iTunes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck we had never,</v>

2678
01:43:37.451 --> 01:43:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was completely by chance.</v>

2679
01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:45.430
<v Speaker 2>And slowly along the line it's morphed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and slowly along the line it's evolved</v>

2680
01:43:45.670 --> 01:43:47.940
<v Speaker 2>and slowly along the line it's become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2681
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:49.720
<v Speaker 2>like something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2682
01:43:49.721 --> 01:43:51.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is itself,</v>

2683
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2684
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Like now we don't think about how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2685
01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Like we came over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Brian came over here today and we</v>

2686
01:43:57.651 --> 01:44:00.500
<v Speaker 2>didn't even have to talk about when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about just normal shit like we</v>

2687
01:44:00.501 --> 01:44:02.600
<v Speaker 2>always do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is our hundredth episode.</v>

2688
01:44:02.601 --> 01:44:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Man was a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're like,</v>

2689
01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.360
<v Speaker 2>but we should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

2690
01:44:05.361 --> 01:44:06.171
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should do it together.</v>

2691
01:44:06.171 --> 01:44:06.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just sue,</v>

2692
01:44:06.831 --> 01:44:08.840
<v Speaker 2>you and me for the hundredth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that was the,</v>

2693
01:44:08.841 --> 01:44:11.750
<v Speaker 2>all the thing we had to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it is its own thing,</v>

2694
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:12.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

2695
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:17.120
<v Speaker 2>it's got its own life to it now and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that send me emails,</v>

2696
01:44:17.121 --> 01:44:20.600
<v Speaker 2>man and all the Twitter messages and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that I meet in the comedy</v>

2697
01:44:20.601 --> 01:44:23.810
<v Speaker 2>clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the fuck out of that.</v>

2698
01:44:23.811 --> 01:44:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my biggest accomplishments in my</v>

2699
01:44:28.191 --> 01:44:32.390
<v Speaker 2>career is this podcast and that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>message board and both of those things</v>

2700
01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.440
<v Speaker 2>and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2701
01:44:33.441 --> 01:44:35.190
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole Internet group,</v>

2702
01:44:35.191 --> 01:44:38.050
<v Speaker 2>but bringing all these cool people</v>
<v Speaker 2>together and the,</v>

2703
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:41.210
<v Speaker 2>the positive energy that I get from all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these people at shows and the</v>

2704
01:44:41.211 --> 01:44:44.780
<v Speaker 2>positive reactions that I get so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people coming up to me and telling me</v>

2705
01:44:44.781 --> 01:44:47.540
<v Speaker 2>that this podcast helps them think</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

2706
01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:50.600
<v Speaker 2>It changes the way they look at life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changes the way they view their</v>

2707
01:44:50.601 --> 01:44:52.790
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Change the way that you view how they</v>

2708
01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:54.740
<v Speaker 2>interact with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2709
01:44:54.741 --> 01:44:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't be happier man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't be happier that we did this</v>

2710
01:44:57.261 --> 01:44:59.290
<v Speaker 2>and this wouldn't have happened if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't give in and,</v>

2711
01:44:59.291 --> 01:45:02.420
<v Speaker 2>and come back from Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I decided to stay in Colorado,</v>

2712
01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:03.620
<v Speaker 2>we would have never have done this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2713
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.320
<v Speaker 1>What about the idea of getting like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>female sidekick?</v>

2714

01:45:27.081 --> 01:45:29.700
<v Speaker 2>this new chick and a lot of people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Rogan board didn't like her.</v>

2725

<v Speaker 1>Nothing in her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2742
01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:10.490
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be cool to have Adam</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolla on.</v>

2743
01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:12.620
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2744
01:46:12.621 --> 01:46:13.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next week.</v>

2745
01:46:13.670 --> 01:46:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Next Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2746
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your formula,</v>

2747
01:46:16.491 --> 01:46:18.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've been working with on,</v>

2748
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:20.780
<v Speaker 1>on it.com o n n I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>T.</v>

2749
01:46:20.781 --> 01:46:22.520
<v Speaker 1>A cause it's almost done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on its way.</v>

2750
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I was reading the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you read the case study?</v>

2751
01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:26.300
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty interesting.</v>

2752
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

2753
01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.270
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been taking five HTP and I've had</v>

2754
01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:33.440
<v Speaker 2>some pretty powerful results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it makes a sentences form</v>

2755
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:35.900
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's more circulation to</v>

2756
01:46:35.901 --> 01:46:37.970
<v Speaker 2>my brain or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I don't know what it is.</v>

2757
01:46:37.971 --> 01:46:41.720
<v Speaker 2>But five HTP has given me a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very tangible benefit.</v>

2758
01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:44.690
<v Speaker 2>And there's some other stuff that I took</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gave me some good benefits as well.</v>

2759
01:46:44.691 --> 01:46:48.530
<v Speaker 2>But what we did with Chris did with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>new tropic formula at school,</v>

2760
01:46:48.531 --> 01:46:50.880
<v Speaker 2>like Alpha brainwave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nootropic formula is going to call it.</v>

2761
01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:54.570
<v Speaker 2>What we did was take all of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>nootropics,</v>

2762
01:46:54.571 --> 01:46:57.990
<v Speaker 2>which are nutrients for the brain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>condensed them into a,</v>

2763
01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.170
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like two pills and it's all</v>

2764
01:47:01.171 --> 01:47:02.640
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The case studies had some really</v>

2765
01:47:02.641 --> 01:47:04.210
<v Speaker 2>positive experiences with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2766
01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:06.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all legit stuff.</v>

2767
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:10.470
<v Speaker 2>It's all stuff that people have reported</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually helps brain function.</v>

2768
01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:14.670
<v Speaker 2>We're going to combine it into one thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think nutrition and you know,</v>

2769
01:47:14.671 --> 01:47:18.420
<v Speaker 2>mental nutrition and physical nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it is one of the most underlooked</v>

2770
01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:20.600
<v Speaker 2>keys to happiness for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2771
01:47:21.230 --> 01:47:24.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have a friend that got on</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants and this motherfucker</v>

2772
01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:26.340
<v Speaker 2>eats Cheetos every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never works out.</v>

2773
01:47:26.341 --> 01:47:27.210
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo Dude,</v>

2774
01:47:27.211 --> 01:47:28.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you took care of that body,</v>

2775
01:47:28.771 --> 01:47:30.810
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you you would feel a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit better.</v>

2776
01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:31.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2777
01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2778
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you don't have an issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe needs to be corrected</v>

2779
01:47:35.401 --> 01:47:37.770
<v Speaker 2>chemically cause I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not inside your head,</v>

2780
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:40.830
<v Speaker 2>but I know for a fact my own brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't work out,</v>

2781
01:47:40.831 --> 01:47:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I would not be nearly as happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have all this extra pent up shit</v>

2782
01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:47.760
<v Speaker 2>and you got to get that out man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've got to treat this fucking</v>

2783
01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:48.240
<v Speaker 2>vehicle.</v>

2784
01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give this vehicle vitamins,</v>

2785
01:47:49.921 --> 01:47:53.010
<v Speaker 2>van.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink fresh squeezed juices every</v>

2786
01:47:53.010 --> 01:47:54.980
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every morning when I'm at home I squeeze</v>

2787
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:58.110
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get ginger and raw garlic and carrots</v>

2788
01:47:58.111 --> 01:48:02.340
<v Speaker 2>and celery and I blended all together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you feel so fucking good.</v>

2789
01:48:02.341 --> 01:48:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It's great getting all those raw</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients in your body and your body.</v>

2790
01:48:05.490 --> 01:48:07.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two people that I know,</v>

2791
01:48:07.111 --> 01:48:09.300
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of friends who are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart,</v>

2792
01:48:09.450 --> 01:48:14.450
<v Speaker 2>but they almost think that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something vain and trivial and foolish</v>

2793
01:48:14.911 --> 01:48:16.800
<v Speaker 2>about taking care of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2794
01:48:16.801 --> 01:48:18.450
<v Speaker 2>they smoked cigarettes or they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2795
01:48:18.451 --> 01:48:20.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat shitty food and you know,</v>

2796
01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.590
<v Speaker 2>and they never exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never had to take care of</v>

2797
01:48:22.591 --> 01:48:23.071
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2798
01:48:23.071 --> 01:48:25.800
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're missing out on a big chunk of</v>

2799
01:48:25.801 --> 01:48:27.480
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's annoying.</v>

2800
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:30.240
<v Speaker 2>It's annoying to have to go to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's good to learn a martial</v>

2801
01:48:30.241 --> 01:48:33.300
<v Speaker 2>art or it's good to like to pick up a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport or racquetball or something where</v>

2802
01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:35.910
<v Speaker 2>you're forced to move around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where it's fun.</v>

2803
01:48:35.911 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the whole game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But find some way,</v>

2804
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:42.110
<v Speaker 2>find some way to take care of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Bonnie fines on fucking away</v>

2805
01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take some fucking vitamins.</v>

2806
01:48:43.981 --> 01:48:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's just multivitamins and fish</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil,</v>

2807
01:48:46.441 --> 01:48:49.530
<v Speaker 2>even if it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will make a fucking difference.</v>

2808
01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:51.330
<v Speaker 2>And so many people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2809
01:48:51.331 --> 01:48:53.890
<v Speaker 2>so many people just ride it out and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hope it all was going to</v>

2810
01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:58.090
<v Speaker 3>can stay together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I switched my five HTP two Chris's</v>

2811
01:48:58.091 --> 01:49:00.590
<v Speaker 3>brand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is called Ron or rollover are,</v>

2812
01:49:00.610 --> 01:49:02.530
<v Speaker 3>can't remember which one it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the blue bottle.</v>

2813
01:49:02.590 --> 01:49:03.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2814
01:49:03.371 --> 01:49:04.330
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great to,</v>

2815
01:49:04.331 --> 01:49:07.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's 175 milligrams I think it was.</v>

2816
01:49:07.271 --> 01:49:09.210
<v Speaker 3>And you feel a difference after taking a</v>
<v Speaker 3>photo shoot?</v>

2817
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I've been taking it for over a month and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in the reservoir patrol I think are</v>

2818
01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:16.210
<v Speaker 3>two of the best things I've take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take,</v>

2819
01:49:16.211 --> 01:49:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I take fish oil in a multi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multi vitamin everyday,</v>

2820
01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:22.600
<v Speaker 3>but I think those two are the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've noticed the biggest from.</v>

2821
01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:26.080
<v Speaker 3>How much do you think cigarettes fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you owe a lot.</v>

2824
01:49:28.650 --> 01:49:30.150

<v Speaker 2>That you're poisoning yourself with</v>

<v Speaker 3>poisoned slowly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2953
01:53:55.791 --> 01:53:58.700
<v Speaker 2>at a bit of a disadvantage just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey is and that they're both roost,</v>

2956
01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a seven minute spot at live at Gotham or</v>

<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2958
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:09.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was always hard for me to,</v>

2959
01:54:09.501 --> 01:54:11.660
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first started out to clean it up</v>

2960
01:54:11.661 --> 01:54:13.630
<v Speaker 2>for like a 10 minute set or seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

2961
01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 2>seven minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our hard in the first place.</v>

2962
01:54:16.101 --> 01:54:19.250
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like just getting a joke out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like fuck you know,</v>

2963
01:54:19.251 --> 01:54:20.600
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you want to do a set,</v>

2964
01:54:20.601 --> 01:54:22.190
<v Speaker 2>you want to open up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get their,</v>

2965
01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:25.740
<v Speaker 2>get their respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some laughs and then slowly settle</v>

2966
01:54:25.741 --> 01:54:29.060
<v Speaker 2>into your view of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't do that in 10 minutes,</v>

2967
01:54:29.061 --> 01:54:31.370
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 10 minutes you got to slam him with</v>

2968
01:54:31.371 --> 01:54:33.170
<v Speaker 2>some shit and then just get the fuck out</v>

<v Speaker 2>writing things that I think certain</v>

2987
01:55:07.410 --> 01:55:10.280
<v Speaker 2>think are funny and interesting or some</v>
<v Speaker 2>link that Sony sent me.</v>

2988
01:55:10.281 --> 01:55:13.130
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm retweeting it and I want it</v>

<v Speaker 2>entertaining.</v>

01:55:14.211 --> 01:55:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure it's entertaining</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because it's a part of that whole</v>

2991
01:55:17.571 --> 01:55:18.470
<v Speaker 2>system of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2992
01:55:18.471 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 2>of promoting yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting yourself out there or being</v>

2993
01:55:21.111 --> 01:55:24.350
<v Speaker 2>of being able to work and Ari hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really embraced that.</v>

2994
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:26.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he embraced the Twitter better a little</v>

2995
01:55:26.361 --> 01:55:28.040
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He writes funny tweets every now and</v>

2996
01:55:28.041 --> 01:55:30.080
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he needs to be like real proactive</v>

2997
01:55:30.081 --> 01:55:31.530
<v Speaker 2>of like his website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2998
01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:34.940
<v Speaker 2>he's got a wife and kids and a job and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an excuse to not be doing all this</v>

2999
01:55:34.941 --> 01:55:35.774
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 2>gentlemen for that sort of an inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke on this podcast and I'm a retard.</v>

3084
01:58:55.541 --> 01:58:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I never turned my fucking phone off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is I'm always usually</v>

3085
01:58:58.361 --> 01:59:00.220
<v Speaker 2>on the phone right up until the time we</v>
<v Speaker 2>start.</v>

3086
01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:02.380
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of them and their</v>

3087
01:59:02.381 --> 01:59:03.280
<v Speaker 2>cordless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3088
01:59:03.281 --> 01:59:05.860
<v Speaker 2>so they're all floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never know where the fuck they are.</v>

3089
01:59:05.861 --> 01:59:07.720
<v Speaker 2>And I usually just pull the plug out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall.</v>

3090
01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I did it yesterday but actually plugged</v>
<v Speaker 3>it back in right before the show,</v>

3091
01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:15.070
<v Speaker 3>the show today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I had to make a call.</v>

3092
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:17.770
<v Speaker 3>You don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wouldn't either.</v>

3093
01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:20.680
<v Speaker 3>The point is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've done this for a hundred episodes</v>

3094
01:59:20.681 --> 01:59:21.970
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me some knuckles.</v>

3095
01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.330
<v Speaker 2>We'd had a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Red Band.</v>

3096
01:59:24.331 --> 01:59:26.280
<v Speaker 2>And I have uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

3097
01:59:26.281 --> 01:59:27.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than,</v>

3098
01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:29.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surpassed our expectations.</v>

3099
01:59:29.371 --> 01:59:31.740
<v Speaker 2>I never had any going into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you did either.</v>

3100
01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Never thought it would be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought this was actually going to</v>

3101
01:59:34.461 --> 01:59:36.740
<v Speaker 3>last a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought like you'd get sick of it in a</v>

3102
01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:38.210
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the craziest thing about</v>

3103
01:59:38.211 --> 01:59:39.140
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you still,</v>

3104
01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:39.961
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3105
01:59:39.961 --> 01:59:41.180
<v Speaker 3>you still do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3106
01:59:41.190 --> 01:59:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought for sure.</v>

3107
01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:43.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty good at</v>

3108
01:59:43.150 --> 01:59:44.140
<v Speaker 2>doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I get,</v>

3109
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:46.360
<v Speaker 2>once I get started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at sticking to him,</v>

3110
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:48.660
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's uh,</v>

3111
01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:52.000
<v Speaker 2>the one I realized it was crazy when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>realized like weird things was happening</v>

3112
01:59:52.150 --> 01:59:56.740
<v Speaker 2>was when I asked the crowd in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the Wilbur theater packed,</v>

3113
01:59:56.741 --> 01:59:59.590
<v Speaker 2>sold out and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many in Eddie Bravo was there?</v>

3114
01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:03.970
<v Speaker 2>And I yelled out to Eddie Cause I had my</v>
<v Speaker 2>10th planet Jiu Jitsu shirt on and I was</v>

3115
02:00:03.971 --> 02:00:05.510
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chad planted in the house and then I,</v>

3116
02:00:05.511 --> 02:00:07.330
<v Speaker 2>and I yelled out how many guys listen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast?</v>

3117
02:00:07.331 --> 02:00:11.290
<v Speaker 2>And they went fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like 90% of the crowd.</v>

3118
02:00:11.291 --> 02:00:12.071
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3119
02:00:12.071 --> 02:00:13.390
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

3120
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:15.630
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized that I'm like</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere along the route,</v>

3121
02:00:15.670 --> 02:00:18.070
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's why these crowds have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooler lately.</v>

3122
02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Like over the last like six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crowds have gotten noticeably cooler</v>

3123
02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:23.650
<v Speaker 2>and they were always cool.</v>

3124
02:00:23.650 --> 02:00:25.600
<v Speaker 2>There were always cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was always a huge percentage of</v>

3125
02:00:25.601 --> 02:00:27.250
<v Speaker 2>cool people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was always people that didn't</v>

3126
02:00:27.251 --> 02:00:29.190
<v Speaker 2>know what I was up to and they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3127
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:32.680
<v Speaker 2>the fear factor or UFC or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Kennedy wasn't in town,</v>

3128
02:00:32.681 --> 02:00:33.850
<v Speaker 2>so they wanted to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I mean.</v>

3129
02:00:33.851 --> 02:00:35.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like they don't know what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and just wander in there.</v>

3130
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:37.030
<v Speaker 2>But now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3131
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:39.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a completely changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Philly,</v>

3132
02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:41.770
<v Speaker 2>the whole crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all podcast fans because they find</v>

3133
02:00:41.771 --> 02:00:43.720
<v Speaker 2>out about the show long before everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

3134
02:00:43.930 --> 02:00:46.120
<v Speaker 2>That show was sold out a month before we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were ever there,</v>

3135
02:00:46.150 --> 02:00:46.780
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3136
02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:49.000
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's never happened to me before.</v>

3137
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:52.420
<v Speaker 2>If the best case scenario was like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time I was in Philly,</v>

3138
02:00:52.450 --> 02:00:56.290
<v Speaker 2>which is like a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sold it all out just before I got</v>

3139
02:00:56.291 --> 02:00:58.450
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this was sold out like way before</v>

3140
02:00:58.451 --> 02:00:59.320
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3141
02:00:59.321 --> 02:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
