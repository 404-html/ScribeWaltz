WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.300
Pow,
POW.
Pow.
Pow.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.660
I get so pumped up for these,
uh,
fight companion.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.060
If you've never heard one of these before.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.700
and I'll probably explain this in the introduction for the people that have to

5
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:19.500
listen to the audio version of it only,
uh,
we just watch fights and we talk shit.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.780
We may or may not discuss the actual fight itself.
Uh,
most of the time we don't,

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.060
but today it's with the Great Joe.
He motherfucking Diaz.
Thank you for having me.

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.230
Thanks for being here brother.

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.040
I'm excited and I'm excited about our show at the Cock theater tomorrow night.

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.960
Yes.
Out of all the fights on the card.
Go sign.

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.610
Yos Alvarez was the fight.
Really.
I was Mike for the whole weekend,

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.190
the whole weekend.
I didn't know when it was.
I thought it was one on the,

13
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:49.920
on the car and I didn't know what it was.
Yeah.

14
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.480
This one tonight I've been waiting for this to me is a fucking barn burner.

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.160
I'm looking forward to it for sure.

16
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.800
Cause Alvarez is a very tough and he makes every fight tough.

17
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.590
He's a tough dude and I think he's going to have a real good game plan coming
in.

18
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:04.830
I think he's going to be as prepared as you've ever going to see him.

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.890
Cause you've seen him off some hard fights in the UFC.
You know,
he had,
uh,

20
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.910
that war with cowboy Serone got got lit up,
especially his leg,

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.380
his leg kicked.
He just got introduced to the next level of MMA,

22
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.580
but coming off of a victory like that over pedes and he beat Gilbert two and a,

23
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:27.530
he,
if I had to fight through adversity in the Gilbert Melendez Phi data,

24
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.440
seriously fucked up.
I remember his eyes.
Yes,
that's right.
It's a tough,

25
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.860
he could talk dude.
You gotta you know,
you got to put him away man.

26
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.980
And that's tough to fucking do.
He says game as they get,

27
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.120
but this dude is special.
There's still San Joses special.
He's,
um,

28
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.470
he's hit a very high level over the last couple of years and he's,

29
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.440
his skill level is higher than it's ever been.

30
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.290
It's like a bunch of different things coming together.
One,
it's hot.

31
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.400
Cordero Hofeld Cordura is such a good coach.

32
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.920
The coach of kings MMA,
the one,

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.280
the original guys from shoot debox in Cotati ba Brazil.

34
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.740
Those guys were so bad ass.
I mean,
he's from such a bad ass lineage.

35
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.980
He's from the early days of Ninja and Anderson Silva and he's the guy who took

36
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:16.810
for breach over doom from a guy,
really wasn't a striker at all,

37
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.910
just a Jujitsu artists.

38
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.380
And he brought him to the heavyweight title and now you look at Fabrizio

39
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:25.710
striking,
he made a big mistake obviously in the steep meo chick fight.

40
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.770
But I think Steven Meo chicks a bad motherfucker.
If he catches you,

41
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:29.880
he catches you.
You know,

42
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:33.360
he tried to go to war with Steve pay and Steve Bay just was better at moving

43
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:37.180
away and countering them and he got careless and left some openings and it could

44
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:40.290
have been because he was in Brazil.
He was a real emotional,
you know,
who knows.

45
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.660
He fucked up and Steve Bay is a bad motherfucker.

46
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.960
So those two are a bad combination together.
But that said,

47
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.500
you look at like for doom striking against Travis Browne's.
Excellent.

48
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.260
His strike against Cain Velasquez.
Excellent,

49
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.190
excellent long snaps that jab out,
keeps you to distance,

50
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.800
throws hard kicks because he wants you to take him down.

51
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.710
How that he wants you put him on his back.
Good luck with that.

52
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.460
Good luck with the nastiest guard the heavyweight division has ever seen.

53
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.790
Arguably he's a motherfucker.
I mean Frank Mir snapped arms.

54
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.260
I mean you've got to go with like,

55
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:15.010
if you want to look at it like effective submissions in the heavyweight division

56
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.400
in MMA,
it's tough to not give the nod to frank.

57
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:23.401
Mir tapped Lesner with a knee bar snap mataros arm snapped Tim Silvia's arm.

58
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.190
Just maybe not for his overall career cause he's,

59
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.940
he's definitely had ups and downs but been in some amazing fights.

60
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:35.890
But his submission victories are fucking horrendous.
He breaks bones,
man.

61
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.570
Who the fuck else breaks bones?

62
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.860
Frank Mir is breaking bones with a armbars breaking bones with Kimora.

63
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:46.330
He poked fucking minute Toros arm snapped it in half where he was looking over

64
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:50.290
at it like holy Shit.
So it's hard not to give the nod to,

65
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.360
to Frank Mir when it comes to like overall MMA guard skill.

66
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.090
But that said,
man,

67
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:02.440
the technical ability that VRE doom has is off the charts.

68
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.360
The way he wraps you up is so neat.

69
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.280
He just tucks everything tight like that fader Armbar all my God.

70
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.640
I mean he just slapped that on him or Fado was stuck in that guard and you could

71
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:19.150
see in his eyes he was like,
Oh shit.
Like this is like the water's heavier.

72
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:23.950
I can't drink it.
Like,
oh,
I can't,
I can't get up to get where the air is.

73
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.870
Holy Shit.
It just get crushed into those legs and he's fucking huge too.

74
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:31.330
He's a giant guy.
I'm going to go legit.

75
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.220
Two 40 doesn't really have to lift much to be like two 40 he's a huge guy

76
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.580
for dooms.
No joke,
man.
So for steep immuno chick to take him out like that.
Fuck.

77
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:46.540
That was a victory.
And to do it in Brazil,
it must've been nuts,
man.

78
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.560
There was like 40,000 people or something crazy.
Ryan was a soccer stadium.
Jesus.

79
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.920
He went,
he didn't give a fuck.

80
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.670
There was zero fucks given him zero fucks given me.
Oh Jeez.
World.

81
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:01.780
There was zero fucks.
He had no idea he was in Brazil.
Well,
he's,

82
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:06.190
that dude is as live shit as they get.
His mindset is so strong.

83
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.750
He's so calm.
He's so calm.
Right before he throws down man.

84
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.530
And you know what?
More now than ever because he's been there and done that.

85
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:18.130
That war that he had with junior dos Santos,
I mean that was a fucking war.

86
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.880
Experiences a motherfucking this UFC and MMA experiences it man.

87
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.200
Yeah,
it is it.
But he's also got a lot of skill and he's getting better.

88
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.320
That's the other thing about steep by steep banks getting better.
I mean,

89
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:35.740
he's always been a motherfucker,
but he's better now than he's ever been.

90
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.140
Better mentally stronger,
more steady.

91
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.580
Like everything about it is better now.
He has,
what's his name in Cleveland?

92
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:46.660
When ouster Overeem in October.
Oh,
September.
September.

93
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.000
Something like September I think.
September in Cleveland.
Oh,

94
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:52.870
we want to go to a barn burner on com.
I don't know what the date is.

95
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.980
Let's do it a show him Friday night.
October is jacked until there's a,

96
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.890
it's too God damn popular.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I do the every other week thing,

97
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.660
but the nose,
the special,
everything is just falling,
you know,
it's just,
uh,

98
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.370
October 15th I shoot.

99
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.030
So everything is wrapped around that pretty much beautiful.

100
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.450
But Cleveland's a,
that's going to be fun.

101
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.930
And they're the people that are going to be there to support Steve Bay because

102
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.501
right now,

103
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:23.420
I mean they've got basketball and now they've got the UFC heavyweight champion.

104
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:27.110
Put the show together.
I'm open.
You're open.
I'm open.
I think.

105
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.530
I'm hoping that Saturday,
September 10th I think I'm open.

106
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.730
So the Friday the ninth would be where we do the show.
Beautiful.
Let's do it,

107
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.580
I think to find something that's a crazy fight too.

108
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:41.930
That's an interesting fight because Alistair has been fighting very smart
lately,

109
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.870
man.
He's just put it together really nicely.
And his last few fights,

110
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.680
he's still a Jackson.
Yes.

111
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:52.940
He's still a Jackson's I think part time.
Pretty sure.

112
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.810
I'm pretty sure it's still a Jackson's.
The thing about him again,
he was,

113
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:58.370
you know,
in pride and all that stuff.

114
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.630
He was the heavyweight champ of the champion and kickboxing,
you know,

115
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.720
that comes a time in your life when you put the pieces together and we're

116
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:09.500
starting to see it now.
Yup.
From Allister to Nate Diaz,

117
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.960
all these fighters that years ago they lost one,
you know,
didn't heal the,

118
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.760
who were even lose two,
he lost a clay,
Guido,
a Rafael dos Anjos broken jaw,

119
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.300
you know,
and look what he's gone on to do crazy.
And so it stay,

120
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.450
put it all together.
There's a,
it's like when a comedian gets a show,

121
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.460
you know this,
we're convenient together.

122
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:33.020
Show all the stars have to be aligned.
Right.
You know,

123
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.970
everything has to be in on everything just to get it on.
Right.
That's a complete,

124
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:39.500
everybody gets pilots every year.

125
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.830
But just to really get to that high level that you're talking about takes years.

126
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.170
You know,
maybe you maybe caught Dara when he went to court.

127
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:49.940
Darrow's Codero put it all together.

128
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.940
The jujitsu when the boxing or kickboxing put it all to it.

129
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:54.980
Definitely is a big part of,
it's a big part of it.

130
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.400
You know what else is a big part of it?
His strength and conditioning program.

131
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.820
He's one of those guys who trains under nick curse on you.

132
00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:05.390
Do you know nick curse the curse on his?
Um,

133
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.640
he's one of the students of Marvin Marinovich,

134
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.870
you know the mob rent eviction Todd Marinovich story back.
Yeah.
Yeah.

135
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.700
And Marvin Marinovich was a world famous strength and conditioning coach with

136
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:18.980
like some seriously unconventional wild ideas that were very,
very effective.

137
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.200
And um,
he trained Bj Penn for a couple of camps and I'm nick curse on his,

138
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:26.310
one of his disciples and nick curse on handles though.

139
00:08:26.311 --> 00:08:30.300
San Joe's and quite a few other guys on pro provident kickoff.

140
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.490
How'd he say his name was?
Lon providing the cough,
providing a cough.
Right.

141
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.940
I'm so high,
definitely shouldn't be doing this podcast right now,

142
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.590
providing the cough,
the Siberian rocky,
you know that guy I'm talking about.

143
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.460
He trains that guy too.
And Joe Schilling,
he's done some work with Joe.

144
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:51.530
He's a really good strength and conditioning guy and um,
cardy hero.
And,

145
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:51.920
uh,

146
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.920
the combination of like high level MMA high level and this radical strength and

147
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.880
conditioning program.
These guys do all these plyometrics.

148
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.760
It's all this box jumps.
Everything's like exploding and resting.

149
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:06.450
Everything's like very carefully monitored.
It's really interesting stuff man.

150
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.270
Do a lot of stuff with your feet.
That's one thing that uh,

151
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.380
he said that kind of blew my mind.
I was like,
yeah,
I didn't even think of that.

152
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:15.630
He goes,
I go,
what's the most important thing?

153
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:18.840
Like what do you work on a guy the most when you first started training him and

154
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:19.674
he's like their feet,

155
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.800
he's like foot strength is like one of the biggest like weaknesses that a lot of

156
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:29.100
fighters have.
Like their fetal get tired and so you don't push off,

157
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.600
you can't push off is hard.
He can't move as well.
Your,

158
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.990
your footwork starts to suck.
You can't explode in around.

159
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.380
And when you see a guy who's got like real good foot work and like this,

160
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.670
the ability to dive in and out and move very well and,
and fast,

161
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.750
you realize what a giant advantage that is.
Like,
Connor does it so well.

162
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.430
Leo Did it so well.
Wonderboy does it so well.
Oh Shit.
Joe Duffy,

163
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.140
Joe Duffy Banging on Mitch Clark.
Joe Duffy,

164
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.040
very upset coming into this fight after losing a Dustin poray.

165
00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:06.160
He's got a rear naked choke on them.
Clock taps.
Wow.

166
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:11.180
Beautiful Joe Duffys bad motherfucker.
He was a bad motherfucker.

167
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.270
But you know,
he rented to pour.
Yay.

168
00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:18.271
When poor Yay had finally figured out that one 55 was the healthy weight class

169
00:10:19.001 --> 00:10:23.230
for them.
So it was just killing himself,
making that one 45 limit.
He's a big boy.

170
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.530
You were standing next to Dustin Poirier.
He's a big dude.
He's a big dude.

171
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.260
He's a big dude to get down to 145 pounds.

172
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.850
These guys that do that man there.
Ooh,
what did he fight last?

173
00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:38.060
He looked really fucking good.
Fuck Bobby Green knocked him out.
Really good.

174
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.650
Detailed am I should say and uh,
his standup looked excellent.
Excellent,

175
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.190
excellent.

176
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.190
He's so sharp and a real fluid was combinations and all the guys that Mcgregor

177
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.900
beat up,
those first two or three guys really have turned Holloway.

178
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.870
Max Holloway is a killer.
Right?
Oh Max Holloway fire.
Right.
He's the killer.

179
00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.640
Receive as some web banging on a cage right now.
You know,
Dennis,

180
00:11:00.641 --> 00:11:04.180
he was the only one that has a show.
What happened after Mcgregor?
But yeah.

181
00:11:04.181 --> 00:11:06.760
Well Dennis Seaver,
it took a bad beating in that fight.

182
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.050
I remember watching that fight going all this is a,
it was a dentist's Seaver.

183
00:11:11.051 --> 00:11:14.540
I think that first of all,
Connor is just better than them.
Qantas faster.

184
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.960
His bigger hits hard as fuck.
He's 30 years younger.
Yeah.
And the,

185
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.560
is this the miles Seavers hat?
Some wars inside the cage.
You know,

186
00:11:23.561 --> 00:11:25.510
you'd go back and watch some,
a Seavers fights,

187
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.470
then think about the camps that he had and preparing for those fights.

188
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.680
Then think about the fucking wars did he must have had in the camps.

189
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.720
And you look at all that miles.

190
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.830
So it's like you see a guy like Conor beat a guy like Seaver and it just sort of

191
00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:42.120
confirms what you already know.
Is it Conners the truth?
You know,

192
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.090
like he is that God damn good cause it was a beating,
you know,
it was just,

193
00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:49.150
he and Seavers got an interesting style.
It's hard.

194
00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:53.920
It's hard to beat him upstanding because Seaver throws hard shots and it's got

195
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.400
that weird karate style.
One kick is like,
uh,
yeah,

196
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:01.990
but he just was not,
when I first met John and I have gray hair.
Look at him now.

197
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.460
That's when he's like,
Obama,
you do these live shows freak the fuck out.

198
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.600
I'm looking at him going,
he had no fucking gray.
Hey,

199
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:15.220
he was the young kid two years ago.
What happened?
Props.
The Jon Anik for um,

200
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.140
getting that two oh nine tattoo.
That shit's hilarious.
You know when he did,

201
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.510
he made a,

202
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.400
he fucking said something like something silly about,

203
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:28.000
uh,

204
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Nick Diaz that are Nate Diaz that if Nate Diaz won the fight with Conor,

205
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.760
he would get two oh nine tattooed on his arm.

206
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.120
Like first of all,
like you're,

207
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.690
you're probably not supposed to say that.

208
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.560
I don't think like especially about a guy that you have to commentate on.

209
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.130
And second of all,
I didn't agree with it at all.

210
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.020
Like I didn't agree with it at all.
Like stylistically,
I thought when those,

211
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.640
when they announced that match up,
I was like,
whoa.

212
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.420
Like Nate's a nightmare to people that don't know he's a nightmare.

213
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.300
If you don't know that guy's a nightmare,

214
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.150
we'll go watch that fight with Michael Johnson.

215
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:09.700
We beats up Michael Johnson standing,
you know,

216
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:13.330
go watch what he did to cowboy Cerrone's particularly in the first round.

217
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.070
Nate Diaz is a motherfucker will listen bro.
Oh Tattoos.
None.

218
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:20.740
Cause then triple you have to drink a bunk,
a bucket of or something.

219
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.680
It bucket of pests.
You'd forget about it in a couple of weeks.

220
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:27.850
He's going remember that Tattoo for the rest of that bucket of pistol lingo over

221
00:13:27.851 --> 00:13:32.050
my head all week.
But Anik is a really good guy.
He's a good,

222
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.660
he's a real nice guy.
I really liked that guy.

223
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:37.000
I think he's a really good commentator too.

224
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:40.870
He's excellent at that job that he has and that Goldberg has,

225
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:46.090
that job is hard,
man.
That's,
it seems easy because they're good at it.

226
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.540
But if you had to do it or if I had to do it,
I would fail miserably.

227
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:51.550
I did it once a long time ago.

228
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:54.340
I failed miserably as me and Phil Baroni did an episode.

229
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.420
I was just terrible at that.
The,
my job is so much easier.

230
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.240
All I have to do as the fights are happening and I have to say what I think is

231
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:02.830
happening in the fight.
That's it.

232
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
The job of the Goldberg Guy or the Anak Guy or Michael Chavela or any of those

233
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:14.090
guys that more renown.
That's a very difficult job.
We go,

234
00:14:14.091 --> 00:14:16.930
oh shit Duffy with the right hand.
Mitch is in trouble.

235
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.620
Well that dream and keep it together.
They're just a replay.

236
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.530
I was like,
what do you mean he had tapped,
didn't eat.

237
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.590
That's a beautiful angle of it.
That's a,

238
00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:35.370
that's a quick beat down Joe Duffy working with for Rasa hobbies,

239
00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:37.980
a big move to man.
That's a big move.

240
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.800
I know he had done some work with them before,
but,
um,
there's the,

241
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.880
there's like a couple of those guys,
like a Duke Roufus,
you know,
for us,

242
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.060
Matt Hume,
they just know so much for Ross's resume.

243
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.680
I want break down.
It's impressive as hell.
Yeah.

244
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:58.700
He was a kickboxer very good kickboxer and I'm nasty Jujitsu man.

245
00:14:58.701 --> 00:14:59.600
Really Good Jujitsu.

246
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.570
I've seen him demonstrate some techniques and I've talked to some people that

247
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.680
roll with him.
Legit worldclass like very,
very good on the ground.

248
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.060
Like surprisingly good.
Yeah.
And just very smart,

249
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.620
very smart,
very good at breaking down fights.
Very Analytical Mind,

250
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:18.520
but very objective,
not ego based.
And he's,
you know,

251
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.300
he's strong and everything for us is as,
as a martial artist,
I think like,

252
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.310
I think you could say the same thing about Matt Hume.

253
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.830
Both those guys are elite in everything.
Like Matt Hume was an elite MMA fighter.

254
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.800
Mulatta people don't know he plot Pat Miletich back in the day.

255
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.010
This is before pat had become the UFC champion,

256
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:40.670
but pat was like a really well respected MMA fighter.
He was a real pioneer,

257
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.410
pat military.
It was and uh,
Matt Hume took them apart.
He blasted him,

258
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.670
he blasted him with a leg kicks and I believe he caught him with a knee and

259
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:50.451
broke his nose.

260
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:54.380
And it was real weird stoppage cause it was real quick fight and pat would have

261
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:57.710
fought through it but they stopped the fight because of a broken nose.

262
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.270
So like honestly,
I mean although Matt was having his way with them,

263
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.010
I mean it was just a series of exchanges.

264
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.460
We've all seen fights turn around where one guy's winning and he's dominating

265
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:12.200
and the other guy turns around and beat some.
But,
but Matt Hume,
my point is like,

266
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:13.880
did he beat,
even though there was a kind of a,

267
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.740
I just wanted to put it like it was kind of a funky stoppage because pat would

268
00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:17.750
have definitely fought through it.

269
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.660
Like you'd have to kill pat military to get them to quit.
He's not quitting,

270
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.140
you know,
for a broken nose.
That didn't mean shit to him.

271
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:27.770
But the doctor just decided for whatever cause he knows like fucking nose go

272
00:16:27.771 --> 00:16:31.050
home does it was like four or something like you,

273
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.820
you're believing like that gushing of I'd be fainting.

274
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.910
These guys have broken noses all the time and they fight through it now.

275
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.800
They fight through it all the time.
That fucking guy.

276
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.600
When when the Alvarez had the,
I like that.
I'm going home.
Listen,

277
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.510
I'm going with my come back next week on Friday.

278
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.940
We got to go look at this fucking what the fuck?
Broken nose.

279
00:16:49.941 --> 00:16:53.480
I'm going to sit there and fight you to the death with a broken those shit.

280
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.000
Well Rory Macdonald's having a problem with his nose.

281
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.600
Apparently he broke it twice and training.
They were talking about it on a,

282
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.640
what is the ESPN shows or the uh,
Fox sports one chose e UFC tonight.

283
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.390
Is that what it is?

284
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:09.170
See tonight they were talking about the UFC tonight that he had gone through.

285
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.160
How the fuck do I not know that name?
I should probably know that.
Um,

286
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:16.250
that he had to go through a two broken noses in his camp.

287
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:21.140
So he broke his nose twice in camp preparing for that fine cause I think it was

288
00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:26.141
really fucked up by Robbie Lawler and that Robbie Lawler fight was insane.

289
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.080
I got to fix my nose.
They would put two straws or my nose match,

290
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.640
but 30 years I was looking for a strong,
now they're putting the two strokes.

291
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.060
My knows what an invention they get to keep them there forever,
for a week.

292
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.240
So I used the surgery Monday and then for a weekend,

293
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.440
two straws on my phone and then they pull the straws out and they both estrozen.

294
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.040
I had a splint in my nose.
It's interesting man because

295
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.670
<v 3>it kind of changed the shape of my nose a little bit.</v>

296
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.850
Like it made my inside.

297
00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.940
There was so much they cut out in like the the,

298
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.490
they have these things called turbinates,

299
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:04.440
you know there's things out there they get in the way too.

300
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.640
They cut those out and he said they just pulled out just giant chunks of scar

301
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:13.290
tissue that had calcified.
There was just no breathing or that stupid notes.

302
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:16.800
You're going to love it,
Joey.
Once you get it done,
all my God,

303
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.610
you're going to feel so good.
Read of your nose gets done.

304
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.930
The right side is done.
I must have to have that side would blow killed.

305
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.330
But when that shit,

306
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.240
all I could see is that Bechtel I could see is that doctor or Monday,

307
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:34.440
like the dentist when the cleaning a cavity and she's got the goggles and I'm in

308
00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:38.340
coke rocks.
They hit me in the face and fucking aluminum foils.

309
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.580
Pubic cares and God knows what else I snot a cheat rock,

310
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.470
whatever the fuck comes off that ceiling and carpets and Kat,

311
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.800
I put all that shit cause sometimes you drop a coke rock on the floor listening

312
00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:51.720
to 400 more than that.
Coke rock's going down.

313
00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:53.070
I don't give a fuck what's on the floor,

314
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.160
Dale thumbtacks led it all goes again.

315
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.910
Those you deal with it in the morning and the morning he'll come out,

316
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.500
something will be there.
Fuck ass unfucking beliefs.

317
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:06.390
Have you spilled a little bit on a hardwood floor?

318
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:10.140
Would you get down on that floor and sniff it right off for a fucking put my

319
00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:14.220
finger and whatever else stuck to my finger.
We might say it was a little coke.

320
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.110
Rockman had limped around and the sheet rock,

321
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.230
whatever else was on that finger went in my fucking nose.

322
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.520
It some water and I just held it up there to melted and whatever happened to

323
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:27.030
happen.
Oh my God.
It's just crazy.

324
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.050
That's just crazy.
And the doctor's name is doctor line,

325
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.590
l.
I.
N.
E?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know if it's a joke.

326
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.280
The doctor's fiction.
He knows his doctor line doc.
The line.

327
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.180
That's the fucking knows.
Doctor.

328
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.420
See this one of those things where it just makes you feel like we're not living

329
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:52.680
in reality.
This is it,
doctor line.
We're not.
When he gave me the reference,

330
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:57.300
I fucking died.
My family doctor,
I go,
you serious?
His name is doctor line.

331
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.720
This can't be real joy to movie.
It's a fucking day.

332
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.130
We're living in a moving this Jon Jones Shit.
Joey Diaz.

333
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.580
How disappointed.
Real disappointed.
I'm like a 10.

334
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.030
I was at 10 out of all like fight cancellation,
disappointments.

335
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.710
That was heartbreaking to call.
I could fucking night nine o'clock at night.

336
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:22.680
I found that
I found out about Jamie.

337
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.400
Jamie texted it to me and I was just heartbroken.
I don't know,

338
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.500
I just couldn't believe it.
It was like,
oh no,
I couldn't believe it.

339
00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:32.790
It's not drugs.
Um,
I don't know what it is.

340
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.550
It's not because he's been tested by the probation department.

341
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.440
Well how often they test them every two weeks.
Maybe once a month.

342
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.210
What if he was doing something that well who the fuck knows?

343
00:20:43.211 --> 00:20:46.560
So this is just speculation,
but just from what I understand,

344
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.130
I don't think they pull

345
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.730
<v 0>you off a card if you were doing pot.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

346
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.120
Like if he tested positive for marijuana this far out cause it was in June,

347
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.160
I do not think they would pull them off the card.
He tested positive once before.

348
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.700
Before for what?
Yes,
against calling me way before.

349
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:11.490
But what I'm saying is I don't think it's that,
no,
I think it's a ped.
Oh God.

350
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.590
That's what I think it is now.
What's a pee Dee?
Exactly.

351
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:19.300
Performance enhancing drug,
which could be,
he could be an accident.
It's in,

352
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:21.980
it's had been an accident many times.
Tim Means,
um,

353
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.610
it was the most recent example.
I mean he told them straight up,

354
00:21:24.611 --> 00:21:28.180
this is all I took.
They went to the fucking store,
bought it off the shelf,

355
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.230
opened it up,
tested it.
He had that shit in it.
So this is these people,

356
00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:34.030
we've said it time and time again folks.

357
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:39.010
There's people that are selling these things in vitamin stores and these muscle

358
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:43.000
building things.
And there's some people that are,
you know,

359
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:45.850
it might say that it has the ingredients on the list,

360
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:49.180
which are all things that have been shown to help build your body up.

361
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:52.420
But they throw other stuff in there too.
They just do,

362
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.460
they want their stuff to work.

363
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.210
So sometimes they make these things and they just put steroids in them.

364
00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.840
Like you could go to a fucking GNC or a vitamin Shoppe and you can go and buy

365
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:09.190
steroids like legit steroids.
Like they will make you fucking big like steroids.

366
00:22:09.191 --> 00:22:13.180
We used to keep catching them not as good as the best of the best steroids,

367
00:22:13.181 --> 00:22:16.300
but at times there were,
I've talked about it before.

368
00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:20.080
There was this stuff called Mag 10 that you could get.
It was so strong.

369
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.430
It was crazy how strong it was.
You just reject jacked.

370
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.350
There's so much of that stuff.

371
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:30.160
There's so many of those things out there and they just keep making them and

372
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:34.600
then they catch them and then they have to change the name and they come back.

373
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.440
That's how they do with those boner pills to those boner pills are filled with

374
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:43.441
like steroids and fucking Viagara like we need to do an Ana test of,

375
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:46.790
of boner pills.
We needed just like see,

376
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.700
go by whatever red bands taken and take it to a lab and just find out.
Exactly.

377
00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:54.820
You buy those over the counter,
not even over the counter.

378
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.950
It's like you buy my gas stations only.

379
00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.640
It's like regular stores aren't going to sell those rhino pills.

380
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:05.590
You have to buy them in the shittiest.
I apparently,
according to red band,

381
00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:07.510
I haven't taken them.
They destroy it.

382
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.110
They turn it into a fucking cock heating Zombie,
your,
your,

383
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:14.640
your Dick just becomes a monster.
You,
Dick,
just a,

384
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.860
something happens to it.
It just gets so hard that you can't believe it.
You're,

385
00:23:19.861 --> 00:23:22.240
you're,
you're filled with lust and passion.

386
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.480
People talk about it like they're crazed.
I'm like,
you're taking math.

387
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.880
They're taking meth mixed with my Viagra.

388
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:33.270
Like someone's dosing them up with some ridiculously high levels of speed and

389
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:39.061
probably some steroids and some math and some Viagra just I was out of,

390
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.030
they don't have to tell you what's in there.
While I was out of,

391
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.010
I was out of that him of course chocolate.
I didn't have enough

392
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.870
<v 4>chance to send the kid in the email,
get it.</v>

393
00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:51.110
So I just went to the store and I asked to get,
I just want pro,

394
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:56.170
I didn't want to spend the $94 for the way cause I didn't want to haul all that

395
00:23:56.421 --> 00:23:59.630
protein powder.
So I went through the one on Lankershim and he goes,

396
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:01.910
do you take the preworkout shit?
And I don't take my,

397
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.480
I take the fucking quadriceps.
I didn't tell him that,
but I take the,

398
00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:08.930
I take like half of the shroom tech.
I don't want to have a fucking heart attack.

399
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:11.030
I think half of those fucking shoot tax.

400
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.420
Sometimes you're in the middle of the class and you're gasping for air because

401
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:17.150
so much air is coming into you and my body can't take it.

402
00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:21.200
It's too much fucking ass sometimes.
Like you're like,
fuck this is too much.

403
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:23.240
So I just went there,
went there,
the guy goes,
take this.

404
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.320
It's like a drink before the fucking,
uh,
before you work out again.

405
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.740
I had it in the bag and I drove and I get done.
I go,
let me just try it.

406
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.370
I tried half of it.
I did the class,

407
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:37.270
but on the way home I had the wildest fucking harder.
I had to go home,

408
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:41.750
take a shower and jerk off in the fucking shower because the Harlem,
it was real.

409
00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:45.650
Momma wasn't on,
nobody was around.
I mean it was fucking evil.

410
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.240
And even after I jerked off,
it stayed hard.
Dod and the shower.
I was like,

411
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:51.620
Jesus fucking Christ.

412
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.960
I got to save this shit and drink it with Mama's around these things by hand.

413
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:59.150
The one sentence thing,
then I got scared because after I jerked off,

414
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:01.180
like an hour later,
my heart side haven't popped it.

415
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.040
Then I'll put the shit enough with this,
but I don't do anything.
Listen,

416
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.810
I've never been a proponent,
is that the word to fucking read book?

417
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.320
Because when I was shooting a movie,
once I was up on nights,

418
00:25:14.321 --> 00:25:18.230
you don't blow and I fucking drank three of those red bulls and I fell asleep.

419
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.950
So I said,
fuck it.
That's not then that shit.
That shit don't work.

420
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:24.440
I drank three of those red bulls and was not done the set.

421
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.390
So those things don't fucking work.

422
00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:31.130
So I've never been really been any energy drink.
I grew up without energy drinks.

423
00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:35.570
You'd expect me to like energy drinks.
I hate all that shit.
I don't believe it.

424
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:40.010
When I was a beginning comment,
I used to take no dogs to drive all night.

425
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.460
That was horrible.
That stuff's nasty.

426
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.930
Just when I would drink it with mountain dude really goes deep and smoke a
joint.

427
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.600
You drive all night like this,

428
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:53.420
look like that all night and then you pull over.

429
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.170
He didn't take a nap and I would take a nap at the car cause it was the winter.

430
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.060
Like in those days I had to drive,

431
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.310
I would have to do the late show as a feature and then drive back to boulder

432
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.760
overnight from Boise,
Idaho or wherever the fuck I was at billings,

433
00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:11.750
Montana.
So I would drive all night to get pick to pick up the baby.

434
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.630
In those days I'd have to do whatever the fuck I had to do.

435
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:18.320
One Night Jamie had pulled the car over and it was freezing out and left the car

436
00:26:18.321 --> 00:26:22.100
around and I fell asleep.
And when I woke up I thought I lost control of the car.

437
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:24.890
You have no idea what happens to your heart.
Oh my God.

438
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:28.810
When you fall asleep and then wake up and I had to have the right turn and I saw

439
00:26:28.811 --> 00:26:32.930
all the snow and I was like,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh.

440
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:35.060
And you grabbed the steering wheel when you put the brake on and be like,

441
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:39.670
I'm not even fucking moving.
Oh my God.
So those no dozes with mountain dew.

442
00:26:39.671 --> 00:26:44.520
It all my boy,
there you go.
Alan Gel ban just about to step

443
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:49.220
<v 0>into the octagon right now.
Yeah.
Great Dude.
Great Dude.</v>

444
00:26:49.221 --> 00:26:53.210
Very sweet.
Love.
He says hello.
He's the one,
uh,
Eddie.

445
00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.780
As long as students,
I've known that kid forever.
He's awesome.

446
00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.780
It's always been awesome.
Great guy to train with.
Super Cool.
And he's,

447
00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.690
he's been doing really well.
And you have c except the Einstein fight,
you know?

448
00:27:05.691 --> 00:27:09.950
But,
um,
uh,
that guy two men off is a beast,
man.

449
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:14.870
Albert Tumen off.
It's just so technical,
his striking.
It's just so good.

450
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:20.390
And uh,
what we gotta do that Raphael Cordeiro has,
has,
has always fucked up,

451
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.030
doesn't look like much of a fighter.
He got,

452
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:27.770
I poke last time twice and he just knocked the mother fucker out.
Baru.
Shh.

453
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.670
Oh,
didn't you know,
but I like him too.

454
00:27:31.671 --> 00:27:35.560
I like Raphael [inaudible] is a really good Jujitsu player too,
man.

455
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.170
She is Jujitsu.
No,
his kickboxing has come a long way with Cordura.
You know,
he's,

456
00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:43.010
he's kickbox is really good now.
It's excellent.
But uh,

457
00:27:43.011 --> 00:27:46.730
his Jujitsu's now he's designing,
he keeps his guard down like his hands low,

458
00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:47.970
which always sometimes,
yeah.

459
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.530
But Codero is called Dero so I trust they're up to something.

460
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.140
So it's none of my business going,
what the fuck that you know,

461
00:27:54.141 --> 00:27:58.420
his diaries of very smart guy,
very smart guy.
And uh,

462
00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.880
he's hard worker and he'll get better.
You know,
I mean,
he,
right now he's,

463
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.800
he's cracking into that top 10 realm.
You know,
he's a,

464
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:11.480
he's a very,
very good fighter.
Some brother had a setback in the,
she has a fight.

465
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.560
[inaudible] Michael Kia choked him.
But Kiyosaki,
I'm telling you,
man,

466
00:28:15.561 --> 00:28:17.990
Michael Casaa has nasty back control.

467
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.040
I watch my kids the way takes backs and the weight clamps down.

468
00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:25.010
He's got a super like,
very tight game.

469
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.520
Some guys just have a technique like you remember Cody,

470
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:31.070
Mckinsey had that fucking guillotine of death.

471
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.770
Like if Mckenzie caught you in that guillotine,
man,

472
00:28:33.771 --> 00:28:38.600
he's putting dude's asleep and you look at him,
not a physical specimen,
you know,

473
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.020
just looks like a regular dude.
He's not athletically gifted.

474
00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:45.410
He just had this one technique,
razor sharp,

475
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.690
razor sharp and for,
okay,

476
00:28:47.691 --> 00:28:51.470
it's four minutes and 50 seconds right now in round number one.

477
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.770
So that's the timestamp.
46,
45,

478
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.300
44 43 you got it.
Um,
but,
uh,

479
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.690
chaos has got that with his back mountain man.
He gets that back mount on dudes.

480
00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:04.970
That rear naked choke is a strong position for him.

481
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.630
Alan Joe Ban looking very light on his feet here.

482
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.870
Listen,
man,
once you get the elite level,

483
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:21.400
you have to be very intelligent as a fighter.
He,
there's no other way to improve.

484
00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:22.810
No higher level.
No,
no,
no,
no.

485
00:29:22.811 --> 00:29:25.170
You're not a bar brawl with no more that goes in there with,

486
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.830
I'm going to punch him in the mouth mentality.
Yeah.

487
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:31.550
You figured out how to win the war.
You train accordingly.
I mean those guys,
uh,

488
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.390
and at Jujitsu,
oh shit,

489
00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.680
they left hand Joe Ban that Jujitsu makes you so analytical when you were a high

490
00:29:38.681 --> 00:29:42.910
level black belt.
It makes you think so much differently and you know,

491
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:44.770
just growing and kicks and punches,
you know,

492
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.220
you have to think so much quickly when you roll with those high level black

493
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:51.580
belts game over.
I mean it's just a,

494
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.760
yeah,
Joe bands here in full guard.
Um,

495
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.530
I would like to see him pass.
I don't like this.
Yeah,

496
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:05.050
see and he got swept and now he's stuck in a standing gear team but only one arm

497
00:30:05.581 --> 00:30:08.880
in.
I don't ever like it when dudes lay in the guard.

498
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.580
I just think if you're on top and you're in the guard,

499
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:16.110
you should at least attempt to pass because if you can pass and get to a

500
00:30:16.111 --> 00:30:20.970
dominant position,
you,
you established that you have the better ground game.

501
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:21.690
Right.

502
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:26.690
And then you also have the opportunity to try to set some stuff up for real and

503
00:30:27.271 --> 00:30:30.720
you force someone to be completely defensive because someone in the guard is

504
00:30:30.721 --> 00:30:33.420
still partially offensive.
They can still catch you.

505
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.090
When you get a guy inside control,

506
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.020
you're almost a hundred percent offensive and he's almost a hundred percent

507
00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:43.140
defensive is only like a couple of things you could do from the bottom like with

508
00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:46.950
elbows and maybe you can catch up Kamora if the guy's not paying attention.

509
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.050
But for the most part when you're in the guard,
like look,

510
00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.360
we were talking about with Verdomme,

511
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.710
there's still guys that could fuck you up from there.
Brian Ortega,

512
00:30:55.770 --> 00:31:00.570
he will fuck you up from inside.
It's guard laying.
That dude's guard.
Good luck.

513
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.930
That guy will fuck people up in that guard.

514
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.830
I just think sometimes do to try and play it safe.

515
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.900
You know they get a guy down in there inside of his guard and they just say hi,

516
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.460
let me just throw some punches here and see what's up.

517
00:31:16.461 --> 00:31:18.230
And they just kind of cancel each other out.

518
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.350
So what you're saying is if you're in the closed God,
get the fuck out of him.

519
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:24.693
Yeah.
Don't get,

520
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.200
first of all I don't like fall into it and obviously easier said than done.

521
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:33.100
Right.
But don't choose to fall into it.
Treat it like it's a dangerous place.

522
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:38.020
Get out of there for on everybody.
Even on guys that may be the guards,

523
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:40.720
not that good.
Pretended is treat everybody the same way.

524
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:45.400
Get the fuck oh head check.
Oh that was brutal.
This dude's done.

525
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.740
If this guy survives as he is a fucking monster.
Oh elbows.

526
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.920
Oh
Wow.
This dude is gutting it out.

527
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:02.710
He has gotten it out,
man.
Come on,
let's do this shit.

528
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.450
Allah.
Muhammad is tough as he's fuck man.

529
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:11.290
He is tough as fuck cause he is.
He is not giving up at all man.

530
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.970
Giving up his back.
Don't give up your back.
Oh needed a body.

531
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:21.640
Those knees against the fence or brutality man leaves the body against the
fence.

532
00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:25.870
They were rough like when Anderson got chill son,
that one.

533
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.330
Ooh,
nice slice pass.

534
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.193
<v 1>Keep going</v>

535
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.740
<v 0>Mama guys,
a motherfucker dude to survive that.</v>

536
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.340
He's getting back up to his feet.

537
00:32:42.341 --> 00:32:46.600
Look at this shit and he rolls ban on top.

538
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.713
<v 1>Awesome.</v>

539
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.440
<v 0>Oh we went crazy with the flying punch.</v>

540
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.460
Japan's wrestling looks pretty good too,
man.

541
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:03.160
Good defense here.
But it's Muhammad guy looks very strong.
I think Joe Band,

542
00:33:03.161 --> 00:33:07.510
those guys work out with the kickboxing somewhere in north Hollywood.
Really?

543
00:33:07.511 --> 00:33:10.750
So Saxons?
Yes.
Yeah.
That school up north,

544
00:33:10.751 --> 00:33:15.190
I would think that was in Van Nuys,
Van Nuys,
wherever.
Uh,

545
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:19.660
uh,
all the was used to be.
Oh yeah,
that's cool.
There.

546
00:33:19.661 --> 00:33:23.980
I think one of the kids that goes to daycare trains without ms kid goes,

547
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.890
oh okay.
He always tells me that's what,
yeah,

548
00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:30.550
that sax on a Jim is one of the best gyms around in this,
uh,

549
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.880
in this city for uh,
for kickboxing.

550
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.480
A lot of guys out of their fight in local competitions,

551
00:33:37.481 --> 00:33:42.220
he's got guys in glory and he's got Alan and a bunch of other guys,

552
00:33:42.221 --> 00:33:44.290
but very high risk,
highly respected gym.

553
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.400
Damn Muhammad's bad motherfucker.

554
00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:49.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

555
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.071
<v 0>I do.</v>

556
00:33:50.071 --> 00:33:55.071
It's tough cause he got clanged he got lefthanded on the point of Chan.

557
00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:01.580
I mean that's a nice sort of hooking lefthand and then call anger.

558
00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.150
He got double claimed,

559
00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:08.280
he got claimed with the Shin and then climbed the punch after it Dank.

560
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.960
That's a boom,
boom.
I guy is tough as fuck.

561
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.093
<v 1>Nice.</v>

562
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:26.320
<v 0>So here's something that happens in exchange is like that sometimes when a dude</v>

563
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.420
hurt to guy and then unloads on him trying to finish them but can't finish them.

564
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.630
Now I'm not a guy like Alan because Alan is pretty experienced.

565
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:37.220
I don't think he emptied his gas tank,

566
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.960
but guys have empty their fucking gas tank trying to take a guy out and then had

567
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:46.250
to coast for the remaining second and third round.
Like some guys they,
they've,

568
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.740
they're notorious for that.
Like they open up on you and if it,

569
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:53.660
like I'm looking at Allen right now,
he looks really tired and some guys do that.

570
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:57.010
They'll open up with that first round and they think they got a guy hurt.

571
00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.520
But if the guy can survive,

572
00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:03.910
they've blown a lot of gas and a lot of adrenaline too cause they got emotional.

573
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.660
They just went crazy after Ya.
And then when it's,

574
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.110
when it doesn't happen and the guy survived and he's still there,

575
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:16.040
there's just like a mind fuck going on.
Like oh no.
Did I empty my gas tank?

576
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:21.041
Was the big guy against that Brock and Adam was born Shane motherfucking card.

577
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.430
Yeah,
for sure.
A couple of the five.

578
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.860
And I didn't understand what he was saying at first.

579
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.890
If they gassed in the first round,
your arms get tired.

580
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:35.420
I didn't understand that concept,
but I saw it a couple times and I was like,
ah,

581
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.670
well Shane was a monster dude.
I mean,

582
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:42.240
he had just ridiculous punching power and he was,
uh,

583
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.020
just far more skillful,
uh,
at the time,
at least.

584
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:51.000
Then Brock was standing when Shane was a really good striker standing up his,

585
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:55.140
uh,
his punches were short and he had mad confidence in them.

586
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.390
Like he would slug it out with anybody.

587
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.170
And one of the best examples of that when he fought Gabriel Gonzaga,

588
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.220
Gonzaga brokage snows like Gonzaga had him hurt.

589
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.160
He broke his nose and staggered them.

590
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.650
And then when Gonzaga moved in for the kill,

591
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:15.210
Shayne hit him with six inches of death.
Just this soup,

592
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:20.400
that giant cinder block and the end of is impossibly thick arms.

593
00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:25.530
And he just punched through Gonzaga his head.
It was ridiculous.
He has this,

594
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:30.510
he's like short punches that he hit Frank Mir with.
He tied up Frank Mir,

595
00:36:30.511 --> 00:36:32.220
he got him in like a collar tie or something like that.

596
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:33.780
I forget what to do or maybe over hooked him.

597
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.740
I forget what he did to control his body but then he'd just upper cut it the

598
00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:41.040
fuck out of him and it was just brutal.

599
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.780
The power and the speed and the fucking leverage of these shots.

600
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:50.100
I was like just St Shankar was one of the scariest guys have punch you maybe

601
00:36:50.101 --> 00:36:53.220
ever Shane Carmen and corks on you.

602
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.730
Like I've watched that guy knock out a lot of dudes and there's something about

603
00:36:56.731 --> 00:37:01.590
him in particular like his physical size and you know until his body started

604
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:05.550
having serious problems because of all his football career and you know,

605
00:37:05.551 --> 00:37:09.930
just years of combat sports training his,
you know,
his body was giving him real,

606
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.010
real big problems.

607
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:14.220
Now what back you feel in the octagon when your arms get like that?

608
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:19.110
They just got heavy acid fills your arms.
You'd have to talk to them obviously,

609
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:24.090
cause I've never fought in the octagon.
But like there's an ampule of boxers.

610
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.690
Yeah,
sure.
This type of training happened.

611
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:29.760
A boxers where they get all adrenaline dumps.
The adrenaline dumps are so real.

612
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.670
But there's also a thing about MMA versus boxing.

613
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.480
Five minutes is a long fucking time.

614
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:41.190
It's a long time and you can't sprint for five minutes.
No one can.

615
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:45.930
And so with a guy like Joe ban,
like did he sprint there?

616
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.820
That's the question.
Did he sprint?

617
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.400
Did he go all out and then couldn't go any further?

618
00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:53.730
And then had a minute 40 left in the round and Muhammad survives and Muhammad

619
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:57.510
feels that he feels that Joe Bam,
I had a fucked up and empty this gas tank.

620
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.590
Now he's got Jo Bang up against the cage.
Joe Bands moving around,

621
00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:06.060
he looks a little slower.
You know,
it gets,
it gets interesting because that's,

622
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.920
that's a famous quote.
Um,
I think someone else said it,

623
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:13.420
but shale,
shale son is the one that told it to me.
Um,

624
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:19.070
he said that if you try to take a guy out in the first round but don't,

625
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.330
you're most certainly lose a decision

626
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.320
or you're more likely to lose a decision.

627
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.930
Like you try to win the fight by knockout or don't win the fight at all because

628
00:38:30.931 --> 00:38:35.070
you're not going to have the gas to go three rounds.
Now,

629
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.890
is there anything you could do and your strength and conditioning program to

630
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:39.724
avoid that

631
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.730
you can recover faster with the most efficient training and get getting yourself

632
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:50.020
in the very best peak shape you can recover faster?
You know,
the question is,

633
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.190
okay,
is a guy like Alan or is this gentleman Mohammed?

634
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:57.550
Are these guys in their optimum physical shape?
Well,
you don't really know.

635
00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.330
They're there obviously in fantastic shape there obviously elite athletes,

636
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:03.800
but are they at their best?
I mean if they,

637
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.060
if he was with a mark Marinovich or someone along those lines,

638
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:09.880
I mean who knows what a guy like that could do on strength and conditioning

639
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:13.750
level.
And so then it becomes a matter of how important is the strength and

640
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:14.584
conditioning.

641
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.190
See that's where guys like Marinovich and like even nick curse on a lot of these

642
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:20.530
guys,
they differ from a lot of the pack.

643
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.320
They think it's the most important thing.
And I think he's right.

644
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.630
I think once you already learned how to fight,

645
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:31.020
then it's almost less important to do spend all the time boxing and sparring and

646
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:36.910
almost more important to do drills and do mad strength and conditioning work.

647
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.360
Cause I think you'd take less off your body,
your,

648
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:41.620
you already know how to fight me.

649
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:44.710
Alan Gel band knows how to fucking fight and this is not going to be a surprise

650
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:45.544
for him.

651
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.900
How much fight training does he need to do versus conditioning training because

652
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:52.450
if he's in the same position here in this fight,

653
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.780
but had less time in camp hitting,
you know,
uh,

654
00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.520
hitting sparring partners but more time doing plyometrics and was much fresher

655
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.390
and felt better and this round that the argument is like,

656
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:09.391
you're better off having the most fit vehicle to do combat with.

657
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.950
Like your mind already knows how to go do combat,
right?

658
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:12.761
You're gonna know how to kick.

659
00:40:12.761 --> 00:40:14.800
You already know how to punch your gonna know how to choke dudes.

660
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:16.660
You're not gonna get much better at that in six weeks.

661
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.790
But here's what you can get better.
At six weeks,

662
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.690
you could ramp your cardio up to some fucking ungodly levels.

663
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.010
So the question becomes,

664
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:29.250
should you invest all your time doing that or shooting you,

665
00:40:29.831 --> 00:40:32.140
invest your time and fight training.
And it's the great debate.

666
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.500
Now we had the discussion about Robbie Lawler,

667
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.970
the Robbie Lawler's training camps consist of wrestling and hitting the patch

668
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.340
used to use as far as now in bars.

669
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.810
I don't think it's a coincidence that the time that he's backs barring is also

670
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:49.730
the time when he went on this unbelievably successful run in the UFC and it's

671
00:40:49.731 --> 00:40:53.620
now the welterweight champ.
I don't think you can get away with not sparring.

672
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:58.990
I don't,
but some people do.
And some people think that,
uh,
you,

673
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:01.150
you don't need to spar at all.
Are you spar very little.

674
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:03.520
And most of what you do is,
I mean,
that works for them.

675
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.910
Some people think that sparring is the most important thing.

676
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Eddie Alvarez when 150 rounds to prepare for Dos Anjos and I'm sure Eddie

677
00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.290
Alvarez does everything else.
I'm sure he does strength and conditioning.

678
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:16.750
I know he does a lot of pad work.
I know he does everything.
He's an animal.

679
00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:20.560
He leaves no stone unturned.
Right.
But that's a lot of spartan,
right?

680
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.080
Some guys don't like spar much at all.

681
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:27.160
Some guys spar very little maybe spa real light spot like once a week.

682
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.540
And they saved themselves.
I mean it's,

683
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:30.550
everybody's got their own method to prepare.

684
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.140
But guys like curse on and I guess it's Marinovich is um,

685
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.380
this is there a,
there a school of thought was like for a guy like Bj,
Bj Penn,

686
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:42.440
the Marinovich took Bj Penn to its highest heights.
Like when,

687
00:41:42.441 --> 00:41:44.960
when they were training together.
Bj hated the training,

688
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.810
but God damn was the unstoppable inside the octagon.

689
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.960
That was the fiend dom beanie.
Bj Penn.

690
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.430
That was the real prodigy when Bj Penn was lightweight champion.

691
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:58.880
Like when he'd destroyed Sean Sherk when he destroyed Diego Sanchez.

692
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.400
God Damn Bj was good for this brief time.
That's,
you know,

693
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:08.410
a few funds is cardio was a suspect at all at all with them at all with them.

694
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:13.160
But the training is just unbearable.
He beat,
Bj did an interview about it.

695
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:16.490
We're just talking about it.
We couldn't even hold his baby in his arms,
man.

696
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.100
He would get home at night and he couldn't hold his baby.

697
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:21.800
His arms were too tired.
If they break you,

698
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.900
they're all about physical conditioning.

699
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.160
I mean Marinovich is a fucking mad scientist,
man.

700
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:33.140
I'm giggling because Monday was 4th of July and maybe asshole decides to go to

701
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:36.290
the Drusen.
Mr. Crane goes,
fuck it.

702
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.130
There's no teacher Dick Today.
Just seven minute rounds.
I didn't know this.

703
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:43.280
I can't hear.
I'm deaf.
I can't hear.
I hear him.

704
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:47.060
He puts the clock and you have to pick your sparring partner.
Girl picks me.

705
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.230
She fucks me up.
Right?
Cause she's about a buck tag.

706
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:53.630
This girl with a tattoo over eyebrow.

707
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:56.480
So I know I'm in for fucking dog fight with this girl.

708
00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.440
She can't pull me down and she can't move me around.
But she's taking my back,

709
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:02.870
Joe Rogan.
I'm dying and I'm huffing and puffing.

710
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:06.680
I looked up this three 50 left on the clock,
three minutes and 30 minutes left.

711
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.470
I thought I was going to fucking die.
He made us do that seven times at the end.

712
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.940
I just looked at them,
Joe and I was like,
Jesus Christ,

713
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:17.360
I don't know how you high level motherfuckers do this.
Oh yeah.
I couldn't.

714
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:19.490
I couldn't even walk there at night.
My legs were killing me,

715
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.800
but I will tell you what I've been doing over that,
Joe.

716
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.830
That's helped me a lot and it's right what you're saying,

717
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.360
that tactical fitness again,

718
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:32.390
the 30 minute class after the Jujitsu class and it's just little exercises that

719
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:37.160
you don't think much of,
but next thing you know,
Shit's pouring out of you.

720
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.790
How you're doing it with that kettle Jitsu guy.
The guy on Instagram?
No,
no,
no.

721
00:43:40.791 --> 00:43:44.510
He's my buddy Joey Alvarado.
Good guy.
He's got a good Instagram page.

722
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.970
He really wants to draw Alvarado videos have really does good kettlebell

723
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.190
exercises.
Yeah,
he really does.
At six 30 in the morning and dog,

724
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:57.160
and he's saying he's a Jujitsu player to black belt Machado.

725
00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:01.610
Black power.
There you go.
That makes sense.
Because he had real good exercises,

726
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.970
grappling for grappling for Jujitsu.

727
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:08.120
That shift starts at five 30 in the morning with him.
That's an animal man.

728
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:12.530
Five 30 kettlebells,
SixThirty Jujitsu,
then it closes down until nine.

729
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:17.510
Then they start the attack fit than they do no gate than they do drills.

730
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.470
Then they do the regular Jujitsu and there's people that stay there from nine to

731
00:44:21.471 --> 00:44:23.480
one.
Joe Rogan,
Jesus Christ.

732
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.850
This is dude.
Uh,
I'm friends with Jocko Willink.

733
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.950
He's a former navy seal and now does like,
um,

734
00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:36.840
he does like seminars for businesses and stuff like that.

735
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:40.800
Teaches them how to motivate and lead groups.

736
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:46.010
This motherfucker such a savage that every morning he takes a photo of his watch

737
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.730
when he gets up to work out.
He works out every morning at four 30,

738
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:52.530
so take hates but,

739
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:57.830
but his Instagram is filled with these pictures of his watch at four 30.

740
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.890
And you want to,
you want to see some shit that makes you feel lazy.

741
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.130
Fall that guys' Instagram every fucking day.
Four,

742
00:45:05.131 --> 00:45:10.131
four 30 all caps get after it and he's doing fucking dead lifts and squats and

743
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:15.900
fucking throwing kettle bells around and doing dibs early morning guy.
Oh No,

744
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:19.770
not at all.
As you grow weights around,
um,
sometimes I love it.

745
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.620
Well I do weird shit.
There's Jockos look at it.

746
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.210
We get his fucking Instagram page is all four 13.
Oh,

747
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:30.390
that guy is Yay trains a dean lister.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I know who that is.
Legit,

748
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.450
legit.
Top level black belt too.
I mean,

749
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:38.451
I know for a fact that he goes to war with lister and lister is one of the best

750
00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:42.290
in the fucking world.
I mean,
and he's got a podcast to that Jocko.
Jocko podcast.

751
00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:43.200
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

752
00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:47.820
I convinced him to do it after doing the podcast with him here to Allen's in

753
00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:51.660
trouble.
He's in trouble.
He's taken some hard shots here.

754
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.790
He's getting roughed up.
That upper cut there.

755
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.310
I think what we're talking about might have happened and he talks to you.

756
00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.450
You could see them on the ground.
He was tired.
Yeah,

757
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:03.930
I saw him after the first round.
Oh,
he got spinning back fist.

758
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.670
He's all right there.
They went to a decision.
I wonder who won.
Well,

759
00:46:08.671 --> 00:46:12.840
he won this round.
I think a while back to Allen was the first two.

760
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:16.140
So that guy's a tough,
tough motherfucker.
You congrats to him.

761
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.910
We even went on where?
Loose garments.
He was 12 and old going into this.

762
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.810
I don't think they really,
I get this his first UFC fight or not?

763
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.740
I don't think so.
I feel like he's had one,
but God damn,

764
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:29.820
I'm impressed with him man.

765
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.403
<v 1>Yup.</v>

766
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.440
<v 0>This is his first one.
Yeah,
cause he didn't have a picture of them.</v>

767
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.910
Didn't even have a fucking picture of him.
He's really good,
bad.
He's really good.

768
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:46.260
He's tough as shit too.
I mean he,
he got,
oh look at that right hand.

769
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:49.350
That's nice and clean.
He got clanger it in that first round man.

770
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:53.670
You can never forget that.
He got clanger twice.
He was in real trouble.

771
00:46:53.671 --> 00:46:58.350
That guy gutted through that weather the storm and started putting it on him

772
00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.870
beginning in sometime in the second round

773
00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.140
because it has nice combinations.

774
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:10.780
Sometimes I'm up at four 30 I drink a glass of water with ice in it to get

775
00:47:10.781 --> 00:47:12.640
everything going and I make it a little coffee.

776
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.760
I make an almond smoothie and it's like five 45 and I go,

777
00:47:16.761 --> 00:47:19.520
maybe I go to the six 30 Jujitsu class.
Whoa,

778
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.840
fuck you tax.

779
00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.980
Most heart attacks out between 6:00 AM and 12 bitch.
Do they?

780
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:31.390
I don't do a jumping Jack Til 12 you me not to.

781
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:35.180
And now they're saying if he asked of you older than 50 they happen between a

782
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.400
midnight.
You know between men,

783
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.640
they want you to take a baby aspirin and drink a glass of water.

784
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.400
No pissing on night.
You know,
I don't.

785
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:46.930
I go on a fucking drought after six so I could sleep fucking nine hours straight

786
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.973
without pissing.

787
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:51.370
Now they want you to drink a big glass of water at midnight before you fucking

788
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:54.220
go to bed.
Yeah.
That's not good for your sleep patterns.
No,

789
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:57.210
but that's what they said.
You need to do.
Why do you need to do that?

790
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:03.760
Check out the journal over this mad one of those things.
Yeah.

791
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:06.570
So now they're saying that a baby aspirin,
the glass,
you guess,

792
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.230
give me guess who else and Joe Ban.

793
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.283
<v 2>But</v>

794
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.660
282729282927

795
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.080
<v 0>Allen Joe Band.</v>

796
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:23.490
But he better get on his knees and thank the Lord you better get on his knees

797
00:48:23.491 --> 00:48:26.790
and thank the Lord and Satan and whoever else.
Well,

798
00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:31.200
cause he knows he was getting hit at the end and he knows he's gonna walk out

799
00:48:31.201 --> 00:48:35.550
and go,
Jesus,
I was running on ag.
Uh,
yeah,
he was in trouble.

800
00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.400
Alan Jaeger band.
Just given that dude.

801
00:48:49.401 --> 00:48:51.500
Perhaps that's what a Nice Guy Alan Jobe ban is.

802
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.040
<v 5>No,
but me coming here and taking them out like that.</v>

803
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.840
I belong in the top 10,
top 15 Joel silver.
They don't want you.
I need to topic.

804
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:05.750
Do you find that guys?

805
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.430
<v 0>Yeah,
he should have used better wording.
I mean I see what he's trying to do,</v>

806
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:11.830
but he didn't say took him out cause he didn't take that dude out.

807
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.460
Mean he heard him in the first round,

808
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.870
<v 5>number one my hand in the second round.</v>

809
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:23.760
<v 0>Clangor</v>

810
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.610
<v 5>well,
I'll put slowed down a lot.</v>

811
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.120
I couldn't really throw any left hands after that song was just kind of trying

812
00:49:30.121 --> 00:49:31.750
to survive with my right hand and my kids.

813
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.360
<v 2>What was the mentality in that boat and blowing around the rally too little too</v>

814
00:49:35.361 --> 00:49:35.730
late though.

815
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:37.590
<v 5>You don't.
My coaches led me through it with my coach and said,</v>

816
00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:40.280
give me five good minutes.
You don't need to let him just set up the kids,

817
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.640
set up everything else.

818
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.480
<v 0>So Alan Jobe and broke his hand that second round.</v>

819
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:46.790
People are listening to this probably like what happened to them?

820
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.650
Did they go away?
Sorry.

821
00:49:48.651 --> 00:49:52.270
We're listening to and that's a problem with actually no one to do it.

822
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.190
And being friends with a dude and then uh,

823
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.970
doing commentary on his fights and watching him fight.
It's like,
I just know him.

824
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.810
Such a nice dude.
So what's the earliest you could work out?
My brother,

825
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.620
I'll get up sometimes before the dawn and work out what it says.
So I don't know.

826
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.590
Sometimes I get up to pee,
right.

827
00:50:09.591 --> 00:50:12.770
It might be like five o'clock in the morning and I just as like a little mental

828
00:50:12.771 --> 00:50:13.520
exercise.

829
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.540
I said I'm just going to go work out and then just forced myself to go workout.

830
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:20.390
Don't worry for no food,
no nothing.
Straight up.
Get some water,

831
00:50:20.391 --> 00:50:21.500
bad breath going there.

832
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:26.510
And how long have you is a full or is it just to get the blood going?
It depends,

833
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.260
you know,
but it's always got to be something hard to do.
Powerful Robbie Lawler.

834
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:37.400
Usually it's,
you know,
I'll do some chin ups.
I'll do some kettlebell work.

835
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:40.640
Just do like 40 minutes,
maybe more,
maybe an hour.

836
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:44.120
And you'd go back to the bedroom to sleep.
Maybe the Hogan fucking snow.

837
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:48.950
Sometimes I stay up.
I don't know man.
Sometimes I like to go up,

838
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.150
get up early rather because,
uh,
I like to go outside,

839
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.600
like when everything's coming on,
there's something weird about like seeing,

840
00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.710
seeing people wake up,
sort of like seeing people leave the houses and seeing,

841
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.220
seeing the hustle and bustle as they're starting to get ready to go to work.

842
00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.020
You know,
you can,
you can actually kind of see it in the distance all spread out.

843
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:09.770
When you're,

844
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.320
you get up in the morning and go sit outside on your porch or something like

845
00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:16.010
that and look around.
Just something about,
uh,

846
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:20.750
it just makes you really recognized the strange cycle,

847
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.970
strange cycle that we do every night.

848
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:28.400
Sleep in her eyes and sleep and rise and get caught up in the momentum and keep

849
00:51:28.401 --> 00:51:30.040
doing the same thing over and over again.

850
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:32.900
Try and figure out what the fuck you're doing.
Well,

851
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.870
sometimes when you watch other people doing it,

852
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.140
you kind of realize it's like,
oh,
this is like a weird,

853
00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.680
we're like pattern things we have,

854
00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:46.910
we follow patterns like humans,
uh,
on a whole,

855
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:48.800
we love to follow patterns.

856
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:51.980
We follow the same patterns over and over and over and over again.

857
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.710
Same routes to work.

858
00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:00.080
Same Bullshit you're dealing with at the office.
You know,
day in,
day out,

859
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:02.990
day in,
day out.
When you watch people do it.
Like when you get up early,

860
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:06.380
if you don't have to go somewhere and you watch the city come alive,

861
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:12.170
it's like almost like you get to see the fucking work behind the curtain before

862
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:15.500
the play plays out.
So you get to see like,
oh,
this is,

863
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.180
this is weird.

864
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:22.000
<v 4>It was the last time you got up for work a week in a row.
I can fit back.
Yeah.</v>

865
00:52:22.001 --> 00:52:26.920
That was the last time I had a job.
Job,
job,
job.
I hated those homes.
You know?

866
00:52:26.921 --> 00:52:30.790
I came from a home boy.
The mornings would,
there wasn't much action.

867
00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.990
I got up,
I made my own fucking cereal.
I took a shower,

868
00:52:35.991 --> 00:52:39.880
I dress myself on the way out.
I said,
mom,
see you later.
That's it.

869
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:43.420
But then you went to people's homes who it was heavy duty.

870
00:52:43.421 --> 00:52:46.810
They were going to work and I would sit there and go,
fuck this shit.

871
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.710
I hate that action in the morning that where's my toothbrush?

872
00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.830
Where's my fucking shirt?
You know,
for people yelling,

873
00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.630
everybody get out of the fucking back and you're go to the bathroom.

874
00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:01.440
Smells like 10 shifts.
You know?
You're like,
fuck this,
you know.

875
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:04.150
So I swore to God if I ever had a family,

876
00:53:04.151 --> 00:53:07.450
I don't want that early morning fucking riff Raff.
Yeah.
I like,

877
00:53:07.451 --> 00:53:10.300
she's got riff Raff in the morning and this drama with her in the morning,

878
00:53:10.301 --> 00:53:14.050
but not really.
She's three and a half now.
She wakes up,
she puts the TV on,

879
00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:17.250
she gets her own truck with milk.
I get up.
I don't give it.

880
00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:18.300
Why you gotta make it fun?

881
00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:21.400
I got to shake it with it through the whole fucking thing.
But besides that,

882
00:53:21.401 --> 00:53:23.950
she leaves me the fuck alone.
There's no drama.

883
00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.400
I don't like that early morning drama.

884
00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.170
<v 3>Right.
Once I hit life.
Okay,</v>

885
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:29.680
that's drowning because I don't want to know what you're saying.

886
00:53:29.681 --> 00:53:33.910
My house running out the door.
I don't want that shit.
Fuck it.
Yeah.
I checked.

887
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.770
People relax.
I walk up.
I liked that slow.

888
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:42.170
Yeah.
I go to,
it's really weird.

889
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.610
I appreciate the fives in the mornings.
I appreciate the six in the mornings.

890
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.130
I love going outside and smoking and watching and,

891
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.600
but I also appreciate two in the morning.
Sometimes I get back to the valley.

892
00:53:53.601 --> 00:53:56.300
I just sit on my balcony and look out and I go,
Jesus Christ,

893
00:53:56.301 --> 00:54:00.800
it's a fucking nothing.
That's it.
We're in space.
Yeah,
this is it.

894
00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.400
I'm in space.
It's me and that fucking mood and those three stars around it.

895
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:09.020
I think you need a little place where you can go.
Occasionally.

896
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:14.090
We don't hear anybody.
Nobody's talking.
We can just look up,

897
00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:17.540
just look up by herself.
I think we all need that.

898
00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:21.350
We missed that and that's a really interesting

899
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:27.860
aspect of civil as ancient that as we become more and more dependent upon

900
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:31.860
technology,
more and more into lights,

901
00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:36.510
we were less and less aware of the fact that we're in space.
It's a lot.

902
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:37.830
It's all happening together.

903
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:43.430
It's like the technology that's going to take people past where we are now to

904
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:48.360
some strange new world and the next decade or a hundred years or whenever the

905
00:54:48.361 --> 00:54:52.690
next fucking crazy invention comes out.
You know,

906
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:57.670
I like getting up at five,
but I don't turn the TV on.
I don't check Twitter.

907
00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:01.510
That's good.
That's good.
I look,

908
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:06.560
I charge my phone in the living room and I look at it to see if somebody called

909
00:55:06.561 --> 00:55:09.490
with an emergency.
Unless I see ms call Miss [inaudible].

910
00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:13.390
I put the phone down for two hours.
I don't do Dick in the morning.

911
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.580
I have a notebook in front of me.
I drink coffee.

912
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.570
After about 30 minutes I go smoke some pot and really kick it up and maybe even

913
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:23.710
nicotine gum and get the party really started.
I was,

914
00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:28.150
I just drained.
What's in your coconut?
Maybe the,
I think about the night before.

915
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.130
I didn't tape that set last night,

916
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:34.420
but I said one thing onstage that I liked and I'll write that down.

917
00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:35.620
I have a page of just shit.

918
00:55:35.621 --> 00:55:39.700
I sat on stage and I before then it's got to going anywhere and you liked the

919
00:55:39.701 --> 00:55:43.240
nicotine gum,
gives you a little stimulant is up in the morning with coffee.

920
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:47.110
Look at this guy.
He keeps losing more and more weight.

921
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:52.240
Was he fighting that one on one 45 and he's fighting on Saturday so he's in the

922
00:55:52.241 --> 00:55:56.540
weight cutting already.
She's dehydrated there.
You could fucking towel.

923
00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:02.920
She's five 45 I think he's fighting 45 wait a minute.

924
00:56:03.221 --> 00:56:07.480
Who's he fighting this weekend?
Jim Miller.
No,
I think he's felt 50 fellows.

925
00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.180
Five talking about me.
Oh,
that's right.
Miller's fighting go on me.

926
00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.070
That's the best.

927
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:19.240
Best under the under the under card of all fucking time I think to Django was

928
00:56:19.241 --> 00:56:23.460
fighting 55 I think 45 was too much for him.
Yeah.

929
00:56:23.461 --> 00:56:24.450
He looks 45

930
00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:25.283
<v 4>right now.</v>

931
00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:27.540
<v 1>I'm 55</v>

932
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:28.380
<v 3>yeah,</v>

933
00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:33.380
one 55 but he's the kind of guy that even at 55 is going to cut weight.

934
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:37.060
He's going to get a little bigger and dropped down.
Who was he fighting again?

935
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.960
Joe Loans on.
That's right.
I was going to be a while.
That's fine.

936
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:44.590
Joe Lozan has been some Goddamn wars over the last few years.

937
00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:51.210
What was it that look at that early prelim.
Tremendous sell.
That's incredible.

938
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:54.490
That's an incredible deal.
He's still supposed to fight someone.
Yup.

939
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.240
Any idea who it could be?
Do you think?
I'm going to tell you,

940
00:56:57.241 --> 00:57:01.090
you know you were fucking reporter.
I don't know what

941
00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:07.080
fucking fights his shit.
He can't fight twice in,
I know a few things.

942
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:09.830
I know a few things,
but I can't talk about them.

943
00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.600
I know a few things about other things.

944
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:17.970
I know some things I can say nothing if you don't know nothing.

945
00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:21.060
I don't know.
I don't see nothing.
I tell you what,

946
00:57:21.061 --> 00:57:25.930
this Jon Jones thing like literally broke my heart.
I mean,
when you say,

947
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.450
when you said it to me,
it was like a distant relative.
Died.
Not like a close one,

948
00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:35.750
but like,
oh,
aunt sue,
fuck.
I remember her like a,

949
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.760
like a relative that haven't seen since I was 15.

950
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:42.900
Choose different substances that whatever.
And they're not just one substance to,

951
00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.920
oh yeah,
that's what you're reading.
Which,
which website?
Um,

952
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:51.200
where I lost that car that might pull it off.
I,

953
00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.580
how would I have left up is what he said about it.
And it was like,
oh,

954
00:57:53.581 --> 00:57:56.640
substance he couldn't pronounce.
Okay.
But I haven't,

955
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:03.050
well that's not entirely what I hear.

956
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.960
I can pronounce both of the substances that I heard.

957
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.700
<v 4>Jamie,
how many do you want?
Let's see.
What are you doing now?</v>

958
00:58:11.701 --> 00:58:12.990
All these stars at death

959
00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.140
number 200 Jesus career.

960
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:20.180
How many you want to just chill in this?

961
00:58:20.181 --> 00:58:22.480
You just say 200 years through two of when your mouth,

962
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:27.010
you all to get the party's car.
Oh my God.

963
00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:32.570
How are you doing that?
How can you do that?
How has your body hold up?

964
00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:37.280
I'm a savage this and CBD oil.
I got the glue that keeps the bones together.

965
00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.880
You know what I'm saying?
This is a must.
Your inflammation level must be zero.

966
00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:45.460
If pot is anti-inflammatory,
let's apparently it is your inflammation level.

967
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:49.850
Does she think the oil,
I'm getting this 51% this honey off.
Wow.

968
00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:52.400
Let me tell you some three,
four drops in the morning.

969
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:54.200
I do it after the almond shake.

970
00:58:54.201 --> 00:58:57.530
I let the almond shake leave my mouth when I put that thing on that hold it for

971
00:58:57.531 --> 00:59:02.300
60 seconds.
There's times I go home,
I'm going to hold fat.
Fuck man.
I go home.

972
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:06.510
I sparked two times.
I'm done.
I go home.
I could feel my legs that fucking,

973
00:59:06.511 --> 00:59:07.700
they feel like they're swollen.

974
00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:13.670
I do a Tylenol instead of fame and I do three or four of those drops baby,

975
00:59:13.671 --> 00:59:16.910
and the next day I'm ready to rock again.
Wow.
You know,

976
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:20.690
I don't know exactly what the CBD oil,
every time I look up benefits,

977
00:59:20.691 --> 00:59:21.770
they tell one more.

978
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:24.770
<v 3>You read now and it prevents dementia.
You know,</v>

979
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:28.070
you read all these fucking things.
They'd been hiding this shit.

980
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:30.920
David Hyde and this shift from America,
man.

981
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:34.190
Well it's be because pot's been illegal.

982
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.040
They haven't been able to give people CBD oil.

983
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.320
And you mean it has low levels of THC?

984
00:59:39.321 --> 00:59:42.040
You'll test positive for THC with a lot of it.
No,

985
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:45.530
but now it's legal in 50 states and you could smell it so it's got an OT.

986
00:59:45.531 --> 00:59:47.540
The only reason why that's going on is because they take,

987
00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:51.410
you don't catch positiveness saying,
well,
they must be way better at it now.
Yeah,

988
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:55.340
no,
now they're really getting it down.
But he was,
it's an element of marijuana.

989
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:58.220
I mean,
absolutely.
It's got to be.
Yeah.

990
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.910
They can make strains that are higher in CBD oil.
I mean,

991
01:00:01.911 --> 01:00:05.540
maybe they figured out a way to extract CBD oil a hundred percent pure where

992
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:10.370
there's no residue of THC and then they add a little THC to it because

993
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.770
counterbalanced with the THC,

994
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:17.170
that's what gets everything that's a worse on those tumors that come to,

995
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:22.310
you know,
so that CBD oil is supposed to be amazing for inflammation though.

996
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.650
Yeah.
That's um,

997
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:29.030
that's a real unfortunate thing that they did that they kept us illegal for so

998
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:30.290
long.
It's just,

999
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:34.790
it helped a few people profit and it fucked a lot of people over.

1000
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.520
It fucked a lot of people over.
Not just,

1001
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.280
not just because people got locked up in jail,

1002
01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:42.960
but because people got the wrong impression of an awesome plant.

1003
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:47.870
The really crazy thing was that I was never familiar with holistic medicine

1004
01:00:47.871 --> 01:00:51.290
until I moved to boulder and I thought these people were fucking quacks.

1005
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:52.780
Like they talked to me like God,

1006
01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:59.510
but then you start paying attention to them.
They do a touch here,
touch there.

1007
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.090
They'd tell you to eat something and you're like,
wait a second,

1008
01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:05.540
I don't have that fucking pain no more.
What'd you do?
You know,

1009
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:08.690
like what the fuck did you do?
You know,
boulder was,
is the home of that stuff,

1010
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.460
right?
It's the home of that stuff.

1011
01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:13.340
It's where it breeds out to the rest of the country.
You believe in that stuff.

1012
01:01:13.341 --> 01:01:16.580
He believed people have like the Voodoo touch and they can rub your back and all

1013
01:01:16.581 --> 01:01:21.020
of a sudden it feels better.
I'm not sure.
I mean he gives,

1014
01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:25.190
got the Indian,
the Indian of touch a couple of ways,
you know?
Right.

1015
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:29.160
There's this other guy that says your frame is all that much,

1016
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.290
but you know what man,
a year ago when I would see movement training,

1017
01:01:33.291 --> 01:01:36.500
I thought it was crazy.
And now I think it makes a lot of sense.

1018
01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:41.420
And now that I see a lot of high level Jujitsu schools incorporating that as a

1019
01:01:41.421 --> 01:01:44.750
class and their workouts,
so it's gotta be doing something for you.

1020
01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:46.900
That stuff that,
uh,
the guy didn't,

1021
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:51.200
the beginning Hixon the documentary,
all that stuff.
People,

1022
01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:55.340
and it looks very simple.
It's very,
it's very similar to,
very similar,
you know,

1023
01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:57.290
bro,
we've evolved.

1024
01:01:57.291 --> 01:02:00.800
We've evolved in every fucking level from technology and the main training,

1025
01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:01.431
you know,

1026
01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:04.670
10 years ago they put a chicken on the floor and you chased it for speed,

1027
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:08.030
you know,
whatever the fuck you did in those days.
I don't know.

1028
01:02:08.031 --> 01:02:09.320
Now it's completely different.

1029
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:12.770
But that was what was so interesting about Hickson Hickson and figured this out

1030
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:16.490
in 1994.
I mean,
that guy was a Yogi.

1031
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:19.980
He was a legitimate Yogi.
You mean Hixon does some spectacular

1032
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.813
<v 7>shit.
He does.</v>

1033
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
He'll stand on a balance bar and do a full split standing up,

1034
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:29.730
grabs his foot and puts it over his head like a fucking ballerina.

1035
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.880
Plus he'll choke you out.
I mean,
his,

1036
01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:36.750
his ability to control his body is really freaky.

1037
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:41.550
Like he was an incredible,
um,
bodyweight athlete.

1038
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:45.540
Like the stuff that he could do with his body just in terms of like gymnastic

1039
01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:48.360
movements and stuff like that and yoga movements and stretching movements.

1040
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:52.470
Like very,
very unusually dexterous.
Dexterous.
Is that the word?
Yeah,

1041
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.990
good dexterity,
amazing dexterity.
But,
uh,

1042
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.070
just his Jujitsu was so high level on top of that.

1043
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.570
So he had this deep knowledge of Jujitsu of all the positions,
a kids,

1044
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.990
his basics,
we're so fucking good.

1045
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:11.430
Everything they to this day,
him and his son crone,

1046
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.870
they,

1047
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:17.370
they use the same standard Jujitsu that everyone has always used.

1048
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.300
There's not like a lot of fancy crazy weird shit you've never seen before.

1049
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.720
Triangles armbars chokes and they're just razor sharp out them and that's like a

1050
01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:28.380
Gracie family thing.

1051
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:32.070
You think about like [inaudible] same shit like Darce choke I guess like the

1052
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.210
most unconventional thing that he does a lot of time he does like a standard

1053
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:40.380
Gracie attack armbars triangles,
[inaudible] chokes.

1054
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:45.381
It's like they have that style of attack and especially Hickson and his son

1055
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:48.690
crone is just at this Ninja level,

1056
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:53.070
this monk level where it's just,
they do the standard Jujitsu.

1057
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:57.990
There's no crazy weird tricks coming your way.
No Burn Bolo both by the God,

1058
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.540
I mean they know it.
I'm sure.
I'm sure he could do it.

1059
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.920
I mean I'm sure all every high level guys aware of pretty much every technique

1060
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:05.783
at this point.

1061
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:09.810
Like if they're competitive or if they train into competitive gym or the curious

1062
01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:12.680
or they work with athletes.
Look at the Derek Brunson.

1063
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.140
He's fighting out of Houston,
Texas.
You know what he's thinking about right now,

1064
01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:19.020
right.
Was like,
I'm knocking on this motherfucking house,

1065
01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:22.950
so I go back and get myself some barbecue in this mother fucking shit.

1066
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.160
Maybe he's thinking about Roy Nelson as if it was a white cop.

1067
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.980
It's a fucking nightmare.
What's going on on Jamie?

1068
01:04:34.981 --> 01:04:38.820
Can you put the card up and one of the TV so we can see what's coming up next.

1069
01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:42.780
Nice.
Needed a body.
That's a really,

1070
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:49.390
it's this and those aren't,
yes.
The dos Anjos fight to five rounder,
right?

1071
01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.253
Yeah.

1072
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:52.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1073
01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.001
<v 7>Roy Nelson,</v>

1074
01:04:53.001 --> 01:04:57.020
I knew him back in the day when he was just a Jujitsu guy before he ever did any

1075
01:04:57.021 --> 01:04:58.880
MMA.
Really?
Yeah.

1076
01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:04.390
I'm pretty sure he was in Brazil with us when a Eddie had that match with a

1077
01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.520
boiler and I flew down with them.
That was 2003.

1078
01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.870
Roy Nelson was a real hot,
I mean,
it still is like a real high level grappler.

1079
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:18.100
He um,
beat Frank Mir and a grappling competition,

1080
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.590
<v 0>a straight graveling competitions,
like some ridiculous amount,</v>

1081
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.550
like a just outpointed that shit out of him.

1082
01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:32.800
But uh,
those like the Frank Mir lazy days,
Frank Mir has gone through,

1083
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:37.430
you know,
days where he's less dedicated days where he's more dedicated.
Well,

1084
01:05:37.431 --> 01:05:41.170
he's asking to be released now.
Well,
he got something happened.
You got,

1085
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:45.070
there's some drug test issues.
What was the Frank Mir drug test issue?

1086
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:49.960
Is it a steroid thing?
Kangaroo meat.
That's right.
Right.

1087
01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:53.170
They said that they tested that they put the steroids that kangaroo meat or some

1088
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:58.170
shit.
So when might you serious?
No.
Yeah,
that's what he said.
He ate kangaroo.

1089
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:02.500
Oh,
what'd he went to Australia?
He tested positive after Australia.
Come on.

1090
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:03.960
He really blamed it on kangaroo.
Damn.

1091
01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:06.880
He's Roy Nelson knees to the thigh are impressive.
I like what he's doing there.

1092
01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:11.050
He really did say that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
That's what he ate.

1093
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:14.050
Was it?
They may be they blah,
blah,
blah.

1094
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.470
I swear to God mere question.

1095
01:06:18.471 --> 01:06:22.360
In April if his positive tests could be the result of tainted kangaroo meat.

1096
01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:23.410
He consumed it.
Australia.

1097
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:27.910
I have a feeling he did that with a half a smile on his face.
Oh Shit.

1098
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.570
Good.
Very broad.
I told Ya directs like wait a second,

1099
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.190
I gotta get this out of Las Vegas.
Oh Shit.
It's Derrick Lewis.

1100
01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:38.800
Would I call them dark brown?
Sorry about that.

1101
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.353
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1102
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:49.090
<v 0>See now this is a bad spot for him cause Roy has a fucking nasty ground game.</v>

1103
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.770
Everybody thinks a Roy's being,

1104
01:06:50.771 --> 01:06:53.170
this dude would just beat you up if you stand and trade with them.

1105
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.230
But Roy can control motherfuckers on the ground,
man.

1106
01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.300
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1107
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.250
<v 0>he,
no,
he lost to a Andre Arlovski in elite x z.</v>

1108
01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:07.610
But that's what I detail or what I taught when I call one of the most crooked

1109
01:07:07.621 --> 01:07:12.621
organizations that ever showed MMA crooked in not maybe that they cheated but

1110
01:07:14.161 --> 01:07:18.610
crooked in like the way they interpreted the rules of MMA.
They would stand,

1111
01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:21.840
be blunt,
they were down for like 15 seconds.
Like if you went to the ground,

1112
01:07:21.841 --> 01:07:26.050
you've got to submit somebody quick.
They were just standing people up.
Oh Damn.

1113
01:07:26.051 --> 01:07:27.450
This is Christ.
Oh Jesus.

1114
01:07:27.451 --> 01:07:32.010
Roy just got blasted in the gut and another one to the gut and to the face.

1115
01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:35.760
Oh Shit.
Oh is in trouble.

1116
01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.580
Oh,
need of the body.
Oh,
we've got that Gable grip though.
Can you get them down?

1117
01:07:41.581 --> 01:07:45.280
You got the escrip rather.
Damn.

1118
01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:49.420
This is a fight for his life here,
Derek.
Punch man.

1119
01:07:49.421 --> 01:07:51.310
That's where his experience comes in though.

1120
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.750
He got them waffle and gave him a little chance to breathe and fucking thank

1121
01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:58.120
clear.
His hair,
his head.
He's still in trouble,
dude.

1122
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.333
<v 2>Cool.</v>

1123
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:06.210
<v 0>Louis can crack,
man.
He really hits hard.</v>

1124
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.230
That was an excellent exchange too.

1125
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:17.540
<v 3>Ooh,
crazy sport.
What were we talking about right before this?</v>

1126
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.010
We were talking about something super important.

1127
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.200
CBC Oil show like that started to bring up to what's going on in America.

1128
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:30.913
Oh,

1129
01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:36.050
the sheer active situation going on too right now in Dallas.
What's going on?

1130
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:40.550
There's supposedly a shooter shooting cops right now and during a protest,

1131
01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:45.010
no shit.
No Shit.
This is what's going to happen.
No Shit I can't take today.

1132
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.390
Take call me,
goes this date.
I go,
listen,

1133
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:51.530
six black guys are going to get together and start ambushing motherfuckers and

1134
01:08:51.531 --> 01:08:55.940
that's it.
This is going to go cause you can't keep doing this.
Oh yeah,
this is,

1135
01:08:55.970 --> 01:09:00.590
this was fun.
Oh Roy,
he's taking some bombs,
man.
Roizen trouble.
Jesus.

1136
01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:02.630
Derek is in excellent shape too,
man,

1137
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:06.440
cause he's hitting him when some hard fucking shots and he keeps coming forward

1138
01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:10.430
and Roy can take a punch like no other and it gets the takedown.

1139
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:14.330
Goddamn full mount.
Not Good.
No Bueno for Derek.

1140
01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.700
This could be a wrap man.
I'm telling you.

1141
01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.820
Oh the end of the round dude,

1142
01:09:19.821 --> 01:09:23.000
Roy Nelson mounted on you is one of the worst situations ever.

1143
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:27.080
That gut and all that body weight is all centered.

1144
01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:32.081
It's like having like a giant 400 pound kettle bell sitting on your Dick.

1145
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:37.550
Like the way he mounts you.
You don't want to release.
I control people.

1146
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:40.880
I feel bad,
especially when I'm sweating and shit.

1147
01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:44.280
They smelled my stomach juice and pizzas and pretzels.

1148
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:50.480
Fuck you stomach.
I get my like I tried to get my rib eyes.
It's too bad.
No,

1149
01:09:50.481 --> 01:09:53.780
no.
Look at these fucking shots.
Derek's Landon.
Jesus.

1150
01:09:53.781 --> 01:09:58.610
Roy's tough because Derek was beaten the shit out of him.

1151
01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.190
This is good.
As Derek's several overlord,
like those combinations,

1152
01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:07.450
he looks more more settled and he's fucking calm looking at,
I'm Tom.

1153
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:09.190
We gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

1154
01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:14.710
Imagine if he grabs the mic and says,

1155
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:16.970
forget it man.

1156
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.710
God Damn it.
Look at him.
He's not even breathing.
Well,
you know what?

1157
01:10:23.711 --> 01:10:27.820
Derek has also had quite a few fights in the UFC now and he's gotten more and

1158
01:10:27.821 --> 01:10:30.670
more at home there and more and more comfortable with the experience.

1159
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:36.160
We get that Nice smoothies right out of the way of that right hand.
This is good.

1160
01:10:36.161 --> 01:10:37.800
As he's ever looked mad,
I think it looks great.

1161
01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.520
Doesn't mean that he can't still get caught because Roy hits fucking hard and

1162
01:10:44.831 --> 01:10:45.880
Roy knows how to win.

1163
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.810
Oh Shit.

1164
01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:51.873
<v 2>No.</v>

1165
01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:57.430
<v 3>Yeah,
it's really weird.
Roy's been lingering for years,
bro.
He's like,
God,</v>

1166
01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:01.470
you don't go away.
Roy is a tank.

1167
01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:05.160
He really is a tank and he's a guy who probably should be fighting at one 85 how

1168
01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:05.994
about that?
Okay.

1169
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:07.010
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1170
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.280
<v 3>no,</v>

1171
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:12.030
I mean if he had the kind of discipline that some of these dudes have like dos

1172
01:11:12.031 --> 01:11:13.530
Anjos that cut way down.

1173
01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.541
<v 0>But who knows?
Man,</v>

1174
01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:21.541
maybe part of why he's so good is because he's a small man fighting as a

1175
01:11:22.181 --> 01:11:27.181
heavyweight and can take unbelievable punches and kicks and hits really hard.

1176
01:11:28.181 --> 01:11:29.950
But he's not like a physically big guy.

1177
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:31.723
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1178
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:36.030
<v 0>I mean I guess he is in his weight because he's about to 65 but if you got rid</v>

1179
01:11:36.031 --> 01:11:39.150
of all the body fat on him,
how much do you think you'd weigh?

1180
01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:44.540
Two 30 to 20
like quite honestly,

1181
01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.720
if you put him in the same kind of condition that say like a Robbie Lawler's in,

1182
01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:55.400
get him down to his optimal fighting weight.
What is your way to 10?
Yeah,

1183
01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.720
look,
he's got lats.
Oh,
he's a tech.
He's got lots.
He's got traps.

1184
01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:04.330
So it was just a stomach.
Yeah.
Well all that stuff under the legs,

1185
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.990
it's long as shit.
Look at the legs now.
I remember when he loses those,
that wait,

1186
01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:12.110
those legs are going to be fucking savages because they'd been holding up a

1187
01:12:12.111 --> 01:12:14.780
house.
Yeah,
that's true.
The last fucking 10 years,

1188
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:19.070
so yeah,
he's got,
he's halfway there.

1189
01:12:19.071 --> 01:12:22.250
If he just went on a diet,
he's never going to do that though.
That's part of,

1190
01:12:22.251 --> 01:12:26.900
is a part of his flair.
That's just who he is.
I mean,

1191
01:12:26.901 --> 01:12:27.471
it's amazing.

1192
01:12:27.471 --> 01:12:32.150
He's a world class fighter and he's built like a guy who works at a gas station.

1193
01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.290
No dirt,
no disrespect.
Roy knows I'm a big fan.

1194
01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:44.950
He's a great guy.
It's tough as fuck too.
Just tough as fuck.
He's one of them.

1195
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.540
All them brothers,
motherfuckers,
you know,
he's one of them.
Allman brothers.

1196
01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:52.310
Fighters don't fucking come all night.
Hope will show up with a bottle of Jack.

1197
01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.360
You bust that limp.
They just,
but Jacqueline,
I keep fighting the fuck stitches.

1198
01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.650
He's had some spectacular knockouts in UFC too.
I think of the guys.

1199
01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:07.430
He's Code Mitre,
own check Congo.
They can't check Congo,
right?

1200
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:10.190
Yeah.
Did he say he did?

1201
01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.300
I know Frank Mir caught Congo and then put them away with a choke.

1202
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.530
Am I confusing it to Oh oh shit.

1203
01:13:20.531 --> 01:13:25.531
So I control not good for Derek and he's only shot him fucking those beers.

1204
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:29.440
He did beat him.
He knocked him out.
Yeah.
Um,

1205
01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:34.420
this is terrible because this is two minutes to go in the round and uh,

1206
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:38.590
Derek is not moving that much,
which means Derek is probably starting to fade.

1207
01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:41.640
He blew his gas tank trying to put Roy away.

1208
01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:46.650
I think we're seeing the same strategy play out that we saw with Joe band and

1209
01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:49.090
with Derek Lewis went for it.

1210
01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:54.091
Sprinted empty that tank and a worse situation for sure though,

1211
01:13:54.881 --> 01:13:59.200
for Louis men to be on the bottom.
Roy gets that fucking that um,

1212
01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:02.020
mounted crucifix all the time.
That's what he's looking for.

1213
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:06.100
He's gonna Punch Derek in the face until Derek gives him that right arm.

1214
01:14:06.101 --> 01:14:06.950
He's going to take that right here.

1215
01:14:06.951 --> 01:14:10.270
I'm shoving in between his two legs and once he gets that arm in between his two

1216
01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:14.080
legs,
once he feels like can open it,
he's like trying to bait Derek.
Oh,
okay.

1217
01:14:14.081 --> 01:14:14.914
Now he's got his back.

1218
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:26.950
Wow.
Dark yet that we can't fuck.
I ain't fucking around.
Back up to his feet.

1219
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.020
That's strong.
That's a strong move.

1220
01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:36.080
That's impressive because Roy Bam takes from my back down Roy's ground games

1221
01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:39.210
type,
but Roy,
he doesn't like to take that back.
That's weird.

1222
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:41.730
But it was tough to take it back.
When you a Chubby dude.

1223
01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.750
That's what it is right over there.
Yeah.
It's time because of his gut.

1224
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:47.400
If you've got them from a turtle,

1225
01:14:47.401 --> 01:14:51.660
it works and you lay on them and you pull them back.
But it's tough.

1226
01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.210
I guess it's sort of a fulcrum point,
right?
Oh Shit.

1227
01:14:54.211 --> 01:14:58.890
He took a hard elbow to the head by Derek and attempting that takedown and now

1228
01:14:58.891 --> 01:15:02.580
he's back.
Interesting.
Okay.
Back to [inaudible].
That's his shit.

1229
01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:04.980
That's his shit for MMA.
He likes this.

1230
01:15:04.981 --> 01:15:07.170
This is how he stopped Kimbo slice on the ultimate fighter.

1231
01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:10.440
He's gonna pin that fucking right arm in between his two legs.

1232
01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.490
It just doesn't want to lose the position again because he doesn't have much

1233
01:15:14.491 --> 01:15:18.450
time here,
so he's probably just going to try to beat him up from here.

1234
01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:23.220
He's smothering him with his gut,
get that pizza on the fucking head and garlic.

1235
01:15:23.221 --> 01:15:27.510
Chili heard him left,
took
whoa.

1236
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:31.680
Jesus Christ.
So he's tired.
He starts off to have that guy look up and he's like,

1237
01:15:31.681 --> 01:15:36.500
God damn,
that white dude stinks.
Well,
this topic up,

1238
01:15:36.501 --> 01:15:39.270
my God,
Deb face,
that's when he forced him to move.

1239
01:15:39.271 --> 01:15:41.610
He forced him to move when he was gut smothering them.

1240
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.410
Roy Nelson with the powerful leg kick.

1241
01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.730
I'm just a big fan of Roy Nelson who voiced stands for,
you know,

1242
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.660
that's as American as it gets zone.
I love him.
I love the big crazy beard.

1243
01:15:51.661 --> 01:15:55.980
He's fun.
It looked like my titties,
right?
That though all fucked up for the side.

1244
01:15:55.981 --> 01:16:00.270
They sweat.
You get that to the sweat on you with that Pretzel stubbing sweat.

1245
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:04.710
That shit deadly.
The Pretzel Stomachs.
I smell my rash guard when I know.

1246
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.850
I definitely don't.
Definitely don't.
It's time for a [inaudible].

1247
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:15.450
What's going to have here happen here?
Give me a Joey karate prediction.

1248
01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.140
Third round joined karate predictions.

1249
01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:21.450
Roy Nelson is getting a little bit of confidence.

1250
01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:24.150
He might take them down and do exactly what you said.

1251
01:16:24.151 --> 01:16:28.920
The fucking Tomahawk with the legs,
that amount in the crucifix,

1252
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:33.960
if he can get them down.
Derek is taking some big deep breaths and um,
you know,

1253
01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:36.990
this is a high pace fight,
real high paced fight.

1254
01:16:36.991 --> 01:16:39.150
And when two guys start getting tired,

1255
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.600
the guy with the greater wrestling is able to usually impose his wrestling game

1256
01:16:45.061 --> 01:16:48.420
better than the guy with the pretty decent takedown defense,

1257
01:16:48.421 --> 01:16:50.160
which is where I would put Derrick Lewis.

1258
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.060
So like they start making mistakes and they get really tired and a guy with a

1259
01:16:54.061 --> 01:16:59.060
lot of experience in grappling,
like Roy does a great job of uh,

1260
01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:03.750
forcing guys in a bad positions when it takes him down.
So if he could,

1261
01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:08.610
if he could push the pace now he's got a much better chance of getting Louis

1262
01:17:08.611 --> 01:17:13.520
down than he did in the first or second round because Louis has to bargain.
Like,

1263
01:17:13.521 --> 01:17:17.300
how much energy do I use to fight off this take down?

1264
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:20.180
He's punched him in the knee and Derek complaint,
that's interesting.

1265
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:22.220
Look at this.
He's punching the inside of his leg.

1266
01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:25.601
You know,

1267
01:17:25.601 --> 01:17:29.290
sometimes a guy will like let the fight go to the ground because like he just

1268
01:17:29.291 --> 01:17:30.730
can't defend it anymore.

1269
01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.130
And then he wants to take a little break and then try to scramble.

1270
01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.530
But you can't afford to do that in the third round,

1271
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:37.990
especially if it gets any deeper here.

1272
01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:41.740
You were like four minutes in now or four minutes ago.

1273
01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.930
So you know Derek's trying to pummel under,

1274
01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:49.510
he's going to fall into that KIA team.

1275
01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.600
Roy just Roy just has no fear of his guillotine

1276
01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.480
and boom,
he's down.
There it is.
And Roy is going to step over.

1277
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.670
Okay.
So now he's got three minutes and 30 seconds to work.

1278
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.670
And if one of the first thing Roy's going to do,
Roy doesn't fuck around,

1279
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:11.570
Roy is going to establish a position and then he's gonna move to half guard or

1280
01:18:11.571 --> 01:18:12.950
move to a side control.

1281
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:18.350
He's gonna establish like some way to control his body like head and arm
control.

1282
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:23.590
And then he does like your standard Shinon insteps slice pins down.

1283
01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:28.680
He's a Henzel Gracie black belt.
Izzy.
Yup.
In New York that,
Yup.

1284
01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.130
I mean he trained with a lot of different people,

1285
01:18:31.131 --> 01:18:34.790
but I'm pretty sure he got his black belt from Hanzo.
Roy,

1286
01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:38.210
super legit on the ground watch.
She's going to slice down,

1287
01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:41.750
just just posturing up on him here.

1288
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.840
It doesn't feel like Derek is a moving his hips at all.

1289
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.250
Derek is like an exploder.

1290
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:49.400
He's like a wait for his moment and explode sort of a guy.

1291
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:53.210
But he's eating some shots here with Roy on top of them before I can just keep,

1292
01:18:53.211 --> 01:18:54.230
keep pinned down here.

1293
01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:58.010
Like this was headed that awkward angle as an awkward place to be.
Man.

1294
01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:01.760
He doesn't want any more.
So he's going to see,
it's like Derek,

1295
01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:06.110
like bides is time waits for his energy levels to restore and then just hoaxes

1296
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:06.973
way standing.

1297
01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:11.550
I mean for sure he's got technique.

1298
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.800
The way he got up that was all smooth and everything like that.

1299
01:19:13.801 --> 01:19:15.900
But what I'm saying is like he's strong as fuck,

1300
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:24.050
but this fucking guy resting on.
Yeah,
it takes it.
So,
yeah,

1301
01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:29.270
no it does.
No.
And Roy,
I believe me,
it's making that guy carry all of his weight.

1302
01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:30.081
Look,

1303
01:19:30.081 --> 01:19:34.040
I like how much he's driving into them with his shoulders pinned against them.

1304
01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:35.630
It makes it harder for him to breathe.

1305
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:39.710
He's got real good head control like Roy's.
Oh,
he's gotta be careful with those.

1306
01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.720
Oh No.
Yeah,
he likes sacrifices.
A couple of those elbows to get them down.

1307
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.040
This is not good for Derek.
He's definitely losing this round.

1308
01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:53.780
Backups his feet again,
man.
So impressive.
That's impressive.

1309
01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:57.530
Cause uh,
Roy is good at holding dude's down,
man.

1310
01:19:57.531 --> 01:20:01.490
It just shows you how tough Lewis is and how strong he is,

1311
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:08.040
but he just doesn't have a,
it doesn't seem like he

1312
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.040
<v 7>has the horsepower or the gas tank to sustain and they can't get away from him.</v>

1313
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:16.350
He manages to get back up to his feet,
but then he can't get away from it.

1314
01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:20.360
We go here.
We got big John McCarthy stows into fans.

1315
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:24.950
I was doing this shit.
You see on the weekends the baby.
Oh,

1316
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.380
let's do this shit.
Well,
I just took to pay gas.
Deep breath.

1317
01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1318
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:34.640
<v 7>Wow.
These people,
he's gonna kick 'em</v>

1319
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.690
<v 1>okay.</v>

1320
01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:37.790
<v 7>He's telegraphing that left kick.</v>

1321
01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:39.453
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1322
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.220
<v 7>Derek was given that one away.</v>

1323
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:51.250
The best guys.
Let's go co shit out of that.
Oh Shit.
Get out of there.
Oh Jesus.

1324
01:20:51.251 --> 01:20:54.460
Fucking Christ.
Jesus is a body.
Ooh.

1325
01:20:55.660 --> 01:21:00.210
The clinch again.
And Derek just went hall,
man.
God dammit.

1326
01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:03.380
This mother fuckers on top of me.
Boy,

1327
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.980
teddy juice getting this teddy juice on me.
[inaudible] juice off,
man.

1328
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:12.310
Come on man.
This is fucking hot dogs.
This one little flying it out.

1329
01:21:12.311 --> 01:21:17.200
20 seconds to go.
20 seconds to go.
Does he get free?
Yes he does.

1330
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:21.550
Yes he does.
Oh Shit.
Left hand.
Oh Shit.

1331
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.710
God Damn Derrick Lewis.
Woo.
But he don't give a fuck this walking.

1332
01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:31.600
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh to just one hour.
He's hurt.

1333
01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:37.910
Oh my goodness.
Look at him.
Look at me.
Oh my goodness.

1334
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:41.190
That's white brilliance,
right?
You just lose a tooth.
He lost something.

1335
01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.640
Mouth piece,
something teeth.
He don't give a fuck Jack.
Dude.

1336
01:21:45.650 --> 01:21:47.990
He got correct.

1337
01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.100
He got cracked.
Watch.

1338
01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:59.970
Here it is.
Here's a right hand.
Boom.
Oh,
that was slobber.
That's a slobber.

1339
01:21:59.971 --> 01:22:03.500
Knocker.
Hmm.
That's officially a slobber.
Knocker.
Damn.

1340
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:06.990
Roy Nelson has a chin of the gods.

1341
01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:09.660
Look at his Chin that is in his Chin is insane.

1342
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:14.000
His ability to absorb punishment is just superhuman.
He's just,

1343
01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:16.460
just give him the fight just for taking that punch and stay there.

1344
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:21.210
That just goes to show you a hard mark hotheads mark hut and knocked him out.
He,

1345
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.670
he killed him with an upper cut and walked away.

1346
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:28.020
That just shows you what a bad mother fucker.
Mark Hunt is.

1347
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:32.850
Roy Nelson man takes a shot as good as any human being that's ever lived.

1348
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.210
And for as long as he's been doing it,
I mean,

1349
01:22:36.211 --> 01:22:39.270
he's been taken shots for a long fucking time.

1350
01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:41.370
It still has an iron jaw.

1351
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:46.560
I mean that was a perfect punch from a knockout artists that landed right on the

1352
01:22:47.311 --> 01:22:49.860
tip of his chin,
snapped his head back.

1353
01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:51.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1354
01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.930
<v 7>And the dude survived.
It's a tank.</v>

1355
01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.253
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1356
01:22:56.490 --> 01:23:00.830
<v 7>Who won that fight?
Roy takedowns,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1357
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:03.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1358
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:07.150
<v 7>But if you look at it like who was closer to finishing the fight?</v>

1359
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:12.010
It was the one round with Derek and then the third round with Derek.

1360
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.870
Those exchanges were way more dangerous for Roy then anything that Roy did to

1361
01:23:16.871 --> 01:23:19.960
him on the ground.
Cause Roy never really established,
um,

1362
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:22.800
any good position for a long period time.
Got The mound,

1363
01:23:22.801 --> 01:23:23.890
but it was at the end of the round.

1364
01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:27.640
He got site control and he like was trying to get the amount of crucifix and

1365
01:23:27.641 --> 01:23:31.000
Derek kept getting up so it wasn't a whole lot done on the ground other than

1366
01:23:31.001 --> 01:23:33.760
some,
you know,
decent ground impound.

1367
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:43.020
Ooh,
Split Decision Ladies and gentlemen.
First judge scores are for Louis.
No Sir.

1368
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.380
Second for Nelson.

1369
01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.940
Derrick Lewis.
See,

1370
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:58.870
judges are starting to look at take downs as being less important than damage

1371
01:24:00.381 --> 01:24:05.300
done.
And if you want to go by damage done,
you got the first round.

1372
01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:10.010
Lot of damage done,
a lot of damage done by Louis.
You had the second round,

1373
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:14.620
lot of take downs,
right?
How many times did Roy take them down?
Three.

1374
01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.780
And then the third round take downs.

1375
01:24:17.781 --> 01:24:20.810
But Derrick hit him with some hard shots and had him in trouble

1376
01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:28.470
either way,
man.
What a fight.
See,
this is one of the reasons why hate,
um,

1377
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.250
like those,
uh,
the win and loss money.
Boom.

1378
01:24:33.251 --> 01:24:37.000
Look at this hair comes crank.
Who takes that shot?

1379
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:42.010
Who fucking takes that shot?
What was human being?
Takes that shot.
That is insane.

1380
01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.420
Roy Nelson's jaw is fucking insane.
You would,

1381
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.510
you'd have to fly in specialists.
If he punched me like that.

1382
01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:53.550
Royal blue is going to go out dancing tonight.

1383
01:24:53.551 --> 01:24:55.630
You probably pick up from chewing tobacco on the way home.

1384
01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:03.130
Oh,
unbelievable.
But anyway,

1385
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:06.760
what I was going to say is sometimes they get bummed out that um,

1386
01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:11.650
that like someone makes less money than that in a split decision.

1387
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:16.710
Especially I feel like a split decision so many times.

1388
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.570
I don't agree so many times.
And the difference between like three people,

1389
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.620
three people's opinions.
So it's really only two people's opinions against it

1390
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:32.320
and that's going to cost you half of your money.
That seems so crazy.

1391
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.390
That seems like that's something that shouldn't,

1392
01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:39.810
I feel like maybe they should be like different kinds of women bonuses or the

1393
01:25:40.091 --> 01:25:44.050
very least they should share something.
If it's like a split decision,

1394
01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:48.250
you know,
I know the UFC privately bonuses a lot of people,

1395
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:50.740
but that's not even what I'm talking about.
I'm just talking about like this,

1396
01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:54.100
the idea of a way,
I mean,
everybody's trying to win.

1397
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:57.370
You know how much when they go to the show up,

1398
01:25:57.371 --> 01:26:01.900
they know they're getting a certain amount,
right?
Like,
uh,
it's a private company,

1399
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:04.100
first of all,
obviously I work for them and I can't

1400
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.950
<v 3>divulge things that I know that,
that I'm not supposed to talk about.</v>

1401
01:26:06.951 --> 01:26:11.951
But it's a private company and they prefer to pay people non publicly with a lot

1402
01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:18.770
of this stuff.
They do.
I can't say much more than that because it's not my place,

1403
01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.920
you know?
Um,
I'm obviously not a money person.

1404
01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:26.980
I don't pay attention to how the business side of shit of this especially works.

1405
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:30.020
There's lots of different sports so that players will get fucked out of a

1406
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:33.910
contract.
Like I've,
I've known baseball players have a,
maybe we're,

1407
01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.530
their team wasn't going to make the playoffs,
but that is really good.

1408
01:26:36.531 --> 01:26:39.830
And he has that performance bonuses built into his contract and at the end of

1409
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:41.330
the year they'll,
maybe one,

1410
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:44.120
he needs to pitch one more inning or even one more out and they'll take them out

1411
01:26:44.121 --> 01:26:44.421
of the game.

1412
01:26:44.421 --> 01:26:47.410
So I don't have to pay him like $1 million or some shit like that when the

1413
01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:50.480
players also feel like that guy deserves it because he worked all year for it,

1414
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:54.930
did everything he was supposed to do.
Right.
And the owner just says,
ah,

1415
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:58.610
not going to pay that money today.
Sorry.
Yeah,
that's fucked.

1416
01:26:58.830 --> 01:27:01.550
But I guess that's like we were talking about um,

1417
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:06.050
performance bonus money where um,
baseball teams,
Jamie was saying,

1418
01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:09.650
we'll take a guy out if he needs to pitch like one more inning and he gets like

1419
01:27:09.651 --> 01:27:11.500
a million dollar bonus.
They just bench him.

1420
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:15.410
They just won't let him play so that they don't have to pay him that bonus,

1421
01:27:15.411 --> 01:27:18.590
which totally makes sense.
I mean,
especially if they're winning,
they're ahead.

1422
01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:19.880
They don't need them.
I mean,

1423
01:27:19.881 --> 01:27:22.340
it all depends on like how and in losing situations too though.

1424
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:25.310
There's planning the thing out for fans to watch a game and they're just,

1425
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:27.650
people have sometimes they even know the situation,

1426
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:31.460
like this guy's going to make 500 g's if he gets three hits today and they're

1427
01:27:31.461 --> 01:27:34.480
like,
I got to and he's not going to play for the next four innings.

1428
01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.640
It it's crazy.
Jamie clubs,

1429
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:42.670
one night 11 I was at the fucking comedy store and Paul Mooney was onstage

1430
01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.740
talking about Barry Bonds.

1431
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:49.340
He was talking about how Barry Bonds that weren't going to let that white boy

1432
01:27:49.341 --> 01:27:52.610
break the record.
I behave was going up against the steroid guy.

1433
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:54.830
I'll never forget.

1434
01:27:54.831 --> 01:27:57.890
He kept saying that Shit onstage and then we're going to let that,

1435
01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.950
that pool a little black boy break that record all this stuff.

1436
01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:04.890
The next day I woke up to the plains,
Haiti and I'll never forget,
saved myself.

1437
01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.680
Jesus Christ.
He was right dead.

1438
01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:11.000
Never going to let that Barry bonds with the fucking battery died.

1439
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:14.000
That's how much they want out of fucking way.

1440
01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:18.770
I'm not the Jamie cranked this up so I can hear what they're saying about Mark

1441
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:23.390
Hunt.
I'm so happy that Mark Hunt is the guy fighting Brock Lesnar.
Okay.

1442
01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:28.840
<v 2>To ever compete in the heavyweight division,
the
heavyweight contender,</v>

1443
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.260
a guy was meet with some of the best fighters in the world and a guy who has

1444
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:35.140
absolutely one punch knock out.

1445
01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:42.150
<v 3>She just fucking smokes people,
man.
Be Mark Hunt just smokes people.</v>

1446
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:45.440
<v 2>Does he book?</v>

1447
01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:53.240
I'm going to try to take him down.
It's fighting evil.

1448
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:55.070
I don't have to sit here and build this way.

1449
01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:57.920
<v 3>Holy Shit.
I'm excited about this.</v>

1450
01:28:58.820 --> 01:28:59.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1451
01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:02.640
<v 3>I was more excited about Cormier and Jon Jones.</v>

1452
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:07.560
<v 0>I wasn't that.
We're excited about this fucking fight,
this fight.</v>

1453
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:09.620
Mark Hunt and Broccoli in there.
Fuck.
Ooh.

1454
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:13.690
I can't hope mark club picks him up and throws his head on the fucking room.
Ah.

1455
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:18.930
That's what I give a fuck.
What is pissed off to be fucking pissed off.

1456
01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.060
He's pissed off right now,
so yeah,
he should not see what the fuck this goes.

1457
01:29:22.061 --> 01:29:26.880
This is going to be a good fight.
Um,
yeah man.
I'm interested.

1458
01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.670
They got me.
I'm interested and it,

1459
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:35.490
the very few guys could be coming from pro wrestling,
you know,

1460
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.020
and having a used to have fought in MMA and come back and get you excited like

1461
01:29:40.021 --> 01:29:44.940
this guy.
I mean,
he's a legit freak of the freaks.

1462
01:29:44.941 --> 01:29:49.140
I mean,
look at the size of that motherfucker,
dude,
look at that.

1463
01:29:49.330 --> 01:29:50.190
Boom.

1464
01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:51.613
<v 5>Thank you.
Wait,</v>

1465
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:56.590
<v 0>no,
that was a fight where,
yeah.
Oh Shane car.
When I look at it,
look how he would,</v>

1466
01:29:56.610 --> 01:30:00.770
he,
he beats the fuck out of Frank Mir here.
I mean,
just smashed him.

1467
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.900
He's a big boy.

1468
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:10.350
That is the biggest you're ever going to see as far as like legit super athletes

1469
01:30:11.441 --> 01:30:14.770
in MMA that fight at 265 pounds.
Cause that's,
you know,

1470
01:30:14.771 --> 01:30:18.410
they have to maybe some people don't know that for the heavyweight division you,

1471
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:19.990
it's not unlimited.
Wait,

1472
01:30:20.530 --> 01:30:24.910
heavyweight division has a weight limit and that limit is 265 pounds.

1473
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.210
Everything above 265 pounds is super heavyweight.

1474
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:31.870
And we don't have a super heavyweight division in the UFC.

1475
01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:35.470
So if you're like a super giant guy like the mountain,

1476
01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:38.870
that game of Thrones demon.
Dude,
that guy could not find the OCD,

1477
01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:43.750
can't make the wait that guy's way over 300 pounds.
Right?
He's enormous.

1478
01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:48.730
So if they ever wanted to do that super freak division,

1479
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.480
like they would have to open it up and then they would have to start having

1480
01:30:52.481 --> 01:30:53.081
fights in there.

1481
01:30:53.081 --> 01:30:58.081
But I just don't know if there's enough 265 pound plus elite MMA athletes do it

1482
01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:03.340
all.
Be a bunch of fucking ex linemen,
man.
That's what it would be.

1483
01:31:03.341 --> 01:31:06.610
A bunch of ex Lyman that walk around it too.
You know.
[inaudible] five.

1484
01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:11.650
Let me ask you this.
The x linemen who are,
uh,
you know a lot about football,

1485
01:31:11.651 --> 01:31:15.910
so if a guy's like a fucking worldclass Lineman,
some beast of a man,

1486
01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.760
um,
what would that guy have to,

1487
01:31:18.761 --> 01:31:23.350
how much would he have to lose to compete as an MMA fighter?
20 pounds.

1488
01:31:23.351 --> 01:31:27.340
Maybe that's it.
If the alignment that's walking around at two 95,

1489
01:31:27.610 --> 01:31:32.230
he's got a tremendous foot work.
If he's an offensive line,
defensive line,
right?

1490
01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.650
So half my work is done.
He's got strong fucking feet.
Yeah.

1491
01:31:35.651 --> 01:31:38.410
We got to work on the striking his takedowns it

1492
01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.150
once you break the take down to them.

1493
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.230
Jill football channel side of that beautiful tape.

1494
01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:51.260
[inaudible] beautiful football style tape.
Now you went four feet.
Well,

1495
01:31:51.261 --> 01:31:53.760
Chelsea Clinton was an elite athlete,
channel son,
a very,

1496
01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:54.850
very high level wrestler.

1497
01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:00.360
If you could teach somebody who's six foot six two five to check a motherfucker

1498
01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:04.780
down.
Wait,
shale don't die.
You get done.
What's going on over here?

1499
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.840
The eighth starved death gets stuck.
Who is this?
Bjorn.
Oh,
this is the rock.

1500
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.540
The mountain guy.
Beyond Sin Bra br.
How do you say that?
Johnson.

1501
01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:19.240
Doris.
Bj O,

O N.
Bjornsen six foot nine and weighs 403 pounds.

1503
01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:28.900
Jeez.
Co riced.
After injuring his knee and basketball,

1504
01:32:28.901 --> 01:32:31.030
we started competing in strong man competition.

1505
01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:36.400
When Iceland strongest man competition that came out sixth and the 2011 world's

1506
01:32:36.491 --> 01:32:41.020
strongest man competition contest.
Haute Shit Dude.
Wow.

1507
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:46.120
As a giant giant dude.
Fucking amen.

1508
01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:52.960
He he bench presses 500 pounds and he weighs 400 pounds somehow.

1509
01:32:53.811 --> 01:32:58.550
I think he's a pussy.
So you can do bitch,
I want you bench bro.

1510
01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.250
It fell on him and talking.
I vent 600 pounds.

1511
01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:04.140
It was like talking shit to the guys in the room with them.
Like you ain't been,

1512
01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:09.020
you ain't big like me.
Okay.
Uh,
um,
Mark Bell,

1513
01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:13.160
you know dude who's been on our podcast for and his brother Chris from a bigger,

1514
01:33:13.161 --> 01:33:14.060
stronger,
faster.

1515
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:17.510
He just had some shit on his Instagram the other day where he's benching way

1516
01:33:17.511 --> 01:33:22.270
over 500 pounds.
She's fucking go real estate wrong.

1517
01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:27.620
Like that guy has huge fucking huge and that's all he wants to do is just lift

1518
01:33:28.671 --> 01:33:33.490
heavy shit.
He's got an awesome gym.
Created this product is,

1519
01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.650
that's what he's real lifting.
Watch this shit.
We'll cut a problem.

1520
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:41.600
He's got this uh,
thing called the slingshot and it,
uh,

1521
01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.370
it supports your elbows and your shoulders when you're a,
when you're benching.

1522
01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.020
It's actually a pretty interesting invention.

1523
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.090
I look at the size of this motherfucker.

1524
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:52.820
Look at how much weight he's pushing out.
That is insanity.

1525
01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:58.610
That's a quarter of a ton.
What in the fuck him.
That was his friend.

1526
01:33:58.730 --> 01:34:01.340
Oh,
okay.
Well,
there's ones,
oh,

1527
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:05.720
Sorry on fucking believable.
Yeah,
I should know that's on him.

1528
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.891
I can't tell you all.

1529
01:34:06.891 --> 01:34:11.020
See actually see his face until he gets up and then he's all of a sudden Mark's

1530
01:34:11.021 --> 01:34:14.980
a ginger.
But this video is a him,
but I know,

1531
01:34:14.981 --> 01:34:17.660
I know one is Instagram of him lifting ungodly.
Wait,

1532
01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:23.870
still all those big muscles.
You've discussed it before.
You know what?

1533
01:34:23.871 --> 01:34:27.440
Jujitsu and stuff,
the endurance factors go up.
Yeah,
for sure.

1534
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:29.090
That's super heavyweight division.

1535
01:34:29.150 --> 01:34:31.430
They're going to be huffing and puffing on the third fucking round.

1536
01:34:31.431 --> 01:34:35.420
Especially if they come in.
They're yoked to the gills.
Yeah.
I wonder,
you know,

1537
01:34:35.421 --> 01:34:39.710
I mean there's very few heavyweights other than Cain Velasquez that can fight

1538
01:34:39.711 --> 01:34:41.480
like a lighter weight fighter,
you know,

1539
01:34:41.481 --> 01:34:46.160
and cane in his prime in particular had just this unbelievable endurance

1540
01:34:46.161 --> 01:34:50.360
threshold.
He could just put paces on guys they just could not tolerate.

1541
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:55.580
And you would watch it.
I'd watch it like ringside and I would try to think,

1542
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:58.190
have I ever seen it?
Ha,
I hit a heavyweight

1543
01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:03.290
<v 7>that active that can keep it up for five rounds.
There's no,
no,
the answer's no.</v>

1544
01:35:03.291 --> 01:35:07.190
I've never seen anybody as fit as Cain was in his prime.

1545
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:10.980
Like no one has the uh,
the kind of endurance that guy be.

1546
01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:13.760
He'll be there again this weekend.
It will be that same condition.

1547
01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:18.080
He's 100% healthy.
I hope so.
He had back surgery,
man.

1548
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:21.230
You never know what the fuck's going to happen to an athlete after back surgery.

1549
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:26.090
Back surgery is a very tricky,
they're pulling pieces of his disks out,
you know,

1550
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:31.640
cause it's disk was impeding on his nerves impinging I guess.
Um,

1551
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.790
and then he's also had shoulder surgery.
He's had knee surgery.

1552
01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:38.250
There's a lot going on.
I'm like,
no one's a bigger Cain Velasquez fan than me.
I,

1553
01:35:38.290 --> 01:35:43.290
I personally think there's only two guys ever that you could put in contention

1554
01:35:43.401 --> 01:35:47.870
for being the greatest of all time.
And that's Kane.
And are those the only two?

1555
01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:51.080
Well it's as far as heavyweights,
those are the two.
The only,

1556
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:54.880
well I guess you got to argue for doom.
Well Sorta,

1557
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:59.480
but Allister,
certainly a combat sports athlete.

1558
01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:02.360
I mean he's one of the most decorated ever.
And you won the k one Grand Prix.

1559
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:04.250
Anyone strike Strikeforce and dream.

1560
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:06.740
So he was the heavyweight champion of three different organizations.

1561
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:08.130
Just never could win.

1562
01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:12.410
I never has one or even had a shot until this next upcoming fight.

1563
01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.110
Anderson Silva fight Daniel Cormier at UFC 200

1564
01:36:17.610 --> 01:36:19.940
is that true?
That's true.

1565
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:23.930
TMZ sports has confirmed he was bullshit and this afternoon I,
this is so good.

1566
01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:28.430
He put a flyer out with UFC 200 that is crazy.

1567
01:36:28.431 --> 01:36:31.040
If he does that because let me tell you something.

1568
01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:36.700
Daniel Cormier is a very strong man and he's a powerful wrestler and Daniel

1569
01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:43.190
Cormier was throwing dudes around at heavyweight and sometimes people forget

1570
01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.840
what he did to rumble Johnson.

1571
01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:50.360
I rumble Johnson Rumble Johnson hits as hard as any fucking light heavyweight

1572
01:36:50.391 --> 01:36:53.580
he's ever walked the face of the planet.
He cracked me on the button,

1573
01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:57.980
me goes down,
gets back up,
whether it's a storm and start to ragdoll in them.

1574
01:36:58.170 --> 01:37:01.250
It starts breaking them.
It takes them down,
strangles him,

1575
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:06.170
broke them and strangle them and and rumbles way bigger than Anderson.

1576
01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.900
You know,
and this is 40 year old Anderson.

1577
01:37:09.850 --> 01:37:14.300
It's is a a very interesting,
um,
very interesting fight.

1578
01:37:14.301 --> 01:37:17.570
That hint that I understood would want that because if it was like the Anderson

1579
01:37:17.571 --> 01:37:21.980
that Jay had just knocked out,
Forrest Griffin,
I'd be like,
Oh shit.
Yeah,

1580
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:24.260
let's see that.
You know,

1581
01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.490
cause Anderson's two fights at light heavyweight or three Stephan Bonner was at

1582
01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:31.190
light heavyweight too,
right?
Wasn't it?
I want to say it is.

1583
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:36.230
I want to say that was a non title affair because I think it was,
um,

1584
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:41.750
that was a headliner in Brazil.
Find out what weight Anderson was when he fought.

1585
01:37:41.751 --> 01:37:45.920
Stephan Bonner.
Two Oh five was it two or five?
I think so.
Well,

1586
01:37:45.921 --> 01:37:48.980
bond or fought Jon Jones.
Bonner Bonner has always been a two oh five it'd be,

1587
01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:53.250
we thought Jon Jones,
205-FIVE-FOUR-3205.
It had to be two oh five two.
Oh,
but I'm,

1588
01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:56.100
I'm just talking about mass bonding has never made one

1589
01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:00.790
<v 3>85 so what am I even saying?
What's the outlook box?</v>

1590
01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.860
But I'm interested in that.
Just a new product that you guys are,
no,

1591
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:07.410
this is just a,
just thought weed.
Okay.
No,
no,

1592
01:38:07.411 --> 01:38:11.070
I want a Panorai then no quickie.
How are you feeling after those three things?

1593
01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:13.980
You don't mean this is,
this is like an appetizer for uncle Joey.

1594
01:38:14.170 --> 01:38:16.830
This is like going to fuck at Ruth Chris.
We did get the clamps.

1595
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:20.430
I don't know how you do it.
I built it.
I work in,
I've been training,

1596
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:23.820
I've been taking this breast spray recently.
How good is it?

1597
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:26.940
How many millet gets me so paranoid?
Does it?

1598
01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:30.780
There's something about the breast spray that just hits you with this burst of

1599
01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:34.740
paranoia and um,
it's not the breath spray,
it's edibles.

1600
01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:39.390
It's just really hope edibles.
He started feeling,

1601
01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.760
there's a point on the plane where I get rid of,

1602
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.440
but that's the point of the plane with my legs can't stop moving and that's the

1603
01:38:46.441 --> 01:38:49.330
fucking worst that happens over a certain altitude.
With edibles,

1604
01:38:49.410 --> 01:38:52.710
my legs can't stop or anything like that.
The crazy leg syndrome.

1605
01:38:52.711 --> 01:38:56.340
So it without the bulls,
you can't fucking judge nothing.
These,

1606
01:38:56.341 --> 01:39:00.390
at least I know I take four or five weeks.
I see the devil because I fall asleep.

1607
01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:05.580
That's it.
I fall asleep.
I get up at four fucking cotton mouth thirsty.

1608
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:07.800
Don't you feel like those?
Feel the doubt.

1609
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:11.970
Meet the devil moments are actually a good for you because even though you,
you,

1610
01:39:11.971 --> 01:39:16.110
you get all fucking crazy paranoid and weirded out and you feel vulnerable and

1611
01:39:16.111 --> 01:39:19.980
strange when it's over you,
you appreciate life more.

1612
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:23.250
It's almost like camping out in the forest for a few days and not having air

1613
01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:26.880
conditioning and coming home and just having a nice cool glass of ice tea.

1614
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:30.150
That sizzle first show for Dolphy sizzled.

1615
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:35.280
As I was getting on stage,
the attaboy hit me punch to the stomach.

1616
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:40.080
I thought I had to sit down and I walked out on stage.

1617
01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:44.670
It was surreal and it kicked into the next level when I walked out once the

1618
01:39:44.671 --> 01:39:49.671
adrenaline and met the THC that's just ran with it and it walked out and it

1619
01:39:50.341 --> 01:39:52.890
ended up perfect.
But Jesus Christ,

1620
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:56.230
you never know what you're putting in your body with those fucking things you

1621
01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.610
never know.
Never fucking know.
Well,
especially from new sources,

1622
01:40:00.570 --> 01:40:05.010
the ship that brought your Jane,
what's your old school Jamie?

1623
01:40:05.011 --> 01:40:07.590
Cause that's how I roll.
What do you got

1624
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:12.810
Joe g is,
when are you going to commit to a fanny pack?
What does this,
this is it.

1625
01:40:12.811 --> 01:40:15.840
This is the visit that that Sarah,
this is it brought to sorrow.

1626
01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:20.290
My Man Chris sent me.
Oh Nice.
I got everything.
Get I got this refund.

1627
01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.680
Joey Diaz has a fanny pack.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1628
01:40:22.710 --> 01:40:26.280
when are you going to get a family?
I got the fucking lighter.

1629
01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.040
They only got the fucking look.
I even got quite loose.
I got,
I got one coin.

1630
01:40:30.041 --> 01:40:34.380
Lou left Cosby,
quaint little gorilla biscuits and shit.
That is a big fanny pack.

1631
01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:37.080
Yeah.
This is the real deal.
Hopefully the big one.
He he,

1632
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:40.710
he's had more than one size,
right?
No,
this is it.

1633
01:40:40.711 --> 01:40:44.220
I think it's just the one he sells as the Joe Rogan utility pack or something

1634
01:40:44.221 --> 01:40:47.150
like that
and this just happened.

1635
01:40:47.151 --> 01:40:51.480
Made to write anything.
It makes us happy.
He makes it easy.
Makes it really good.

1636
01:40:51.481 --> 01:40:55.810
Gies man,
this is the shit to fly with.
Oh yeah.
This is how I fly it.
This,

1637
01:40:56.290 --> 01:40:58.930
that's it.
Yeah.
It's easy and off you put it,
you talk to you.

1638
01:40:58.931 --> 01:41:02.210
You still keep your wallet in your front pocket because yeah,
those fucking,

1639
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:06.940
you know those people.
Fuck people,
those people.
But uh,
no.
This is tremendous.

1640
01:41:06.941 --> 01:41:11.150
You got your keys.
You get him.
Chris due to man's got a real estate company week.

1641
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:16.030
He's coming next week,
but we're going to be an oh,
he's,
yeah,
he's Friday night.

1642
01:41:16.031 --> 01:41:19.690
He's at the Ice House.
Okay.
He's coming in for Ebi.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.

1643
01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:22.890
You like the Ice House next Friday night?
No,
I'm not there for that.
No.

1644
01:41:24.190 --> 01:41:27.460
So here it goes.
A dos Anjos is about to get on stage,

1645
01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:33.130
step into the octagon looking shredded.
What do you think about this fight,

1646
01:41:33.131 --> 01:41:35.620
Joey Diaz?
I know you've been wanting this fight for a long time.

1647
01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:39.070
I think you're an Alvarez Fan,
right?
No,
no,
no.

1648
01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:42.100
I think this is a real barn burner of a fight.
I think so too.

1649
01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.730
I think this is hard against fucking tremendous skill.
I mean,

1650
01:41:45.731 --> 01:41:46.630
this guy's got like,

1651
01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.980
he's a great decorator that you get two guys got like 19 stripes on his black

1652
01:41:50.981 --> 01:41:53.320
belt.
This is the real deal.
This fucking guy.
Yeah.

1653
01:41:53.321 --> 01:41:56.880
Those sign just has a very good Jujitsu game.
But he's also,
his striking is,

1654
01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:01.110
I mean what he did to cowboy Cerrone showed that his striking his fucking spooky

1655
01:42:01.111 --> 01:42:04.390
and shit too and what he did to pedis is even scarier.

1656
01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:09.550
What he is more than anything,
man is super serious and super focused.

1657
01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:13.090
His,
that is a focused man.
And uh,

1658
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:17.150
so who's number one in this division of him?
Want to be sad?
No,
no,
no.
He's,

1659
01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.840
he's the champion.
I beat number.
Good.

1660
01:42:18.841 --> 01:42:22.150
Madoff is definitely the number one contender and the biggest threat to him

1661
01:42:22.151 --> 01:42:27.151
because number Grumet off beat him and he beat him pretty handily just a couple

1662
01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.133
of years ago.

1663
01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:32.930
<v 7>And then number give,
Madoff had series of injuries,</v>

1664
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:37.420
had surgery on his knee,
hurt it again,
had a lot of shit happened.

1665
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:41.750
[inaudible] years.
Yup.
Still Aka he,
Habib,

1666
01:42:41.751 --> 01:42:46.190
Norma Madoff is a fucking nightmare.
Nightmare inside the octagon.

1667
01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.280
His grappling is so high level,
man.

1668
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:53.750
You see any so ferocious in his approaches?
It's not,
I mean it's just,

1669
01:42:53.751 --> 01:42:55.400
it's a sea of salt.

1670
01:42:55.401 --> 01:42:58.790
You fast and hard and when he gets a hold of you in a clinch man,

1671
01:42:58.791 --> 01:43:01.620
he's doing a lot of crazy shit.
He's tripping you.
He's,
he's,

1672
01:43:01.670 --> 01:43:06.650
he'll throw guys he takes guys down with doubles his,
his grip is insane.

1673
01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:10.220
Like he clamps a hold of guys and you see when he's clamping a hold of them,

1674
01:43:10.221 --> 01:43:11.090
let like Whoa,

1675
01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:15.830
like he's just got this level of squeeze and this level of like physical

1676
01:43:15.831 --> 01:43:18.710
strength and the understanding of how to manipulate bodies.

1677
01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:22.910
That's just at a super high level.
When he ragdoll dos Anjos,

1678
01:43:22.911 --> 01:43:27.890
that's when it really opened my eyes.
I was like,
wow,
I did not expect that.

1679
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:30.980
Like I expected a good fight.
I expected a struggle.

1680
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:35.660
But he did the same thing to Nate Diaz.
He beat the fuck out of Nate Diaz man.

1681
01:43:35.661 --> 01:43:39.500
And when you watch the way he did it,
you're like,
wow,
this guy's a tank.

1682
01:43:40.730 --> 01:43:41.720
And that,
you know,
again,

1683
01:43:41.721 --> 01:43:46.400
nick curse on trained athlete and a curse on is of the belief that the strength

1684
01:43:46.401 --> 01:43:47.510
and conditioning is everything.
Man.

1685
01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:50.160
You're gonna know how to put a little bitch down cause the old member it.

1686
01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:51.073
You do not.

1687
01:43:52.590 --> 01:43:55.880
<v 0>I though,
I mean the last I heard he have him working with fighters is Bj.</v>

1688
01:43:55.881 --> 01:43:57.860
He might've worked with other fighters and I don't know about,

1689
01:43:57.861 --> 01:44:01.100
but he's a guy that I would love to sit down and talk to because he was a genius

1690
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:04.100
man.
Super Genius.
So it was Todd Marinovich.

1691
01:44:04.101 --> 01:44:07.610
Now what as an artist now stop playing football.

1692
01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:09.350
Our 30 for 30 on him I think.

1693
01:44:09.351 --> 01:44:12.410
And at the end was the biggest that they talk about how the guy from the Raiders

1694
01:44:12.450 --> 01:44:15.350
got them arrested.
Hmm.
I don't remember the whole thing.

1695
01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:19.110
You put the coconut socks so he will get low a draft pick and he could steal a

1696
01:44:19.111 --> 01:44:22.610
minute.
Shit.
Really?
Yeah.
Davis is the real fucking deal.

1697
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:25.640
I'm surprised Al Davis saying,
Hey,
Trump's running mate.

1698
01:44:26.490 --> 01:44:30.200
That's what the fuck that we'll link to that a few years ago.
Yeah,
that's right.

1699
01:44:30.201 --> 01:44:31.700
He did die.
What the fuck am I thinking?

1700
01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:38.940
The fucking drafted you would do kinky Shit,
you know.

1701
01:44:40.730 --> 01:44:45.050
So here's the question.
Should Bruce Buffer break out the buffer?

1702
01:44:45.051 --> 01:44:48.270
Three 60 for UFC 200 when he introduces Brock Lesnar.

1703
01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.050
Especially now that Brock Lesnar is in the main event,

1704
01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:53.550
he's doing something completely different.
What's he going to do?
Like though?

1705
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:57.170
He went to three no sunshine,
you know made dog.
I know.
Thinks what he's doing.

1706
01:44:57.350 --> 01:45:00.390
What's he doing?
It's a surprise.
And you serious?
Yeah,

1707
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.450
he's doing like a pink type deal.
Oh yeah.

1708
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:07.280
They would come out like going get off the flag on up and we like that.

1709
01:45:07.281 --> 01:45:08.010
Like that.

1710
01:45:08.010 --> 01:45:12.860
He's on the off of the top dressed up like an angel swing down silks.
Yeah.

1711
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:16.370
Look at Eddie Alvarez.
Got Two black eyes.
That's how hard he's been training.

1712
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:18.080
He's coming into this fight.
Beat up.

1713
01:45:20.370 --> 01:45:24.680
Eddie Alvarez has two black eyes,
man.
I mean he wasn't lying about a sparring.

1714
01:45:24.690 --> 01:45:29.580
150 rounds.
Yeah.
Very interesting man.

1715
01:45:29.581 --> 01:45:32.640
Cause Alvarez is the type of dude who rises to the occasion.

1716
01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:36.300
He's got greatness in him,
man.
I mean he's had some wins and some losses.

1717
01:45:36.301 --> 01:45:39.120
Nice inside leg kick.
But at the end of the day,

1718
01:45:39.121 --> 01:45:42.390
this dude's a savage and the most exciting,

1719
01:45:42.391 --> 01:45:44.670
biggest challenge is where he's going to fight as best.

1720
01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:49.290
And that's what we're looking at goes on at Alvarez in the most dangerous

1721
01:45:49.291 --> 01:45:53.730
situation he's been in,
in years.
And the most important.

1722
01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:57.540
That's where a guy like Eddie Alvarez will fucking come to life.

1723
01:45:57.570 --> 01:46:02.500
And that's what makes this exciting.
Dosantos has to be aware.
I'm,

1724
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:06.930
and Alvarez is no fucking joke.
He's got a mind,
his p's and q's as he makes his,

1725
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:11.520
when the differences dos Anjos throws a lot of kicks man.
And uh,

1726
01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:13.620
I'll read through a couple of Nice inside leg kicks,

1727
01:46:13.621 --> 01:46:17.460
but that's generally not what he does.
Once,
once he starts brawling,

1728
01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:21.090
once he starts brawling,
he'll widened his stance and throw bombs.

1729
01:46:21.450 --> 01:46:24.600
Whereas dos Anjos we'll stick with the kickboxing game.

1730
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:28.740
He'll stick kicking those legs and mixing things up.

1731
01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:33.710
It's just a matter of who strategy works the best.
But I,

1732
01:46:33.711 --> 01:46:35.730
I liked that Alvarez came out with those kicks,

1733
01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:40.140
but he hasn't thrown very many sense.
No,
Joe Rogan.
What a weird gift that

1734
01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.730
it,
it'd be a professional fighter.
I want 50 fucking five what a wig gift.

1735
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:51.480
Yeah.
What a weird,
you know,
dangerous choice in life,
man.

1736
01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:57.030
Crazy.
Just unbelievably difficult journey you're on.

1737
01:46:57.930 --> 01:47:00.300
Especially at this level.
I mean,
look how good these guys are.

1738
01:47:01.330 --> 01:47:06.330
Dos Anjos just caught him at the end with that left hand and fatigue may very

1739
01:47:07.441 --> 01:47:10.800
well play a factor in this fight because one of the things again about dos Anjos

1740
01:47:10.801 --> 01:47:13.710
not to harp on this,
but his conditioning is exceptional.

1741
01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:18.090
What he did with with pedes in particular,
oh,

1742
01:47:18.091 --> 01:47:21.900
guillotine getting Eddie's in trouble.

1743
01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:25.430
This motherfucker's got a squeeze and he's got to fight those handoffs.

1744
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.710
Gotta fight those hands off.
Oh Nice knee on the brake.

1745
01:47:33.110 --> 01:47:37.530
You feel that clamp.
Those guys are really good gear teen.

1746
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:40.620
Like you could see it when they clamp onto dude's like whoa.

1747
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:46.820
Like 'em honey ya ya.
You ever see that guy fight honey?

1748
01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.620
I Yaz is tiny gentlemen.
He didn't mean,

1749
01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:53.370
I think he used to fight at one 35 now he's won 25 right?

1750
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.140
Isn't honey at one 30 the one 35 or one 25 [inaudible] not the biggest guy in

1751
01:47:58.141 --> 01:48:02.160
the world.
Find out what way it is.
I think he's a flyweight.
Now.
I might be wrong,

1752
01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:07.460
but anyway,
it doesn't look like a bodybuilder or anything.
Oh,

1753
01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:11.340
dos Anjos caught him with that left high kick and that's what I'm talking about.

1754
01:48:11.341 --> 01:48:13.110
Like he can,
he can add in.
Yeah.

1755
01:48:13.210 --> 01:48:17.990
<v 4>Oh,
Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
Fucking Christ.</v>

1756
01:48:18.190 --> 01:48:22.730
Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
Fucking Christ Jesus.
Oh Jesus.

1757
01:48:22.731 --> 01:48:27.620
He's going to win Jesus fucking Christ.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1758
01:48:27.621 --> 01:48:28.454
Jesus.

1759
01:48:29.110 --> 01:48:29.320
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1760
01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:33.340
<v 4>this is fucking tremendous.
Look at them again.
This is hard against,
fuck.</v>

1761
01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:36.100
Joe Rogan is fucking home

1762
01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:42.090
down like this.
Oh Geez.
It control.
Oh yeah,

1763
01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:45.430
but you don't know where he is.
He doesn't know where he is.
He doesn't know.

1764
01:48:46.090 --> 01:48:48.360
He doesn't know who he is.
This is hard.

1765
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:53.470
I'm gets fucking scowl cuff.
Sakis I been waiting,
put his bucket pipe,

1766
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:56.650
but three fucking months.
This is what I'm talking about.

1767
01:48:57.010 --> 01:48:59.760
This is what the fucking problem is.
The body,

1768
01:48:59.890 --> 01:49:03.130
every once in a while you run into a brick.
Fuck the wall.

1769
01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.830
This Guy Diaz the fuck could they did these people sat looking at,

1770
01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:12.700
Shit,
you got to kill this motherfucker.
It's fucking over.

1771
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:17.110
There's a new one 55 where it's to McGregor.
Now,

1772
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:20.830
where's Conor McGregor now?
This text.
Philadelphia.

1773
01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:22.480
You don't talk mother the pockets.

1774
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:24.863
<v 0>Eddie Alvarez.</v>

1775
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:28.500
<v 4>This is crazy.
I told you this is the pilot a bucket here.</v>

1776
01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.680
You fucking Momos holy shop with your bullshit and mark fucking hot.

1777
01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:38.260
She stopped compared to this.
God Damn

1778
01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:42.360
<v 0>God Damn Eddie Alvarez.</v>

1779
01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.780
<v 4>I told you I was excited when you called me.</v>

1780
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:49.930
This is the fucking fighter he had suckers.
Holy Shit.
Eddie Alvarez.

1781
01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:53.370
She says,
I've got an anxiety attack.
He looks fantastic.

1782
01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:57.220
It's what I'm fucking talking about.
That was spectacular,
man.

1783
01:49:57.221 --> 01:50:01.780
150 rounds.
Joe Rogan fucking spectacular.
Look at this.
Boom.

1784
01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:06.760
That right hand landed there.
The the legs go.
Oh Shit.
Boom,

1785
01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:11.350
boom,
boom.
See again.
Wham.
O He snuck it in right over the guard.

1786
01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:15.010
Oh,
we did the chicken dance.
I'll tell you what dos Anjos.

1787
01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:19.760
He weathered a fucking dollar stores.
No nothing for those sign.

1788
01:50:19.761 --> 01:50:22.600
Use a fucking savage to Conor McGregor.

1789
01:50:22.601 --> 01:50:25.930
You better pack eight lunches if you want to fuck with these motherfuckers.

1790
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:30.370
These motherfuckers cheese.
This is the deck five.

1791
01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:33.130
Oh my God,
Eddie Alvarez,
look at these common

1792
01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.890
enemy America.
Fuck you when you're dumped.
Fight smart contradictions,

1793
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:43.960
but the pocket,
wow.
This was at Joe Rose boy,
Mark Henry.

1794
01:50:43.961 --> 01:50:48.010
That guy is one of the best coaches in MMA today.
Dude from New Jersey.

1795
01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:52.210
Suck my Dick.
You walk when you're fucking machines and your bullshit.

1796
01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:57.250
I'm paid some fucking dude.
Suck my Dick.
And his other client was Frankie Edgar,

1797
01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:00.350
but heart,
they show up with nothing but heart.

1798
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:06.370
And I'm a big fan of Henry's big fan.
Fucking tremendous

1799
01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:13.980
winner by Tko new one 50 are you fucking kidding me?

1800
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:21.640
And he just throws a tremendous wrench into everything now.
Well,

1801
01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:22.750
you know what else it does?

1802
01:51:22.930 --> 01:51:27.010
It lets everybody know how fucking Goddamn good Michael Chandler and I told you

1803
01:51:27.011 --> 01:51:29.380
on the phone,
Joel broke and he came in,
he looked through bots.

1804
01:51:29.381 --> 01:51:32.770
The first fight he bugged Gilbert,
the other guy.

1805
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:36.130
All the first five is a slow fucking starter.
It's over now.

1806
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:41.170
It's over now.
Well,
the first fight,
a lot of pressure.
First of all,
you know,

1807
01:51:41.171 --> 01:51:43.780
first fight in the UFC,
he's careers online,
you know,

1808
01:51:43.781 --> 01:51:46.030
leaves Bella tour as a champion,

1809
01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:49.630
but it shows you how good do you see how good Michael Chandler looked in his

1810
01:51:49.631 --> 01:51:50.870
last fight?
They,

1811
01:51:50.890 --> 01:51:55.850
these two had wars over in Bellator wars and Chandler,
uh,

1812
01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:58.240
just knocked out pit bull in the first round.

1813
01:52:01.670 --> 01:52:04.460
Tam Eddie Alvarez looked good.
I looked fucking tremendous.

1814
01:52:04.461 --> 01:52:07.270
I've got an anxiety attack.
Joe Rohde.
What's my God,

1815
01:52:07.330 --> 01:52:11.190
what we're saying like the Eddie Alvarez is the kind of guy says occasion.

1816
01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:14.510
This is,
this is the shit we forgotten.
There's no,

1817
01:52:15.190 --> 01:52:18.490
you'll see tattoos on him or a goat p and whatnot.
That twos

1818
01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:23.630
motherfucker fucking hot.
Then the animal man,

1819
01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.930
he hits hard to look at that.
Boom.
Oh Shit.

1820
01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:33.620
Oh Shit.
Dos Anjos took some Nah,
they'll sign.
Yes.
Oh my God.

1821
01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:35.420
Was anybody else would have went down by now.

1822
01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:39.260
20 guys would have went down by now.
Fucking Eddie Alvarez.

1823
01:52:41.210 --> 01:52:42.110
<v 2>He's a good dude.</v>

1824
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:48.770
<v 3>Just thanking the people who train them.
Look at this great guy,
man.
Good for him,</v>

1825
01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:53.690
good for him,
and great for the sport to Greg.
Great Guy.
Great for the sport.

1826
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:59.690
Really Likable Guy.
Really marketable guy.
Good for him.
Good for him,

1827
01:52:59.691 --> 01:53:02.720
man.
You know what dose on Joe,
so he'll be back.

1828
01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:07.610
Now that sets up some interesting though,
that being y'all,
I now you got this,

1829
01:53:08.010 --> 01:53:12.290
this,
this throws a monkey wrench into everything,
but you ain't beating this kid.

1830
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:15.890
You Ain't beating this kid for the next two or three fights.
Alvarez.
Yeah,

1831
01:53:15.891 --> 01:53:18.200
you ain't beating him.
This kid's a fucking Philadelphia guy.

1832
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:20.240
He's believing pizza for 20 years.
He's done.

1833
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:24.140
You're going to give him a lobster tail.
Docking lights out,
lights out.

1834
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:28.910
I wonder if he gets a number and Madoff gets a shot at him next.

1835
01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:33.650
I wonder if that's what they set up.
You know?
Uh,

1836
01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:35.840
it's hard to deny.
Nijmegen Madoff his shot.

1837
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:40.110
He's undefeated and he's the number one contender to show real.

1838
01:53:40.111 --> 01:53:43.550
But this is beautiful.
What a beautiful right hand.
He snuck it in there,
man.

1839
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:48.360
And he saw him do that chicken dance.
That's crazy that he didn't go down,
man.
No,

1840
01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:50.600
no,
no.
And you count the punches.
He got hit with,
Oh,

1841
01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:54.350
this is fucking Carlos condit jr he got hit with bombs.

1842
01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:56.120
He's just teeing off on him.

1843
01:53:56.930 --> 01:54:00.590
Herb Dean best in the business right there and just looks at,
he's like,
Yep,

1844
01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:04.880
I seen enough.
I've seen enough and I totally agree.
Perfect.

1845
01:54:04.881 --> 01:54:08.660
Time to stop at Herb Dean is the best.
He really is.

1846
01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:11.660
Who you're breathing heavy cheeses.
You okay with that?

1847
01:54:12.050 --> 01:54:15.380
I was getting anxiety though.
For Real.
Yeah.
Cause you get worked up.

1848
01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:20.150
I love this shit.
This is my life.
But I love it's my business.
I saw hot dog.

1849
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:24.050
This is hard.
That was hard.
That's hard dog.
That's not,
what do you think?

1850
01:54:24.370 --> 01:54:29.370
You're hanging out with your boys and drinking non gluten and he fucking look at

1851
01:54:30.381 --> 01:54:32.720
this tomorrow,
man.
Look at the prelim.
Just the prelims.

1852
01:54:32.721 --> 01:54:37.710
Cat Zingano and Julianna Pena.
Johnny Hendricks and Calvin Gaslamp,
j Dilla,

1853
01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:42.050
Sha Allah.
Sun's out and sage Northcutt and Enrique.
Man,

1854
01:54:42.051 --> 01:54:43.540
there ain't a dime on that card.
Jamie.

1855
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:46.520
Look at the fucking Johnny Hendricks gas domain.
What does that,
uh,

1856
01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:49.580
is that even money?
Yeah.
But they're all pretty much,

1857
01:54:49.581 --> 01:54:53.120
even Frankie Yag is even now,
there ain't a dime on this car.

1858
01:54:53.150 --> 01:54:54.290
If you look at and make a dime,

1859
01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:58.180
you better fucking bet baseball this weekend because this is,
um,

1860
01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:01.400
I got to look at the Friday early card.
Look at us,
look at the main,

1861
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:04.280
oh my goodness.
I make a dollar on this.
Look at the organ.

1862
01:55:04.290 --> 01:55:08.030
The Bet Travis Browne is another dog and he should,
Tate is now the main fight.

1863
01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:11.390
That's the main fight.
Now that's the headline and fight.

1864
01:55:11.391 --> 01:55:15.350
And we should take an Amanda Nunez.
Very interesting.
Look at this.
Joe Rogan.

1865
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:20.320
Tj Dillashaw minus four 10.
I can't make a dime,
but look at that.

1866
01:55:20.321 --> 01:55:21.840
That card,
that's,

1867
01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:26.860
that seems like they decided to have Nesha versus Amanda Nunez over Brock Lesnar

1868
01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:32.420
versus,
is that true?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1869
01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:35.740
So they switched that up because just before that.
Yeah,

1870
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:40.460
just looking at what's opposite.
Somebody made an executive decision.
Well,

1871
01:55:40.461 --> 01:55:44.190
they look at embedded.
They still hold a bikini.
Huh?
That's basically is fuck

1872
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:48.060
this shit.
That's probably what it is.
She should be.
Well,
it might be,

1873
01:55:48.061 --> 01:55:50.100
she might be the best one to sell this card.
Yeah,

1874
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:54.120
but also like from a hardcore fan standpoint,
you got to go,

1875
01:55:54.121 --> 01:55:58.950
how the fuck is all doe in Edgar for the title?
Not even talked about?

1876
01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:03.060
That's,
I mean it's an interim title.
It is an interim belt,
right?

1877
01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:07.770
I mean that's what's going on.
Yeah.
Interim featherweight title,

1878
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:10.380
but it is for the belt.
You know what I mean?

1879
01:56:10.381 --> 01:56:14.590
Obviously Conor McGregor is going to have a hard fucking time making one 55 one

1880
01:56:14.591 --> 01:56:17.400
one 45 again.
I mean I guess he could do it,

1881
01:56:17.401 --> 01:56:21.870
but how much more is he going to do that
after you saw this tonight?

1882
01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:25.830
Yeah,
that one 55 and the be hell's kitchen dog.

1883
01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:29.900
He knows he's going to want to fight these guys.
Would you?
Yeah.

1884
01:56:29.901 --> 01:56:33.210
It kind of wants to fight those guys.
That's where the money is to that kid.

1885
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:37.500
Not only can he throw punches,
but that kid could wrestle to that.
Fuck yeah.

1886
01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:41.430
Alvarez is a very good restaurant and that's how he beat Pettis itch all over

1887
01:56:41.431 --> 01:56:42.530
down there and I'm on us.

1888
01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.030
He's got to come home now and killed Diaz because what he's turning his back to

1889
01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:51.840
is the fucking hell is dead.
It's,
it's the original room on a Tuesday.
You can't,

1890
01:56:52.110 --> 01:56:53.260
there's six people there.

1891
01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:58.530
There's six people that you got those two savages at one 45 and then you got,

1892
01:56:58.590 --> 01:57:02.190
now you got this fucking Philadelphia Kid.
You've got the Brazilian,

1893
01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.220
you got the fucking Russian boom.

1894
01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:08.880
Who else is at one 55 linger and know that Max Holloway kid?
No,

1895
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:10.810
he's 45.
Well,
those kids will live out.

1896
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:14.130
The other kid that you talked about that stayed at one fifth,
the uh,

1897
01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:18.540
Dustin poray.
What's the point?
You got to hell's kitchen down it now.

1898
01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:23.580
So the UFC just got,
it's a tremendous weight class.
Damn.

1899
01:57:23.581 --> 01:57:27.390
Alvarez was throwing bombs.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I feel that pain going on by look.
I mean,

1900
01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:31.710
these are like full count.
These Jamie,
you count these.
He got it fucking Han.

1901
01:57:31.730 --> 01:57:33.570
I'm a bunch of time.
Boom.

1902
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:37.590
I mean full windups significant strikes.

1903
01:57:37.591 --> 01:57:41.160
57 50 fucking seven.

1904
01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:45.950
He landed 57 looking at,
Huh?
Oh,
and you've got no coke.
Oui.
Oh,

1905
01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:49.010
look at that.
Total strikes and significant strikes.
Look,

1906
01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:51.740
all of it strikes were significant Rogan Michael,

1907
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:55.980
she has his number 10 looking at and row.
Oh,
what are you saying,
Jamie?

1908
01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:59.190
That might not be perfectly updated,

1909
01:57:59.191 --> 01:58:02.340
but what the mouse just because they're both the same.
Yeah,

1910
01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:06.480
but that means he just hit him every time hard while I was a significant strikes

1911
01:58:06.481 --> 01:58:08.340
and strikes.
They can be the same thing.

1912
01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:12.990
The fight before with Roy Nelson and Lewis and the more different from the stats

1913
01:58:12.991 --> 01:58:17.040
on here.
Oh,
okay.
All right.
That's interesting.
Okay.

1914
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:20.370
Who is Joe Rogan?
Huh?
So it might not be updated.
Yeah,

1915
01:58:20.610 --> 01:58:22.770
they're showing you right there when he was setting this up.

1916
01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:25.830
Now making Madoff is a beast,
man.
Well,

1917
01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:29.160
I mean he's been the number one contender for a long time and he's a very

1918
01:58:29.161 --> 01:58:31.620
skillful man.
Very skillful,
very strong.

1919
01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:36.960
If he can get through camp and be healthy,
but that's a significant if,

1920
01:58:37.290 --> 01:58:42.100
because he's pulled out a couple times now and had pretty significant

1921
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.460
<v 7>injuries.
No one's a bigger fan of that dude than me.
I think he's a,</v>

1922
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:49.390
he's one of the biggest puzzles.
The one of the most difficult puzzles to solve.

1923
01:58:49.391 --> 01:58:54.070
And the division Amy supposed to fight Tony,
but,
um,
they had,
uh,

1924
01:58:55.210 --> 01:58:59.800
they had to postpone that fight,
so it'd be,

1925
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:03.430
I was one of the best fights I've ever seen Tony had to pull out at due to an

1926
01:59:03.431 --> 01:59:07.690
injury.
Right.
Tony got injured lung infection or yeah,
lots of something.

1927
01:59:07.691 --> 01:59:10.150
And that's when that young man who,
uh,
what was his name,

1928
01:59:10.151 --> 01:59:14.590
who just fought number Grumet off the young guy who took the fight on real short

1929
01:59:14.591 --> 01:59:16.300
notice.
And uh,

1930
01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:21.190
this motherfucker had just gotten like surgery on his elbow like a six weeks ago

1931
01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:25.000
or some crazy shit.
It might've been less than that.
He's nuts.

1932
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:28.343
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1933
01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:31.990
<v 7>Darrell Horcher,
Darrell Horcher,
that guy's a stud,</v>

1934
01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:34.930
took that fight against Dharma Madoff.
Nobody wanted that fight.

1935
01:59:34.931 --> 01:59:38.650
Took that fight on short notice and fought well fought real well,

1936
01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:42.730
especially for a guy would just merely didn't have any time to prepare for it.

1937
01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:46.030
But I think that Norma Madoff needed that fight too.

1938
01:59:46.031 --> 01:59:49.690
He needed a fight against a guy that may not,
you know,

1939
01:59:49.691 --> 01:59:53.990
first fight in the UFC.
You might not have been a,
I'm just teasing.

1940
01:59:55.110 --> 01:59:58.120
Sally's quoting,
you'll excuse me.
It might not have been as well prepared.

1941
01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:58.631
You know,

1942
01:59:58.631 --> 02:00:02.920
I think that a normal gromit off probably need to knock the dust off a little

1943
02:00:02.921 --> 02:00:07.880
bit.
He's out for two years.
Two years with injuries.
Man.
That's just one ACO.

1944
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:12.430
Lot of shit wrong.
He got hurt again.
Yep.
Same knee got hurt twice.

1945
02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:17.550
Yeah.
I think he might've rushed is a comeback sometimes guys do that guy,

1946
02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:20.440
a lot of guys had done that.
They uh,
they hurt their knee.

1947
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:24.820
And then in the process of rehabbing it,
short fuse,
Herman did that hurt.

1948
02:00:24.821 --> 02:00:29.080
It was rehabbing it.
Um,
started training again.
Blew it out again.

1949
02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:31.720
Um,
Capa guys,
I've had that happen

1950
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:36.390
<v 4>dog.
I'm still overwhelmed by that site.
I'm still overwhelmed.
Incredible.</v>

1951
02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:38.190
Like my head can't even rent my,

1952
02:00:38.191 --> 02:00:42.180
I can't believe it had a funny fucking feeling too.
I was like,
you know what man,

1953
02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:46.980
this is the battle right here.
This is going to be a great fucking fight.
Yeah.

1954
02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:51.110
But you know,
we weren't in fucking Vegas to better.

1955
02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:53.670
So who gives a fuck,
Jamie?
And if we were,

1956
02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:58.290
I would have bet you would've been on Ebay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just a yard stick.

1957
02:00:58.291 --> 02:01:01.890
Just to watch the fucking fight.
You got to give the kid the benefit of doubt.

1958
02:01:02.130 --> 02:01:03.960
That's one of the greatest lines in any movie.

1959
02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:08.100
When the loan shark gives rocky 500 and it goes,
you don't have to pay me back.

1960
02:01:08.101 --> 02:01:10.950
I think lady luck as in your colon.
I kept hearing that all fucking week,

1961
02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:15.000
lady La kids.
Fuck on man.
I love all that shit.
That's,

1962
02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:19.890
that's how much of an underdog was he?
Not much and a half to one.
That's it.

1963
02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:22.600
That's it.
It wasn't this no doll.
That's amazing.

1964
02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:25.720
No double have thrown a yard stick just to watch and have assaulted.

1965
02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:27.860
That's amazing.
There's no doubt as we go.

1966
02:01:28.170 --> 02:01:32.100
Vegas took such a bat on Nate Diaz that now they tightened their lines on

1967
02:01:32.101 --> 02:01:34.350
fucking Vegas when they'd be as did that.

1968
02:01:34.351 --> 02:01:37.620
They paid out hundreds of thousands and they said,
fuck it.
That's it.

1969
02:01:37.621 --> 02:01:40.310
No more mistakes with this.
They got [inaudible].

1970
02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.710
<v 3>They got everybody in on it helping out with the lines.</v>

1971
02:01:42.711 --> 02:01:46.190
Now there's no more mistakes.
For a long time.
You see week lines,

1972
02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:48.740
you know you want to bet football and make money,
go shit.

1973
02:01:48.930 --> 02:01:52.280
If you lose the September,
you're a fucking loser.
You Bet.

1974
02:01:52.281 --> 02:01:54.560
Basketball the first three weeks in November,

1975
02:01:54.561 --> 02:01:58.700
you're going to win the lines a week home.
The next home on a Tuesday night,

1976
02:01:58.701 --> 02:02:01.610
they give him three.
Come on,
they're going to run away with,
you know,

1977
02:02:01.611 --> 02:02:05.540
Shit like that.
That's common sense shit.
But then they tightened their shit up.

1978
02:02:05.541 --> 02:02:09.430
Come December.
Same thing happened.
You know when I first you should go to your,

1979
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:13.460
we use ago just in my thought,
not even what you would say to me.

1980
02:02:13.461 --> 02:02:15.440
I would win money than the first fight.

1981
02:02:15.441 --> 02:02:18.670
I have a bet with Sean shirt against Frankie.
I was just sick and tired.

1982
02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:22.310
They go on.
I could have made money this weekend cause the lines were dog shit.

1983
02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:25.960
You would talk to me on the plane about generalities and I'd watched

1984
02:02:25.961 --> 02:02:29.540
generalities and I was a fucking dummy and I'd put it together.

1985
02:02:29.541 --> 02:02:33.290
Can you imagine somebody who knew the game,
like somebody who was a fighter,

1986
02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:37.760
you could've killed Vegas early.
Now,
I think after Diaz,
whatever.

1987
02:02:37.761 --> 02:02:41.240
Cause I always look,
I always look at some of my blood,
I gotta look,

1988
02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.940
but after the gas there's no more mistakes.

1989
02:02:43.941 --> 02:02:47.300
And then they used to have a lot of mistakes in the undercards because listen,

1990
02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:49.850
you're going to gamble to make money.
If you want to be with Beanie,

1991
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:53.000
you might as well go get it.
Your palm read.
That's not gambling.

1992
02:02:53.001 --> 02:02:55.170
Gambling is to make money and to put your,

1993
02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:57.740
your percentage is higher than make a fucking living.

1994
02:02:58.130 --> 02:03:00.800
So it doesn't matter what I bet.
Well,
I had,

1995
02:03:00.801 --> 02:03:04.880
Ronda doesn't really fucking mad if you had Holly Holm because some idiot in

1996
02:03:04.881 --> 02:03:09.881
Tennessee bet 200,000 on the opening fight that nobody looked at because he knew

1997
02:03:11.961 --> 02:03:12.710
that the fucking,

1998
02:03:12.710 --> 02:03:16.730
you know what has been some times where we brought in guys where I look at the

1999
02:03:16.731 --> 02:03:18.200
line and uh,

2000
02:03:18.230 --> 02:03:21.800
I know who they were and I know how good they were and I'd be like,

2001
02:03:21.801 --> 02:03:24.780
this line is crazy.
Yeah.
They don't know.
There's been a no meeting five times.

2002
02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:25.970
Nobody really knows.

2003
02:03:26.150 --> 02:03:30.650
But you also have a thing in the UFC calls first time jitters.

2004
02:03:31.190 --> 02:03:33.800
The crowd grow show,
you don't really know how to judge it.

2005
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:37.490
There's some guys you know,
won't get first round genders.
There's a certain,

2006
02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:41.540
there's a certain level of God that operates at such a professional level that

2007
02:03:41.541 --> 02:03:45.950
they're pretty much always operate at that level.
It's weird.
He kind of,

2008
02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:50.150
you can kind of guess when guys won't get UFC jitters.
It's real weird,
man.

2009
02:03:50.210 --> 02:03:52.220
I can't guess.
You got good.
I can,

2010
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:54.340
I don't know where they're coming from and what organization.

2011
02:03:54.341 --> 02:03:56.360
There's only a few guys.
We haven't got the far with them.

2012
02:03:56.361 --> 02:04:01.361
So Alster didn't get UFC jitters at all at all.

2013
02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:06.350
And when he came to the UFC,
uh,
it was when,
you know,

2014
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:09.360
drug testing was a little bit their phone.
That's right.

2015
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:12.580
But he watched that Brock fight.
Oh,
you fucking,

2016
02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:15.200
he just kicked him right in the fucking side.
But not only that,

2017
02:04:15.230 --> 02:04:16.820
that was his first fight in the UFC.

2018
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:20.090
So everybody's waiting to see him and I've been waiting to see him forever.

2019
02:04:20.230 --> 02:04:20.961
So you know,

2020
02:04:20.961 --> 02:04:25.160
I'm a big kickbox and fan and he was the k one Grand Prix champion as I've

2021
02:04:25.161 --> 02:04:30.050
watched this kickboxing matches with Badr Hari and go con Saki and I mean he's a

2022
02:04:30.051 --> 02:04:33.990
worldclass kickboxer so I was like if this guy can keep people off often there's

2023
02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:35.960
a lot of people that are fucked because this is a,

2024
02:04:35.961 --> 02:04:37.980
you're going to see some stupid high

2025
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.090
<v 7>level striking.
I mean his striking,
it's very clean man.</v>

2026
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:46.920
Real dangerous.
Especially when he was jacked.
We were super Overeem Uber Him.

2027
02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:52.860
He's one of those guys man.
So like his for when when I saw him fight in the UFC,

2028
02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:54.750
I'm like this guy's not going to have first round jitters.

2029
02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:58.080
It's not going to have first fight jitters.
He's just fought too many times.

2030
02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:58.830
It's fun.

2031
02:04:58.830 --> 02:05:03.830
Prides for dreams want k one was the Strikeforce heavyweight champion.

2032
02:05:03.841 --> 02:05:05.340
He was a dream heavyweight and he's not going to get,

2033
02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:07.910
he's not going to get rattled.
It might.
That was his first wife.

2034
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:12.570
I mean he might lose.
You just came in and went for that fucking stomach.

2035
02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:15.810
Played that victim pulled out fight.
Find them.

2036
02:05:16.290 --> 02:05:19.440
Find the Brock Lesnar.
Alastar Overeem fight.

2037
02:05:19.890 --> 02:05:24.890
Cause that I just want to look it over him to body real quick because when that

2038
02:05:25.531 --> 02:05:29.340
guy,
is it a,
it's on fight pass,
right?
Yeah.
You can find it on fight pass.

2039
02:05:29.341 --> 02:05:33.750
I'm sure the stream has ended.
Thank you for watching.
God Damn Eddie Alvarez.

2040
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:38.160
Congratulations.
You fucking savage.

2041
02:05:38.970 --> 02:05:41.100
Is there a um,
you know,
we've got to get dude,

2042
02:05:41.101 --> 02:05:45.420
we got to get the new apple TV cause this old apple TV is dog shit compared to

2043
02:05:45.421 --> 02:05:48.940
the new one.
The new one's bad.
Oh,
the new one.
They liked that hawk.

2044
02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:53.400
They were Redman bands.
I wouldn't buy it,
but red band has it is dope.

2045
02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:56.940
How much is,
I don't know.
Apple Watch.

2046
02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:01.760
Oh you
boy.

2047
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:05.850
It's after 100 Brock versus Overeem.

2048
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:12.760
Uh,
I wouldn't say it's more than one at one 41.
There it is.
Wow.
Yeah.

2049
02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:17.960
Six foot five two 56 versus six foot three two 65.

2050
02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:21.900
They let me tell you something.
They both way to 65 cause I,

2051
02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:23.550
I remember with them weighing in.

2052
02:06:24.690 --> 02:06:29.690
I don't think Allister wade a hair under like two 60 they're both like the same

2053
02:06:30.151 --> 02:06:30.984
weight.

2054
02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:33.600
<v 1>I think God,
it's hard to remember.</v>

2055
02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:40.330
<v 7>Yeah.
See this,
this thing is whack of dishes.
The new one you can kind of,
okay,</v>

2056
02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:44.230
I'll do it.
The new one you swipe your finger across.
He could pick a point.

2057
02:06:44.530 --> 02:06:47.170
It's got like a swipe pad on it.
Just like a,

2058
02:06:47.171 --> 02:06:50.410
you're a keypad on your laptop is that kind of thing.

2059
02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.960
The new one's dope and you can talk into it.
Joey Diaz,
what?

2060
02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:58.120
You can talk into your,
your eye,
apple TV remote.

2061
02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:01.570
Tell what you want to watch.
Like what's up shit.

2062
02:07:01.630 --> 02:07:03.220
What was that movie that you were in?

2063
02:07:03.250 --> 02:07:06.690
The one that saved Christmas that you were in a series of the dog and saved

2064
02:07:06.691 --> 02:07:08.860
Christmas.
By the way.
I told you before,
I will tell you again,

2065
02:07:09.070 --> 02:07:12.730
my kids love that fucking movie.
They love it.
They still watching love it.

2066
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.860
Especially the six year olds,
just like eight of them.

2067
02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:19.600
They love us like eight of those fucking movies.
They loved that.
That's Joey.

2068
02:07:19.601 --> 02:07:24.100
Joey's been over here.
They just like,
they love it.
They love seeing you on TV.

2069
02:07:24.101 --> 02:07:28.660
They laugh,
they think it's so funny.
Those are fun movies,
man.

2070
02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:31.450
I don't remember what my point was.
What was I gonna say?

2071
02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:35.110
Pull them up with your voice on that.
So I could say the dog to saved,

2072
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:40.390
I'd say an into the remote and it would find it finds,
it just shows up on uh,

2073
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:45.820
the uh,
the screen and you're like,
Yep,
that's it.
You talk to the thing.

2074
02:07:45.821 --> 02:07:50.770
Yeah,
you do.
You talk to it.
It does searches within in the God damn future.

2075
02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:54.910
Joey Diaz.
So strange.
Strange time to be alive.

2076
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:58.810
So we're fast four in this thing until we get to the Brock Lesnar.

2077
02:07:59.050 --> 02:08:02.350
Alistair Overeem,
slug fest.

2078
02:08:04.090 --> 02:08:04.923
So like,

2079
02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:08.890
that's a guy that I didn't think was going to have a hard time competing in the

2080
02:08:08.891 --> 02:08:10.660
UFC.
Tim Kennedy,
that's another one.

2081
02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:13.930
When he came over to the UFC and my people have been shooting at him and

2082
02:08:13.931 --> 02:08:17.560
Afghanistan for years,
he's not going to get rattled coming into the UFC.

2083
02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:19.720
He was fine.
Luke Rockhold same thing.

2084
02:08:20.110 --> 02:08:22.810
There's like a bunch of guys where you just knew they were going to be fine.

2085
02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:26.590
Lorens Larkin,
he's another one.
Robbie Lawler,
when he came back to the UFC,

2086
02:08:27.190 --> 02:08:28.990
he's not going to get rattled at all.

2087
02:08:29.170 --> 02:08:33.850
You know Robbie Lawler is as savage as they come.
That dude,

2088
02:08:34.330 --> 02:08:39.130
there's like no pure expression of like primal combat.

2089
02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:43.360
Then like his fights with Johny Hendricks,

2090
02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:46.570
the second fight in particular and his fight with Rory Macdonald.

2091
02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:51.720
Just blood and guts and it's Carlos condit fight both those guys just blood and

2092
02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:55.000
guts like fuck.

2093
02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:56.733
<v 2>Got It here.</v>

2094
02:08:58.240 --> 02:08:59.140
<v 7>See where we're at here.</v>

2095
02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:03.250
Two 31 and 27 seconds in here.

2096
02:09:06.730 --> 02:09:08.980
Is Our internet still dog shit aim Jamie.

2097
02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:10.753
<v 2>Uh,</v>

2098
02:09:11.590 --> 02:09:15.640
<v 7>it's gotten any better.
Wow.
Look,
the fight is this.</v>

2099
02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:18.280
This is a long ass time ago.

2100
02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:22.820
It doesn't seem like it has one 41 but there's 60 UFC is,

2101
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:26.350
I go almost in Gambia region.

2102
02:09:33.630 --> 02:09:37.610
<v 3>I got to move this up a little bit here.
So a Joey d is,</v>

2103
02:09:37.611 --> 02:09:41.270
where are you doing your Special Chicago?
Oh Shit.

2104
02:09:41.450 --> 02:09:46.250
Rosemont xannies Oh shit.
Blue collar.
Like a motherfucker like a motherfucker.

2105
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:51.260
After my storage where I started full time training only I sets,

2106
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:56.100
you know I'm going to go fucking commando him till he does.

2107
02:09:56.150 --> 02:09:59.960
I got to go GSP and the routes.
I got a coach.

2108
02:09:59.961 --> 02:10:04.280
I've got everything old school.
You got to calm any coach?
Yeah.
Who'd you call me?

2109
02:10:04.281 --> 02:10:08.720
Coach Red Fox.
How's he helping you?
I don't know.
From the grave.
From the grave.

2110
02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:11.840
He talked to Eddie Griffin to the bathroom at the comedy store.

2111
02:10:13.530 --> 02:10:13.700
<v 7>That's</v>

2112
02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:16.160
<v 3>something that's up to my fucking house with some chickens though.</v>

2113
02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:19.110
Saying something.
Do you remember that?
Come on.

2114
02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:22.860
I'll never forget that horrible fucking scene.
Even though the movie was,

2115
02:10:23.070 --> 02:10:27.680
that movie was ridiculous.
It was hilarious.
I love movies like that.
Foolish ways.

2116
02:10:27.681 --> 02:10:31.800
My,
that's my personal roadhouse brother.
I remember his name was foolish waste.

2117
02:10:31.801 --> 02:10:36.050
Which yeah,
that would be green light.
The Red Light.
It was different.

2118
02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:40.610
Whatever.
Some with the light areas you thought I forgot it.
Shit.

2119
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:46.290
<v 7>That was a master p production.
Oh look at Nate Diaz.</v>

2120
02:10:46.291 --> 02:10:49.770
It looks like a young boy here.
Nate Diaz winner by unanimous decision.

2121
02:10:50.010 --> 02:10:50.843
He looks so young.

2122
02:10:51.930 --> 02:10:56.160
So now Overeem is standing in the in the cage.

2123
02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:57.353
This is weird.

2124
02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:02.600
They're showing Nate Diaz backstage while Overeem is fighting about to fight

2125
02:11:04.411 --> 02:11:06.180
Brock Lesnar.
I don't understand what's going on here.

2126
02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:16.200
Oh,
okay.
The Brock Lesnar fight.
I pat fast forwarded through it.

2127
02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:18.130
Woopsies

2128
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:27.660
so,
um,
are you self producing this thing?
No.
Your special wave,

2129
02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:33.170
uh,
whose,
which is a,
what's new wave?
They did all the little specials.

2130
02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:37.790
<v 3>I did a bunch of specialists that did Thompson goes</v>

2131
02:11:38.830 --> 02:11:42.280
<v 7>um,
this,
this doesn't make any sense.
I feel like the Manny Gambier and fight,</v>

2132
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:44.610
they might've showed it afterwards.
It doesn't make sense.

2133
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:48.610
<v 3>Yay.
Yay.
Yay.
Yay.
Yay.
Maybe it is.
Maybe that's what it was.</v>

2134
02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:52.060
<v 7>Yeah.
Must be the Manny gambler and fight.</v>

2135
02:11:52.061 --> 02:11:54.170
It must've been a fight that they showed after the main event.

2136
02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:57.620
The main event happens.
Quick minutes left.
What?
We always do that,

2137
02:11:57.770 --> 02:12:00.890
which is actually kind of cool.
Then you get to see some of the prelims,

2138
02:12:00.891 --> 02:12:03.320
some of the excellent prelim fights.
All right,

2139
02:12:03.321 --> 02:12:05.410
so we're going to take this back to two hours in.

2140
02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:07.880
That's probably when the fight took place.

2141
02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:11.300
<v 3>So they did Thompson girls too.
Is that what you said?
Yeah,</v>

2142
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:16.130
they did a bunch of people.
They did Ali Wong.
I heard Ali Wong,
uh,

2143
02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:19.190
at the comedy store the other night.
She was fucking hilarious dog.

2144
02:12:19.191 --> 02:12:22.930
She's always hilarious.
She's hilarious.
And when she was pregnant up there,

2145
02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:26.380
when she was ready to bust,
she just her special.
When she was pregnant,

2146
02:12:26.530 --> 02:12:28.520
she was killing me.
One night on a Sunday night,

2147
02:12:28.521 --> 02:12:31.910
I went down there and she went up white two before me.

2148
02:12:31.911 --> 02:12:36.560
I went to Blackstone to the gills and she said some shit that my fucking jaw

2149
02:12:36.561 --> 02:12:41.420
dropped.
I couldn't stop laughing.
It's her delivery,

2150
02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:45.990
her voice.
She's got that shit down to a science man.

2151
02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:47.270
She got the,
he's very good.

2152
02:12:49.710 --> 02:12:54.650
<v 7>They're the size of that motherfucker back then.
God Damn Uber Dream.</v>

2153
02:12:57.810 --> 02:13:01.140
<v 3>It was a ridiculously big back then.
Here we go.</v>

2154
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:07.420
So you fucking eaten.
You're shooting,
you eat and a boat.

2155
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:11.300
What are you doing to get that big dog?
Him?
Yeah.
You're doing,
Geez.

2156
02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:13.860
Is this jeans a big part of his,
his jeans.

2157
02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.970
You're doing people you're doing fucking doing.
You're doing viking come.

2158
02:13:17.971 --> 02:13:19.870
That's where you're doing fucking out of.

2159
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:22.950
You're eating the fucking 16 eggs for breakfast,

2160
02:13:22.951 --> 02:13:25.340
but all that stuff is not going to give you that bone structure or

2161
02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:27.680
<v 7>that bone structures insane.
I mean,</v>

2162
02:13:27.681 --> 02:13:31.680
he's built like a fucking shaved down gorilla.
There's no one built that guy.

2163
02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:32.010
I mean,

2164
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:35.400
<v 3>that is one of the biggest athletes you ever going to see in the heavyweight</v>

2165
02:13:35.401 --> 02:13:38.460
division.
Both of these guys.
Yeah.
Both these guys,
these guys.

2166
02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:43.080
Now this is pre Uber.
This is Uber.
This is Uber aim.

2167
02:13:43.230 --> 02:13:44.970
This is when you look at the size of him.

2168
02:13:44.971 --> 02:13:49.020
He's fucking Jack Modified here watching the,
when they um,

2169
02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:53.700
he's got lane,
must be 63.
There it goes.

2170
02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:57.870
Alster way to 63 broccoli to 66.

2171
02:13:58.350 --> 02:14:01.920
It's fucking crazy.
That's so heavy.

2172
02:14:05.190 --> 02:14:09.990
He's got to cut weight to make two 66 two it was like cool Brock fucking mood

2173
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:12.780
and he's way bigger than two 66.
He's huge.

2174
02:14:13.410 --> 02:14:17.070
He probably weighs two 80 to 85 I bet he cuts.

2175
02:14:17.370 --> 02:14:22.370
I wouldn't be surprised if at some point in time he cut as much as 25 get that

2176
02:14:22.981 --> 02:14:25.950
bay and he's been playing football.
They life.

2177
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:31.290
They just developed this wild quickness.
Cho,
they don't play baseball growing up.

2178
02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:35.100
They throw that fucking thing at track and we'll,

2179
02:14:35.101 --> 02:14:38.610
have you ever seen his combine numbers?
No.
They're ridiculous.

2180
02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:41.820
Come on other crazy.
Oh yeah.
He's an elite athlete.

2181
02:14:42.170 --> 02:14:47.170
Like is a vertical leap long jump amount of times he can bench press 225 pounds

2182
02:14:48.091 --> 02:14:51.600
or something.
It was like 50 or something ridiculous.
He's one of those guys.

2183
02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:56.680
He's a freak.
I mean,

2184
02:14:56.850 --> 02:14:59.640
yeah.
Let's see what his combine numbers are.
What do this,

2185
02:14:59.730 --> 02:15:03.450
he did a 40 and 47 come on,
man.

2186
02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:07.500
He's got a 10 foot standing broad jump,
35 inch vertical leap

2187
02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:11.490
and his bench and squat numbers are ridiculous.

2188
02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:15.780
[inaudible] can Seikos 40 to 25 say that again.

2189
02:15:15.810 --> 02:15:19.800
30 Times he bends to 25 Jesus Christ.
30 Times.

2190
02:15:20.670 --> 02:15:25.140
If he did a four,
seven what did Conseco do?
Yeah.

2191
02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:30.180
Conseco was like fucking four,
four really?
Let's see.
Let's see.

2192
02:15:30.330 --> 02:15:32.970
Oh fuck it go.
That's 40 basis.

2193
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:36.630
That's something that at that size you can't do that shit.

2194
02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:40.230
You gotta write 40 Jamie.
It's been the 40

2195
02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:47.720
you don't think he ran it?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
They had it.
They had us,

2196
02:15:47.730 --> 02:15:52.200
he claimed,
oh,
he claimed he claimed he cleaned.

2197
02:15:54.070 --> 02:15:58.890
Well,
listen bro,
but he's a serious athletes.
Look at the 40 40 club.

2198
02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:02.970
Okay.
Just hit that.
That's what tells you how many of you,

2199
02:16:02.971 --> 02:16:06.580
how many people in the 40 40 club.
You know,

2200
02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:10.500
there's not a lot of people in that job.
He was,
that was that Jose Conseco.

2201
02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:15.030
This is what I'm telling you that to get that you have to be fast.

2202
02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:17.790
And three of the three of those people

2203
02:16:19.470 --> 02:16:23.430
were accused of certain things.
Yeah,
all of them.
But probably did it.
I Dunno.

2204
02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:28.290
I Dunno if Alfonso Soriano,
but how many in all the baseball,

2205
02:16:28.291 --> 02:16:30.400
there's only been four 44 forties

2206
02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:33.430
<v 7>here we go.
Look at this.</v>

2207
02:16:37.130 --> 02:16:41.690
Okay.
The size of that motherfucker,
and again,
this is like,

2208
02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:46.040
I don't even think it was a year after Brock Lesnar had some serious surgery and

2209
02:16:46.041 --> 02:16:50.780
his stomach,
they removed like 12 inches of his colon.
Right?
Well,

2210
02:16:50.781 --> 02:16:54.300
it's not just the size of Alster,

2211
02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:59.320
but Al's dirt is highly skillful as a striker and just as big as Brock.

2212
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:06.200
So lucky he's got the horsepower to keep them off of him and his striking is

2213
02:17:06.201 --> 02:17:09.980
just fucking elite.
And so all he has to do is take his time,

2214
02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:13.610
stay on the outside like he's doing right now,
way for those openings.

2215
02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:17.060
And then when he finds a make the most out of them and you see like it just

2216
02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:19.820
slips away from that Jab.
Like you ain't going to hit him that easy.

2217
02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:22.220
He's going to hang on.
The outside is not going to charge at you.

2218
02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:26.120
Look at Nice counter,
right hand season common counters.

2219
02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:30.830
Super Dangerous to strike with this guy.

2220
02:17:30.831 --> 02:17:35.540
He's so clever because like he's had some knockout losses.

2221
02:17:35.541 --> 02:17:38.180
He's a human being.
I mean if a guy like Ben Rothwell catches him,

2222
02:17:38.190 --> 02:17:40.160
he's going to go out.
Everybody goes out.

2223
02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:44.960
But when you watch him knockout junior dos Santos and you see how he set that
up,

2224
02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:48.440
caught him with that left upper cut.
You realize how God damn good he is.

2225
02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:49.820
He's sneaky.

2226
02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:51.553
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2227
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:56.630
<v 7>And who did it?
I asked her just beat was Dosantos his last fight.</v>

2228
02:17:58.950 --> 02:18:01.910
I feel like it wasn't.
No,
I don't think it wasn't,

2229
02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:15.510
but neither of his body fucking
thank you.

2230
02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:21.600
The power to the body.
He stopped Lawsky,
right?
Yeah.

2231
02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:24.643
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2232
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:28.250
<v 7>Well seeing the them look at boom,
run lessons.
This is going right,</v>

2233
02:18:28.251 --> 02:18:30.680
but a bread basket.
Yeah.
What's also these?
You fuck them up?

2234
02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:34.040
Shots are so powerful.
He's his technique.

2235
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:38.420
His Moitai,
his knees to the body in particular.
There's so devastating.

2236
02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:42.200
He's like one of the best ever in the heavyweight division for throwing knees to

2237
02:18:42.201 --> 02:18:45.600
the body without kicks at them.
Right back to watch WWE,

2238
02:18:45.630 --> 02:18:49.530
but still left kick watch.
We slipped.
His left kick walking.
He said,

2239
02:18:49.550 --> 02:18:52.970
you can see that on his face as he was going down.
Fuck this shit.

2240
02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:56.480
Wait to move back to rehearsal.
He sets up this switch.

2241
02:18:56.481 --> 02:18:57.470
Kick to the body right here.

2242
02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:04.610
There's a moment where Brock is throwing the right hand and ouster slips the

2243
02:19:04.611 --> 02:19:09.230
left kick underneath it.
No problem.
Boom.
Look at that knee.
Oh Shit.
No.

2244
02:19:09.231 --> 02:19:12.050
That ain't even hit though.
That's not it,
but no,
that was it.
He was,

2245
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:17.090
here comes a kick.
Boom.
There it is.
That's it right there.
That's it.
Boom.

2246
02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:19.550
It was that kick,
that left power kick.

2247
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:21.650
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2248
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:26.400
<v 7>backup.
I've got,
uh,</v>

2249
02:19:26.530 --> 02:19:28.130
that left kick is a thing

2250
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:32.120
<v 4>of beauty,
man.
But you know what,
Joe here and I'm way before that he was,</v>

2251
02:19:32.121 --> 02:19:36.390
you could see it on Brock's face,
bro.
No,
he certainly did.
But he was getting,

2252
02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:42.000
boom,
there it is.
He was doing nothing but hurt.
No Allister,

2253
02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:43.490
that house,

2254
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:48.490
that version announced or when the scariest guys ever still is rocky was like,

2255
02:19:48.621 --> 02:19:51.950
fuck this shit.
What do you think about him and Steve Bay?

2256
02:19:51.951 --> 02:19:54.770
What's your thoughts on that fight?
Because you're going to be there.

2257
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:57.830
It's going to be a great fucking fight.
You know,

2258
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:05.480
this guy's kickboxing is so advanced,
more than steel.

2259
02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:10.730
Steve Bay,
you think so?
This guy spinning in Phuket,

2260
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:15.530
Thailand and Bangkok and the jungles of debt.
Winkled John's,
you know,

2261
02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:19.130
it's a different,
it's a different type of fighter.
I mean,

2262
02:20:19.131 --> 02:20:22.840
I'm not saying that I'm not taking anything away from her dorm or anything.
Uh,

2263
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:26.500
I had a feeling he was going to knock fucking,
we're doing mouth.
Really.

2264
02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:30.200
I had a feeling,
I just had a feeling he wanted it.
He wanted to live Joe.

2265
02:20:30.201 --> 02:20:34.490
He wanted it,
he wanted it.
And those types of guys are fucking,
uh,
you know,

2266
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:39.050
so boom.
Now you've got this,
this guy,

2267
02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:44.210
and they're doing it in Cleveland,
but this guy has experienced,
you know,

2268
02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:46.820
if he's at Winkeljohn,
one thing about Winkle,
John's,

2269
02:20:46.821 --> 02:20:50.960
those guys know how to put together a game plan man.
And if you stick through it,

2270
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:55.940
I guarantee the percentages are high.
They put together a gate,
a great game plan.

2271
02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:59.030
I'm not taking nothing away from the hope it's coach and nothing.

2272
02:20:59.031 --> 02:21:02.510
I'm just saying that winkled that's what they specialize in.
Joke game plan.

2273
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:05.300
And then they practice it and they fucking,
uh,

2274
02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:09.320
and sometimes it works against them with homes.
Ameesha tape,

2275
02:21:09.321 --> 02:21:13.610
but it worked with homes and Ron and work with Carlos conduit and the Diaz Guy.

2276
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:18.800
It works.
They,
if you stick to that game plan,
you'll succeed.
Jon Jones,
you know,

2277
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:22.400
so who knows what they got in store for this kid?
Well,

2278
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:26.330
the way I look at his house,
there's always a threat.
He's just so skillful.

2279
02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:29.960
As a striker.
But when I see what Steve Bay did,

2280
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:34.100
the Fabio Maldonado who obviously he's a smaller guy,
um,
but you know,

2281
02:21:34.101 --> 02:21:37.640
just had a war with fade or do you see that fight you got a couple of weeks ago

2282
02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:40.010
not to fade or down?
Kinda got fucked.

2283
02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:44.000
Lots of decision should have been dry I think.
Um,
but either way,

2284
02:21:44.001 --> 02:21:45.830
at the end of the day,
uh,

2285
02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:50.300
Steve Bay looked like a murderer or against our Lawsky crushed our Lawsky

2286
02:21:51.010 --> 02:21:55.460
knocks.
We're doing mountain the first round,
man.
It's hard to,
uh,

2287
02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:58.460
hard to look past that.
Well,
I'm looking at those times,
that perspective,

2288
02:21:58.461 --> 02:22:00.540
that fucking mirror is,

2289
02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:03.950
it's confidence is out the fuck.
You know,

2290
02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:08.060
he said he was gonna knock out Bruh.
Don't he said it.
You know,

2291
02:22:08.061 --> 02:22:12.410
so right now this confidence is high.
It's in his backyard.
W who knows?

2292
02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:16.220
All I know is right now,
I feel this is a fucking war.

2293
02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:20.090
This is going to be a really good fucking fight.
Look at that knee to the body.

2294
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:23.360
Good Lord.
Yeah.
Steve Bay's a tank man.

2295
02:22:23.390 --> 02:22:28.230
He's a legit tank and he's a serious fucking athlete too.
Man.
Works hard,

2296
02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:32.700
real talented,
stays cool under pressure.
So a murder when he gets in there,
man,

2297
02:22:32.701 --> 02:22:35.970
so calm,
like that guy can fight at his very best now,

2298
02:22:35.971 --> 02:22:40.230
especially now with all of his experience inside the octagon he get,
he's like,

2299
02:22:40.231 --> 02:22:42.300
he's like seasoned.
You know what I'm saying?

2300
02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:45.840
I learned about Winkeljohn when I watched

2301
02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:52.290
GSPS coach do the breakdown of the Holly Holm.
Ronda,

2302
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:57.240
that was possibly one of the best breakdowns.
I saw him more ways than one.

2303
02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:02.430
I learned so much from that breakdown from what the I at the house doesn't have

2304
02:23:02.431 --> 02:23:05.700
a clue what the fuck you're doing to people at home.

2305
02:23:05.701 --> 02:23:08.740
Don't have a clue what the fuck that,
oh,
they're watching.
But what do you mean?

2306
02:23:08.741 --> 02:23:13.740
Like the way he was?
Uh,
you know why she was keeping a hips high?

2307
02:23:13.741 --> 02:23:16.920
Just little things.
I didn't know.
I never even fucking heard of this shit.

2308
02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:20.220
It's just little things and the for them,

2309
02:23:20.221 --> 02:23:23.070
for Holly homes to be that good at it,

2310
02:23:23.550 --> 02:23:27.750
that meant that Winkeljohn and the other guy,
Greg Jackson,
Greg Jackson,

2311
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:32.990
Professor Greg Jackson put this thing together and they drilled that thousands

2312
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:37.950
and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of time.
So I tell you,

2313
02:23:37.951 --> 02:23:42.900
Joe Rogan,
every time you feel this hand on your hip,
you put your ass up.

2314
02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:45.150
We're going to do that a thousand times.

2315
02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:48.960
I'm gonna come to your house and every time I touch it yet I want you to drop

2316
02:23:48.961 --> 02:23:53.430
your knees and she can't throw you.
You know,
just simple shit.
I like preparation.

2317
02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:58.940
The preparation that Holly Holm had for Rhonda was fucking money was money and

2318
02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:02.940
yeah,
Rhonda was consumed with other things,
but I was very impressed with that.

2319
02:24:02.941 --> 02:24:07.920
The preparation Carlos had against,
uh,
against Diaz.

2320
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:11.600
You know,
nobody thought going to stay in there against the ass.

2321
02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:16.500
Nobody fucking even came close to that.
And,
um,
I learn something.
I was like,
wow,

2322
02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:21.210
I fucking learned a lot that night about preparation,
how they prepared for this.

2323
02:24:21.420 --> 02:24:24.720
So I liked that camp for that.
You know,
everybody,

2324
02:24:24.721 --> 02:24:26.130
every camp has a different thing.

2325
02:24:26.131 --> 02:24:30.930
Aka everybody accuses him of being like these fucking,
they go to bras,

2326
02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:35.940
you know Jim Brawls and shit.
You know,
I grew up in the 70s Joe Rogan.

2327
02:24:35.970 --> 02:24:40.710
I thought that that was what was acceptable.
Yeah,
well a lot of people don't now.

2328
02:24:40.740 --> 02:24:43.920
Yeah,
I still do.
I mean it's still good still.
It's an argument.
You know,

2329
02:24:43.921 --> 02:24:48.750
the problem with this whole conversation is no one's wrong.
You know,

2330
02:24:48.751 --> 02:24:50.190
like Eddie Alvarez was right.

2331
02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:54.150
He did 150 rounds and it prepared them perfectly and he went in and took,

2332
02:24:54.151 --> 02:24:57.690
those aren't just the only one.
So he walked into that fight with two black eyes,

2333
02:24:57.691 --> 02:25:00.600
Joey.
I mean that guy sparring some fucking hard rounds.

2334
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:04.560
Probably having some Jim more.
So in his case it worked out.

2335
02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:06.390
And when I say 150 rounds,

2336
02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:10.260
do I get Joe Rogan to duplicate Rafael dos Anjos style.

2337
02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:11.910
You get a bunch of different guys usually,

2338
02:25:11.911 --> 02:25:16.200
and I prepare for dosign Yossi style pay for guys mimicking.

2339
02:25:16.380 --> 02:25:20.270
Three would joke with him go red banned them that throw Brian in there,

2340
02:25:20.290 --> 02:25:23.800
throw Eddie.
And so it's three guys at all mimicking Dosantos,

2341
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:27.790
<v 7>one facing different guys,
most likely in a good camp.</v>

2342
02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:32.400
They would want you to try to mimic some of the movements so you get all hand
up.

2343
02:25:32.410 --> 02:25:35.950
I'm getting set up for this so I know exactly how to react to it.
That's well,

2344
02:25:35.951 --> 02:25:39.580
Mark Henry,
who was his striking coach is a very skillful guy.

2345
02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:43.170
We're going to go eat pizza.
They are the risks.
Let's do it.
I liked that car.

2346
02:25:43.430 --> 02:25:45.190
I heard his pizza is fantastic.

2347
02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:48.970
It's got to be in an area where you can't fucking camp corral.
You can go Joe,

2348
02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:51.040
shoot you.
So he's gotta be a good boxer.
Yeah,

2349
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:53.860
I've had some conversations about food with him.
He seems legit as fuck.

2350
02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:57.940
I never met him.
I never saw him saying he's a great guy.
You'd love him.
But uh,

2351
02:25:57.941 --> 02:26:00.700
his um,
his strategy and his,
uh,

2352
02:26:00.701 --> 02:26:04.030
his understand his tactical understanding of like striking movements and

2353
02:26:04.031 --> 02:26:05.860
combinations.
I'm always very impressed,

2354
02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:09.430
very impressed by the training and very impressed by what Brendan Schaub term

2355
02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:13.270
told me because Brendan shop did some work with them for like one camp and he

2356
02:26:13.271 --> 02:26:16.960
said the dude had like fucking notebooks filled with all these different notes

2357
02:26:16.961 --> 02:26:20.470
about different movements and recreating stuff and drills and all the stuff that

2358
02:26:20.471 --> 02:26:23.590
we're going to work on and what to do in this and they have different codes for

2359
02:26:23.591 --> 02:26:25.990
stuff and they change them all the time.
Like five,
six,

2360
02:26:25.991 --> 02:26:27.520
seven hit him with the two,
three,

2361
02:26:27.521 --> 02:26:32.050
five like it's all like these codes that they create apparently like it.

2362
02:26:32.051 --> 02:26:35.320
He doesn't want anybody pattering patterning it so they change it up.

2363
02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:37.810
This is what Sean was telling me,

2364
02:26:37.811 --> 02:26:40.510
shop shop was super impressed with them and Shabazz was like,
look,

2365
02:26:40.511 --> 02:26:42.070
if the dude didn't live on the other side of the country,

2366
02:26:42.071 --> 02:26:44.610
I would definitely trained when looking at who guy he showed up with this guy

2367
02:26:44.611 --> 02:26:48.130
who meet him.
Just get up.
He had Frankie,
I go for three.
Edson Barboza.

2368
02:26:48.131 --> 02:26:49.360
You had him for a long time as well.

2369
02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.600
The guy obviously knows what the fuck he's doing and his,

2370
02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:57.850
his striking work with his students is very,
it's very high level.

2371
02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.060
Barboza is obviously Barbara is a fucking freak.

2372
02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.140
I mean his striking so God damn good.
Especially his kicks are just ridiculous.

2373
02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:08.830
God Damn,
he's good now.
You know it was just on fire right now.

2374
02:27:08.831 --> 02:27:10.420
He's another hundred 55 pounder on

2375
02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:17.410
that barter was ro one 55 who did buy Bose is just beat.

2376
02:27:19.350 --> 02:27:21.940
Wait,
you got to hit me with this after I eat it because I'm trying to remember

2377
02:27:21.941 --> 02:27:26.530
because it was just stunning.
Um,
beautiful.
He was beautiful.

2378
02:27:26.531 --> 02:27:31.240
That fight.
Yeah.
Who the fuck did he beat Anthony Pettis.

2379
02:27:31.241 --> 02:27:32.350
That's right.
Yeah.

2380
02:27:32.530 --> 02:27:35.920
That was a fight where pedis finally got a guy who wanted to strike with them.

2381
02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:36.641
You know,

2382
02:27:36.641 --> 02:27:40.520
because Pettis has been getting these guys like Dolson Joe Send Eddie Alvarez

2383
02:27:40.521 --> 02:27:43.720
who could grab a hold of them and squish them,
push him against the fence,

2384
02:27:43.721 --> 02:27:47.140
use their physical strength and the wrestling.
And that was like a guy that he,

2385
02:27:47.141 --> 02:27:47.731
that was the,

2386
02:27:47.731 --> 02:27:51.430
exactly the kind of fight that he wanted and it just didn't work out because

2387
02:27:51.610 --> 02:27:55.090
that's how good Barboza is.
He's on the fastest kickers in the sport.

2388
02:27:55.870 --> 02:28:00.700
Perfect technique too.
But that,
that's,
you know,
that's him.
He's very good.

2389
02:28:00.701 --> 02:28:02.890
He was good going in there,
but a lot of it,

2390
02:28:02.891 --> 02:28:06.070
you got a credit to Mark Henry and what he's done with Frankie to one of the

2391
02:28:06.071 --> 02:28:09.490
most impressive like Beaton's I was seeing was one that I was switching the

2392
02:28:09.491 --> 02:28:12.430
challenge and I saw Jose Aldo.

2393
02:28:12.431 --> 02:28:15.190
I didn't know nothing about no w eat nothing at all.

2394
02:28:15.191 --> 02:28:18.820
Wec only getting the fuck out of the UFC and they have to sell a fucking league.

2395
02:28:19.210 --> 02:28:22.010
Now I got to watch this shit,
but I saw him.

2396
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:23.960
<v 3>The reason why I stopped was I just saw,</v>

2397
02:28:23.961 --> 02:28:27.830
he's like cakes and then the next day we got on a plane and you would talk to me

2398
02:28:27.831 --> 02:28:30.830
about it and I didn't know what to say.
Like I was fucking,

2399
02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:35.720
those leg kicks was something I had never seen before.
Yeah,
he's pretty pretty.

2400
02:28:35.721 --> 02:28:39.290
God Damn sporty.
He throws bombs,
man,

2401
02:28:40.250 --> 02:28:43.070
he um,
at one point in time,

2402
02:28:43.071 --> 02:28:47.920
I guess when he was young he was a really high level soccer player and a like

2403
02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:50.560
maybe even had aspirations of going pro.

2404
02:28:50.561 --> 02:28:54.340
I could have possibly been at that level if he decided to go that path and

2405
02:28:54.341 --> 02:28:58.910
instead went to Jujitsu and MMA obviously,
but a hit because of that,

2406
02:28:58.911 --> 02:29:02.810
I think those years of running and sprinting and throwing,
kicking soccer balls,

2407
02:29:02.811 --> 02:29:07.140
he just,
he whips those kicks man.
They're devastating.
Ooh.

2408
02:29:07.310 --> 02:29:10.630
His fight with Frankie and his fight with a Uriah is protected.

2409
02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:12.680
That's the one I saw.
Oh my God.

2410
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:17.270
It's really weird that you were posting shit a couple of weeks ago by Ian trying

2411
02:29:17.271 --> 02:29:22.271
to turn you on to soccer the 70s we just didn't dig soccer socket influence this

2412
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:26.300
bigass yeah.
Again,
I'm going back to the flutes.

2413
02:29:28.090 --> 02:29:31.580
No flutes.
I didn't know.
I didn't even fucking know.

2414
02:29:31.850 --> 02:29:35.030
I was called up in the 70s you like the Pittsburgh Steelers.
You like this shit.

2415
02:29:35.031 --> 02:29:39.260
You play two hand touch and one day some dude that my mother's boss like you

2416
02:29:39.261 --> 02:29:40.400
want to play football?

2417
02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:43.880
Like we ain't going to go to eight Hudson county park the tomorrow at night.

2418
02:29:44.450 --> 02:29:45.650
I go up there with my football.

2419
02:29:45.651 --> 02:29:50.210
These guys playing soccer to me he was like fucking a different language.

2420
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:52.820
Like we just didn't grow up in that.

2421
02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:58.210
It didn't become popular in this country to like 85 84 they started introducing

2422
02:29:58.691 --> 02:30:01.990
it and schools and stuff.
My high school soccer game,

2423
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:05.630
I didn't know none of my mind.
Dude.
Pele I knew pay later.
That's it.

2424
02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:08.570
That's all I knew about bucking soccer.
That's all everybody knew.

2425
02:30:08.571 --> 02:30:10.040
That's how popular payday was.

2426
02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:13.880
You know he's like the Tony Hawk of soccer.

2427
02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:17.630
Like nobody knows anybody other than Tony Hawk.
Who's a pro skateboarder.

2428
02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:21.740
Tony Hawk.
That's why everybody knows who put who rides a bike professionally.

2429
02:30:21.741 --> 02:30:23.660
Lance Armstrong,
but I heard he did steroids.

2430
02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:28.340
You know like there's like a few guys that they're the only guy that anybody has

2431
02:30:28.341 --> 02:30:33.020
ever heard of in that genre.
Right.
Who Dives?

2432
02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:37.190
Greg Louganis.
That's it.
Nobody else dives.
There's no other divers.
Shut up.

2433
02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:41.780
Who Swims fast,
but that fucking pothead goggle Phelps,
that guy,

2434
02:30:41.781 --> 02:30:45.050
he's swamped fast.
Come up again.
Nobody else can't swim fast.

2435
02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:49.400
He's the only guy we know though.
He's about to fuck him up again.
Yeah,

2436
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:53.660
like he's about to fuck him up again.
How was he doing?
Is He,
uh,

2437
02:30:54.010 --> 02:30:56.870
has he done any other races or is he just preparing for the Olympics?

2438
02:30:56.930 --> 02:31:00.770
I think he was just preparing for,
I think he's been winning.
He's been winning.

2439
02:31:00.771 --> 02:31:01.730
He's done a couple of races.

2440
02:31:01.731 --> 02:31:04.670
I don't think he's been like actually actively compared to baby in a couple of

2441
02:31:04.671 --> 02:31:08.630
times.
Yeah.
Maybe when you get in trouble for pot.
God,
that was stupid.

2442
02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:13.010
I had to apologize.
That is so fucking stupid.
They,
he could've been,

2443
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:17.060
he could've had a drink in both hands and a cigar in his mouth and no one said a

2444
02:31:17.061 --> 02:31:20.610
word and everybody will know the kids blowing off steam.

2445
02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:25.470
He had an amazing Olympic career.
Think about,
look at the gold medals,

2446
02:31:25.471 --> 02:31:28.680
ladies and gentlemen,
think about the pressure and for relax.

2447
02:31:28.740 --> 02:31:31.710
Let him have his Margarita and his tobacco.

2448
02:31:32.250 --> 02:31:35.880
But if you catch them doing bong hits at someone's party,
like Holy Shit,

2449
02:31:36.210 --> 02:31:40.270
and whoever that was at narked on them should be shot in fucking hoe much.

2450
02:31:40.270 --> 02:31:44.270
Why don't like shit?
How dare they just didn't even know what they were doing.

2451
02:31:44.290 --> 02:31:46.630
Just for the fucking record.
They'll let you know that that fucking reef,

2452
02:31:46.631 --> 02:31:47.910
it don't even hurt your cardio.

2453
02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:51.330
It wasn't Michael Phelps is fucking kicking it up like that.
Swimming,

2454
02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:53.430
it doesn't hurt your cardio.
Those,
uh,

2455
02:31:53.431 --> 02:31:57.000
in extreme endurance athletes love it has been a bunch of articles written

2456
02:31:57.020 --> 02:31:59.490
lately on,
uh,
them taking edibles,

2457
02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:02.400
[inaudible] edibles and sometimes even stop at tents and vape.

2458
02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:07.140
They'll have like a vaporizer,
like a volcano set up halfway along the way.

2459
02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:09.960
The friend that took a little chill in with them on a marathon,

2460
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:13.860
he stopped to Porta John and took a couple of heads.
Good for him.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2461
02:32:13.861 --> 02:32:16.770
I mean,
I bet it makes the whole thing a much better experience.

2462
02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:20.610
It's fucking way better for Yoga.
Bitsight some I do yoga.

2463
02:32:20.611 --> 02:32:25.290
I told you sober all the time.
No,
I do yoga sober all the time,

2464
02:32:25.291 --> 02:32:30.291
but occasionally I like to go deep and go to the hot yoga class and get my

2465
02:32:30.931 --> 02:32:33.270
stretch on.
Holy Shit Man.

2466
02:32:33.450 --> 02:32:35.930
Especially with edibles and the booze is the way to go to yoga.

2467
02:32:35.970 --> 02:32:39.960
You feel everything.
You can smoke 30 minutes before Yoda,

2468
02:32:39.961 --> 02:32:44.460
you pop a light at a bull.
I wouldn't do 800 million and you'll go to yoga.

2469
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:50.030
I take 200 milligrams stretch and by the 30 minute mark at Yoga,

2470
02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:54.600
all that stretching and all that released,
the 200 goes to work

2471
02:32:56.730 --> 02:32:59.490
and it gives you a light buzz and you don't know it to,

2472
02:32:59.491 --> 02:33:03.330
you stuck it up position and you're breathing.
That's when you go like,

2473
02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:07.290
Oh shit.
Oh Shit,
you're right here.
Right?

2474
02:33:07.770 --> 02:33:12.470
Oh Shit.
Now I'm feeling it towards the end.
Like it's,

2475
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:16.360
I used to eat banana bread and go to yoga with my wife before I knocked her up,

2476
02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:18.330
fucked up.

2477
02:33:18.331 --> 02:33:22.140
And that the only problem with yoga is you can't bring a notebook and a pen,

2478
02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:26.270
you know,
that's fucked up and you can't even,
you know,

2479
02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:28.140
you can't bring your phone because you're an asshole.

2480
02:33:28.470 --> 02:33:32.940
And Yoga when you're in that downward dog stone to shit that comes out of your

2481
02:33:32.941 --> 02:33:35.400
spine into your mind is creep.

2482
02:33:35.401 --> 02:33:39.360
You start looking at girls acids and the teacher and thinking about shit.

2483
02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:41.870
Like if there's somebody Asians in the class,
you'd rather get it.

2484
02:33:42.060 --> 02:33:43.720
You get all fucked up in the class.

2485
02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:48.360
You start thinking about green teas and shit.

2486
02:33:49.050 --> 02:33:51.990
You know what I thought about setting up and I might actually have to do this,

2487
02:33:52.310 --> 02:33:52.610
uh,

2488
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:57.610
a voice activated tape recorder for inside my tank cause I don't want to leave

2489
02:33:58.711 --> 02:34:02.700
the tank.
No,
it's too much.
Sometimes it's too much.
Those,
those uh,

2490
02:34:03.150 --> 02:34:08.040
those exercises,
when you do that type of stuff,
yoga stoned when you're in that,

2491
02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:12.280
it kills you because you think is shit when you're in a deep stretch.

2492
02:34:12.281 --> 02:34:15.180
So you've never floated before.
Have,
you know,
I'm still paranoid.

2493
02:34:15.370 --> 02:34:18.240
I want good swimmer,
but I don't want,
you can't,
it's

2494
02:34:19.220 --> 02:34:21.080
<v 4>Becky's going to take me to Pasadena.</v>

2495
02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:23.890
That's the biggest place in the world now is it?
Yeah.

2496
02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:27.160
That guy that opened up that float center in Pasadena is the biggest float

2497
02:34:27.161 --> 02:34:29.380
center in the world.
It's the name of the company.
What's it called?

2498
02:34:29.770 --> 02:34:33.770
Give the give the homiest props.
I'm not sure.
I want to say it's the flow lab.

2499
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:38.440
No float lab is in Venice and in a Westwood and that's the best.

2500
02:34:38.470 --> 02:34:42.330
This guy's got salmon,
Hollywood on the planet.
Just flow.
Just flow task.

2501
02:34:42.650 --> 02:34:47.440
Holly does him good for him because Becky works at all inspired by us talking

2502
02:34:47.441 --> 02:34:51.290
about it.
He's a good dude.
I met that guy at the Ice House in Pasadena.

2503
02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:54.490
It's amazing.
It'll take,
you know,
man.

2504
02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:57.520
Sometimes I go deep with it fucks with me for four or five days.

2505
02:34:57.850 --> 02:35:00.160
I like the other day I remember I dropped out of high school.

2506
02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:05.050
Who Remembers that shit?
Do you know?
I would remember that.

2507
02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:08.830
You want me to tase him?
Do you know how I went to community college?

2508
02:35:09.850 --> 02:35:13.780
I did two sickest part,
but without a high school diploma.
Yeah.

2509
02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:17.230
You could go to community college with a GED.
No,
no.
I didn't even have the GG.

2510
02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:20.320
He just went,
I just went.
I just started signing up.
They asked me.
I told them,

2511
02:35:20.321 --> 02:35:24.010
yeah,
I didn't know.
And then when I got the letter that I had too many credits,

2512
02:35:24.011 --> 02:35:27.250
I had to transfer the bolder.
Boulder was like,

2513
02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:30.710
we'd been looking for your paperwork,
we can't find your GED.

2514
02:35:30.730 --> 02:35:32.530
And I kept telling them it's in there and they go,
well,

2515
02:35:33.070 --> 02:35:35.950
ain't nothing going to get process until we have the paperwork in their hand.

2516
02:35:36.250 --> 02:35:37.390
So it was like a Tuesday.

2517
02:35:37.391 --> 02:35:40.560
I had to go take the g the other Saturday and like pass it.

2518
02:35:40.570 --> 02:35:43.360
My brother and I got into college.
That's how I did it.

2519
02:35:43.390 --> 02:35:46.660
You just bringing that up made me remember that I went to a junior college.

2520
02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:49.450
I literally,
I've completely forgot about it.

2521
02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:54.480
I forgot I fucking dropped out and got to make sure I got sad for a week.

2522
02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:57.340
How to cock can get dropped out of high school.

2523
02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:00.730
Like I was thinking like I was single for a while.
Yeah,
you were single,

2524
02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:03.630
you were fucking dropout.
Who the fuck wants to,
hey,
I want to drop out.

2525
02:36:03.631 --> 02:36:06.610
You got no future.
So you're not even thinking this when you're a high.
Recently,

2526
02:36:07.390 --> 02:36:08.081
three weeks ago,

2527
02:36:08.081 --> 02:36:12.280
I'm writing and I'm out lighting and I'm trying to figure out a hook for the

2528
02:36:12.281 --> 02:36:15.950
special right.
And I'm thinking about what traumatizes you right?

2529
02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:19.150
How can we go in all this shit they've heard and it's bullshit.

2530
02:36:19.450 --> 02:36:22.720
What really got to me?
And I was a member,
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

2531
02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:27.190
I dropped out of high school,
junior year,
August,
going into senior year,

2532
02:36:27.191 --> 02:36:31.000
you drop out.
And I went in and like in January,
and I got my credits,

2533
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:34.660
but I was three credits short to graduate and they wanted me to go to summer

2534
02:36:34.661 --> 02:36:36.750
school and I was like,
you know,
I ain't gonna

2535
02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:43.450
fuck with you.
So I didn't get to get my diploma and stands and get it,

2536
02:36:44.350 --> 02:36:46.750
which I didn't really care about because I had nobody to show him,

2537
02:36:46.751 --> 02:36:50.140
put the fucking thing.
Anyway.
So in my mind I didn't really give a fuck.

2538
02:36:50.141 --> 02:36:54.160
Why would I want to go to embarrass myself like sugar now I would've done it,

2539
02:36:54.490 --> 02:36:58.660
but then I just wanted to smoke pot and I just wanted to get out of there.

2540
02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:01.630
I didn't go to my graduation.
I just wanted to get out.

2541
02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:05.640
I felt like that whole experience was just,
it was just like,
no,

2542
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:07.830
that's frustrated.
I didn't like prompts.

2543
02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:09.550
I didn't go to my eighth grade graduation.

2544
02:37:09.551 --> 02:37:13.090
I went to five star basketball camp instead.
It was one of those snow years,

2545
02:37:13.091 --> 02:37:16.490
so you've got to stay in school to June 29th I booked the basketball camp,

2546
02:37:16.491 --> 02:37:20.390
the 20th Einstein.
They went to great adventure.
Fuck that.
You know what?

2547
02:37:20.391 --> 02:37:23.900
I went to a good school too.
It wasn't a bad school,
but the experience,

2548
02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:28.250
the experience was this overwhelming pressure of becoming an adult.

2549
02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:31.430
That was like the big experience.
That was the scariest part of it.

2550
02:37:31.850 --> 02:37:32.690
More than anything,

2551
02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:37.220
it's just an overwhelming pressure of one day having to take care of myself and

2552
02:37:37.221 --> 02:37:39.500
trying to figure out what the fuck I wanted to do with my time.

2553
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:42.290
High school was good for me.
I'm not going to lie.
No,

2554
02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:45.040
but I had a great time in high school.
Wasn't bad for me.

2555
02:37:45.041 --> 02:37:46.700
I had a great time taking classes.

2556
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.410
I'll tell you what until now I think I live a couple blocks from valley college

2557
02:37:51.411 --> 02:37:54.230
and I always think about why don't I go there at night and take a history class?

2558
02:37:54.231 --> 02:37:55.520
I'm,
I'm,
I'm an asshole.

2559
02:37:55.940 --> 02:37:58.820
Like just really learning the history class that I forgotten.

2560
02:37:59.470 --> 02:38:01.970
This shit just went out of my mind one day.
You know?

2561
02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:05.720
And it's embarrassing when people have conversations and I can't join it.
I mean,

2562
02:38:05.721 --> 02:38:07.430
people don't talk about history a lot around me,

2563
02:38:07.431 --> 02:38:11.990
but I'm just saying it's hard to get excited about a class unless you like

2564
02:38:11.991 --> 02:38:13.850
really thrilled with the subject.

2565
02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:17.310
But I'll tell you one way to learn history podcast,
podcast.

2566
02:38:17.330 --> 02:38:20.090
I know you've been telling me somebody else mentioned that too.
Hardcore history.

2567
02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:23.650
I'm Carlton fucking phenomenal.
Fucking phenomenal.

2568
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:27.950
Just tune into the one I've listened to about world war one.
Okay.
Have,
you know,

2569
02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:30.410
I'll listen to where we'll,
we've got a whole series on world war one.

2570
02:38:30.411 --> 02:38:34.370
It'll blow your fucking mind.
I like what,
listen,
I didn't like reading about it.

2571
02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:38.630
I had a friend that was brilliant,
got arrested.
So this motherfucker was a genie,

2572
02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:39.800
went to Brown the whole day.

2573
02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:42.440
And when that we would get high at night and I asked them stupid,

2574
02:38:42.441 --> 02:38:47.441
creepy questions about the wars and he would break it down out Joe Diaz or break

2575
02:38:47.781 --> 02:38:48.140
it down.

2576
02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:52.940
He was from Jersey and he would say there was this fucking bar and these people.

2577
02:38:52.941 --> 02:38:56.210
And I understood it.
Like I finally,
when I was growing up,

2578
02:38:56.211 --> 02:38:59.840
I didn't really give a fuck about history man.
I didn't really give a fuck.

2579
02:38:59.870 --> 02:39:01.510
Somebody was saying,
well maybe uh,

2580
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:05.690
you quit high school because you didn't believe in standard ally's education.
No,

2581
02:39:05.691 --> 02:39:09.590
I quit high school cause I was fucking bro Jack like with high school because I

2582
02:39:09.591 --> 02:39:13.110
had to produce something,
I had to do something and I got a warehouse job.

2583
02:39:13.111 --> 02:39:17.750
But Union warehouse job at mass backs century hardware.
Wow.

2584
02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:21.620
It was a fucking nightmare.
But I did it carrying change,
cut and change,

2585
02:39:21.621 --> 02:39:25.880
putting them in boxes.
Six in the morning,
the fucking six at night.

2586
02:39:26.090 --> 02:39:30.410
I loved the Joe Damn at that time it was a $9 an hour.

2587
02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:31.273
But guess what?

2588
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:36.610
I have to 60 days of fucking job opened up loading trucks from seven to four and

2589
02:39:38.761 --> 02:39:40.670
that paid like 18 an hour.

2590
02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:43.400
Plus I was getting into the union and I get my benefits.

2591
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:47.420
And you worked really Monday through Thursday because Friday you went home at a

2592
02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:51.320
quarter today cause I can still see my friends.
So I took the fucking job.

2593
02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:55.640
Tremendous go whenever it's seven,
nobody else there,
three other guys,

2594
02:39:55.641 --> 02:39:56.474
nobody talked.

2595
02:39:56.990 --> 02:40:01.130
I put a Walkman on with a cassette and I would just work,

2596
02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:02.950
everything was going great.

2597
02:40:02.970 --> 02:40:07.970
It's like mid December I fucking ate something and I went down every seven.

2598
02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:13.010
I just got sick one night and I walked off the property and I kept calling back

2599
02:40:14.490 --> 02:40:16.580
and then they repeat pick up the phone.
So the next day I got a call.

2600
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:19.770
You got fired because you left a property even though I puked on the property

2601
02:40:19.771 --> 02:40:21.870
and was sick and I explained to them I really got sick.

2602
02:40:21.871 --> 02:40:24.480
I went home to get a different shirt cause I lived like two blocks away.

2603
02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.020
I just going to get back in and they were like,
uh,

2604
02:40:28.110 --> 02:40:30.390
well fi and then like a month later,

2605
02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:34.170
it's like mid January I go back to high school,
I'm kind of broke.

2606
02:40:34.530 --> 02:40:38.640
I'd go down there to get my last check and I bumped into the shop steward and I

2607
02:40:38.641 --> 02:40:40.380
was always smart.
Whenever I went to lunch,

2608
02:40:40.381 --> 02:40:45.381
I bring the shops do with a bottle he liked like JMB the pint and I'd bring them

2609
02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:50.250
booze.
Fuck yeah,
that's what you,
that's how you brought when he first put me in,

2610
02:40:50.380 --> 02:40:53.620
you were in high school?
I was in high school.
And you would give them boots.

2611
02:40:53.930 --> 02:40:58.150
Fuck yeah.
What's the drinking age back then?
18th 1818 but we were drinking.

2612
02:40:58.151 --> 02:40:58.581
I don't we,
we get,

2613
02:40:58.581 --> 02:41:01.500
of course in those days how we did it was we get booze delivered.

2614
02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:05.310
I think when I turned 18 was when the drinking age became 21 right.

2615
02:41:05.311 --> 02:41:09.990
So this one was it,
when was the
find out what age?
It was the scam.

2616
02:41:09.991 --> 02:41:13.260
In those days,
Joe Rogan was,
you weren't going to go get booze or liquor store.

2617
02:41:13.410 --> 02:41:15.780
You had to stand out there like a hooker trying to get some movement,

2618
02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:16.950
the pack of cigarettes.

2619
02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:21.290
So what you did was you find the liquor store had delivered.
Uh,

2620
02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:24.290
and then when they brought the boost,
he asked the guy would say,
fuck you mean,

2621
02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:29.500
what's the tab 20 I got 20 on top of it.
You're going to turn down.

2622
02:41:29.501 --> 02:41:31.050
Just say my grandfather sleeping.

2623
02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:35.400
Here's a note from my grandfather that says fucking the boosters for him.

2624
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:39.660
And then we got this guy on the tab.
We would just call and we'd be on a rock.

2625
02:41:39.730 --> 02:41:42.990
We'd be at a park and we'd make up an address and he knew it was us.

2626
02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:46.920
So we'd give him an extra 20 on the top and they deliver boosty and those days,

2627
02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:49.620
that's a scam.
That one away.
That's interesting.

2628
02:41:49.621 --> 02:41:51.660
Nobody delivers booze and cigarettes no more.

2629
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:55.380
And if you knew the guy that got would stop and get you us a shrimp parm

2630
02:41:55.381 --> 02:41:59.160
sandwich.
Listen,
you mind stopping over a Primo and get me a,

2631
02:41:59.730 --> 02:42:01.530
it's already called them.
They know you're coming.

2632
02:42:01.531 --> 02:42:04.320
I'll give you an extra five on top of the 20 guys.

2633
02:42:04.370 --> 02:42:08.310
Get this guy buying sandwiches for you.
People had,
I remember him,

2634
02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:12.120
became friends with him.
We became friends with the liquid delivery guy.

2635
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:13.050
That's hilarious.

2636
02:42:13.051 --> 02:42:17.940
The liquor delivery guy quit that and opened up a bar really years later.

2637
02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:20.430
Tremendous fucking bar.
Like for six months it failed.

2638
02:42:20.431 --> 02:42:24.410
He started selling coke out of that and then what the fuck fucker whistle so

2639
02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:28.320
that they turned it.
The legal age was 21 Jamie pulled up,
uh,

2640
02:42:28.350 --> 02:42:33.350
at a 1984 so it was like right when I was turning 17 they turned it to 21 it was

2641
02:42:33.661 --> 02:42:38.050
good.
It was good for 18 that means you're drinking at 16 yeah.

2642
02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:41.220
When you're 18 you look 18 and 16 when I was growing up,

2643
02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:44.040
not to mention the New Jersey can 16 anyway.

2644
02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:47.570
How much everybody's drinking at 16 anything.
Anyway,
they get to a parchment.

2645
02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:51.720
Yeah.
When I was growing up,
you started drinking in the eighth grade.

2646
02:42:51.930 --> 02:42:54.850
Some guys smoked pot.
Nobody was doing hard drugs.
Now,

2647
02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:56.760
once that freshman summer came along,

2648
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:59.400
people started falling off to the fucking wasteland,

2649
02:42:59.401 --> 02:43:02.220
but this was the scamp Joe Rogan.
The scam was this,

2650
02:43:02.490 --> 02:43:05.610
no matter where you lived in the Tristate area,
New Jersey,

2651
02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:08.460
if you check all the residences in New Jersey,

2652
02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:12.250
tons of people had New Jersey licenses.
You know why?
Why no picture?

2653
02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:16.510
<v 3>Uh,
check and see what he had New Jersey put pictures out in la.</v>

2654
02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:20.200
That was the scam.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Joe Rogan.

2655
02:43:20.450 --> 02:43:24.460
So Joe Rogan's got another brother,
Nigga Bro.
Oh my God.

2656
02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:28.570
Joe Rogan's got Nick Rogan and Mike Rogan.
Okay.
And the family.

2657
02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:31.360
You're ready for this one?
Joe Rogan's a hustler.

2658
02:43:31.570 --> 02:43:36.570
Joe Rogan steals Mick and Mike's buck and licenses south to Joey and fucking the

2659
02:43:37.361 --> 02:43:41.500
genius here.
They get duplicates.
What'd you ever hear Ari?
Fear Story.
What?

2660
02:43:41.630 --> 02:43:45.640
Ra Shit fears.
Brother fucking used his id to,
uh,

2661
02:43:45.730 --> 02:43:48.670
he forged his ID to get like insurance or something like that.

2662
02:43:48.910 --> 02:43:51.460
And Ari didn't find out until like someone called him.

2663
02:43:51.461 --> 02:43:54.610
He had told the story about it on the skeptic tank on his podcast.

2664
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:57.160
His brother faked his ID and got his own fucking ID card.

2665
02:43:57.161 --> 02:44:00.160
His brother was in degenerate.
You have no idea.

2666
02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:05.050
You have no fucking idea with these savages,
do now.
No idea.
Yeah.

2667
02:44:05.051 --> 02:44:06.430
Well I didn't know that there was a,

2668
02:44:06.431 --> 02:44:10.780
I forgot that there was a time where id didn't have photos on them.
That's crazy.

2669
02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:13.640
That's hard to believe.
Do you remember the days when you didn't have to,
uh,

2670
02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:18.130
bring an ID to get on a plane?
Remember those days?
Oh,
fight.
I made up names.

2671
02:44:18.430 --> 02:44:20.980
You just get on a plane ticket and show them the ticket.

2672
02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:24.520
Nothing ticketed and have your name on it and nothing.
No nothing.

2673
02:44:24.521 --> 02:44:27.550
You could tell him John Smith and you could fly as John Smith and you could give

2674
02:44:27.551 --> 02:44:30.100
somebody a ticket.
You could buy a ticket and they give it to them,

2675
02:44:30.310 --> 02:44:31.330
but they can just go on.

2676
02:44:31.450 --> 02:44:35.620
I remember hiding coke in the lockers and the lockers and putting,
you know,

2677
02:44:35.621 --> 02:44:37.570
the ones you've got to put quarters in to get the shit out.

2678
02:44:37.571 --> 02:44:40.990
They don't even have those no more.
That's how long ago I traveled,

2679
02:44:40.991 --> 02:44:45.190
Joe and I would go to a bar and drink and go back and put $10 in quarters,

2680
02:44:45.191 --> 02:44:47.050
take it out to two more bumps.

2681
02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:50.650
That's how we're talking about it was it cost me $200 to fucking drink and do a

2682
02:44:50.651 --> 02:44:53.860
couple of lines in those airports.
I forgot about those locker things.

2683
02:44:53.861 --> 02:44:55.630
Those fucking lockers.
So that porch,

2684
02:44:56.230 --> 02:45:00.100
you ever been in San Francisco and you see the Yoga Room?
No.

2685
02:45:00.130 --> 02:45:02.650
San Francisco airport and has a yoga room?
No.
No.
Okay.

2686
02:45:02.651 --> 02:45:05.110
I didn't know if I have a yoga room was like a special fucking thing.

2687
02:45:05.111 --> 02:45:08.320
We need to go to do yoga next time we work San Francisco,

2688
02:45:08.321 --> 02:45:10.070
we need to pull in there.
It will,

2689
02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:12.910
it will be a long time from now since I just did the,

2690
02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:18.520
I was in San Francisco and 85 stuck at the airport one time and every time I

2691
02:45:18.521 --> 02:45:20.870
went to the bathroom I smelled the same guy in there.

2692
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:24.640
And after about six hours,
eight hours,

2693
02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:28.540
the guy you go to pitch and also that he popped in and standing next day,

2694
02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.150
hey look at your Dick.
And then he'd go to the next guy.

2695
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:38.980
So what he would do is he look at your dick going to bathroom whack off and then

2696
02:45:38.981 --> 02:45:41.990
he would stay in the bathroom until you took your Dick.

2697
02:45:41.991 --> 02:45:44.350
I went up to the thing and he was lightning quick.

2698
02:45:44.351 --> 02:45:48.370
He had the foot speed of a fucking 43 Conseco.

2699
02:45:48.730 --> 02:45:51.700
He would run the next day with his dick in his hand and smile and look.

2700
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:54.760
How many times did you interact with this guy?
I didn't interact with them.

2701
02:45:54.761 --> 02:45:58.000
I was watching him.
You know,
I got to laugh.
If you're in the weight of it,

2702
02:45:58.240 --> 02:45:59.790
you're saying you got an eye for pervert.
He was like,

2703
02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:03.460
you're in the bathroom notch.
The Guy,
I'm stuck at a terminal.
Okay,

2704
02:46:03.730 --> 02:46:07.930
I'm sitting there.
The bathroom's right there.
Bathroom's right there.

2705
02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:11.250
There's like CNN.
It's 1985 wasn't like it is now.

2706
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:16.430
My flights is 6:00 AM when I get there,

2707
02:46:16.431 --> 02:46:19.370
I go to the bathroom and this guy is next to me.

2708
02:46:19.830 --> 02:46:24.080
As I take my dick and wash my hands.
You just see what the guy looks like.
Okay.

2709
02:46:24.350 --> 02:46:28.430
You sit down and two hours later you see a guy going into the bathroom again.

2710
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:31.970
Then three hours later you're going to send them to the bathroom again and

2711
02:46:31.971 --> 02:46:34.970
you'll see him walking out of that and acting suspicious and I'm like,

2712
02:46:34.971 --> 02:46:38.150
this is fucking crazy.
Now you're going to the bathroom again.

2713
02:46:38.151 --> 02:46:41.600
I'm delaying the gun.
I go in the bathroom again.
Guess who's next to me?

2714
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:46.070
Got Same Guy.
You figure it out.
He's a fucking perv.
I didn't figure it out.

2715
02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:48.860
I never repeated this because it didn't make any sense.

2716
02:46:48.861 --> 02:46:51.470
I mean it was 85 there was no,
there was like a buzzer.

2717
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:55.580
There was no people there and nothing.
There was like a Buzzer,
you know?

2718
02:46:55.581 --> 02:46:59.870
That's when you were allowed to walk to the gate.
Do you remember people,

2719
02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:02.300
this guy would just go to the airport and the daytime

2720
02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:05.460
<v 7>just go jerk off and go with your coffee all fucking day at the,
well,</v>

2721
02:47:05.461 --> 02:47:08.850
there's something about men's restrooms that I've always been like,

2722
02:47:08.851 --> 02:47:12.070
places where gay dudes hooked up.
Remember where that Senator got Troy?

2723
02:47:12.110 --> 02:47:13.880
It happened in San Francisco.
Yeah,
right?
Yep.

2724
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:17.550
What was like a Minneapolis or something like that,
wasn't it?
They,

2725
02:47:17.551 --> 02:47:19.590
they used to have some weird thing they would do.
They were like,

2726
02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:22.270
tap their foot three times on the ground.
If you want to suck some Dick,

2727
02:47:23.370 --> 02:47:27.600
climb under the stalls cause stalls,
footsie room,

2728
02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:31.620
you could probably climb under a stall if you're a small guy.
Right?

2729
02:47:33.420 --> 02:47:37.200
What's that?
As Minnesota?
Yeah.
I have a feeling it was Minnesota.

2730
02:47:37.470 --> 02:47:39.990
Minneapolis airport.
Larry.
Yeah.

2731
02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:45.030
Is he was apprehended by plain clothes police officer investigating complaints

2732
02:47:45.031 --> 02:47:47.380
of you would tap on it.
Yeah,
you would tap on something,

2733
02:47:47.970 --> 02:47:52.970
but that's just amazing that this guy is a Republican senator and he's doing gay

2734
02:47:53.791 --> 02:47:56.070
shit.
Or how about this?

2735
02:47:56.250 --> 02:48:00.930
Maybe he wasn't really doing gay shit and he had some fucking enemy and so some

2736
02:48:00.931 --> 02:48:05.750
enemy has him arrested for doing gay shit in the bathroom by a corrupt cop.
This,

2737
02:48:06.020 --> 02:48:09.520
it gets embarrassing.
Like if someone says you were sucking Dick in the bathroom,

2738
02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:11.420
man,
they could crush your reputation.

2739
02:48:11.500 --> 02:48:12.730
<v 3>Listen to me.
If,</v>

2740
02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:17.760
if somebody shoots boot over here and they come into the rest of me and I don't

2741
02:48:18.071 --> 02:48:21.280
have a fucking gun,
right.
They let me go

2742
02:48:22.410 --> 02:48:23.760
<v 7>look at this.
The report,</v>

2743
02:48:23.790 --> 02:48:28.200
allegedly according to the arrest report cited by roll call,

2744
02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:29.700
Craig tapped his right foot,

2745
02:48:29.701 --> 02:48:33.870
which the officer said he recognizes a signal used by persons wishing to engage

2746
02:48:33.871 --> 02:48:36.540
in lewd conduct.
How do you know maybe he's just got a song in his head.

2747
02:48:37.350 --> 02:48:38.550
He is then uh,

2748
02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:42.030
alleges that Craig then touch the officer's foot with his foot and the senator

2749
02:48:42.031 --> 02:48:45.420
proceeded a swipe his hand under the stall divider several times.

2750
02:48:45.630 --> 02:48:47.970
Maybe he's out of toilet paper.
He didn't want to talk about it.

2751
02:48:47.971 --> 02:48:51.150
Figured you'd be a gentleman handled some fucking toilet paper at that point,

2752
02:48:51.151 --> 02:48:54.450
the officer said he put his police identification down on the floor so Craig

2753
02:48:54.451 --> 02:48:57.540
could see it in a form.
The senator that he was under arrest.
Wait a minute,

2754
02:48:58.020 --> 02:48:59.070
wait a minute.

2755
02:48:59.610 --> 02:49:03.210
You can't arrest someone for tapping their foot and putting their hand out.

2756
02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:07.980
Yes you can.
How can you arrest someone for that?
Yes,
you can.
Joe,
you would

2757
02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.980
<v 4>be
at the airport.</v>

2758
02:49:11.250 --> 02:49:15.050
I would definitely be as you saw my guerrilla foot with the fun guy.
Now come to

2759
02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:21.270
come to that thing and tap your foot and then my hand comes out and goes like

2760
02:49:21.271 --> 02:49:25.350
this,
look,
look,
joke.
Like I'm squeezing it and nuts.

2761
02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:28.740
He's not going to dial nine one one.
I mean that's a pervert.

2762
02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:30.440
That's definitely a perfect,

2763
02:49:30.450 --> 02:49:34.290
I mean I'm not supporting this behavior but I just think you need a little bit

2764
02:49:34.291 --> 02:49:39.030
more than some sign language.
You get arrested and then weird.
I mean,

2765
02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:41.030
come on man.
Hillary Clinton,

2766
02:49:41.470 --> 02:49:45.870
she has a like a thousand emails that had classified information in them.

2767
02:49:45.871 --> 02:49:47.970
She doesn't get arrested.
This dude just taps his foot.

2768
02:49:48.510 --> 02:49:53.420
He gets arrested and 10 days in jail,
10 days.
Hmm.
Wow.

2769
02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:57.420
When I was like 18 there was a movie star bucks.
It's worth it.
It was real.

2770
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:58.880
It was a movie theater,

2771
02:49:58.900 --> 02:50:03.270
not no work enough and it was like a regular suburb and we went there one night

2772
02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:06.330
and we thought it was like a rocky horror,

2773
02:50:06.331 --> 02:50:08.130
but it was like fucking straight up on,

2774
02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:12.360
it was like straight up queen liberty.
One of those places.

2775
02:50:12.690 --> 02:50:16.500
It was straight up porn and we went in there and we hung out for maybe 20

2776
02:50:16.501 --> 02:50:19.770
minutes somewhere.
You heard yelling and screaming to the bathroom dog.
Oh Jim,

2777
02:50:19.771 --> 02:50:22.130
we got the fuck out of.
That was the end of that shit.
He,

2778
02:50:22.140 --> 02:50:25.290
you could run into like the old days.
I can't deal with it yet.

2779
02:50:25.291 --> 02:50:29.070
In the old days Times Square,
you didn't want to fucking man.
Yeah,

2780
02:50:29.071 --> 02:50:31.380
I mean you were,
you were involved in madness.
Well,

2781
02:50:31.410 --> 02:50:35.010
Time's Square in the old days when people don't remember is that you have

2782
02:50:35.011 --> 02:50:37.340
Broadway,
let's go to the map.
You're filling them out of the,

2783
02:50:37.410 --> 02:50:39.300
and you had the eighth avenue,
which is probably the same,

2784
02:50:39.301 --> 02:50:41.640
I don't even fucking remember in those days.

2785
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:46.910
But the movies started like here they were like g PG.

2786
02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:48.090
And then as you went up the block,

2787
02:50:48.091 --> 02:50:51.960
they got our that across the street towards the corner middle,

2788
02:50:52.110 --> 02:50:56.600
whether the acts devil and Mr. Jones,
you know,
uh,
that they had,

2789
02:50:56.670 --> 02:50:59.820
could be,
first of all,
in those days you couldn't have like a fucked up name,

2790
02:51:00.210 --> 02:51:01.260
like a comedic name.

2791
02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:04.870
You had to have a theatrical release name and point in the 70 [inaudible],

2792
02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:06.780
Linda Lovelace,
Lovelace.

2793
02:51:07.050 --> 02:51:10.430
You couldn't have like a spin off of something like,

2794
02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:15.440
it wasn't like they probably had out of the 12 or 13 movie theaters on both

2795
02:51:15.511 --> 02:51:16.320
sides.

2796
02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:20.760
They probably had more for movie theaters that were dedicated to straight up

2797
02:51:20.761 --> 02:51:24.330
fucking porn and they had one that was a split.

2798
02:51:24.331 --> 02:51:28.590
That was a movie on the way down to movies that were on the way down.

2799
02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:30.720
You know what I'm saying?
The Poseidon Adventure,

2800
02:51:30.721 --> 02:51:34.500
that Chinese connection there on the way down and then you had another movie

2801
02:51:34.501 --> 02:51:37.710
theaters actually played three movies on Sunday,

2802
02:51:37.711 --> 02:51:42.060
but then you had the good ones that play the James Bonds and you know the really

2803
02:51:42.061 --> 02:51:45.300
good ones,
but it was just always scary to go down there.

2804
02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:49.260
I used to always go down there,
Joe.
I bought ids down there.

2805
02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:54.230
I played three card Monte Donna,
I want it to one of the eighth grade.

2806
02:51:54.231 --> 02:51:55.530
I saw Paris busy owner.

2807
02:51:56.040 --> 02:51:59.820
He caught his neck on the fucking thing with April corridors and the and the

2808
02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:04.290
peep show.
Oh,
you told me that he stuck his neck and his head in there.

2809
02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:08.160
Let's head in that in those days they had three d,
You know I grew up down there,

2810
02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:11.830
you know,
I remember my friend buying weed and it was that sex.

2811
02:52:11.831 --> 02:52:16.210
We'd sex weed and the eighties you what?
Penthouse?
A playboy.

2812
02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:18.970
He had to be pent cause there were a little bit more.

2813
02:52:19.210 --> 02:52:23.590
If you bought a penthouse in the eighties the last two pages was dedicated to

2814
02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:27.430
fake weed and it was that.
It was just fuck.

2815
02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:30.460
That was one of the grossest things about those pot magazines.

2816
02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:35.480
They used to sell fake weed ads and they would just con suspecting unsuspecting

2817
02:52:36.581 --> 02:52:39.850
stoner stupid people.
And then they tell you don't open it to you.

2818
02:52:39.851 --> 02:52:41.770
Walk three blocks down.
Really are you?

2819
02:52:41.780 --> 02:52:44.620
If I just gave you 2150 I'm in the eighth grade.

2820
02:52:44.740 --> 02:52:47.740
I'm opening this motherfucker right here.
My buddy bought acid,

2821
02:52:47.741 --> 02:52:50.260
they gave him paper with coffee stains,

2822
02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:53.740
like little coffee but blotter acid like you got to be an ass.

2823
02:52:53.741 --> 02:52:54.850
So I like the word got out.

2824
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:57.520
That was like amateur street of you went down to the Bot,

2825
02:52:57.880 --> 02:53:01.600
but that was the last 50 yards of the sex side,

2826
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:06.520
like I said.
So on this side was just regular movies.
The mechanic,

2827
02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:10.990
a love bug,
you know,
it had an array of that style of movie.

2828
02:53:10.991 --> 02:53:13.310
Then across the street they would get a little bit more risque,

2829
02:53:13.311 --> 02:53:18.311
but sex world and towards the animal that block there was where Joe,

2830
02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:21.940
the 50 yards,
broad daylight,

2831
02:53:22.630 --> 02:53:26.110
cops down the corner and you can hear as you walked with your family,

2832
02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:29.950
you can be with your mom,
dad,
kids and that's all you would hit.

2833
02:53:29.951 --> 02:53:31.360
Marijuana acid brother.

2834
02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:36.970
I got cocaine,
I got some speed,
motherfucker.
I got tense.

2835
02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:40.340
I got fake ids selling it right out there.
Right out,

2836
02:53:40.420 --> 02:53:44.890
right out on that fucking 42nd street.
Daylight,
you know,

2837
02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:48.670
packed on a sat.
Saturday was suckers,
Paradise Suckers,

2838
02:53:48.671 --> 02:53:53.320
paradise and you would walk 50 yards and marijuana and [inaudible] oh yeah.

2839
02:53:53.330 --> 02:53:56.170
It didn't go but equal [inaudible] I have speed.

2840
02:53:56.171 --> 02:54:00.040
I got heroin and it was all beat because it's cops caught them.

2841
02:54:00.310 --> 02:54:04.450
It wouldn't even go to jam because it was fake.
Everything was fake.
Wow.

2842
02:54:04.480 --> 02:54:06.820
And then you hit the close getting all these tourists.
Yeah,

2843
02:54:06.821 --> 02:54:10.310
they were getting tourists.
Then you hit the corner and they would sit.

2844
02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:13.810
They would dissipate a little bit and then once you hit that street,

2845
02:54:14.350 --> 02:54:17.680
it would turn into three card Monte Ville.
Uh,

2846
02:54:17.710 --> 02:54:19.300
and then I knew a lot of guys who did that.

2847
02:54:19.301 --> 02:54:22.900
And then that's where three card Monte would get the tourists and you see people

2848
02:54:22.901 --> 02:54:26.740
crying and just crying.
And then after that it slowed up.

2849
02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:29.290
Excuse me.
Then the streets met,

2850
02:54:30.670 --> 02:54:35.620
but that was a hell fucking hole in the 80s a big Tgi Fridays.

2851
02:54:35.700 --> 02:54:40.450
Big Tgi Friday,
nothing goes down.
That's weird.
Nothing happens to Kim.

2852
02:54:40.451 --> 02:54:44.110
Like the place where like a top 40 TV shows film.

2853
02:54:44.530 --> 02:54:49.120
It became this like homogenized mall in the middle of New York City.

2854
02:54:49.150 --> 02:54:52.720
It's like the worst roughest part of New York City Times Square.

2855
02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:56.440
I mean that was 42nd street.
That was,
that was,
you know,
those,
those,

2856
02:54:56.441 --> 02:54:59.680
there's like these iconic blocks,
you know,
hell's kitchen.

2857
02:54:59.710 --> 02:55:03.560
That was like right in their times square was like the place where all lewd

2858
02:55:03.561 --> 02:55:04.010
movies,

2859
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:08.310
<v 3>where Times Square was all the sex shops.
Times Square was all the chaos.
Great.</v>

2860
02:55:08.570 --> 02:55:11.150
Now Times Square is like a Guy Fieri restaurant.

2861
02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:14.390
Six years ago you took me to New York City and you know we're from here.

2862
02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:18.240
So when we go back to New York,
we're not going to bed till three mammo.

2863
02:55:18.650 --> 02:55:22.060
We didn't even start thinking about bed till three o'clock in New York,
right?

2864
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:24.950
Because it's midnight,
midnight or midnight.

2865
02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:29.360
Midnight is so I would fucking item,
it was four 30 in the morning.

2866
02:55:29.390 --> 02:55:32.900
I couldn't take it away.
I gotta go outside and rolled a joint.
These pictures,

2867
02:55:32.901 --> 02:55:36.770
Jamie's pulling up that I went to go full screen on that kick tracking thing.

2868
02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:41.330
I walked around for maybe 25 minutes and Joe Rogan,

2869
02:55:41.331 --> 02:55:45.710
I didn't see us soul.
Look at this video poker,
they had video poker,

2870
02:55:46.230 --> 02:55:50.630
pinball,
you play poker.
I don't remember.
Mardi gras.
This is just,

2871
02:55:50.690 --> 02:55:52.900
it's hilarious like that girls.
But you can,

2872
02:55:52.930 --> 02:55:56.930
we tolerated the tiny little butts back then.
You know,
and she's like,

2873
02:55:56.931 --> 02:56:00.020
look at all this today that their bet you'd be doing squats.

2874
02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:05.390
They changed the ass game somewhere around 2000 right?

2875
02:56:05.630 --> 02:56:10.630
The ass game pre 2000 and post 2000 I mean you want to talk about like errors of

2876
02:56:10.731 --> 02:56:11.564
greatness.

2877
02:56:11.930 --> 02:56:16.930
Like the the ass age is here if you want to like the acids of today are so

2878
02:56:17.451 --> 02:56:19.880
superior to the acids of our parents' generation.

2879
02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:23.630
I mean it's not even a fucking contest because in our parents' generation it

2880
02:56:23.631 --> 02:56:27.590
wasn't even a subject of debate.
It wasn't like who's got the best ass.

2881
02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:29.660
It took them years to figure that out.
It was tits.

2882
02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:33.680
Do you think of anything to do with those like magazines like maximum and stuff

2883
02:56:33.681 --> 02:56:37.040
that like they couldn't show nudity so they just have to show some sexy acids

2884
02:56:37.041 --> 02:56:40.310
with a little fun.
It's a very good point.
And they're all sports are oriented,

2885
02:56:40.311 --> 02:56:43.820
right?
So that's right around the two thousands and late nineties and it's,

2886
02:56:43.821 --> 02:56:44.654
you know,
what happened?

2887
02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:48.800
Check started lifting as soon as chick started lifting and you went whoa.

2888
02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:51.770
Like it made a big goddamn difference.
Mean,

2889
02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:57.530
there's always like standard meth measurements of beauty,
right?
Like small waist,

2890
02:56:57.531 --> 02:57:01.850
big hips,
you know,
hip to waist ratio,
facial features,

2891
02:57:01.851 --> 02:57:03.320
breast size.
You know,

2892
02:57:03.321 --> 02:57:07.400
something that makes women extraordinarily attractive to men.
Right?
But we,

2893
02:57:07.401 --> 02:57:12.260
I don't think we knew how much a big juicy ass really got people until like the

2894
02:57:12.261 --> 02:57:14.820
two thousands when the same me,

2895
02:57:14.821 --> 02:57:17.720
the late nineties the sixties and seventies who were breast people,

2896
02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:19.960
country when it was a different breast,

2897
02:57:19.961 --> 02:57:23.640
it was a real breasts to fucking pink was a lot bigger of the Arriola.

2898
02:57:23.690 --> 02:57:28.600
Whatever was huge and thick and you know,
it was,
and now it's become the,

2899
02:57:28.601 --> 02:57:32.540
the,
the breast skin tight call.
The fat's been cut off the breast.

2900
02:57:32.541 --> 02:57:36.170
That's what you look for now.
The woman's body has changed over the years.

2901
02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:41.030
If you look at a playboy from 1970s both of you guys,
you'll call me back and go,

2902
02:57:41.031 --> 02:57:45.350
what the fuck?
What people think?
And they're still beautiful,

2903
02:57:45.620 --> 02:57:48.200
but it's a different type of book.
They just weren't athletic.

2904
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:52.430
If you look at the women in movies in the 60s they would drop dead.

2905
02:57:52.431 --> 02:57:55.690
Fucking gorgeous.
Yeah.
You had a fucking boat,
Derek.

2906
02:57:56.090 --> 02:57:58.370
She was like one of the first to have a tremendous ass,

2907
02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:04.350
but her body was just spectacular.
Bettie page had a pretty decent ass.

2908
02:58:04.590 --> 02:58:08.070
Hard to tell.
That girl needs to go to the gym.
Who's that?
Raquel Welch.

2909
02:58:08.250 --> 02:58:12.900
Her ass probably better now at 90.
Whose ass is that?
Whoa.

2910
02:58:13.170 --> 02:58:17.040
Quite flat,
unfortunately.
I wonder what,
what was the time now though?

2911
02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:19.080
What was the chick that flux are notches,
Heather.

2912
02:58:19.470 --> 02:58:22.680
I want to see what Audrey Hepburn.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Not your head.

2913
02:58:22.681 --> 02:58:25.500
Think that went to fucking Paris.
Went up behind the,

2914
02:58:25.850 --> 02:58:27.510
who was exotic looking bitch.

2915
02:58:27.511 --> 02:58:30.270
I wonder what she was like in a bikini or she was stunning.

2916
02:58:31.050 --> 02:58:35.190
I was gonna say Tina Fey.
What the fuck am my team?
I gotta get Outta here,
man.

2917
02:58:35.191 --> 02:58:38.610
I got to go to the store.
What time is it right now?
It's 10 o'clock.
Joey Diaz.

2918
02:58:38.690 --> 02:58:42.650
All right,
let's do it tomorrow night.
Nine o'clock.
He KLT though.

2919
02:58:42.651 --> 02:58:47.490
What's the name of it?
Uh,
the car.
The Kia.
They,
the MGM.

2920
02:58:47.880 --> 02:58:52.830
You dirty freaks.
Ian Edwards hair.
She is,
who is it?
No,

2921
02:58:52.831 --> 02:58:56.630
that's not her.
I don't think that's her,
that's another one.
Yeah.
No,
no,
no.
That's,

2922
02:58:56.640 --> 02:59:01.110
I think that's his daughter.
You dirty son of a bitch.
Um,
he's got a,

2923
02:59:01.800 --> 02:59:05.010
he was an actress that he was in love with.
It didn't work out.
Whatever.

2924
02:59:05.011 --> 02:59:09.990
What are you going to do tomorrow?
Caught Theater.
Ian Edwards.
Joey Diaz.

2925
02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:13.260
And why?
We're fucking psyched.
I don't know how many times

2926
02:59:13.390 --> 02:59:17.930
<v 0>your left.
It was almost sold out as of today.
Uh,
but uh,
and Joey,</v>

2927
02:59:17.931 --> 02:59:20.330
what else you got coming up?
I know you are at the Ice House soon.

2928
02:59:20.331 --> 02:59:25.130
I saw your name up on the board.
Are you there next weekend?
Well,
ice house.

2929
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:29.020
Pasadena?
No,
they had to cancel next weekend because of the surgery.
Oh,

2930
02:59:29.021 --> 02:59:33.350
I'm just doing isolated dates.
They got your name still up at the ice house.

2931
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:36.330
Tell him to take your fucking name down.
It was supposed to have taken it.

2932
02:59:36.350 --> 02:59:39.680
There's a poster outside that's advertising.
You being there?

2933
02:59:40.490 --> 02:59:43.670
I pulled showing them.
Yeah.
I mean maybe it's a different date.

2934
02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:47.010
Do you have a date in the future there?
I got a date.
Uh,

2935
02:59:47.870 --> 02:59:50.900
maybe it's the August date they have up there.
Maybe that's it.
Maybe that's it.

2936
02:59:51.500 --> 02:59:53.750
Maybe I knew you were going to be there and I knew you switch.
I don't know.

2937
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:56.010
Maybe I fucked it up in my head.
All right.
I didn't know for sure.

2938
02:59:56.410 --> 03:00:00.240
Thank you very much.
Thanks everybody.
Thanks you too.
And then,
and uh,

2939
03:00:00.290 --> 03:00:05.180
we will be back on Monday with the great shale son and,
and,
uh,

2940
03:00:05.181 --> 03:00:06.560
it should be fun time talking to him,

2941
03:00:06.561 --> 03:00:11.561
especially because it's right after UFC 200 and I think jail has a new

2942
03:00:11.631 --> 03:00:15.410
submission organization.
He's going to do a professional submission,

2943
03:00:15.440 --> 03:00:19.850
a organization with Ebi rules,
which is the Eddie Bravo invitational rules,

2944
03:00:19.851 --> 03:00:23.180
the best rules and all of grappling.
So a exciting stuff.

2945
03:00:23.181 --> 03:00:25.950
So we'll talk to jail on Monday and that's it.
I see a little bit.

2946
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.620
<v 8>Hmm.</v>
