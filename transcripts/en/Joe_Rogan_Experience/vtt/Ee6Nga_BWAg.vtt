32
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:05.034
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

34
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:07.020

<v Speaker 1>you looked at us,</v>

35
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you open the door fully looked at me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this young fighter and you're like,</v>

36
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we all smoked pot together and this</v>

37
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>hotel room and fucking wherever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Montreal,</v>

38
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're just a fun time.</v>

39
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And then seeing this guy move on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become the baddest motherfucker on the</v>

40
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

41
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>But we also had a conversation with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>about I wanted him to go to a different</v>

42
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

43
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>He was training in fucking youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos in New York with his buddies in a</v>

44
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You too.</v>

45
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:34.771
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Mike.</v>

46
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>You should be in a real cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

47
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>We had that over weed in that hotel</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

48
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really think so?</v>

49
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:40.771
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

50
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>So I know you only have a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time in this thing.</v>

51
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I go and your time should be invested</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a real coach who's going to hone</v>

52
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>your skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

53
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>you can be an all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great man.</v>

54
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I remember telling him that and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

56
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you really think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

57
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know.</v>

58
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really got to move on.</v>

59
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That how influential is out in the</v>

60
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking future of mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it helped.</v>

61
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I retain enough strength to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be good at what I need to.</v>

62
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So to burn yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't burn myself out,</v>

63
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like the oldest people in the</v>

64
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 2>world were an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 2>and they're kind of people who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn themselves out too much.</v>

66
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my theory on longevity is like don't</v>

67
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 2>overdo it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to necessarily be</v>

68
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 2>overtrained for what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the skill.</v>

69
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the winning that I do competitively is</v>

70
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 2>from a skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so much from being super strong</v>

71
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 2>having crazy cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's making a choice about which wave,</v>

72
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.660
<v Speaker 2>how I'm gonna Approach and ride that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wave and I have to get two scores every</v>

73
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes when they compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like I got this 30 minute window</v>

74
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I need to be ready for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to be like in crazy,</v>

75
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 2>crazy shape [inaudible].</v>

76
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 2>So what is it that held other guys back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past?</v>

77
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a number of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to naturally be really</v>

78
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 2>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in your,</v>

79
00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 2>when you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your home,</v>

80
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>somehow you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you needed something to prove.</v>

81
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.453
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

82
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I was Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 2>growing up I sort of looked back at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of laugh.</v>

84
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I maybe I couldn't get the girl I</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked because she liked an older guy or</v>

85
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have,</v>

86
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>we didn't really have any money in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>family so I wanted to make some money.</v>

87
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I had an older brother who kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>picked on me,</v>

88
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>but I hung out with him and played</v>
<v Speaker 2>football with his friends that were all</v>

89
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>three years older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to be strong,</v>

90
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to be tough and fast.</v>

91
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I had to be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the case with a lot of guys,</v>

92
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 2>older brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were brothers that they couldn't</v>

93
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 2>really compete with them like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

94
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>And so every night we would just eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>away at the end.</v>

95
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it did and there was always</v>

96
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:36.911
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 2>my brother and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a pretty good</v>

98
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 2>relationship now and I don't think he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would disagree with me that we kind of</v>

99
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 2>didn't get along for 20 years or more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't hate each other.</v>

100
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a long time.</v>

101
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing is about wally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate trashing law but also kind of</v>

102
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.690
<v Speaker 3>loved trashing wildly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

103
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.780
<v Speaker 3>is they have a lot of money to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities to tweet ads for awhile way</v>

104
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:04.260
<v Speaker 3>basically Gaga being one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

105
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 3>And you heard this story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.100
<v Speaker 3>so she's tweeted a bunch of wally ads</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I noticed that while she's a brand</v>

107
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 3>ambassador for awhile,</v>

108
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 3>her Huawei phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look in the details of the tweet,</v>

109

<v Speaker 3>I don't care,</v>

111
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.490

118
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:39.204
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

119
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.580
<v Speaker 3>that's how twitter works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can see the data.</v>

120
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that was,</v>

121
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.490
<v Speaker 3>that's my screenshot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

122
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:51.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only did Gaga Dope Bloch Gal Godot,</v>

123
00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:53.190
<v Speaker 3>the fucking wonder woman lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

124
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Wonder woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder woman,</v>

125
00:04:56.551 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Speaker 3>you fucking fake from an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just funny because look at the</v>

126
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:03.750
<v Speaker 3>picture of her lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She blocked you.</v>

127
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Not only did she blocked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wowway since then has tweeted they</v>

128
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>deleted like her latest tweets and</v>
<v Speaker 3>repost them from an android phone and</v>

129
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 3>she's tweeted from android phone ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>since.</v>

130
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:15.410
<v Speaker 3>I'll give her respect for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

131
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 3>they probably told her you're gonna lose</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that cash is no way she's tweeting</v>

132
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.820
<v Speaker 3>like she has a team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

133
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.120
<v Speaker 3>but like whoever was on her team</v>
<v Speaker 3>tweeting from an iphone,</v>

134
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:27.810
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that she blocked you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those hilarious.</v>

135
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:30.060
<v Speaker 3>That's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was really didn't do</v>

136
00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:31.130
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

137
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I tagged her in and she probably</v>

138
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:36.090
<v Speaker 3>was just getting barraged by like people</v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

139
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 3>well you're using an APP like an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why I'm I think event.</v>

140
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 3>It was like a year later she unblocked</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

141
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:44.550
<v Speaker 3>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She unblocked me.</v>

142
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.403
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

143
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 3>So he actually changed his position</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly because when he ran for</v>

144
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.310
<v Speaker 3>president he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only am I against marijuana being</v>

145
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 3>illegal at a federal level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even let the individual</v>

146
00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 3>states decide whether or not</v>

147
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>they want legal marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

148
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>he would prosecute the states like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and California that have legal</v>

149
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>marijuana using federal law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And right there he softened his position</v>

150
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>slightly and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>leave it up to the states and let them</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide.</v>

152
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>So anything that's because he knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll never be president.</v>

153
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he still wants to be president.</v>

154
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's gonna run again.</v>

155
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's going to run in 20</v>

156
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>slash 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 20,</v>

157
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.160
<v Speaker 1>24.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

158
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

159
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odds of that guy's going to make it</v>

160
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>eight more years with that fair point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morbidly obese carcass.</v>

161
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>He's moving his hand around with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need get a stapler.</v>

162
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he get his stomach fucking suit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

163
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>somebody pointed that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

164
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I never saw those stories.</v>

165
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not denying that it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just never heard it.</v>

166
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>But if he did didn't work while I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend who ate through two of those,</v>

167
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

168
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:49.154
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a d,</v>

169
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about food.</v>

170
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 1>He's addicted to food that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is unquestionably,</v>

171
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>he's an addict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think nobody said that to him in</v>

172
00:06:57.891 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>his life or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I look,</v>

173
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.510
<v Speaker 1>look how much thinner he go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

174
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.731
<v Speaker 1>And he did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

175
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I guess he did this before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential race because he wanted to</v>

176
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he got fat again.</v>

177
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was wrote ton before.</v>

178
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.730
<v Speaker 1>He was like a bag of water before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

179
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he trimmed himself down.</v>

180
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny because I don't think in</v>

181
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>any way he realizes the hypocrisy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>having his own,</v>

182
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>issue with food and he would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

184
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat what I want it to</v>

185
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:29.354
<v Speaker 1>freedom choice.</v>

186
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to freedom for</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody to decide to tweak their</v>

187
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>consciousness slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden he says,</v>

188
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>that's where it's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that,</v>

190
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you mean even with what he said about</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol didn't make any sense.</v>

191
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.801
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you mean?</v>

192
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 1>The alcohol illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we try to read,</v>

193
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>it's called prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

194
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.570
<v Speaker 1>But let's pretend that you had some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an ability to keep that from going</v>

195
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

196
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>let's start from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you want alcohol to be legal or</v>

197
00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could wave your hand and and</v>

198
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 1>there would be no more problems that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol associated,</v>

199
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 1>would you do that and make it illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus give a grown adult the</v>

200
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>possibility of deciding whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to drink or not drink?</v>

201
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not being consistent and his logic.</v>

202
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the point is that he's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say I'm thinking about donuts,</v>

203
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>but he even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even mentioned prohibition there,</v>

204
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>but that makes my point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not his point.</v>

205
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's when the mafia got</v>

206
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 1>incredibly powerful because you pushed</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the alcohol sales underground and</v>

207
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:31.470
<v Speaker 1>they got all the power and the money as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a result of it and that's when crime is</v>

208
00:08:31.471 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>shot through the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to decrease violent crime</v>

209
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.540
<v Speaker 1>and the drug war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most transformative</v>

210
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.380
<v Speaker 4>moments of my life was when I met spot</v>
<v Speaker 4>many in person,</v>

211
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:45.640
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the legged robots in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boston dynamics for the first time when</v>

212
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 4>I met them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>met that little fella there was.</v>

213
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly how every aspect of it</v>

214
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a dumb robot,</v>

215
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 4>but when I met him and he got up and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at me,</v>

216
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 4>there it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen a dance now?</v>

217
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dance.</v>

218
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 4>The dance is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's but see,</v>

219
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 4>it's not crazy on the technical side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's engineered.</v>

220
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 4>It's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's programmed,</v>

221
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 4>but it's crazy to watch like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

222
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 4>there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that moment was</v>

223
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 4>transformative because I know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it works and yet by watching it</v>

224
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 4>something about the feeling of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

225
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:29.150
<v Speaker 4>this thing is alive</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was this terrifying moment.</v>

226
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 4>Not Terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying and appealing where this is</v>

227
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 4>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

228
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Like this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this thing represents some future</v>

229
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 4>that is totally that we don't cannot</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

230
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.840
<v Speaker 4>Just like a future in the 18th century</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a future with planes and smartphones</v>

231
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 4>was something you could understand that</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing,</v>

232
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 4>that little dog could have had a a human</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness in it.</v>

233
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 4>That was the feeling I had and I know</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly how it works.</v>

234
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing close to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>

235
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:09.111
<v Speaker 4>but it just gives you this picture of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the possibilities are of these</v>

236
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 4>living creatures and I think that's what</v>
<v Speaker 4>people feel when they see Boston</v>

237
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 4>dynamics will call awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This thing running around is they don't</v>

238
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:18.510
<v Speaker 4>care about the technicalities and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>far away we are.</v>

239
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 4>They see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

240
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:24.570
<v Speaker 4>this thing is pretty human and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities of human like things that</v>

241
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:29.571
<v Speaker 4>supercede humans and can evolve and</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn so quickly,</v>

242
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.300
<v Speaker 4>exponentially fast is this terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 4>frontier that that really makes us think</v>

243
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 4>as it did for me.</v>

244
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a bull rider would look at free</v>
<v Speaker 1>soloing.</v>

245
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.620
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a crazy dude.</v>

246
00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:44.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody looks at another sport and</v>

247
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:44.751
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>

248
00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and honestly I look at fighting and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like us,</v>

249
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:47.950
<v Speaker 1>and he was totally outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

250
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.570
<v Speaker 1>why would you want some other dude beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to death in the cage?</v>

251
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy outrageous.</v>

252
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.520
<v Speaker 1>It is outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can get good enough where you</v>

253
00:10:55.521 --> 00:11:00.521
<v Speaker 1>can avoid getting the knowledge and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tool to land the damage,</v>

254
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even landing the damage to a certain</v>

255
00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:04.730
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

256
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hurting somebody else for the</v>

257
00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:07.280
<v Speaker 1>pleasure of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

258
00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:09.290
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

259
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a very weird feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knocking someone out is one of the</v>

260
00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:17.150
<v Speaker 1>weirdest feelings because a part of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is happy that it's not you,</v>

261
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but part of you is like looking down</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that guy that's just got flatlined</v>

262
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.690
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

263
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.093
<v Speaker 1>that could have been made.</v>

264
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And how much to fighters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

265
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.830
<v Speaker 1>hold back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:30.080
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like you kind of have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go to the death,</v>

267
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.020
<v Speaker 1>but then if you actually like punch</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody so hard they died or something.</v>

268
00:11:33.021 --> 00:11:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously you'd feel horrible or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will.</v>

269
00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:37.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't look back at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying.</v>

270
00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:38.990
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you don't hold back at all,</v>

271
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.700
<v Speaker 1>but then if you actually killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

272
00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:44.240
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you feel horrible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that someone dies in</v>

273
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:45.680
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not.</v>

274
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:46.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

275
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:47.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that,</v>

276
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

277
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.440
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has happened and it's sort of</v>

278
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>like it has happened very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely in mixed martial arts.</v>

279
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Never in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in boxing it happens more often and</v>

280
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why it happens more</v>
<v Speaker 1>often in boxing because you're only</v>

281
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>punching in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking people down.</v>

282
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 1>People are tapping out because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying weird grades.</v>

283
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

284
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 1>it's also there's more options to defend</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

285
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 1>You're not just getting battered against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ropes.</v>

286
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 1>They're also nowadays much better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping a fight when a fighter's</v>

287
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 1>clearly compromised when they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really fucked up.</v>

288
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.520
<v Speaker 1>In the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to let guys just get battered</v>

289
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.720
<v Speaker 5>box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't sit well with me.</v>

290
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

291
00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:29.890
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I'm not a fighter.</v>

292
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing about climbing is</v>

293
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 5>there's this real elemental appeal to</v>
<v Speaker 5>just you and the mountain and it's</v>

294
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 5>nature and it's beautiful and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 5>peaceful and calm.</v>

295
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:43.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like so different than having</v>
<v Speaker 5>thousands of people screaming at you as</v>

296
00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 5>you punch someone in the face over and</v>
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>

297
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

298
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 5>that's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My scene was like 2017.</v>

299
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:54.840
<v Speaker 5>Halloween.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a 400 pound stretched to pass a</v>

300
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 5>skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my gosh.</v>

301
00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 5>This fancy dress party in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking around and I'm thinking,</v>

302
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 5>these are all young kids compared to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm 30 and I felt like I was the oldest</v>

303
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:05.080
<v Speaker 5>guy in there like 29.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

304
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.880
<v Speaker 5>why am I doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

305
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 5>what you want for your life full of</v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

306
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.840
<v Speaker 5>This is not me a number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people told me before this</v>

307
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 5>I was going wrong was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to act out your life.</v>

308
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 5>You can only change your life if you</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to change it.</v>

309
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.850
<v Speaker 5>And I left and everyone said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you going home early?</v>

310
00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:23.684
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

311
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.710
<v Speaker 5>I left at 9:00.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went home and I got back home.</v>

312
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:29.080
<v Speaker 5>I didn't say anything to the Y,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it went straight upstairs into a</v>

313
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:32.860
<v Speaker 5>dark room</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I took the cheap,</v>

314
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:37.861
<v Speaker 5>had skeleton suit off and I sat there</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I got on my knees and I was praying</v>

315
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:41.420
<v Speaker 5>and begging God to help me</v>
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

316
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 5>At this point I'd never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never begged or cry to God to help</v>

317
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 5>maybe for her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prayed a lot all my life,</v>

318
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.710
<v Speaker 5>but I'd never been in this physical</v>
<v Speaker 5>state before.</v>

319
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 5>I can feel tears running down my face.</v>

320
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 5>My chest was wet with tears because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>knew I couldn't do it on my own.</v>

321
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.310
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't possible for me because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>tried and tried and tried and ended up</v>

322
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:05.020
<v Speaker 5>back in Nepal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>back drinking.</v>

323
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 5>I almost accepted that that was going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be my fate and alcoholic.</v>

324
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.430
<v Speaker 5>So it was on my knees in his bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

325
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.990
<v Speaker 5>after praying for about 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got up and I felt the weight of the</v>

326
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:24.421
<v Speaker 5>world was lifted off my shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And for the first time in years I knew</v>

327
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 5>it was going to make a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I called.</v>

328
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 5>My wife has said Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paris.</v>

329
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

330
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 5>she followed was drunk coming home from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pope.</v>

331
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monday morning I started to regain</v>

332
00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:37.990
<v Speaker 5>mission to try and get the heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 5>championship of the world book.</v>

333
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.131
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

334
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

335
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.700
<v Speaker 5>because before this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time I'd have a beer,</v>

336
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 5>I'd come back and I'm going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 5>heavyweight champion of the world again,</v>

337
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 5>because it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the alcohol talking,</v>

338
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 5>so I was like the money called Wolf a</v>
<v Speaker 5>thousand on this.</v>

339
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.400
<v Speaker 5>This sheep had Korea to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was living on the past thinking about</v>

340
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.990
<v Speaker 5>years before glory days and after this</v>
<v Speaker 5>prayer.</v>

341
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

342
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 5>This has got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't believe me one second,</v>

343
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 5>but even when I speak to her now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she says,</v>

344
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 5>that night you told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said a year and a difference,</v>

345
00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 5>and you've always swimming cap on.</v>
