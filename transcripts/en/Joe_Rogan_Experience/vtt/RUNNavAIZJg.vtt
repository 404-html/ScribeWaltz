<v Speaker 2>monkey in the seventh grade?</v>

70
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 2>That would have been fucking walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

71
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember how overwhelming it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time you were with a girl?</v>

72
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd never had any sort of feeling like</v>

73
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>that in your life and now it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming,</v>

74
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 2>completely overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have two sets of friends.</v>

75
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Do you have the logical friends and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have animal friends when you're 13,</v>

76
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>so I had friends that would go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Where are you guys going to go to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and then you have the fucking</v>

78

<v Speaker 2>heavy duty.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the right number.</v>

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>They just tell you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're lost.</v>

84
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>You completely fucking lost when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>

85
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 2>but how great is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fall in love and hold hands and go</v>

86
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>to the movies and go get a slice of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pizza.</v>

87
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 2>When I was 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in this place called Jamaica</v>

88
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>plain and it was like a at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's becoming more gentrified now,</v>

89
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.900
<v Speaker 2>but at the time was kind of sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had some kind of crazy neighbors when</v>

90
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 2>this one kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is Paul Hudson,</v>

91
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 2>he lived right next door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poly Hudson was my age.</v>

92
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 2>We were both like 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was like 30.</v>

93
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>He was like a 30 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>

94
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>He knew a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember one time he was talking</v>

95
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 2>about I hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't even come close to sex.</v>

96
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I had kissed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

97
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.460
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like a little pack or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that at 13 Paul yachts</v>

98
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.190
<v Speaker 2>and probably fucked 100 girls by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

99
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 2>It was an animal and a and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking and he goes,</v>

100
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another it got on the subject</v>

101
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 2>of how a penis enters the vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it gets in there.</v>

102
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was telling me,</v>

103
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>it goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go up in a and I go,</v>

104
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 2>you go up in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

105
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 2>you ain't never fucked a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you?</v>

106
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.180
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

107
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely haven't.</v>

108
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to admit it,</v>

109
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it was fucking obvious,</v>

110
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that your Dick went</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

111
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I thought it went straight in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all do.</v>

112
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I just found that out now and I'm 53.</v>

113
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know the up and I literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I could never figure it out in</v>

114
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>my head because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

115
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I kind of know where the vagina is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how could it work?</v>

116
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Going straight through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

117
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>But that's literally what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you went straight in.</v>

118

182
00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I tried to avoid him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was real.</v>

185
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.600
<v Speaker 2>that's when I really realized that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to learn how to fight when I moved</v>

186
00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:08.010
<v Speaker 2>to Jamaica plain because I was super</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous skies or pick on me and I had no</v>

<v Speaker 2>idea what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if anything went down,</v>

188
00:08:09.871 --> 00:08:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my Stepdad was never into violence.</v>

189
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever explained to me how to even</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch or hold your hands up correctly.</v>

190
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.590
<v Speaker 2>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to learn something,</v>

191
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 2>so that's when I started getting into</v>
<v Speaker 2>karate and I was into movies before that</v>

192
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd taken like a Kung Fu class or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that once when I was like</v>

193
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.460
<v Speaker 2>maybe eight years old and I lived in San</v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco,</v>

194
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but it really know martial arts to speak</v>
<v Speaker 2>of and this neighborhood.</v>

195
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.481
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

196
00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I got these kids are scaring the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

197
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.830
<v Speaker 2>When was this to make a plane in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York?</v>

198
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Now it said Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is a suburb of Boston.</v>

199
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Not a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a suburb really.</v>

200
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:45.120
<v Speaker 2>It was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an inner city area,</v>

201
00:08:45.121 --> 00:08:48.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's just at the time it was at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least just kind of a poor neighborhood,</v>

202
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.620
<v Speaker 2>but apparently now they have some nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>bars and restaurants and you know,</v>

203
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 2>housing prices so expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone a chance on the outskirts and</v>

204
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 2>they start pushing those bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods away.</v>

205
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 2>They start building up and own and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>become gentrified and you'd get a nice</v>

206
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 2>house in a nice neighborhood for a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

207
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 2>that's a giant problem with New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

209
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.400
<v Speaker 2>People just keep talking about it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn.</v>

210
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn's just being bought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

211
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so expensive to live in Manhattan.</v>

212
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever tried to look at real</v>
<v Speaker 2>estate?</v>

213
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:19.750
<v Speaker 2>If you ever fantasize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll move to New York for a couple</v>

214
00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:20.440
<v Speaker 2>of years.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's an apartment.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like regular rent.</v>

225
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 2>People were talking to him about their</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular rent.</v>

226
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 2>They were talking like $3,500.</v>

<v Speaker 2>every time heavy to live in that city.</v>

233
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.570
<v Speaker 2>For me to afford to live in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to live down the shore.</v>

234
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do that do you think you'd go</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the shore?</v>

235
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Long Island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go down the shore because I'm</v>

236
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:16.450
<v Speaker 2>familiar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

237
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I would go like route 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marlboro around there and they got</v>

238
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Chinese restaurants to the old school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian places.</v>

239
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already land.</v>

240
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Keep a place down there because we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a.</v>

241
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I think he's got like hoboken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoboken.</v>

242
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 2>He has a house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a condo or an apartment in</v>

243
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:36.920
<v Speaker 2>hoboken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's got a place down in the</v>

244
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 2>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a place down in this show.</v>

245
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still deal with a lot of gut.</v>

246
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Bob Gunzel gigs down their apps and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels right.</v>

247
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 2>This is a little away from where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody goes.</v>

248
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 2>This is up from Toms River and seaside</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Belmont one.</v>

249
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 2>This is Marlboro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still takes you off the 34,</v>

250
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.750
<v Speaker 2>35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still got to drive a little bit to</v>

251
00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:00.960
<v Speaker 2>see the ocean and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had a friend that lived there and</v>

252
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I liked the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked how the neighborhood was.</v>

253
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.170
<v Speaker 2>They had an old school Italian Delis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk in stinky cheese,</v>

254
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.133
<v Speaker 2>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saliva,</v>

255
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.600
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fucking tongue hanging upside down.</v>

256
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Wet books with water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

257
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie.</v>

258
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Edgar's got to be the king of Toms</v>
<v Speaker 2>River.</v>

259
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the king,</v>

260
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>King.</v>

261
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.290
<v Speaker 2>That's his place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been.</v>

262
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.640
<v Speaker 2>He made me say Tom's river on a paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>view once.</v>

263
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.773
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like after you once say Tom's river</v>

265
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 2>was like Toms River Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toms river is next to seaside.</v>

266
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.141
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

267
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:42.120
<v Speaker 2>like close to seaside lava.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let,</v>

268
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because every time I'd be in seaside I</v>

269
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:46.944
<v Speaker 2>was in Tom's river.</v>

270
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.611
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

271
00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to go to Tom's river.</v>

272
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.150
<v Speaker 2>What you do as you go down and you put</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some nets,</v>

273
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.560
<v Speaker 2>put those nets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the kids.</v>

274
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I used to go down and we stopped by Toms</v>
<v Speaker 2>River.</v>

275
00:11:55.661 --> 00:12:00.661
<v Speaker 2>There was a spot and you drop nuts off</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you go eat and you come back</v>

276
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 2>and you fucking pull out those clients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those crabs,</v>

277
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would go home and make a sauce</v>

278
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:07.340
<v Speaker 2>with the fucking crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

279
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Katrina water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>

280
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:10.231
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

281
00:12:10.231 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 2>the sauce with crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really get that out and you</v>

282
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very tough to make.</v>

283
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know how to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw them do it.</v>

284
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I would never fucking dry because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't trust her,</v>

285
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.110
<v Speaker 2>but they would just take the crabs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in a fucking hall boil the</v>

286
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.730
<v Speaker 2>crabs and the tomato sauce sauce and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>

287
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 2>it has to shell breaks.</v>

288
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

289
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.220
<v Speaker 2>they get the flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat.</v>

290
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember if they pull the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat out or if they left the clause in.</v>

291
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it seems like sometimes they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just left the clause and everything in.</v>

292
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you would have to get it out</v>

293
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:42.870
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to suck it out after we</v>

294
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 2>break the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't see that.</v>

295
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty rare with like a red</v>
<v Speaker 2>sauce.</v>

296
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.400
<v Speaker 2>You'll see it a little bit in a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>fancy Italian restaurant as a special.</v>

297
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Somebody comes in with those crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

298
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 2>we have some nice grabbed for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a place that was a real good</v>

299
00:12:57.371 --> 00:13:00.340
<v Speaker 2>place that was in west La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a real good,</v>

300
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:03.570
<v Speaker 2>especially when it opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Il Grano and uh,</v>

301
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it just went under</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

302
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 2>But this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chef as an artist man,</v>

303
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:13.441
<v Speaker 2>and he made this squid ink pasta with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a crab sauce,</v>

304
00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 2>like a light tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat crab sauce where it was,</v>

305
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know which kind of car crab it</v>

306
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

307
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dungeness.</v>

308
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

309
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 2>It was spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like this black ink pasta that</v>

310
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:30.460
<v Speaker 2>was cooked perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you chew into it.</v>

311
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't just dissolve you like it's got</v>

312
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:38.641
<v Speaker 2>a little pop to it as you bite into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the crab with the sauce.</v>

313
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite dishes.</v>

314
00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:42.830
<v Speaker 2>And what's the crab we get in Jersey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excited.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>

316

<v Speaker 2>Isn't that?</v>

318
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit about crabs and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up because whenever I go</v>

319
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 2>to Texas I get dungeness crab with the</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

326

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

327
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:13.570

<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

328
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:17.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's a get drunk sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

329
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Be As.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

330
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.420

<v Speaker 2>shitload of peers and your uncle gets</v>

331
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 2>drunk and stupid shit and wound up</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting out of there.</v>

332
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:28.420
<v Speaker 2>But it's crazy because as a child I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could eat lobster.</v>

333
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I could eat any fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking squid ink.</v>

334
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 2>The one I could not eat was crap growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

335
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Why not sick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right off the bat.</v>

336
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody said it had something that</v>

337
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:45.690
<v Speaker 2>crab has something that make you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't start eating crab or maybe 15</v>

338
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:49.150
<v Speaker 2>years ago I couldn't eat a crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the sauce.</v>

339
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I could take the sauce but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it had a skit.</v>

340
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

341
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.960

<v Speaker 3>I had done,</v>

342
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 3>I had done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody said that's what it is.</v>

343
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 3>It's heavy and I had died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's true.</v>

344
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking know what's in food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I put for years I couldn't eat it.</v>

345
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I started eating crab again Tuesday</v>
<v Speaker 3>nights at Meogie when we used to do</v>

346
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 3>comedy there and they used to lip sync</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there and shit when they had one</v>

347
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 3>little stone crab rolls and I didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>

348
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 3>So I started eating it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

349
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.600
<v Speaker 3>For years I get sick off grab every</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

350
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Anything else could go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crabs,</v>

351
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 3>clams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

352
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 3>I just went to Boston and I went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal seafoods and I got those big</v>

353
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 3>fucking clams every dead and 12 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

354
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 3>little horseradish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little.</v>

355
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things are fucking delicious</v>

356
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:37.280
<v Speaker 3>because you get the steamers with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tails and shit.</v>

357
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.390
<v Speaker 3>You don't like those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love those.</v>

358
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 3>You're making a face like it in like</v>
<v Speaker 3>steam is rough when you're eating that</v>

359
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 3>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dip those and butter.</v>

360
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.500
<v Speaker 3>It was the first day and I said whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to switch a big fucking clams</v>

361
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.930
<v Speaker 3>cherry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cherry net.</v>

362
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Those are good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are very good.</v>

363
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I think I prefer them over oysters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

364
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.580
<v Speaker 3>The A to the oysters don't work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the clams have more snap when</v>

365
00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're eating them raw.</v>

366
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because we never</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought about it is that being Sashimi,</v>

367
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just getting clams or oysters,</v>

368
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's raw fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's raw seafood,</v>

369
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.850
<v Speaker 3>seafood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

370
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that any different than,</v>

371
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting raw scallops at a Sushi place.</v>

372
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a weird thing that we just cook.</v>

373
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 3>We cook almost everything.</v>

374
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 3>We cook fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's spots we can go where they</v>

375
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 3>don't cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious.</v>

376
00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just give it to you raw.</v>

377
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.770
<v Speaker 3>You go to Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been Alaska and get the halibut up</v>

378
00:16:37.771 --> 00:16:38.870
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you get the.</v>

379
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Speaker 3>I haven't gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done that where it's fresh and</v>

380
00:16:42.621 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 3>really raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two different worlds,</v>

381
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Halibut.</v>

382
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Sushi is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine if you got it like right</v>

383
00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:49.370
<v Speaker 3>off the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be amazing.</v>

384
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

385
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.860
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that we have these sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>rules like as far as like food</v>

386
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:58.850
<v Speaker 3>preparation and it just changed with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sushi,</v>

387
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 3>like think of this country up until</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sushi.</v>

388
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were no one's serving raw fish</v>

389
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:04.960
<v Speaker 3>anywhere until what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean.</v>

390
00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 3>What year did she come out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The eighties or something.</v>

391
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember Japanese restaurants in New</v>

392
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.070
<v Speaker 3>York said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember Sushi.</v>

393
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Sushi.</v>

394
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.120
<v Speaker 3>She blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't try Sushi to Seattle like 95.</v>

395
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I still away from it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once I was in I was fucking all.</v>

396
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:24.830
<v Speaker 3>But I definitely remember Sushi when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a kid.</v>

397
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:27.710
<v Speaker 3>I remember it from when I was like 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 years old.</v>

398
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:32.270
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it had to be before then.</v>

399
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.310
<v Speaker 3>So man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was like the seventies.</v>

400
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 3>We think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Culinarily speaking.</v>

401
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.770
<v Speaker 3>If you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a long ass time</v>

402
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.620
<v Speaker 3>with no Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A long ass time in this country all</v>

403
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:48.580
<v Speaker 3>those years with no Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden Sushi now</v>

404
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 3>you've been to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

405
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.340
<v Speaker 2>And as the Sushi different in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know.</v>

406
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't say that honestly because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to a couple places,</v>

407
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go to a lot of places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

408
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 2>we were only there for the UFC so it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty in and out.</v>

409
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 2>But the Sushi that we found there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

410
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

411
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.110
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a Japanese restaurant,</v>

412
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 2>has a totally different feel because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in Japan.</v>

413
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people can barely speak English if</v>

414
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 2>they speak English at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The menus are all in both Japanese and</v>

415
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 2>English was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the cool things about</v>

416
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 2>traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people speak English,</v>

417
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of places you can go where you can</v>

418
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 2>at least sort of get by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They speak enough English so you can get</v>

419
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:34.520
<v Speaker 2>by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

420
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

421
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.733
<v Speaker 2>that's the case</v>

422
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.300
<v Speaker 2>since it's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

423
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 2>When Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

424
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.580
<v Speaker 2>if it's a totally different world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you go to Japan,</v>

425
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:51.690
<v Speaker 2>like their culture is so interesting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way they choose to behave like</v>

426
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 2>collectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So interesting.</v>

427
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 2>They're super polite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have giant crowds of people in the</v>

428
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 2>streets and there's no issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody walks by each other with no</v>

429
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:01.730
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>

430
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.770
<v Speaker 2>It seems like even though it's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerated culture and obviously they'd</v>

431
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.590
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make a lot of things.</v>

432
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.640
<v Speaker 2>It's they've giant businesses and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>small place.</v>

433
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 2>If you look at how tiny it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people are stacked in there,</v>

434
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.020
<v Speaker 2>but they're super polite really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

435
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.180
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how little crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much order you have and then every</v>

436
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 2>now and then you have these dudes have</v>
<v Speaker 2>come from other countries and decided</v>

437
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:26.881
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

438
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:28.800
<v Speaker 2>this is an easy pickins place.</v>

439
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 2>We were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ran a two while we're walking into a</v>

440
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:38.850
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and we ran into these African</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes trying to get you to go into these</v>

441
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 2>massage places now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like super aggressive about it and</v>

442
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

443
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 2>this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have all these polite Japanese</v>

444
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:51.951
<v Speaker 2>guys and then these really slick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>streetwise dudes have moved into spots</v>

445
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.570
<v Speaker 2>and you could see them sort of work in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these places,</v>

446
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.750
<v Speaker 2>but they're in Tokyo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

447
00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overall.</v>

448
00:19:59.151 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 2>It just really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really polite.</v>

449
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:02.970
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>

450
00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Apparently I didn't experience it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently they have a rate that</v>

451
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the older folks do not like</v>

452
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 2>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just are not really into Americans</v>

453
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 2>being around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We bombed them.</v>

454
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

455
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think they gonna forgive us that</v>

456
00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:20.220
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't think about that in our</v>

457
00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:21.540
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't think about that.</v>

458
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:24.150
<v Speaker 2>That's why they don't need Vietnam food</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>

459
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just fought them.</v>

460
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:28.410
<v Speaker 2>They want to poison this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to go to that and a Vietnamese</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

463
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how the menus,</v>

464
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Speaker 2>like what we think Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I asked you,</v>

465
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.810
<v Speaker 2>because when we think Chinese food is</v>
<v Speaker 2>here is completely different over there</v>

466
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.420
<v Speaker 2>because it gets an Americanized and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing goes for the Sushi.</v>

467
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Bob Sapp told me that when we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting the longest yard,</v>

468
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 3>he said the Sushi was more a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>primitive over there.</v>

469
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.800
<v Speaker 3>They'll come up with a fucking octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

470
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 3>like shit like that where there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of places that'll do that.</v>

471
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a cup.</v>

472
00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.230
<v Speaker 3>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

473
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.190
<v Speaker 3>when uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

474
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.150
<v Speaker 3>I was watching something on food and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about a place in Japan</v>

475
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:11.050
<v Speaker 3>where you go get some type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a place where they only serve food</v>

476
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 3>that has an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an aphrodisiac.</v>

477
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Oni,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's both balls and somethings I</v>

478
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:21.310
<v Speaker 3>balls or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you go in there to get tuned up for a</v>

479
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 3>date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you go to El Paso,</v>

480
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

481
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 3>If you go towards the end of a Paso,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas and get Mexican soup,</v>

482
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 3>like you could hand fish soup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of heads in there with</v>

483
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 3>the eyeballs looking right at you that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't find that here in</v>

484
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 3>California and have a fucking heart</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack.</v>

485
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 3>But once you get more towards the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country itself,</v>

486
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 3>they start showing that culture like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know anything about both balls.</v>

487
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:47.260
<v Speaker 3>It's something to do with bolts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

488
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 3>how they put it in a soup or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a special of the day and the women</v>

489
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 3>can eat it also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just becomes something different.</v>

490
00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:57.010
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was asking you about the</v>

491
00:21:57.011 --> 00:21:57.844
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

492
00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:02.230
<v Speaker 3>the one place that we went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to at least two Sushi places,</v>

493
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:05.470
<v Speaker 3>but one place we went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was supposedly a great place.</v>

494
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.850
<v Speaker 3>I think bordain might have recommended</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to me name drop,</v>

495
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.010
<v Speaker 3>but when we went in there it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

496
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.480
<v Speaker 3>same stuff that you get here really</v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh.</v>

497
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.510
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

498
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was right out of the ocean I'm sure.</v>

499
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.010
<v Speaker 3>But that's the same thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We share the ocean a lot of the same</v>

500
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Japanese fish people,</v>

501
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Japanese who she plays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only buy from Japanese fish</v>

502
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.030
<v Speaker 3>fishing guys.</v>

503
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.500
<v Speaker 3>They keep it like my buddy sold fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>back east and I used to say them.</v>

504
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:38.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel that the Japanese people</v>
<v Speaker 3>know it's well known that that market</v>

505
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:42.050
<v Speaker 3>with the mafia ran a really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go there in the morning,</v>

506
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 3>you see the town and just see the white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Irish and the Japanese people</v>

507
00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:48.040
<v Speaker 3>because they have different types of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish and what they do with it.</v>

508
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they have that poisoned</v>

509
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.110
<v Speaker 3>blowfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they tell you not to eat Sushi went</v>

510
00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:56.380
<v Speaker 3>on Mondays and some other debt because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fishers old.</v>

511
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always say the fish that comes</v>

512
00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday and Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when you get sushis.</v>

513
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Don't eat Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

514
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like someone day.</v>

515
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.930
<v Speaker 3>How long can you keep Sushi before it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

516
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.110
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you buy a big piece of tuna,</v>

517
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 3>how long before you have to serve that?</v>

518
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be very long.</v>

519
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Very long now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a few days at the most.</v>

520
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust fishing on trust pork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times you got to be careful</v>

521
00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:22.600
<v Speaker 3>with those two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those two.</v>

522
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Just a little slight McCook and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking in the hospital.</v>

523
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Not domestic pork isn't so much anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it used to be for sure freezing fish</v>

524
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:32.490
<v Speaker 3>for 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowing it to thaw on the refrigerator.</v>

525
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Reduce harmful bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Making the fish safer.</v>

526
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:35.973
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

527
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.310
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they free.</v>

528
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.121
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is interesting.</v>

529
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Fish for a made for a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for making homemade Sushi.</v>

530
00:23:43.901 --> 00:23:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Should be purchased from a cmo longer,</v>

531
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 2>not a local grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

532
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.670
<v Speaker 2>What's the seeming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Maga is a dude who goes and buys it</v>

533
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 2>straight off of the boats and he only</v>
<v Speaker 2>has like,</v>

534
00:23:55.251 --> 00:23:58.040
<v Speaker 2>he has it that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy used to train with in</v>

535
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:03.041
<v Speaker 2>revere who is a younger who would come</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take taekwondo in my class and this</v>

536
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:07.650
<v Speaker 2>dude had a truck and he would drive his</v>
<v Speaker 2>truck to the boats and you know,</v>

537
00:24:07.651 --> 00:24:11.330
<v Speaker 2>negotiate a price and buy fish and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver that fish to restaurants.</v>

538
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Like that was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting because we</v>

539
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:18.390
<v Speaker 2>talked about it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was telling me how,</v>

540
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.440
<v Speaker 2>what a grind it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

541
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 2>how much work is involved and what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

542
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:25.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was getting up early.</v>

543
00:24:25.721 --> 00:24:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

544
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.570
<v Speaker 1>In the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning you put an App,</v>

545
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 1>would you tell them you go to like 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants and you'll listen?</v>

546
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I have salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my Ma and I got the yellow tail.</v>

547
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 1>That's my fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

548
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 1>you pull it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's say you're a column my</v>

549
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.310
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and you sell 25 pounds a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

550
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:43.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

551
00:24:43.801 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I liked my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where I grew up.</v>

552
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Rudy's Rudy's is basically a columbine</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>

553
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.350
<v Speaker 1>People go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the appetizer they buy 50 pounds</v>

554
00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:54.050
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably got three different guys.</v>

555
00:24:54.051 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 1>They go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

556
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And Chris was one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

557
00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 1>he was Italian and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to cook it.</v>

558
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.800
<v Speaker 1>So he would go over to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a great job for years.</v>

559
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened?</v>

560
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:09.440
<v Speaker 1>He got smart and that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got smart when he kept it simple,</v>

561
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 1>his was very easy.</v>

562
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 1>He went to restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said this is what I have really good.</v>

563
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.400
<v Speaker 1>And he gave him a car with a phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

564
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 1>He got up at three in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pressed the machine and this is joe</v>

565
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:25.450
<v Speaker 1>from Rogan's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get 25 pounds of column on 10</v>

566
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.550
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the yellow tail.</v>

567
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 1>So all he had to do now is add up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would get your 10 pounds squared</v>

568
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:35.330
<v Speaker 1>is 20 pounds is 30 and Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need 100 pounds of squid.</v>

569
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.540
<v Speaker 1>He would go down there and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that actually cut a deal for</v>

570
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:39.710
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

571
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I want this a pound to 100 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it to you for this.</v>

572
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.660
<v Speaker 1>His money changed every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's money changes every day.</v>

573
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.470
<v Speaker 1>So once he go to the boat by it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they delivered it and that was it.</v>

574
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.920
<v Speaker 1>No overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no real insurance,</v>

575
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:56.360
<v Speaker 1>no freezers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

576
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Anything he had left over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he went to come to his</v>

577
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:03.130
<v Speaker 1>family to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened was he went partners with</v>

578
00:26:03.131 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 1>a guy got a freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stocked up on the fucking food.</v>

579
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:08.780
<v Speaker 1>They stocked up on the fish and New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a power outage.</v>

580
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 1>He lost 60 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the end of everything.</v>

581
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.950
<v Speaker 1>He lost 60 department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost like 80 [inaudible].</v>

582
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 1>They went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got got bones and spent all this money</v>

583
00:26:18.681 --> 00:26:21.050
<v Speaker 1>on wholesale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I both know it's a daily thing.</v>

584
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a daily thing.</v>

585
00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:25.550
<v Speaker 1>You been making a living for 10 years on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a daily.</v>

586
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Now you want to think about the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>and buy a bunch of fish and that's the</v>

587
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:30.860
<v Speaker 1>night that like a week later the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>went out.</v>

588
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:33.800
<v Speaker 1>When he moves into his warehouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to go there in the middle of the</v>

589
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.530
<v Speaker 1>night and fish ice things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to take stuff out and ice.</v>

590
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Him and Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

591
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.220
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have such good insulation</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then either.</v>

592
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 2>How long has the power for like 12 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>that time in New York.</v>

593
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 2>This school I'm telling you 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

594
00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.250
<v Speaker 2>you know they have coolers now that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep things like they keep ice for seven</v>

595
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 2>days outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen these coolers.</v>

596
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're crazy.</v>

597
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different really high</v>

598
00:27:02.071 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 2>end coolers and most of it was started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least to my knowledge by this company</v>

599
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 2>called Yeti and Yeti coolers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make these outdoor cores that</v>

600
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.850
<v Speaker 2>people use when they go camping or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

601
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 2>They're real thick and you put ice in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fucking things.</v>

602
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.270
<v Speaker 2>You close the lid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open that lid and seven days there's</v>

603
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 2>going to be ice in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

604
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.030
<v Speaker 2>The insulation properties of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are nuts.</v>

605
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

606
00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 2>They have a seal like your pull down</v>
<v Speaker 2>these rubber straps to seal it in.</v>

607
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.590
<v Speaker 2>They're not cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking heavy shit to.</v>

608
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:32.790
<v Speaker 2>They're really heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

609
00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Most coolers are really light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things are not like you want your</v>

610
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:38.700
<v Speaker 2>eyes to fucking safest days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're crazy though.</v>

611
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:41.910
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy what they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they somehow or another figure it</v>

612
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:44.370
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some insulation method that retains cold</v>

613
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have that shit in the</v>

614
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:49.853
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>

615
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the Ice House in Pasadena used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be an ice house.</v>

616
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Used to be a place where they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver ice and you would go and get a</v>

617
00:27:58.301 --> 00:28:01.440
<v Speaker 2>chunk of that shit for your icebox and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have an icebox and</v>

618
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:04.480
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator and that's where you keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>your milk and whatever you're going to</v>

619
00:28:04.481 --> 00:28:06.400
<v Speaker 2>eat that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you went to the market every day.</v>

620
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Feiss yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to the market for ice when maybe</v>

621
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I use every few days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you went to the market everyday for</v>

622
00:28:13.031 --> 00:28:14.440
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't,</v>

623
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.440
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't just have like a</v>

624
00:28:17.441 --> 00:28:18.730
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You open up,</v>

625
00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.310
<v Speaker 2>pull out packages of meat packages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken like that.</v>

626
00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Nobody did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really rare.</v>

627
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Like when there was no refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

628
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.470
<v Speaker 2>That's not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For most of human history.</v>

629
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.620
<v Speaker 2>There's been no refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why people used to go to war for</v>

630
00:28:35.621 --> 00:28:36.610
<v Speaker 2>salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>

631
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.950
<v Speaker 2>they used to go to war for salt because</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt was how you could keep your food</v>

632
00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:44.710
<v Speaker 2>fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to take a piece of meat and</v>

633
00:28:44.711 --> 00:28:47.710
<v Speaker 2>cover it with salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cover it completely,</v>

634
00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.900
<v Speaker 2>and that would keep bacteria from</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing on it.</v>

635
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.340
<v Speaker 2>That's how they took care of their meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like they would salt their fish</v>

636
00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.120
<v Speaker 2>when they would go to see they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

637
00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.160
<v Speaker 2>the salt would be so valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there was salt wars in the world</v>

638
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.540
<v Speaker 2>for fucking salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is worth nothing now.</v>

639
00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you went all in on salt back</v>

640
00:29:08.241 --> 00:29:09.380
<v Speaker 2>then and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

641
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.840
<v Speaker 2>people are going to war for this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then today you went to a diner and</v>

642
00:29:12.841 --> 00:29:15.560
<v Speaker 2>there they have little packets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just take them like you could</v>

643
00:29:15.561 --> 00:29:16.850
<v Speaker 2>take them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to in and out Burger.</v>

644
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.600
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I take you?</v>

645
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Take as many as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can take as much salt as you want.</v>

646
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.200
<v Speaker 2>What are you fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd call your Viking friends.</v>

647
00:29:24.201 --> 00:29:26.840
<v Speaker 2>They're given salt away at the Burger</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

648
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.180
<v Speaker 2>It would just come in there and steal</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the salt.</v>

649
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Salt back then would you kill people for</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt?</v>

650
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Because that's how people like it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow you to keep food longer,</v>

651
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 2>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was like imagine to war for</v>

652
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 2>refrigerators.</v>

653
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.200
<v Speaker 3>You know Japan had the refrigerators and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't know there was a war to try to</v>

654
00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:49.000
<v Speaker 3>get refrigerators is the only way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep.</v>

655
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Keep your food longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's literally what people were doing.</v>

656
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.260
<v Speaker 3>They were going to war for salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you watched the honeymooners,</v>

657
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 3>they drained the refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I figured out why it was an ice</v>

658
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:02.470
<v Speaker 3>cube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would pick the thing up and drain</v>

659
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:04.000
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The honeymoon is and that's why they</v>

660
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 3>probably put an ice cube and now they</v>
<v Speaker 3>close it.</v>

661
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.310
<v Speaker 3>That's how they do what the honeymooners</v>
<v Speaker 3>though was electrical,</v>

662
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:12.520
<v Speaker 3>so they probably did have refrigerators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of those things would freeze</v>

663
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ice box is you'd have to defrost</v>

664
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:16.120
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>

665
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would.</v>

666
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.820
<v Speaker 3>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking freezer would literally be like</v>

667
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:25.780
<v Speaker 3>the inside of it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a an ice cave?</v>

668
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Yeti's ice cave and a monster</v>

669
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:28.534
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

670
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.000
<v Speaker 3>Now you have freezes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freezes.</v>

671
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Well they call them something that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>freezers don't.</v>

672
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Isis freezers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

673
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.910
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to defrost them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

674
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.420
<v Speaker 3>but we used to chip out them with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>screwdriver and fucking hit.</v>

675
00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to use my air conditioner a year</v>

676
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 3>round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my mom used to call you fucking</v>

677
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd put the air conditioning in my room</v>

678
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.130
<v Speaker 3>year round and it would get a brick of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice on it.</v>

679
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

680
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens when you put it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the window.</v>

681
00:30:57.881 --> 00:31:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I guess the inside refreeze freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to turn it off and let it come</v>

682
00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 3>down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The inside,</v>

683
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 3>we're fucking freeze them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those old school heaters.</v>

684
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:11.200
<v Speaker 3>That would make noise when they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting up like clank clank,</v>

685
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 3>clank pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>radiator heaters,</v>

686
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 3>really tap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>

687
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.083
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>

688
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:16.871
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>

689
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:17.704
<v Speaker 3>tap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tap.</v>

690
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:22.590
<v Speaker 3>It was this hot fucking chunk of metal</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your house and if you leaned on it</v>

691
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:27.190
<v Speaker 3>would sear your skin like a George</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreman grill and that's how you keep</v>

692
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:28.570
<v Speaker 3>your house warm.</v>

693
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Remember those goddamn things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are ridiculous metal things.</v>

694
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Those heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would pick one of those</v>

695
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck those radiators,</v>

696
00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does water heaters.</v>

697
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Hot Water would go through them and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would heat up and that's what you use to</v>

698
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 3>keep your house warm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things were ridiculous and you put</v>

699
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:51.700
<v Speaker 3>a box over them and even if you sat on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the box by mistake,</v>

700
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:53.380
<v Speaker 3>you'd fucking burn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

701
00:31:53.381 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 3>And the only thing in your fucking house</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all would be like within 15 feet of</v>

702
00:31:57.221 --> 00:31:59.200
<v Speaker 3>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they always put them under the</v>

703
00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:01.030
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

704
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 3>They would put the heat under the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking window.</v>

705
00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Like I never figured that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'd stand there and get burned.</v>

706
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.790
<v Speaker 3>But there was like a draft or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

707
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.240
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have anywhere else to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

708
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't put them in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roundabout,</v>

709
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.000
<v Speaker 3>those metal fucking thing.</v>

710
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get like a house,</v>

711
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.070
<v Speaker 3>like the last house I had it and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>studio said he had no fucking heat.</v>

712
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Why when they built that no fucking heat</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't think people in</v>

713
00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know those burbank houses,</v>

714
00:32:24.911 --> 00:32:28.230
<v Speaker 3>those old houses that didn't have heat</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they put a little box like you're</v>

800
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 3>metal and you're injecting some liquid</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:11.540
<v Speaker 3>this guy does a lot of coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put them in this category kink.</v>

807
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got smokes a lot of weed and put them</v>

808
00:36:13.621 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 3>in that quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paint.</v>

809
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shoots heroin.</v>

810
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

811
00:36:17.671 --> 00:36:21.040
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker goes over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a different role.</v>

812
00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I something that you know how much pain</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had in my heart the first time I had</v>

813
00:36:25.171 --> 00:36:26.370
<v Speaker 3>to put something in my nose.</v>

814
00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good feeling.</v>

815
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about it now.</v>

816
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just made a big leap to being a guy</v>

817
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:40.400
<v Speaker 3>who does coke the first time I put some</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my nose or wasn't covered.</v>

818
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.220
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was angel toss.</v>

819
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.180
<v Speaker 3>It was the crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

820
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

821
00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.000
<v Speaker 3>they called the TAC crystal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crystal.</v>

822
00:36:48.001 --> 00:36:50.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't call thc like pot.</v>

823
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what you did in those days was</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a thing that you took a bunch</v>

824
00:36:54.001 --> 00:36:55.730
<v Speaker 3>of stems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got,</v>

825
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.790
<v Speaker 3>you took a pound of the stamps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to pound the weed.</v>

826
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.440
<v Speaker 3>You took those stems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put them in a little bit of water</v>

827
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 3>and you boil it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The powder that goes to the end of the</v>

828
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.420
<v Speaker 3>thing that would scrape that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mix it with some color and then you can</v>

829
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:10.254
<v Speaker 3>snort that.</v>

830
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 3>That was the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was okay.</v>

831
00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some tea.</v>

832
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.030
<v Speaker 3>See Crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does that do for you?</v>

833
00:37:16.031 --> 00:37:18.050
<v Speaker 3>What does it feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I feel like you had a smoke.</v>

834
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like an adult,</v>

835
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:24.380
<v Speaker 3>but they got hip and they started</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting angel dust and gorilla</v>

836
00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 3>tranquilizers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking donkey.</v>

837
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And next thing you know you,</v>

838
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had a great time doing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

839
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love doing that crystal shit.</v>

840
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loved it to.</v>

841
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:40.680
<v Speaker 3>So this is the snorting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snorting or smoking slump.</v>

842
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Essentially a edible cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't.</v>

843
00:37:44.851 --> 00:37:46.720
<v Speaker 3>No edible cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally there.</v>

844
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.040
<v Speaker 3>It was gorilla biscuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

845
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 3>So you have two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can either go down to like a place</v>

846
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:56.931
<v Speaker 3>and buy for $10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got three lines when you're 16 and</v>

847
00:37:57.031 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 3>15 each line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the street hours make it.</v>

848
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Each line were high for 12 hours.</v>

849
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm how fucking 12 hours or eight hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>of heavy duty like the last.</v>

850
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.050
<v Speaker 3>If you had a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's hard to tell now because your</v>

851
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 3>tolerance is so high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you had to compare it to like an</v>

852
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Speaker 3>edible was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like a 200 milligram,</v>

853
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

854
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:18.850
<v Speaker 3>compared to an edible 500 million gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

855
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:19.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

856
00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.900
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different area.</v>

857
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like taking something that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually go to a different fucking</v>

858
00:38:25.651 --> 00:38:27.690
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like doing an adult,</v>

859
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 3>but I've done some edibles and I've gone</v>
<v Speaker 3>to different rums.</v>

860
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but first couple times you do the like,</v>

861
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 3>one time I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working.</v>

862
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 3>I graduated</v>

863
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.340
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the tail end of my tea.</v>

864
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Have my crystal Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even because I did crystal tea</v>

865
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.820
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was probably 15,</v>

866
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe 14 and a half up to the point my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother died.</v>

867
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Then cocaine took over and cocaine just</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

868
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 1>fuck all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was no more acid.</v>

869
00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine came in that heavy in 1980.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before 1980 you would snort.</v>

870
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 1>You were doing the pills and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the fucking,</v>

871
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 1>the thc crystals and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after the cocaine,</v>

872
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 1>just want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 82 I graduated,</v>

873
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:15.661
<v Speaker 1>I was working in the city for this book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went over one day and they go,</v>

874
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to do the horses today.</v>

875
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:20.050
<v Speaker 1>My Dad can't come if you want to hang</v>
<v Speaker 1>out for the afternoon.</v>

876
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.131
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

877
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll just take the day off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget this.</v>

878
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I went walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw some girl and I was walking into</v>

879
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:30.310
<v Speaker 1>one of those spots to get reefer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to get weed,</v>

880
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.710
<v Speaker 1>my day was over and let me get weeded</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and I don't have to come back</v>

881
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:35.890
<v Speaker 1>tonight from Jersey and some black girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up to me,</v>

882
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 1>that'd be 10 in the morning and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

883
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:40.780
<v Speaker 1>you want to split a tray?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

884
00:39:40.781 --> 00:39:42.520

<v Speaker 1>A tray was at $3,</v>

885
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:43.970
<v Speaker 1>bag of angel dust.</v>

886
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 1>So you opened it up and it was just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little wine and you took it and sprinkle</v>

<v Speaker 1>jacket and I could see her belly.</v>

897

<v Speaker 3>looking through your whiskey thing that</v>

954
00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Jack Daniels is Sinatra at.</v>

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.110
<v Speaker 3>I'll drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Affects me completely different than it</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's against always.</v>

961
00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I always fucked me up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watching.</v>

962
00:43:33.171 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's why you don't like booze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it has a stronger effect on</v>

963
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:36.881
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe do.</v>

964
00:43:36.881 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't like boosters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in a bar and saw the</v>

965
00:43:39.201 --> 00:43:39.891
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

966
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:44.180
<v Speaker 3>you and I have a common knowledge that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about the ad that I'm going to</v>

967
00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:46.010
<v Speaker 3>point my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't take drunk people,</v>

968
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.180
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to be honest with you.</v>

969
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.830
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't take drunk people and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

970
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I was just drunk and doing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I understood them.</v>

971
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Now when somebody comes up to me drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck you talking</v>

972
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:56.474
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

973
00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 3>it's a hard time when you're sober and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're drunk and they're insistent on</v>

974
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:04.160
<v Speaker 3>talking because you're in two different</v>
<v Speaker 3>frequencies and their frequency is very</v>

975
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 3>awkward to you and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize that they're being</v>

976
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 3>awkward because they're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

977
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 3>it's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some people are great drugs,</v>

978
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.670
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

979
00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:15.560
<v Speaker 3>they'll have a few drinks and you never</v>
<v Speaker 3>noticed a thing.</v>

980
00:44:15.561 --> 00:44:18.080
<v Speaker 3>They're just happy having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Brian Collins.</v>

981
00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Good example that he ever see Brian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Count drunk.</v>

982
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when he's drunk,</v>

983
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:23.990
<v Speaker 3>he's just Brian Cowen drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

984
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Speaker 3>he's just having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just being silly,</v>

985
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he uh,</v>

986
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.830
<v Speaker 3>he maintains his character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

987
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.693
<v Speaker 3>some people don't</v>

988
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 2>and there's a certain people that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get drunk and you have to talk to if</v>

989
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 2>you're sober and they were drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

990
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:38.840
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

991
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.890

<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

992
00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't get it.</v>

993
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big problem with being drunk because</v>

994
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 2>you'd almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:51.120
<v Speaker 2>you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't really know how.</v>

996
00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:52.770
<v Speaker 2>You sound so terrible.</v>

997
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.780
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Totally know how goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look</v>

999
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:04.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody's drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fine with one person,</v>

1000
00:45:04.061 --> 00:45:04.930
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:11.500
<v Speaker 1>But I realized how fucking Shitty I felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day or half a cigarette,</v>

1003
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:13.330
<v Speaker 1>like three pops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I threw it away.</v>

1004
00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the next day I could feel in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

1005
00:45:16.181 --> 00:45:19.780

<v Speaker 1>And you'll ball while you're doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why you're doing all that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>great way that you described it like Joe</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan.</v>

1012
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:40.090
<v Speaker 1>It's in your bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you talk to an addict and say to</v>

1013
00:45:40.091 --> 00:45:41.620
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1016
00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.380
<v Speaker 1>The withdrawal from heroin and even the</v>

<v Speaker 1>but like the first time I could make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card payment.</v>

1036
00:46:39.191 --> 00:46:43.390
<v Speaker 1>When I got divorced it ruined me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was against my principal who I was</v>

1037
00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always pay your fucking,</v>

1038
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1039
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.140
<v Speaker 1>so if you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like in yourself,</v>

1040
00:46:50.141 --> 00:46:50.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1041
00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm letting myself down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:46:52.811 --> 00:46:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Once you put something up your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose,</v>

1043
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.130
<v Speaker 1>you smack yourself in the face at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1044
00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind shooting something and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>vein.</v>

1045
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:02.830
<v Speaker 1>That is a complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:47:02.831 --> 00:47:04.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1047
00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend for years that was hooked</v>

1048
00:47:06.491 --> 00:47:08.860
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come into his house on Monday mornings</v>

1049
00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:15.090
<v Speaker 1>there'd be blood splatters on the walls</v>
<v Speaker 1>from him missing the vein she uses.</v>

1050
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.390
<v Speaker 1>He would buy a $100 worth of heroin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bought coke.</v>

1051
00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.010
<v Speaker 1>He was doing the Belushi all weekend.</v>

1052
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would Belushi it all weekend.</v>

1053
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:27.640
<v Speaker 1>That speedball right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the coke and the heroin</v>

1054
00:47:27.641 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 1>together and it creates sort of a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

1055
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.490
<v Speaker 1>It creates fuck getting a tornado in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>

1056
00:47:36.491 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>You just passed the fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1057
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:43.750
<v Speaker 1>this guy would be clean from Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was brilliant from Monday to Friday.</v>

1058
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.650
<v Speaker 1>He could keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Thursday night he would break</v>

1059
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:51.100
<v Speaker 1>down and do a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little sniff just to keep them</v>

1060
00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:54.130
<v Speaker 1>together during the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once Friday came,</v>

1061
00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:55.660
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't see him till Monday</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

1062
00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:58.910
<v Speaker 1>During the week you would massage his</v>
<v Speaker 1>veins.</v>

1063
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I got a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to get them to go home for the</v>

1064
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 1>weekend and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1065
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:10.060
<v Speaker 1>And then he would switch like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you go from your arm to your</v>

1066
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:12.640
<v Speaker 1>toe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you half like I can't find a</v>

1067
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:12.940
<v Speaker 1>vein.</v>

1068
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.391
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1069
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:18.391
<v Speaker 1>Let me take my shoe off and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot my toe is just the first guy I</v>

1070
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:22.780
<v Speaker 1>ever had friends that did steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the most interesting</v>

1071
00:48:22.781 --> 00:48:26.020
<v Speaker 1>nights of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were doing coke in the middle of</v>

1072
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.030
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just took off his shirt and started</v>

1073
00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:30.670
<v Speaker 1>doing pushups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got up and he goes,</v>

1074
00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:32.580
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's different for you lifting?</v>

1075
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:33.101
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1076
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I started doing steroids and he started</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking it down to me.</v>

1077
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:41.290
<v Speaker 1>He was getting an addiction to steroids</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was going to every week and</v>

1078
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:43.570
<v Speaker 1>just shooting and they just went off a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>

1079
00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Then they just stopped breaking it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on a cycle year round,</v>

1080
00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:52.870
<v Speaker 1>but he was addicted to the needle going</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his ass and then he would shoot it</v>

1081
00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:57.760
<v Speaker 1>with vitamin B and he would tell me he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can taste the vitamin B in his mouth and</v>

1082
00:48:57.761 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1083
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fucking shoot coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can taste it in your mouth.</v>

1084
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.680
<v Speaker 1>How you really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.443
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1086
00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you shoot it now shooting coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much different is that supposed to</v>

1087
00:49:09.101 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 1>be than snorting it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>

1088
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.470
<v Speaker 1>but what about the people that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean most pick something crazy.</v>

1089
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Birds of a feather flock together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I snorted.</v>

1090
00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with snow artists once they</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to them about needles.</v>

1091
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:21.300
<v Speaker 1>That's when I go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I see a needle,</v>

1092
00:49:21.301 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sit in a room where</v>

1093
00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking needle because I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit still.</v>

1094
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Once I see that syringe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want me around.</v>

1095
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to cvs a month ago and they had</v>

1096
00:49:32.681 --> 00:49:35.080
<v Speaker 1>syringes that they give you a free</v>
<v Speaker 1>syringes.</v>

1097
00:49:35.081 --> 00:49:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I almost fucking died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like.</v>

1098
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like.</v>

1099
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to see them.</v>

1100
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Those people that carry the fixes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1101
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:47.730
<v Speaker 1>they call them a fix kit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spoon and a syringe and a lighter and</v>

1102
00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:50.700
<v Speaker 1>the needles here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1103
00:49:50.701 --> 00:49:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And that when they call it the gears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would ask him like,</v>

1104
00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:55.360
<v Speaker 1>so when you go over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you shoot it?</v>

1105
00:49:55.361 --> 00:49:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all stand around who and we.</v>

1106
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Then we all pass the needle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is 82 when you could pass a veto</v>

1107
00:50:02.021 --> 00:50:06.600
<v Speaker 1>from one guy to the other and shoot the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball and fucking that guy,</v>

1108
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one needle to another.</v>

1109
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Then filling it with vitamin B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would go,</v>

1110
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:16.510
<v Speaker 1>why are we gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1111
00:50:16.511 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 1>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't know how the needle</v>

1112
00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:19.270
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you keep shooting,</v>

1113
00:50:19.271 --> 00:50:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it gets dull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Just take one neat on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the nine guys knew each other</v>

1115
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>through each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firstly you hepatitis</v>

1116
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.620
<v Speaker 3>C,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the first thing he got from that</v>

1117
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:31.880
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just that.</v>

1118
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 3>Now you get hepatitis C if you jam a</v>
<v Speaker 3>needle into you that's been jammed into</v>

1119
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:37.820
<v Speaker 3>someone with Hepatitis C,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1120
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you on sexual transmission also?</v>

1121
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:41.503
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1122
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 3>He ever thought about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've thought about that before.</v>

1123
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Like herpes or anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>warts.</v>

1124
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:56.590
<v Speaker 3>There had to be an original case like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had to be one person that developed</v>

1125
00:50:57.561 --> 00:50:59.720
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how does that develop?</v>

1126
00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I've always been curious like how the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck does something like a herpes,</v>

1127
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.800
<v Speaker 3>so on point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one has her syphilis and you blog</v>

1128
00:51:07.801 --> 00:51:11.920
<v Speaker 3>guy with Spanish syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes the harp they can together</v>

1129
00:51:11.921 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Speaker 3>glide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens.</v>

1130
00:51:13.101 --> 00:51:14.520
<v Speaker 3>It becomes more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse,</v>

1131
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right now supposedly all these</v>

1132
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:20.450
<v Speaker 3>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they disappeared for a while.</v>

1133
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Then they make a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something was popular last year.</v>

1134
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.200
<v Speaker 3>We get measles.</v>

1135
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no sexual.</v>

1136
00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something came back last year that was</v>

1137
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:33.390

<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1144

1324
01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.550
<v Speaker 2>the ag act like a flea collar that you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>put on your dog with apparently worked</v>

1325
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:08.430
<v Speaker 2>and then they had these flea drops that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put on dogs.</v>

1326
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.020

1327
01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:14.990
<v Speaker 2>various spots like right behind the neck</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then like in the middle of the back</v>

1328
01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:18.980
<v Speaker 2>and the lower back and the dog would go</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy and roll around on the</v>

1329
01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

1330
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Try to get that shit off them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you didn't do it you,</v>

1331
01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.030
<v Speaker 2>your dog's going to get fleas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had carpet does that means you</v>

1332
01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:28.640
<v Speaker 2>have fleas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you were walking I'd like in my</v>

1333
01:00:28.641 --> 01:00:31.370
<v Speaker 2>bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be walking in my carpet and I'd see</v>

1334
01:00:31.371 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 2>a flea jump onto my leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like fuck.</v>

1335
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 2>And once you have it you just have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1336
01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:41.840
<v Speaker 2>like I mean there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some carpet stuff that I used to have to</v>

1337
01:00:41.841 --> 01:00:45.320
<v Speaker 2>shake down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I shake down all this poison shit all</v>

1338
01:00:45.321 --> 01:00:47.750
<v Speaker 2>over my carpet and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>vacuum it up,</v>

1339
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 2>but there's always one or two that</v>
<v Speaker 2>survived one or two gangster fleas.</v>

1340
01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:55.160
<v Speaker 2>It figured out how to fucking stay away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the powder and then figure their</v>

1341
01:00:55.161 --> 01:00:57.950
<v Speaker 2>way right back onto your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was hard to get get it off the</v>

1342
01:00:57.951 --> 01:01:00.890
<v Speaker 2>dogs too because then they would just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang out with other dogs.</v>

1343
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:04.190
<v Speaker 2>They'd get it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you cleaned him up and kill all</v>

1344
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 2>the fleas that got them again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could see the eggs,</v>

1345
01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:11.450
<v Speaker 2>like he would click be cleaning them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your wash your dog at the base of</v>

1346
01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:16.030
<v Speaker 2>their hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd find the every fucking gross it</v>

1347
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.260
<v Speaker 2>was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would just drop it and she'll over</v>

1348
01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:20.120
<v Speaker 2>your carpet.</v>

1353
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.360

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1378
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Explain to me marriage guys who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been to hardcore divorces,</v>

1379
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.560
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a fucking way.</v>

1380
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>They have a way of grabbing you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting that urgency and you listen to</v>

1381
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:45.354
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to me.</v>

1382
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Don't fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1383
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:48.503
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't do it.</v>

1384
01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:49.653
<v Speaker 2>I won't do it.</v>

1385
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:56.590
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing as bad as the divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say death is probably worse.</v>

1386
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Divorce is great.</v>

1387
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:00.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what the problem with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people is,</v>

1388
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:05.750
<v Speaker 2>especially a lot of dudes with money is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get married.</v>

1389
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Your wife has my two now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like before you got married,</v>

1390
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.240
<v Speaker 2>you were the guy with money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you had a bunch of money and she's</v>

1391
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:14.641
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1392
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:18.600
<v Speaker 2>like this guy got money and then when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get married,</v>

1393
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:21.630
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now she's got money to now she gets her,</v>

1394
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:26.310
<v Speaker 2>recognize you for you and so it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not as cool anymore because</v>

1395
01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:29.640
<v Speaker 2>you're not just a guy with money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got money to bitch to her fucking</v>

1396
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:31.490
<v Speaker 2>money now and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

1397
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take my share and get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck outta here.</v>

1398
01:03:33.391 --> 01:03:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Like all of a sudden she's got your</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1399
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened is like there's a bunch of</v>

1400
01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:40.320
<v Speaker 2>things that happen when people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>married,</v>

1401
01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:41.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's love,</v>

1402
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.990
<v Speaker 2>there's devotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's commitment,</v>

1403
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 2>there's a beautiful bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ego you guys share,</v>

1404
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:51.650
<v Speaker 2>but let's not get confused under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same rules with the exact same</v>

1405
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1406
01:03:52.801 --> 01:03:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of scamming going on.</v>

1407
01:03:56.070 --> 01:04:01.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people getting robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of legal extortion.</v>

1408
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of legal stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of really hot women who</v>

1409
01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:08.370
<v Speaker 2>have no business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking some old dude.</v>

1410
01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:11.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of really hot women that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like fucking some guy who's 70 years</v>

1411
01:04:11.941 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 2>old and they talked this dummy it</v>
<v Speaker 2>marrying them with no prenuptial they</v>

1412
01:04:16.831 --> 01:04:20.650
<v Speaker 2>suck his dick for a couple of years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped a cup them</v>

1413
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:27.260
<v Speaker 2>and take a chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take a giant chunk of millions and</v>

1414
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.950
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happens to.</v>

1415
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it shouldn't happen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's,</v>

1416
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:34.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not an interesting deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1417
01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:35.590
<v Speaker 2>that some people make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1418
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 2>like the Guy Married Anna Nicole Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember I used to have that bit about</v>

1419
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:40.290
<v Speaker 2>that guy that was the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1420
01:04:40.291 --> 01:04:41.850
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing wrong with it.</v>

1421
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1422
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the same.</v>

1423
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Like all marriages is not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people that were upset about like gay</v>

1424
01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:54.270
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people that legitimately love each</v>

1425
01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:56.820
<v Speaker 2>other and they want to get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd be upset at this other shit.</v>

1426
01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:00.330
<v Speaker 2>She'd be upset that you could go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegas high on coke,</v>

1427
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.460
<v Speaker 2>go through a drive through and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>

1428
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:05.490
<v Speaker 2>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not drug testing you.</v>

1429
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:09.990
<v Speaker 2>They take you to those drive through</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elvis fucking wedding chapels and Vegas.</v>

1430
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.110
<v Speaker 2>You think they see if you're dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a fuck if you're drunk.</v>

1431
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Speaker 2>You mean maybe you can get it a note</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow if you are.</v>

1432
01:05:16.711 --> 01:05:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1433
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:20.840
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a shit that's marriage</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1434
01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bunch of different things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn contract.</v>

1435
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.790
<v Speaker 1>No marriage is bad for somebody when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose something.</v>

1436
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:29.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what a basic list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose a house,</v>

1437
01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:32.220
<v Speaker 1>they lose money if you marry somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1438
01:05:32.221 --> 01:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>You go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be married no more.</v>

1439
01:05:33.841 --> 01:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Me Either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the mom who's keeping the house.</v>

1440
01:05:36.121 --> 01:05:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It's your fucking house by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1441
01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.510
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

1442
01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would get it.</v>

1443
01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:43.020
<v Speaker 1>It's when you lose something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1444
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:45.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or somebody cheated on you or whatever.</v>

1445
01:05:45.571 --> 01:05:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I had no money when I got divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even that alone.</v>

1446
01:05:49.231 --> 01:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1447
01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck you.</v>

1448
01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:52.920
<v Speaker 1>When I get to do comedy now the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1449
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.110
<v Speaker 1>But there was a kitten bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1450
01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.110
<v Speaker 1>And there's always fucking something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1451
01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.530
<v Speaker 1>that's when marriage sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also told myself that for years and it</v>

1452
01:06:01.531 --> 01:06:05.280
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the marriage that sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we don't put enough into the</v>

1453
01:06:05.281 --> 01:06:06.060
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1454
01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what marriage was when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>first got married.</v>

1455
01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my marriage is now,</v>

1456
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:13.470
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what marriage is now and that's</v>

1457
01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:16.260
<v Speaker 1>why it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you have to put time into when I</v>

1458
01:06:16.261 --> 01:06:17.850
<v Speaker 1>first got married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the laundry,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not mad.</v>

1461
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:26.400
<v Speaker 1>When you're 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's marriage,</v>

1462
01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's marriage.</v>

1463
01:06:28.231 --> 01:06:29.410
<v Speaker 1>That's where I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1464
01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll go out and work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think you had to pay attention</v>

1465
01:06:31.441 --> 01:06:34.710
<v Speaker 1>or go to a date night or fucking I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put time into them.</v>

1466
01:06:34.711 --> 01:06:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1467
01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I can't do a spot tonight because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to the movies with my wife.</v>

1468
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to put that time and if you</v>

1469
01:06:40.141 --> 01:06:41.070
<v Speaker 1>want it to fucking work,</v>

1470
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have an actual relationship.</v>

1471
01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.600
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

1472
01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:50.380
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find someone that you enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to,</v>

1473
01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they enjoy being with not just doing</v>

1474
01:06:53.231 --> 01:06:55.780
<v Speaker 2>stuff with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just sitting alone and talking.</v>

1475
01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.550
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

1476
01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.160
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find people that are on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same wavelength as you.</v>

1477
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find people that want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about the things you want to talk</v>

1478
01:07:03.101 --> 01:07:05.200
<v Speaker 2>about or want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1479
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:08.680
<v Speaker 2>want to see things from your perspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you want to see things through</v>

1480
01:07:08.681 --> 01:07:12.730
<v Speaker 2>their perspective that you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>these open kind of honest conversations.</v>

1481
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:17.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to find someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These poor people that we all know that</v>

1482
01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:19.840
<v Speaker 2>are unlike dating apps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1483
01:07:19.841 --> 01:07:23.020
<v Speaker 2>especially smart women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of smart women that cannot</v>

1484
01:07:23.021 --> 01:07:26.050
<v Speaker 2>find a fucking man to save their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you look at it,</v>

1485
01:07:26.051 --> 01:07:26.980
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

1486
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.860
<v Speaker 2>SMART,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ambitious,</v>

<v Speaker 2>powerful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot.</v>

1488
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Can't find a man too hard out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find somebody that you sync</v>

1489
01:07:38.351 --> 01:07:43.351
<v Speaker 2>with that you could talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's way easier for a dude to</v>

1490
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:47.920
<v Speaker 2>find a cool chick that is for a girl to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a guy who's got his shit together.</v>

1491
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm just guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's probably harder.</v>

1492
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I felt a lot of single women out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fucking good looking at jobs and</v>

1493
01:07:58.881 --> 01:08:00.500
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't.</v>

1494
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:03.560
<v Speaker 1>We also know him like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It runs two ways.</v>

1495
01:08:03.561 --> 01:08:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't get that close to them that we</v>

1496
01:08:06.621 --> 01:08:11.000
<v Speaker 1>didn't see what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncrasies works.</v>

1497
01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Even with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of women that look at</v>

1498
01:08:13.671 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>you and God love to be with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they get with this</v>

1499
01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.870
<v Speaker 2>guy flies out of town every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend.</v>

1500
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:18.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1501
01:08:18.871 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Like little things that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1502
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Am I coming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1503
01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:25.970
<v Speaker 2>He ever had guys that you're friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>with who like back up off the comedy</v>

1504
01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 2>because they got a new girlfriend and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new girlfriend's like,</v>

1505
01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:29.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you going out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1506
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you doing sets every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do them every night</v>

1507
01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:32.811
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do,</v>

1508
01:08:32.811 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 2>if I want to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's like,</v>

1509
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you know how like baseball players to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the field and practice?</v>

1510
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go on stage.</v>

1511
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.770
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think about it that way</v>

1512
01:08:42.771 --> 01:08:44.900
<v Speaker 2>because you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to understand it's the same</v>

1513
01:08:44.901 --> 01:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1514
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:47.150
<v Speaker 2>when I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stripper,</v>

1515
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:49.970
<v Speaker 2>the crazy bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't understand that.</v>

1516
01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.710
<v Speaker 2>She was awesome by the way.</v>

1517
01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.593
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

1518
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.680
<v Speaker 2>she was you and her together with one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite couples of all time.</v>

1519
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.060
<v Speaker 2>She still retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved a boyfriend,</v>

1520
01:08:59.061 --> 01:09:01.190
<v Speaker 2>a picture of her boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got cockeyed.</v>

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's a fucking nut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a fucking knows.</v>

1522
01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why I fell in love</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1523
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:07.240
<v Speaker 2>She's a millionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1524
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:09.310
<v Speaker 2>she's a fucking gazillionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1525
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.050
<v Speaker 2>these fucking dudes get all the money</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1526
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Sheet or at first when we broke up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went to Florida and she ended up</v>

1527
01:09:16.581 --> 01:09:19.280
<v Speaker 2>marrying this old Hindu guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1528
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Like he was 76.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lasted three months.</v>

1529
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:25.330
<v Speaker 2>He died when I was at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was I saying?</v>

1530
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Left her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His money.</v>

1531
01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.900
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She took the money and invested in Jim's</v>

1532
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:33.110
<v Speaker 2>curves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bought one,</v>

1533
01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 2>bought two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but four became like a fucking a mogul</v>

1534
01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 2>and then sold them all when they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>still hot.</v>

1535
01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went out of business.</v>

1536
01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Curves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went out of business.</v>

1537
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I think something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1538
01:09:45.171 --> 01:09:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not as popular as they were</v>

1539
01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:48.650
<v Speaker 2>anymore here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea was like,</v>

1540
01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:51.590
<v Speaker 2>don't work out that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can keep it curves.</v>

1541
01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Just come on in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1542
01:09:52.761 --> 01:09:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a place just for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's willing to ambitious just for</v>

1543
01:09:55.701 --> 01:09:57.320
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know it was just kidding.</v>

1544
01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:58.173
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1545
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:59.720
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is just a place for women,</v>

1546
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.100
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear like curves,</v>

1547
01:10:01.101 --> 01:10:04.880
<v Speaker 2>you think of it as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you say embrace your</v>

1548
01:10:04.881 --> 01:10:05.391
<v Speaker 2>curves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1549
01:10:05.391 --> 01:10:06.890
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1550
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.740
<v Speaker 2>What are you trying to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you really saying?</v>

1551
01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying embrace your curves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saying you know,</v>

1552
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:13.700

<v Speaker 2>What are you saying?</v>

1553
01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't bother getting fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying?</v>

1554
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.963
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're saying,</v>

1555
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:18.650
<v Speaker 2>you can't go there.</v>

1556
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:20.210
<v Speaker 2>You can't work out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1557
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.340
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can never have a men.</v>

1558
01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:27.341
<v Speaker 2>Only Jim know if you had a men only gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be empty.</v>

1559
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't.</v>

1560
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.430
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't even matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like women would protest appellee's</v>

1561
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:34.640
<v Speaker 2>fucking humps go to the gym to see girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

<v Speaker 2>most of them do,</v>

1563
01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:38.720
<v Speaker 2>so that's why it would be empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys go to the gym and</v>

1564
01:10:38.721 --> 01:10:40.860
<v Speaker 2>they don't even get motivated unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls working out there,</v>

1565
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.720
<v Speaker 2>don't look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at them.</v>

1566
01:10:43.721 --> 01:10:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout yoga pants.</v>

1567
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Very primal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you're like naked,</v>

1571
01:10:58.251 --> 01:11:02.990
<v Speaker 2>fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with my friend Cameron Hanes in</v>

1572
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're working out at this gym and there</v>

<v Speaker 2>I follow a couple of them on instagram</v>

1575

<v Speaker 2>and they do squats and fucking they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing like what a perfect example is</v>

1576
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>that guy carrying who is here carrying</v>
<v Speaker 2>fitsgibbons.</v>

1577
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:25.820
<v Speaker 2>His wife's name is Jack Jessica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a crossfit champion and she's just</v>

1578
01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ridiculously fit,</v>

1579
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:33.200
<v Speaker 2>but those kinds of like gym girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

1580
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 2>They scare the fuck out of you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

1581
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't say nothing to him.</v>

1582
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I just walked right past them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a girl,</v>

1583
01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 2>but why that doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That lists the whole fucking thing.</v>

1584
01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:46.070
<v Speaker 2>She's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's fucking brutal.</v>

1585
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Mean campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at her and Kim's like,</v>

1586
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to be built like her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had her build.</v>

1587
01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.950
<v Speaker 2>She was jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This lady was just doing squats and</v>

1588
01:11:55.951 --> 01:11:58.110
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking powder on her hands and shit.</v>

1589
01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Big Ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead lifts,</v>

1590
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 2>so women just embraced that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

1591
01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Now if they were told they can't go to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gym because it's an all male power</v>

1592
01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:11.474
<v Speaker 2>lifting gym,</v>

1593
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:16.760
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is like a girl goes to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gym and hits on guys.</v>

1594
01:12:16.761 --> 01:12:20.030
<v Speaker 2>It's really not that big of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if a guy goes to an all girl,</v>

1595
01:12:20.031 --> 01:12:22.400
<v Speaker 2>gems starts hitting on the girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a.</v>

1596
01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.280
<v Speaker 2>That becomes gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's becomes harassment.</v>

1597
01:12:25.281 --> 01:12:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Like he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't work out just a different</v>

1598
01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:30.950
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different feeling for them to hit</v>

1599
01:12:30.951 --> 01:12:35.930
<v Speaker 2>on us than it is for us to hit on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just know is not the same kind of</v>

1600
01:12:35.931 --> 01:12:37.130
<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1601
01:12:37.131 --> 01:12:40.070
<v Speaker 2>a guy hitting on a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain element of danger</v>

1602
01:12:40.071 --> 01:12:41.630
<v Speaker 2>involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1610
01:12:55.471 --> 01:13:00.471
<v Speaker 2>but like if you go to crunch those</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood gyms and all those,</v>

1611
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:04.950
<v Speaker 2>you see that the girls get ready an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they go to the gym,</v>

1612
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.160
<v Speaker 2>make up the hat with the tail coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1613
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:10.650
<v Speaker 2>They're color coordinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1614
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:13.920
<v Speaker 2>they go to those gyms to get picked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guys that go there,</v>

1615
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:16.650
<v Speaker 2>they go for action to when you go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>

1616
01:13:16.651 --> 01:13:20.050
<v Speaker 2>it's slows down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do a couple of women that go in</v>

1617
01:13:20.051 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gotta stab and I see him all the</v>

1618
01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:23.640
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go in there with the little towels</v>

1619
01:13:23.641 --> 01:13:27.150
<v Speaker 2>and the yoga pants and then mingling</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the trainers and shit,</v>

1620
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but then you go to other gyms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even happening.</v>

1621
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:34.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just certain gyms called for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also recognize what a person's got</v>

1622
01:13:37.261 --> 01:13:40.710
<v Speaker 2>going on physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see some girls in one of them,</v>

1623
01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.970
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got that,</v>

1624
01:13:41.971 --> 01:13:46.860
<v Speaker 2>but bob machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that one,</v>

1625
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:52.920
<v Speaker 2>like they're sending out pheromones and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and they're showing you their</v>

1626
01:13:52.921 --> 01:13:56.280
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know they got yoga pants on or</v>

1627
01:13:56.281 --> 01:13:58.170
<v Speaker 2>shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shorts are risky,</v>

1628
01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:00.510
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're doing them kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking maneuvers.</v>

1629
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:05.540
<v Speaker 2>There was any sort of opening there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things get pushed aside or come</v>

1630
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:09.270
<v Speaker 2>flying out of the bottom of there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be careful.</v>

1631
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a move,</v>

1632
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.840
<v Speaker 3>but you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing them exert.</v>

1633
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.620
<v Speaker 3>You've seen them work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seeing them show their vitality.</v>

1634
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:23.030
<v Speaker 3>You know on the lift in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always like some dude helping</v>

1635
01:14:23.821 --> 01:14:24.580

<v Speaker 3>one more,</v>

1637
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.000

<v Speaker 3>She's doing that for other guys too.</v>

1638
01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:35.200
<v Speaker 3>She's like putting out that sent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Accelerating the game.</v>

1639
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:39.850
<v Speaker 3>The whole competition just ramps up a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of notches while she's doing</v>

1640
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:42.670
<v Speaker 3>squats.</v>

1642
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:50.410
<v Speaker 3>clink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high five.</v>

1643
01:14:50.411 --> 01:14:53.770

01:14:55.180 --> 01:15:00.180
<v Speaker 3>See who's checking around hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a girl at the y when I first</v>

1645
01:15:00.671 --> 01:15:03.640
<v Speaker 3>started going on one in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish girl,</v>

1646
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:05.770
<v Speaker 3>torture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>torture.</v>

1647
01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:10.800
<v Speaker 3>She wouldn't shave her armpits flow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sweat would drip from her armpit.</v>

1648
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 3>And here's where it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would always wait gray sweatpants</v>

1649
01:15:14.261 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 3>and she wouldn't wear underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can see the sweat from a monkey</v>

1650
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 3>come right through the fucking.</v>

1651
01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:24.340
<v Speaker 3>So she walked up to see the fucking wet</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Egg right toes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't give a fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She was hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1654
01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm an old man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been talked to a black car and that</v>

1655
01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:37.240
<v Speaker 3>talking to the different guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she'd be benching and she opened up</v>

1656
01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:42.241
<v Speaker 3>her thighs and that little swamp just be</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking drenched with sweat.</v>

1657
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:46.710
<v Speaker 3>It was tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would look at it and shake my fuck.</v>

1658
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.810
<v Speaker 3>This girl's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what happened.</v>

1660
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Let's start with the Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday morning I had to be that</v>

1661
01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:56.410
<v Speaker 3>lunchtime and I'm driving and I see a</v>
<v Speaker 3>black dude that wade,</v>

1662
01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:01.680
<v Speaker 3>he was six feet with 120 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that skinny with Clint Eastwood hat on</v>

1663
01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:07.420
<v Speaker 3>from a fistful of dollars and the Poncho</v>
<v Speaker 3>from clothing and he was standing next</v>

1664
01:16:07.421 --> 01:16:10.090
<v Speaker 3>to a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat white dude with a beard like Jesus</v>

1665
01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 3>with sandals and the Jesus thing.</v>

1666
01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:13.380
<v Speaker 3>And I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog,</v>

1667
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:15.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>

1668
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.790
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking.</v>

1669
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 3>This is what I'm going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1670
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:20.050
<v Speaker 3>you see that at the comedy store almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday night,</v>

1671
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:21.880
<v Speaker 3>Sunday night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that one dude dresses like</v>

1672
01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:22.611
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1673
01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:25.360
<v Speaker 3>he no explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time he came by and he wasn't</v>

1674
01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:26.950
<v Speaker 3>dressed like Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was disappointed.</v>

1675
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:30.700
<v Speaker 3>I seen that guy 100 times at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>dressed like Jesus,</v>

1676
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.140
<v Speaker 3>and then one time I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't dressed like Jesus.</v>

1677
01:16:33.141 --> 01:16:34.630
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you doing here,</v>

1678
01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:37.270
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like once you commit to that outfit.</v>

1679
01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen him without the Jesus</v>

1680
01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 3>outfit once?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1681
01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:47.650
<v Speaker 3>He said he walks in Jesus to his head</v>
<v Speaker 3>down like that folder from the back.</v>

1682
01:16:47.651 --> 01:16:48.730
<v Speaker 3>And He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

1683
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean he found something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He found his niche.</v>

1684
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.690
<v Speaker 3>I guess they used to be at duty.</v>

1685
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 3>You remember the guy who used to walk up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and down the street with a cross on his</v>

1686
01:16:57.191 --> 01:16:59.830
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of people behind them.</v>

1687
01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:17:01.271 --> 01:17:05.560
<v Speaker 3>There was a dude who used to walk down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the street with a cross and sometimes</v>

1689
01:17:05.561 --> 01:17:08.380
<v Speaker 3>people would carry the cross and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes he would strap it on his back,</v>

1690
01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.100
<v Speaker 3>but he would walk down with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>disciples.</v>

1691
01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 3>They all had bibles and they would start</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yelling out different,</v>

1692
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different quotes from the Bible and they</v>

1693
01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1694
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 3>tell them to people in the front patio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is back before the front patio had</v>

1695
01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 3>a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember the front patio was basically</v>

1696
01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 3>wasted space until the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>administration came along and when did</v>

1697
01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:32.630
<v Speaker 3>they open up the bar at the front patio?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many years ago before I</v>

1698
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:36.130
<v Speaker 3>came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now it's a vibrant little foggy.</v>

1699
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.610
<v Speaker 3>It was always something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1700
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.593
<v Speaker 3>he had it.</v>

1701
01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Princess Corey had it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she opened the just so she could</v>

1702
01:17:41.721 --> 01:17:43.730
<v Speaker 3>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1703
01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean she used to open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was walking away.</v>

1704
01:17:46.281 --> 01:17:47.920
<v Speaker 3>People be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the bartender?</v>

1705
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:49.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was never really.</v>

1706
01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.420
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would sell like nine beers or</v>

1707
01:17:53.421 --> 01:17:55.060
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a fucking bar.</v>

1708
01:17:55.061 --> 01:17:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Like you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know they used to do shows.</v>

1709
01:17:57.051 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 3>There were on the back patio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a standup show there.</v>

1710
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:05.270
<v Speaker 3>They would set up a mic out there when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did it a couple of years ago</v>

1711
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:08.270
<v Speaker 3>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the neighbors complained before we</v>

1712
01:18:08.271 --> 01:18:09.200
<v Speaker 3>came back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1713
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:11.630
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have like an open mic night.</v>

1714
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.840
<v Speaker 3>They would have a spill out show where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have an open mic night out</v>

1715
01:18:14.841 --> 01:18:17.090

<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

1772
01:20:49.321 --> 01:20:51.620
<v Speaker 1>You know those bars that you all trickle</v>
<v Speaker 1>down a bug visa,</v>

1773
01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:54.960
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been going to the store for 20</v>

1774
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:57.880
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second time I got on state,</v>

1775
01:20:57.881 --> 01:21:00.570

<v Speaker 1>there's Mitzi shore seeing you yet.</v>

1776
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I was always destined for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it.</v>

1778
01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Like I just know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the more I got into comedy,</v>

1779
01:21:08.701 --> 01:21:11.080
<v Speaker 1>over the years people would say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Mitzi scene he had.</v>

1780
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.820

<v Speaker 1>But it's so weird.</v>

1781
01:21:14.821 --> 01:21:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I had been there for 20 fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1782
01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 1>We were talking the other day about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>she used to call you fat baby.</v>

1783
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.160
<v Speaker 1>That was your name on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fat baby.</v>

1784
01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1785
01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 1>finger in my stomach and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still let the era.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let me rub it.</v>

1789
01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:44.970
<v Speaker 1>And then she would put the pin in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty fucking years.</v>

1790
01:21:44.971 --> 01:21:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I went home the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had scratched my head a few times,</v>

1791
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:48.810
<v Speaker 1>like 20 years.</v>

1792
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this kind of a shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 25 fucking years.</v>

1793
01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:57.650
<v Speaker 1>First Time I got on stage that I fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'd be here 25 years later I think</v>

1794
01:21:57.901 --> 01:21:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I started don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think anything.</v>

1795
01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I just thought a finally I'm going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do something with my life.</v>

1796
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Like that's all I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just something with my life,</v>

1797
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to my buddy because ever since I</v>

1798
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:10.620
<v Speaker 1>shot the special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been thinking about 90,</v>

1799
01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.110
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>93 a lot.</v>

1800
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Like how well I was 1993.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was living in New York City.</v>

1801
01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Why 90?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three specific.</v>

1802
01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:22.800
<v Speaker 1>That's when I made my transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I did comedy for two years.</v>

1803
01:22:22.801 --> 01:22:26.280
<v Speaker 1>The way I went to Jujitsu for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very erratic.</v>

1804
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I would go twice one week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one week I wouldn't go.</v>

1805
01:22:29.371 --> 01:22:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Then I go three times one week and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go for two weeks.</v>

1806
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:36.270
<v Speaker 1>It was very erratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to really get my hands</v>

1807
01:22:36.271 --> 01:22:39.600
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in 1993 I went to the city.</v>

1808
01:22:39.601 --> 01:22:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was broken from the divorce at nothing</v>

1809
01:22:42.961 --> 01:22:43.980
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was broke.</v>

1810
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I went home and lived with a friend of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine and just went around the city and</v>

1811
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:52.080
<v Speaker 1>did calm me and I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no comprehension and what I was</v>

1812
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:54.200
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one night I walked into your</v>

1813
01:22:54.201 --> 01:22:58.320
<v Speaker 1>old triple in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to be like an open mic that started</v>

1814
01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:03.321
<v Speaker 1>at 11 and went till two or 3:00 and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went in there one night about.</v>

1815
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I just finished driving a limo and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped the guy off in Manhattan and I</v>

1816
01:23:08.981 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me go get a spot over that,</v>

1817
01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.680
<v Speaker 1>and I went over there and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no spots tonight because</v>

1818
01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Leguizamo is on stage and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

1819
01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.210
<v Speaker 1>One of those one man shows this place</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a fucking dive.</v>

1820
01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Like every time I'd walk in there I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about my comedy career.</v>

1821
01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I got to figure something out because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to keep doing this</v>

1822
01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.280
<v Speaker 1>display.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smelled like cigarette smoke.</v>

1823
01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 1>There were seven people in New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1824
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.830
<v Speaker 1>When you first started do Konami you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the lights and</v>

1825
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.360
<v Speaker 1>the CBS to be there and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBS Ain't going to be here.</v>

1826
01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Why do I keep coming back here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally one night I went there,</v>

1827
01:23:42.491 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I saw like it was dominant one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I go,</v>

1828
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1829
01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was too special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to do that,</v>

01:23:49.781 --> 01:23:50.614

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1836
01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:06.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A leg was almost onstage.</v>

1837
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a dive and it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1838
01:24:10.331 --> 01:24:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anything about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had read the Judy Carter Book.</v>

1839
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I had read a couple books by that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking writer that when that real</v>

1840
01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:19.840
<v Speaker 1>solutia ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three Belzer's book,</v>

1841
01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:23.440
<v Speaker 1>who Richard Belzer know wrote a book on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up comedy.</v>

1842
01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I read the book by Lenny Bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

1843
01:24:27.911 --> 01:24:31.480
<v Speaker 1>We live at the Chelsea hotel and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking did heroin at night with jazz</v>

1844
01:24:31.481 --> 01:24:32.460
<v Speaker 1>musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1845
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:34.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put me over the top,</v>

1846
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.790
<v Speaker 1>but I taught standing up or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you became.</v>

1847
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you had to work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm trying to say to you.</v>

1848
01:24:39.431 --> 01:24:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought that when people went up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage shoot a special like Joe Rogan</v>

1849
01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1850
01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Tell Him we got cameras really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

1851
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:47.220
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell him to go on state.</v>

1852
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought when you shot a special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just went up and talked for 30</v>

1853
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:52.150
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know there was any preparation.</v>

1854
01:24:52.151 --> 01:24:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really have</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to go by.</v>

1855
01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:58.540
<v Speaker 1>I went in there and I understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process now.</v>

1856
01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I think three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even like a month later I was back</v>

1857
01:25:01.481 --> 01:25:05.140
<v Speaker 1>in Colorado and I was determined to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage every night.</v>

1858
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.080
<v Speaker 1>This was what I was going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm going for,</v>

1859
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:09.670
<v Speaker 1>this is how I'm going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1860
01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.090
<v Speaker 1>these are the clubs I'm going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no,</v>

1861
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.780
<v Speaker 1>no idea what the fuck was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just go on stage loosely.</v>

1862
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I would write whatever I could and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on stage loosely.</v>

1863
01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that you build from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know these things,</v>

1864
01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:27.010
<v Speaker 1>so I keep thinking about 93.</v>

1865
01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I lived in a fucking room with my buddy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did heroin.</v>

1866
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I had one white shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would sell cars on 11th avenue down</v>

1867
01:25:34.981 --> 01:25:35.410
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1868
01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:38.740
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one white shirt and I would wear</v>

1869
01:25:38.741 --> 01:25:41.410
<v Speaker 1>the same shirt everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to come home,</v>

1870
01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.680
<v Speaker 1>jump in the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would wash my shirt in the shower</v>

1871
01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.070
<v Speaker 1>and I would hang it up and then I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron it every fucking day.</v>

1872
01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:50.860
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just a struggling open Miker,</v>

1873
01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was driving a limo some days,</v>

1874
01:25:53.170 --> 01:25:56.800
<v Speaker 1>some days I would sell cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some days I would pass out packages for</v>

1875
01:25:56.801 --> 01:26:01.150
<v Speaker 1>att and t and get $400 a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just putting it together,</v>

1876
01:26:01.151 --> 01:26:01.990
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1877
01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed</v>

1878
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.630
<v Speaker 3>so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just,</v>

1879
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.800
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no illusions of grandeur bro.</v>

1880
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.510
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to do something with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1881
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going to be Kevin Hart or</v>

1882
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:17.180
<v Speaker 3>fucking bill cosby and nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to do something,</v>

1883
01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is why I keep thinking about how</v>

1884
01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:23.390
<v Speaker 3>fucking Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years later I shot a special and</v>

1885
01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:26.120
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just goes back to what you did.</v>

1886
01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had one,</v>

1887
01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:29.570
<v Speaker 3>I would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have to be at work till 10</v>

1888
01:26:29.571 --> 01:26:32.810
<v Speaker 3>some days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would take the 6:00 AM bus because</v>

1889
01:26:32.811 --> 01:26:35.450
<v Speaker 3>if I take the 6:00 AM bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend with the steroids,</v>

1890
01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:38.510
<v Speaker 3>his father was a bus driver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He let me right to the city for free.</v>

1891
01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:42.950
<v Speaker 3>So I would take the 6:00 AM bus so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>could save those $3.</v>

1892
01:26:42.951 --> 01:26:47.540
<v Speaker 3>That's how fucking poor I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to get home I would fucking go</v>

1893
01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:52.250
<v Speaker 3>into service when I would sell cars and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go into the service at 9:00 and I</v>

1894
01:26:52.251 --> 01:26:54.690
<v Speaker 3>would still change when people's cards</v>
<v Speaker 3>until I got home.</v>

1895
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:58.820
<v Speaker 3>I would bring just enough money for</v>
<v Speaker 3>lunch between rent,</v>

1896
01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:03.560
<v Speaker 3>child support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>close reefer cocaine and fucking.</v>

1897
01:27:03.630 --> 01:27:07.190
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't even doing a lot of coke then</v>
<v Speaker 3>if my buddies and I will have to do it</v>

1898
01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:09.740
<v Speaker 3>because I was just trying to do comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1899
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:12.350
<v Speaker 3>And you think about the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you really went through,</v>

1900
01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.900
<v Speaker 3>how you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you delivered papers,</v>

1901
01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:19.340
<v Speaker 3>write papers or whatever and to see you</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1902
01:27:19.341 --> 01:27:21.410
<v Speaker 3>It's such a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I never saw this.</v>

1903
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I never saw the tail end of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to do something.</v>

1904
01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:30.680
<v Speaker 3>When you see someone that's already</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing comedy clubs and headlining places</v>

1906
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:33.650
<v Speaker 3>and you're just starting now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem that far away.</v>

1907
01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:34.701
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1908
01:27:34.701 --> 01:27:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I need to do is just get an act together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can do what he's doing.</v>

1909
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 3>How come I can't do it and you think you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can and then it takes years.</v>

1910
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody tried to tell me once that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took 10 years for you to become a</v>

1911
01:27:44.871 --> 01:27:48.590
<v Speaker 3>real headline or my dad's crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>headliner in two years,</v>

1912
01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:50.300
<v Speaker 3>get out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it really does.</v>

1913
01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.280
<v Speaker 3>It really does because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1914
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Something happens 10 years in or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're smarter than me.</v>

1915
01:27:56.901 --> 01:28:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it'll only take you a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for me it was like 10 years and I</v>

1916
01:28:00.171 --> 01:28:02.220
<v Speaker 3>get a better understanding what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing.</v>

1917
01:28:02.221 --> 01:28:02.631
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1918
01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I kinda get it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of get it now,</v>

1919
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:08.360
<v Speaker 3>but you still don't see it the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would see it if it wasn't you.</v>

1920
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:13.590
<v Speaker 3>If you know as much as you know about</v>
<v Speaker 3>standup and you could watch yourself not</v>

1921
01:28:13.671 --> 01:28:16.370
<v Speaker 3>be you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would be able to fix a lot of things</v>

1922
01:28:16.371 --> 01:28:19.310
<v Speaker 3>with your act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of the things with your act</v>

1923
01:28:19.311 --> 01:28:23.870
<v Speaker 3>like you kind of shield yourself because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just trying to get it to work.</v>

1924
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to put it together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1925
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.910
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of times you're not even aware</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1926
01:28:28.911 --> 01:28:30.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the joke is coming off to other</v>

1927
01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:34.340
<v Speaker 3>people because you're doing it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're too caught up in the idea of</v>

1928
01:28:34.341 --> 01:28:37.400
<v Speaker 3>delivering it to understand what it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to receive it.</v>

1929
01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:40.880
<v Speaker 3>And that takes a long fucking time to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure it out.</v>

1930
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:43.070
<v Speaker 3>And still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fuck it up to those day,</v>

1931
01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:47.480
<v Speaker 3>especially when I'm working on new bits</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you got to take these weird</v>

1932
01:28:47.481 --> 01:28:51.550
<v Speaker 3>chances with new bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to like start premises maybe</v>

1933
01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.210
<v Speaker 3>that you don't know where they're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let,</v>

1934
01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.570
<v Speaker 3>let it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let it under pressure of stage sometimes</v>

1935
01:28:56.571 --> 01:28:57.570
<v Speaker 3>come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1936
01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're working out at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the store trying to come up with new</v>

1937
01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:03.180
<v Speaker 3>stuff under the pressure of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage.</v>

1938
01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:07.620
<v Speaker 3>You can sort of like every now and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop an idea through every now and then a</v>

1939
01:29:07.621 --> 01:29:11.070
<v Speaker 3>new tagline comes through that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh and a new moment comes through.</v>

1940
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:14.040
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't invest in those moments</v>
<v Speaker 3>of doing those,</v>

1941
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:16.530
<v Speaker 3>those bits on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never fucking know.</v>

1942
01:29:16.531 --> 01:29:20.010
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't take those chances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just keep doing the same shit</v>

1943
01:29:20.011 --> 01:29:21.660
<v Speaker 3>over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't take those chances,</v>

1944
01:29:21.661 --> 01:29:23.490
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know whether or not you could</v>

1945
01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:26.670
<v Speaker 3>go down those roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead and become a headline until 18</v>

1946
01:29:26.671 --> 01:29:28.860
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when I felt comfortable.</v>

1947
01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Headline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1948

<v Speaker 3>45 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1950
01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:37.530

<v Speaker 3>The big difference in being a fucking</v>

1951
01:29:37.531 --> 01:29:38.910

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the card.</v>

<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

<v Speaker 3>been in there with some big fucking</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's been then championship fights when</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lights matter and shit like that.</v>

1961
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:08.940
<v Speaker 3>That's called experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That experience is so fucking crucial.</v>

1962
01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 3>That experience is so crucial at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

1963
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:16.590
<v Speaker 3>I am very proud to be a store comic</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of all those years of doing</v>

1964
01:30:16.591 --> 01:30:18.620
<v Speaker 3>those weights bites.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I get myself out of it and he situation.</v>

1966
01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:24.780
<v Speaker 3>When you're a plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

1967
01:30:24.781 --> 01:30:26.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're a Roofer,</v>

<v Speaker 3>your job is the same.</v>

1969
01:30:28.681 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna fucking roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you're paying me 25 instead of 15 is</v>

1970
01:30:33.631 --> 01:30:35.840
<v Speaker 3>because I know how to get around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

1971
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.360
<v Speaker 3>When you come to me and go boss the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking pipe there.</v>

1972
01:30:39.361 --> 01:30:42.030
<v Speaker 3>I got a flashlight and stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a piece of cake.</v>

1973
01:30:42.031 --> 01:30:45.560
<v Speaker 3>I just build a box around you follow me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with comedy.</v>

1974
01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I could do an hour,</v>

1975
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.420
<v Speaker 3>but I always felt like that pennzoil</v>
<v Speaker 3>commercial.</v>

1976
01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:54.420
<v Speaker 3>You could either pay me now or you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay me later.</v>

1977
01:30:54.421 --> 01:30:56.400
<v Speaker 3>I love those motherfuckers to come out</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and go,</v>

1978
01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:57.653
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I been,</v>

1979
01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:01.200
<v Speaker 3>I was a headline at four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a regular at the store.</v>

1980
01:31:01.201 --> 01:31:03.570
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get it at the store one</v>

1981
01:31:03.571 --> 01:31:05.670
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get it,</v>

1982
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.370
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have to follow somebody</v>

1983
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.360
<v Speaker 3>who they're not ready for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not because they've only been</v>

1984
01:31:12.361 --> 01:31:15.180
<v Speaker 3>doing comedy six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to hurt them a little more</v>

1985
01:31:15.181 --> 01:31:16.750
<v Speaker 3>than it would hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you talk.</v>

1986
01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:19.840
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a 50 slash 50 shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>

1987
01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I write jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prepare them.</v>

1988
01:31:21.291 --> 01:31:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm going to go up there and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best I can,</v>

1989
01:31:24.031 --> 01:31:28.950
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes that don't pay that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes there's a girl in there before</v>

1990
01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:31.380
<v Speaker 3>you attended a great night every other</v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

1991
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:36.150
<v Speaker 3>She's bombed tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She blows up that place and you got to</v>

1992
01:31:36.151 --> 01:31:39.210
<v Speaker 3>go up there and figure a way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an experience.</v>

1993
01:31:39.211 --> 01:31:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Fucks you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when I could.</v>

1994
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:43.710
<v Speaker 3>You could blow up that room and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you what,</v>

1995
01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:46.730
<v Speaker 3>I may not be able to follow you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll get a few labs with.</v>

1996
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Ten years ago I wasn't getting anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was caught up in the lights</v>

1997
01:31:51.481 --> 01:31:53.280
<v Speaker 3>and let's keep it going for joe or more</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1998
01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:58.320
<v Speaker 3>It's really funny and not use that word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you go up there and just run with</v>

1999
01:31:58.321 --> 01:32:00.850
<v Speaker 3>that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's experience in my world.</v>

2000
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:03.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't make any big decisions so I got</v>

2001
01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:06.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could feel the difference on state</v>

2002
01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.080
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty five years.</v>

2003
01:32:08.081 --> 01:32:09.760
<v Speaker 3>You could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You John Jacques Machado.</v>

2004
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.800
<v Speaker 3>You Ever See John Jack Rowe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks to you.</v>

2005
01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.610
<v Speaker 3>He talks to Joe and rolls with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

2006
01:32:15.810 --> 01:32:16.643
<v Speaker 3>not silly phone.</v>

2007
01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.673
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2008
01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:21.430
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even know because he's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it for 20 years and I just saw a</v>

2009
01:32:21.431 --> 01:32:23.730
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy did that.</v>

2010
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Marcello Garcia died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then a seminar and he was for years.</v>

2011
01:32:28.301 --> 01:32:30.700
<v Speaker 3>I just put myself in the half guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2012
01:32:30.701 --> 01:32:32.650
<v Speaker 3>I could feel anything you got to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2013
01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:35.140
<v Speaker 3>even when you're going to pop that leg</v>
<v Speaker 3>over to get away.</v>

2014
01:32:35.141 --> 01:32:37.540
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just catch you with this leg and</v>

2015
01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:38.650
<v Speaker 3>put you now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got your neck.</v>

2016
01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2017
01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:40.661
<v Speaker 3>how'd you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2018
01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:43.810
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put myself in half guard every fucking</v>

2019
01:32:43.811 --> 01:32:46.900
<v Speaker 3>day for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what reaction you're</v>

2020
01:32:46.901 --> 01:32:49.750
<v Speaker 3>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called experience when you got.</v>

2021
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I never had the hard times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have had at the comedy store,</v>

2022
01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:59.140
<v Speaker 3>when you're dying at a club and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>feature headliner Mc club,</v>

2023
01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:02.230
<v Speaker 3>you have momentum to pick yourself back</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2024
01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.950
<v Speaker 3>So if I go over there and pick up die</v>
<v Speaker 3>for 10 minutes,</v>

2025
01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I could get onto something and gradually</v>
<v Speaker 3>work them back at the store.</v>

2026
01:33:10.121 --> 01:33:13.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't have that grace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have 15 fucking minutes and once you</v>

2027
01:33:13.631 --> 01:33:16.840
<v Speaker 3>die at the store for seven minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the fucking Roman colosseum.</v>

2028
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:19.930
<v Speaker 3>You run them with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That ain't no getting back into the</v>

2029
01:33:19.931 --> 01:33:22.540
<v Speaker 3>store to store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a medium set up the</v>

2030
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:25.270
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I either do great or I fucking die.</v>

2031
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:29.900
<v Speaker 3>I die most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you know what I'm saying here,</v>

2032
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:31.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no coming back.</v>

2033
01:33:31.841 --> 01:33:34.540
<v Speaker 3>You don't have 20 minutes of work itself</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the situation.</v>

2034
01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:36.340
<v Speaker 3>They also know there's a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming.</v>

2035
01:33:36.341 --> 01:33:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Next comes next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's next?</v>

2036
01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Who's next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

2037
01:33:39.521 --> 01:33:40.580
<v Speaker 3>We got to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2038
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:45.310
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you'll see someone that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just there just on a normal night.</v>

2039
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Maybe their ideas would work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but tonight it's not going to work</v>

2040
01:33:48.821 --> 01:33:51.850
<v Speaker 3>because it's just been too many</v>
<v Speaker 3>different people on before them.</v>

2041
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:54.430
<v Speaker 3>And then it's just I've seen too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2042
01:33:54.431 --> 01:33:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Then that's one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>those late night spots are so important.</v>

2043
01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.330
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that exists in music too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if in music it helps the</v>

2044
01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:04.420
<v Speaker 3>performers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they get occasionally a real small</v>

2045
01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:07.000
<v Speaker 3>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to sing for a crowd of 15,</v>

2046
01:34:07.001 --> 01:34:08.410
<v Speaker 3>20 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2047
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that lets you get in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>own head better,</v>

2048
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:14.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can point on lives,</v>

2049
01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 3>especially those first six years of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store,</v>

2050
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.680
<v Speaker 3>1245,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to assume there's going to be</v>

2051
01:34:20.681 --> 01:34:23.200
<v Speaker 3>17 people in the audience if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky,</v>

2052
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.010
<v Speaker 3>if you're lucky and you have to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that they haven't heard.</v>

2053
01:34:27.011 --> 01:34:29.140
<v Speaker 3>If they sat there all fucking night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've heard everything.</v>

2054
01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:33.730
<v Speaker 3>They've heard everything topical and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would force you to go out of your realm.</v>

2055
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:35.530
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when we shot,</v>

2056
01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.720
<v Speaker 3>we were telling them about specials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting specials.</v>

2057
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:42.430
<v Speaker 3>When I shot the first show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I died because I was too worried about</v>

2058
01:34:42.431 --> 01:34:45.040
<v Speaker 3>my material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really bought into Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

2059
01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Then I remembered what the fuck I am the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second show,</v>

2060
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.310
<v Speaker 3>and you just now you get it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2061
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:54.040
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different focuses is 25</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2062
01:34:54.041 --> 01:34:56.490
<v Speaker 3>You shoot a special and you still</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking up come.</v>

2063
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dog.</v>

2064
01:34:58.011 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 3>This is why I love this because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned something new every fucking day.</v>

2065
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:02.150
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2066
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.390
<v Speaker 3>as long as you have new subjects to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2067
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to have new bits.</v>

2068
01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:11.900
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to have work to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to be done.</v>

2069
01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.610
<v Speaker 3>They're not done right away.</v>

2070
01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.950
<v Speaker 3>You got to go over them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to listen to recordings.</v>

2071
01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.530
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2072
01:35:18.531 --> 01:35:20.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird in that like if you go to see</v>

2073
01:35:20.901 --> 01:35:23.150
<v Speaker 3>the rolling stones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to hear it brown sugar,</v>

2074
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.190
<v Speaker 3>you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to hear a sympathy for the</v>

2075
01:35:25.191 --> 01:35:26.840
<v Speaker 3>devil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I go to see you,</v>

2076
01:35:26.841 --> 01:35:28.580
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear some new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2077
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:30.470
<v Speaker 3>It's just the way it is for our</v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

2078
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:35.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's also so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2079
01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a fun fucking thing to do.</v>

2080
01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:38.973
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two.</v>

2081
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:43.670
<v Speaker 3>There's two trains of thought to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are really interesting because I</v>

2082
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:47.120
<v Speaker 3>did something this year that I knew I</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't pull off like there's no way,</v>

2083
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:50.090
<v Speaker 3>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could only shoot a special every 18</v>

2084
01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:52.030
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My next special is no.</v>

2085
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Once I looked at the product and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>special,</v>

2086
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I knew that those jokes could have still</v>
<v Speaker 3>had six more months of work and you</v>

2087
01:35:59.841 --> 01:36:00.380
<v Speaker 3>follow me.</v>

2088
01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to.</v>

2089
01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I closed it,</v>

2090
01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.980
<v Speaker 3>but I've been doing it now for two years</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because people say,</v>

2091
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I came to seeing you and do that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>job and I've noticed how good that joke</v>

2092
01:36:10.971 --> 01:36:14.210
<v Speaker 3>is become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every two weeks I had a tag for that</v>

2093
01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:16.760
<v Speaker 3>joke even though it's still fucking old</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I do it.</v>

2094
01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly what Tom Papa said on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday.</v>

2095
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:22.220
<v Speaker 3>Exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It bothers me to no end.</v>

2096
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:25.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put a CD out a couple years ago and I</v>

2097
01:36:25.341 --> 01:36:28.220
<v Speaker 3>liked the bit I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that bit was not finished.</v>

2098
01:36:28.221 --> 01:36:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2099
01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.460
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2100
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:32.960
<v Speaker 3>It's ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck no.</v>

2101
01:36:32.961 --> 01:36:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I've added 10 minutes for that bit in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last fucking year,</v>

2102
01:36:35.601 --> 01:36:38.390
<v Speaker 3>just because I liked it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something in there.</v>

2103
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck did I do?</v>

2104
01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:40.790
<v Speaker 3>I just let it go.</v>

2105
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.190
<v Speaker 3>So as a trainer thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't know this.</v>

2106
01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Listen me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I come to see you every year,</v>

2107
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I want you to have 30 minutes of</v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

2108
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Something had to happen in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 3>What you're telling me is you can make</v>
<v Speaker 3>that joke better.</v>

2110
01:36:52.041 --> 01:36:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Run it by me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what else you added.</v>

2111
01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what else you added to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2112
01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.940
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I'm going to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do now.</v>

2113
01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Those jokes that I had from the special</v>
<v Speaker 3>guests,</v>

2114
01:37:01.491 --> 01:37:04.760
<v Speaker 3>what I'll put them away now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll bring them back in a year and</v>

2115
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 3>how at different tags and even if every</v>
<v Speaker 3>time you do a long set,</v>

2116
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:11.270
<v Speaker 3>just bring one bit back down to six and</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

2117
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:12.920
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to strengthen.</v>

2118
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one day you're going to be able to</v>

2119
01:37:15.081 --> 01:37:16.550
<v Speaker 3>do three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2120
01:37:16.570 --> 01:37:20.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying it's nice those bits</v>

2121
01:37:20.331 --> 01:37:21.164
<v Speaker 3>and never done.</v>

2122
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:23.740
<v Speaker 3>That's a mistake I made on the first two</v>
<v Speaker 3>albums,</v>

2123
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:25.700
<v Speaker 3>those bits and never done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're done sometimes.</v>

2124
01:37:25.701 --> 01:37:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you get to them when you're</v>

2125
01:37:27.231 --> 01:37:28.490
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to do this anymore.</v>

2126
01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.413
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

2127
01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.620
<v Speaker 3>When you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>

2128
01:37:30.650 --> 01:37:33.110
<v Speaker 3>That's why I didn't call for responses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that I'm building.</v>

2129
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.680
<v Speaker 3>I went to Portland last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

2130
01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:38.350
<v Speaker 3>He just started to take some time off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to recharge.</v>

2131
01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Recharge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2132
01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to do come on thing.</v>

2133
01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:46.070
<v Speaker 3>You need to get a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes when you do too much county in</v>

2134
01:37:46.071 --> 01:37:48.410
<v Speaker 3>a row,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to stuff.</v>

2135
01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:51.340
<v Speaker 3>I want to deprogram myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2136
01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.340
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to keep saying I'm coming</v>

2137
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:55.530
<v Speaker 3>on the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to keep.</v>

2138
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:57.480
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to keep doing the jute</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2139
01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.350
<v Speaker 3>So I stopped deprogram yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to break those bad habits to</v>

2140
01:38:01.351 --> 01:38:02.070
<v Speaker 3>break that habit.</v>

2141
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:04.350
<v Speaker 3>The only way to break that habit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to forget about it.</v>

2142
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least when it comes to comedy,</v>

2143
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:08.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to forget about it and I won't do</v>

2144
01:38:08.491 --> 01:38:11.640
<v Speaker 3>it no more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of promotion that shit.</v>

2145
01:38:11.641 --> 01:38:14.160
<v Speaker 3>This week I podcast you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a ton of shit.</v>

2146
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.770
<v Speaker 3>It's Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to take it to the zoo at night for</v>

2147
01:38:16.771 --> 01:38:20.730
<v Speaker 3>the fucking lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I said this is a great week to do it,</v>

2148
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.290
<v Speaker 3>but I've learned a lot man from shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>this that no specials ever done.</v>

2149
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:28.470
<v Speaker 3>That's why we want to hear if you go see</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stones,</v>

2150
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:32.040
<v Speaker 3>you might be disappointed sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes the stones to play a</v>

2151
01:38:32.041 --> 01:38:34.950
<v Speaker 3>song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sound like what you're used</v>

2152
01:38:34.951 --> 01:38:38.160
<v Speaker 3>to listening to it because over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>years they added this fucking whole</v>

2153
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:42.570
<v Speaker 3>thing on the road to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you'll never hear because you</v>

2154
01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:43.520
<v Speaker 3>didn't go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2155
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely get hear that.</v>

2156
01:38:44.671 --> 01:38:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes when people do live versions</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>

2157
01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:49.500
<v Speaker 3>they put a whole new twist to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that band,</v>

2158
01:38:49.501 --> 01:38:50.334
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>

2159
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.250
<v Speaker 3>they do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll do a song and it's like it's a</v>

2160
01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:55.830
<v Speaker 3>different version of a song that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard on their CD.</v>

2161
01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:01.470

01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Every year around July.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dance around stage.</v>

2391
01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

2392
01:50:06.710 --> 01:50:09.010
<v Speaker 2>But he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's good friends with him so he's not</v>

2393
01:50:09.011 --> 01:50:12.370
<v Speaker 2>the best place to do stand up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make people stand in the back.</v>

2394
01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:14.290
<v Speaker 2>You know that people get seated in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>front,</v>

2395
01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:17.220
<v Speaker 2>they stay in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will show up tall people that have for</v>

2396
01:50:17.221 --> 01:50:18.054
<v Speaker 2>you last time.</v>

2397
01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:22.440
<v Speaker 2>But that was the problem was it already</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened November 18th.</v>

2398
01:50:22.570 --> 01:50:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a.</v>

2399
01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of people there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had a deal with them.</v>

2400
01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only want to sell tickets to the</v>

2401
01:50:29.771 --> 01:50:31.240
<v Speaker 2>people that get to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2402
01:50:31.241 --> 01:50:33.580
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you run out of seed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tickets,</v>

2403
01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I go stop selling tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy kept filling the place like,</v>

2404
01:50:37.331 --> 01:50:37.781
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

2405
01:50:37.781 --> 01:50:38.051
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2406
01:50:38.051 --> 01:50:39.190
<v Speaker 2>people are still buying tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2407
01:50:39.191 --> 01:50:41.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll stop selling them like you have</v>

2408
01:50:41.111 --> 01:50:43.210
<v Speaker 2>a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the contract is you're not supposed</v>

2409
01:50:43.211 --> 01:50:47.140
<v Speaker 2>to have people standing up like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get less money so that people</v>

2410
01:50:47.141 --> 01:50:49.840
<v Speaker 2>could have a seat like because it'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>better and better.</v>

2411
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:51.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot better and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2412
01:50:51.221 --> 01:50:52.600
<v Speaker 2>but we're still selling tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like alright,</v>

2413
01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:54.820
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

2414
01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Like you know what the contract is dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just decided to smoosh</v>

2415
01:50:58.301 --> 01:51:01.270
<v Speaker 2>everybody in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not as fun to stand around and</v>

2416
01:51:01.271 --> 01:51:02.620
<v Speaker 2>watch comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really didn't.</v>

2417
01:51:02.621 --> 01:51:05.710
<v Speaker 2>When I went to see doug once doug was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a lot of those bar shows,</v>

2418
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:10.270
<v Speaker 2>standing room shows and then went there</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as I love Doug and it was like</v>

2419
01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:13.840
<v Speaker 2>concrete someplace in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were standing there in my fucking</v>

2420
01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:16.600
<v Speaker 2>your legs start hurting like this is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

2421
01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to just stay in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to sit down.</v>

2422
01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't enjoy it as much if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not sitting down when you start</v>

2423
01:51:22.781 --> 01:51:24.100
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2424
01:51:24.101 --> 01:51:27.550
<v Speaker 2>and the conscious just goes away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standing by the 40 minute mark.</v>

2425
01:51:27.551 --> 01:51:29.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like a light talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2426
01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:32.770
<v Speaker 2>In the room and you can't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be throwing heat,</v>

2427
01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:37.390
<v Speaker 2>but a couple of weeks ago at this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got there and they had 200 people</v>

2428
01:51:37.391 --> 01:51:39.670
<v Speaker 2>standing up to argue with the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

2429
01:51:39.670 --> 01:51:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Now I was nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even think about it and I could</v>

2430
01:51:42.431 --> 01:51:45.820
<v Speaker 2>feel him onstage and you can work</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a little bit,</v>

2431
01:51:45.821 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 2>but you feel at this stabbing man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when we used to do the House</v>

2432
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:50.283
<v Speaker 2>of Blues in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2433
01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:54.670
<v Speaker 2>That whole back area was still with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people standing and talking and the two</v>

2434
01:51:54.671 --> 01:51:56.830
<v Speaker 2>bars bars to the left and a bar to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2435
01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

2436
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Just not a good place to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stand up.</v>

2437
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:06.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

2438
01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

2439
01:52:08.210 --> 01:52:10.300
<v Speaker 2>selling tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put them in the bathroom they want</v>

2440
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:12.130
<v Speaker 2>to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2441
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a lot of those music shows</v>

2442
01:52:15.071 --> 01:52:15.910
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to stand.</v>

2443
01:52:15.911 --> 01:52:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be used later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2444
01:52:17.021 --> 01:52:21.780
<v Speaker 2>no wonder I got people throwing punches</v>
<v Speaker 2>and aerosmith one time because the</v>

2445
01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:23.290
<v Speaker 2>fucking stand that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:52:23.291 --> 01:52:26.740
<v Speaker 2>You get tired of it after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I always dance around.</v>

2447
01:52:26.741 --> 01:52:29.950
<v Speaker 2>You'll be okay now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At music shows you sit down and then you</v>

2448
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:31.880
<v Speaker 2>stand up to you on your feet the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2449
01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to those things,</v>

2450
01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:39.160
<v Speaker 2>those music shows or just an excuse for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to get fucking hammered.</v>

2451
01:52:39.370 --> 01:52:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Go see a bunch of bands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wander around the desert or wherever the</v>

<v Speaker 3>Then</v>

2459

2465
01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's gotta be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2466
01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.800
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to see a bunch of different</v>

2467
01:53:12.801 --> 01:53:14.630
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're outside of the few days.</v>

2468

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2469
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:20.090

<v Speaker 3>to those standup ones,</v>

2470
01:53:20.091 --> 01:53:22.070

<v Speaker 3>Do you do those?</v>

2471
01:53:22.190 --> 01:53:24.170
<v Speaker 3>I just did what you did with the Houston</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think two or three years.</v>

2475
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Houston used to be a hub.</v>

2476
01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:37.610
<v Speaker 3>He used to be a hub.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody could figure out how to open up</v>

2477
01:53:37.611 --> 01:53:40.370
<v Speaker 3>that old laptop and river oaks and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>still there.</v>

2478
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:43.540
<v Speaker 3>It's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane at this.</v>

2479
01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:45.200

<v Speaker 3>That helium guy,</v>

2482
01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:51.440

<v Speaker 3>That was the one of the best rooms ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nothing's there now?</v>

2484
01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:58.370

01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2618
01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Twenty days in a row and snow is bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2619
01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:45.550
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of leaving for work on a bus.</v>

2620
01:59:45.610 --> 01:59:47.170
<v Speaker 3>It's snowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting out.</v>

2621
01:59:47.171 --> 01:59:48.370
<v Speaker 3>It's six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's snowing.</v>

2622
01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Going home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's snowing.</v>

2623
01:59:50.111 --> 01:59:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Going to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wake up.</v>

2624
01:59:51.251 --> 01:59:53.830
<v Speaker 3>It's still snowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two days is cool.</v>

2625
01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Twenty days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 days.</v>

2626
01:59:57.670 --> 01:59:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Snowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shovelling every.</v>

2627
01:59:59.210 --> 02:00:02.190
<v Speaker 3>I was shoveling the snow too for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'd have to get up and down.</v>

2628
02:00:02.230 --> 02:00:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I was getting 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 bucks an hour to shower.</v>

2629
02:00:04.150 --> 02:00:07.240
<v Speaker 3>I didn't give a fuck how deep it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight inches.</v>

2630
02:00:07.241 --> 02:00:09.820
<v Speaker 3>12 inches a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how fast the snow comes down in</v>

2631
02:00:09.821 --> 02:00:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Colorado doors or eight feet?</v>

2632
02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:13.443
<v Speaker 3>They probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2633
02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:16.110
<v Speaker 3>they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you either pay me now pay me</v>

2634
02:00:16.111 --> 02:00:19.780
<v Speaker 3>that I don't know what the basis for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bottom of the hill,</v>

2635
02:00:19.781 --> 02:00:23.740
<v Speaker 3>but they got the snow they needed that</v>
<v Speaker 3>year because they man make the hill.</v>

2636
02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:26.980
<v Speaker 3>The snow on the bottom right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That helps out.</v>

2637
02:00:27.670 --> 02:00:29.920
<v Speaker 3>They man make the snow on the bottom I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

2638
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2639
02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Whatever that fake snow but snow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just make it with the machine.</v>

2640
02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:37.930
<v Speaker 3>They just make it with the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then on top fills in those gaps,</v>

2641
02:00:37.931 --> 02:00:40.760
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom gives it more of a base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's called.</v>

2642
02:00:40.761 --> 02:00:44.170
<v Speaker 3>The base that's so they'll tell you we</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a 63 inch base.</v>

2643
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:47.260
<v Speaker 3>We have a $200 base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means you could jump off a fucking</v>

2644
02:00:47.261 --> 02:00:50.020
<v Speaker 3>helicopter and nothing's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you in that base.</v>

2645
02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just used to going to land in powder</v>

2646
02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:53.150
<v Speaker 3>puff.</v>

2647
02:00:53.150 --> 02:00:56.470
<v Speaker 3>You imagine doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to my arm and get in the</v>

2648
02:00:56.471 --> 02:00:59.860
<v Speaker 3>helicopter and just jumping off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter with skis and just landing on</v>

2649
02:00:59.861 --> 02:01:04.060
<v Speaker 3>that fucking thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>without your knee blowing the fuck up.</v>

2650
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a guy who did that video.</v>

2651
02:01:06.551 --> 02:01:11.551
<v Speaker 3>He jumped like 250 feet and went up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking landed in the powder and nothing</v>

2652
02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:12.730
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No nothing.</v>

2653
02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:15.730
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fresh Virgin fucking powder.</v>

2654
02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:19.870
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't take a big chance though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to know exactly what's under</v>

2655
02:01:19.871 --> 02:01:21.300
<v Speaker 3>that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine landing?</v>

2656
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:23.210
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking Ayesha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they call.</v>

2657
02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:26.530

2691
02:02:51.711 --> 02:02:52.700
<v Speaker 3>the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's these new things called cushy</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 milligrams.</v>

2693
02:02:56.570 --> 02:03:00.380
<v Speaker 3>You open it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It smells like transmission fluid when</v>

02:03:00.381 --> 02:03:02.210
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you fucking finger</v>

<v Speaker 3>monkey.</v>

2696
02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:06.530
<v Speaker 3>It smells like gunpowder and the pussy</v>
<v Speaker 3>St.</v>

2697
02:03:08.690 --> 02:03:13.010
<v Speaker 3>it smells like transmission fluid in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking motherfucker go.</v>

2698
02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 3>You get so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2699
02:03:16.671 --> 02:03:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just pass out now,</v>

2700
02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:21.410
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Colorado I got some gum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drops,</v>

2701
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:24.260
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pot gumdrops God,</v>

2702
02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:26.420
<v Speaker 3>they were so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2703
02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:27.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2704
02:03:27.681 --> 02:03:31.100
<v Speaker 3>but each one felt like somewhere around</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

2705
02:03:31.420 --> 02:03:34.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a couple of those and they give</v>

2706
02:03:34.521 --> 02:03:38.660
<v Speaker 3>you a bag that's supposed to be 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams for how many is in there?</v>

2707
02:03:38.661 --> 02:03:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Five and their attending or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2708
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:45.320
<v Speaker 3>But it's got a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell if they're right</v>

2709
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:47.150
<v Speaker 3>because I had one and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2710
02:03:47.151 --> 02:03:50.060
<v Speaker 3>this feels like about 10 milligrams now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another one that was like,</v>

2711
02:03:50.061 --> 02:03:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2712
02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have that consistent.</v>

2713
02:03:55.491 --> 02:03:57.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're doing such a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>job at stirring,</v>

2714
02:03:58.320 --> 02:03:59.420
<v Speaker 3>you know the stars.</v>

2715
02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Last week I was fucking drooling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called the guy and go and see what the</v>

2716
02:04:03.951 --> 02:04:07.430
<v Speaker 3>fuck bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was in these stores this week?</v>

2717
02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:08.160
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm.</v>

2718
02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you got a batch is stronger</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the other.</v>

2719
02:04:10.071 --> 02:04:10.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait luge,</v>

2720
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:12.950
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid with Qualia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people make them in that</v>

2721
02:04:12.951 --> 02:04:15.770
<v Speaker 3>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So something like we talked about</v>

2722
02:04:15.771 --> 02:04:19.370
<v Speaker 3>sometimes to the table is like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2723
02:04:19.371 --> 02:04:21.380
<v Speaker 3>All this shit goes to the bottom and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fuck.</v>

2724
02:04:21.890 --> 02:04:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you get a bag of gummies,</v>

2725
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:27.890
<v Speaker 3>you're not necessarily getting them from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same plant.</v>

2726
02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:29.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

2727
02:04:29.271 --> 02:04:32.960
<v Speaker 3>one gummy might be from one batch and</v>
<v Speaker 3>another gummy might be for another</v>

2728
02:04:32.961 --> 02:04:35.660
<v Speaker 3>batch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it might not mean they're all</v>

2729
02:04:35.661 --> 02:04:38.430
<v Speaker 3>getting piled up together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scooped and put into a bag.</v>

2730
02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:40.960
<v Speaker 3>You easily could have one live one in</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm getting dressed.</v>

2758
02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:02.940
<v Speaker 3>When I was pulling pants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these pants are darker than my usual</v>

2759
02:06:02.941 --> 02:06:04.410
<v Speaker 3>jeans.</v>

02:06:05.370 --> 02:06:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well last time I wore them was probably</v>

2761
02:06:08.101 --> 02:06:11.490
<v Speaker 3>when I had the surgery and that's why I</v>
<v Speaker 3>found the pill in that it would clean.</v>

2762

<v Speaker 3>I went into the detergent,</v>

2766
02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:25.710

<v Speaker 3>watched over it.</v>

2767
02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was like a viking cousin for</v>

<v Speaker 3>I smoked dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I tell you,</v>

2774
02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:44.760
<v Speaker 3>I set the fire alarm off and put the</v>
<v Speaker 3>glove on.</v>

2775

<v Speaker 3>she is.</v>

2782

<v Speaker 3>She's comedy store.</v>

2785
02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:10.020

2790
02:07:15.721 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 3>But that just goes to show you the</v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence of the comedy store.</v>

2791
02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Did you tell them that you did that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you set it off?</v>

2796
02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:30.750

<v Speaker 3>And when you went up there,</v>

2797
02:07:30.751 --> 02:07:34.420
<v Speaker 3>he didn't say that was me smoking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I looked at it afterwards.</v>

2802
02:07:44.231 --> 02:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>So the next night they put a little</v>

<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

2868
02:10:28.810 --> 02:10:33.770
<v Speaker 2>He had always had great rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always had a restaurant here or dive</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was cool.</v>

2871
02:10:38.481 --> 02:10:41.810
<v Speaker 2>It was fun too because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you travel around all these weird spots.</v>

2872
02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Do Comedy and sometimes people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>hire comedians and it wouldn't work out.</v>

2873
02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:49.250
<v Speaker 2>They would try it for one show and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be on that one show and then they never</v>

2874
02:10:49.251 --> 02:10:52.010
<v Speaker 2>had comedy again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was such a dirty comedians from</v>

2875
02:10:52.011 --> 02:10:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Boston come up in some weird fish</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant in New Hampshire and they</v>

2876
02:10:56.331 --> 02:11:00.860
<v Speaker 2>just don't want to just don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of those did we do?</v>

2877
02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>

2878
02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:03.553
<v Speaker 2>Had to.</v>

2879
02:11:04.650 --> 02:11:06.620
<v Speaker 1>I used to do comedy in a place where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was alive.</v>

2880
02:11:06.630 --> 02:11:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Parrot behind John Stayed Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three feet.</v>

2881
02:11:11.210 --> 02:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>He would eat the seeds and fucking flick</v>
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>

2882
02:11:13.651 --> 02:11:16.560
<v Speaker 1>In the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things that you've done</v>

2883
02:11:16.561 --> 02:11:20.400
<v Speaker 1>that you were talking about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have this grand illusion of comedy</v>

2884
02:11:20.401 --> 02:11:24.210
<v Speaker 1>when you get into it and you get to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and it's not a stage.</v>

2885
02:11:24.211 --> 02:11:28.050
<v Speaker 1>There's no green room guy talks to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're shit.</v>

2886
02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:29.550
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I do this?</v>

2887
02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:33.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my 12 and I got to go to work at six.</v>

2888
02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:37.780
<v Speaker 1>So fucking tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a,</v>

2889
02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:39.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2890
02:11:41.130 --> 02:11:44.910
<v Speaker 2>it also doesn't seem that hard when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it from the outside the first</v>

2891
02:11:44.911 --> 02:11:46.590
<v Speaker 2>time you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's not that hard.</v>

2892
02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:49.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just people talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll figure that out.</v>

2893
02:11:50.650 --> 02:11:51.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2894
02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:58.910
<v Speaker 1>until you bomb 800 fucking times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's part of it.</v>

2895
02:11:58.911 --> 02:12:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Like now sometimes I get happy when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombed because I get it out of the what?</v>

2896
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least it's not a fucking surprise</v>

2897
02:12:04.371 --> 02:12:05.204
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2898
02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best motivator to like</v>

2899
02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:15.160
<v Speaker 2>tighten up your game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best motivators are shitty.</v>

2900
02:12:15.161 --> 02:12:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing like one offset just feels.</v>

2901
02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Just wanting to get back and tighten</v>
<v Speaker 2>things down.</v>

2902
02:12:23.890 --> 02:12:26.290
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to people that go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the store on a regular basis too,</v>

2903
02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:29.170
<v Speaker 2>because they get to see all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

2904
02:12:29.290 --> 02:12:33.040
<v Speaker 2>They'll see a bit one time and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll come back and see you maybe six</v>

2905
02:12:33.041 --> 02:12:37.150
<v Speaker 2>months later and they'll see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now it's got all these extra things</v>

2906
02:12:37.151 --> 02:12:38.470
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's alive.</v>

2907
02:12:38.471 --> 02:12:40.750
<v Speaker 2>It's connected to other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get into it better.</v>

2908
02:12:40.751 --> 02:12:45.010
<v Speaker 2>You're smoother in your delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much fucking fun.</v>

2909
02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:47.440
<v Speaker 2>The CSO thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shot in Chicago?</v>

2915
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy it's old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fucking work.</v>

2916
02:13:03.330 --> 02:13:04.290
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>can't stand listening to myself and I</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2922

<v Speaker 1>was shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was letting go at night like you come</v>

2959
02:15:14.401 --> 02:15:15.630
<v Speaker 1>up to and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good bit.</v>

2960
02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:18.150
<v Speaker 1>But you didn't tell me about the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things before that.</v>

2961
02:15:18.150 --> 02:15:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I said that comes after a set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to remember what it</v>

2962
02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:23.401
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

2963
02:15:23.401 --> 02:15:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you remember one or two lines,</v>

2964
02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:29.550
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't remember those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluctuations you set in your voice.</v>

2965
02:15:30.210 --> 02:15:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things I never worked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2966
02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:36.300
<v Speaker 1>That line that you threw away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the setup to that joke and you</v>

2967
02:15:36.301 --> 02:15:39.690
<v Speaker 1>don't even know you set it up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this taught me.</v>

2968
02:15:39.930 --> 02:15:41.790
<v Speaker 1>This special taught me that type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2969
02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I had to listen to every fucking set</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2970
02:15:45.570 --> 02:15:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how you prepare jokes and you</v>

2971
02:15:49.471 --> 02:15:51.930
<v Speaker 1>think what's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you listen,</v>

2972
02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.070
<v Speaker 1>the ship that you thought was gonna work</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really work as well.</v>

2973
02:15:56.670 --> 02:15:59.190
<v Speaker 1>It's little things that you didn't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to work.</v>

2974
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:01.170
<v Speaker 1>That really worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird when you listen to your</v>

2975
02:16:01.171 --> 02:16:04.170
<v Speaker 1>material and it was a whole complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>different education.</v>

2976
02:16:04.171 --> 02:16:06.270
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was rough for me to do.</v>

2977
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It was really tough for me to do because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like listening to myself at</v>

2978
02:16:09.511 --> 02:16:13.170
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do it on planes when you can't</v>

2979
02:16:13.171 --> 02:16:15.930
<v Speaker 1>go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm trapped I get really fucking</v>

2980
02:16:15.931 --> 02:16:18.720
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pull one of these pads out and just go</v>

2981
02:16:18.721 --> 02:16:20.640
<v Speaker 1>on a train on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

2982
02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:22.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened to me.</v>

2983
02:16:22.291 --> 02:16:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I pulled out my third seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deanna.</v>

2984
02:16:24.061 --> 02:16:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Plane out of Chicago is the worst thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ever heard in my fucking life,</v>

2985
02:16:27.741 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 1>but my cd is</v>

2986
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:31.960
<v Speaker 3>probably the worst thing I've ever heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>in all my life.</v>

2987
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I haven't really used</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2988
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:37.960
<v Speaker 3>but that's when I learned that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of jokes in times that even if you</v>

2989
02:16:37.961 --> 02:16:39.760
<v Speaker 3>think even [inaudible] there's seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

2990
02:16:39.761 --> 02:16:42.370
<v Speaker 3>you're like enough with the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still three more,</v>

2991
02:16:42.371 --> 02:16:45.940
<v Speaker 3>four more minutes in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I beat and you taught me that you</v>

2992
02:16:45.941 --> 02:16:48.010
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that said you liked to keep</v>

2993
02:16:48.011 --> 02:16:50.650
<v Speaker 3>finding tags and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2994
02:16:50.651 --> 02:16:52.630
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you just get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go,</v>

2995
02:16:52.631 --> 02:16:54.370
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got four of them on there,</v>

2996
02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:59.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I found that out.</v>

2997
02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:03.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what shocked me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the first time I had really done</v>

2998
02:17:03.401 --> 02:17:06.070
<v Speaker 3>this type of exclusive work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

3007
02:17:26.231 --> 02:17:27.450
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>

3008
02:17:27.451 --> 02:17:29.590
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so cecil was owned by NBC,</v>

3009
02:17:29.591 --> 02:17:30.550
<v Speaker 3>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3010
02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:31.930
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing that.</v>

3011
02:17:32.290 --> 02:17:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great when someone's doing any.</v>

3012
02:17:33.630 --> 02:17:35.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean the more people doing something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

3013
02:17:35.681 --> 02:17:38.170
<v Speaker 3>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

3014
02:17:38.171 --> 02:17:42.910
<v Speaker 3>man right now commonly used to be eight</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 12 or eight to two.</v>

3015
02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Now it's nine to five because people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>on their desks with ear buds on.</v>

3016
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could dream your fucking special at</v>

3017
02:17:50.231 --> 02:17:53.490
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much going on with streaming</v>

3018
02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:54.910
<v Speaker 3>and the whole fucking deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3019
02:17:54.911 --> 02:17:57.520
<v Speaker 3>most of the people that listen to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>are working right now.</v>

3020
02:17:57.521 --> 02:17:58.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on right now.</v>

3021
02:17:58.450 --> 02:18:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine if you're doing</v>

3022
02:18:00.281 --> 02:18:02.830
<v Speaker 3>something that you don't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to somebody.</v>

3023
02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:04.630
<v Speaker 3>You could listen to this while you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing your work.</v>

3024
02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Nine to five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine has shown any Goddamn I got to stop</v>

<v Speaker 3>I ended up five has so many amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know from TV.</v>

3027
02:18:15.341 --> 02:18:18.910

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3028
02:18:18.911 --> 02:18:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much working people only watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>television from eight to 11.</v>

3029
02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:23.290
<v Speaker 3>That's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

3030
02:18:24.190 --> 02:18:29.190
<v Speaker 3>I go to work now at nine and put it buds</v>
<v Speaker 3>on and I can't get into game of thrones</v>

3031
02:18:29.801 --> 02:18:32.730
<v Speaker 3>or Westworld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can listen to a here.</v>

3032
02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:37.670
<v Speaker 3>How many people do you think get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to stuff while they work?</v>

3033
02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:39.010
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>

3034
02:18:39.430 --> 02:18:41.860
<v Speaker 3>What percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I T I don't know about it.</v>

3035
02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:43.310
<v Speaker 3>A lot of tech people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3036
02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:46.330
<v Speaker 3>A lot of tech people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I talk to my knees sometimes in</v>

3037
02:18:46.331 --> 02:18:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she tells me I was to you in the office</v>

3038
02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:50.110
<v Speaker 3>and she's in marketing.</v>

3039
02:18:50.170 --> 02:18:53.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it puts these in and make notes and type</v>

3040
02:18:53.411 --> 02:18:56.860
<v Speaker 3>of proposals and listening to podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole game out.</v>

3041
02:18:56.861 --> 02:19:00.600
<v Speaker 3>That's not eight to 11 no more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing is that now?</v>

3042
02:19:01.170 --> 02:19:02.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight till 11.</v>

3043
02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Netflix is a whole new realm now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

3044
02:19:06.701 --> 02:19:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Now I could go to work and listening</v>
<v Speaker 3>from nine to 12 and from one to five and</v>

3045
02:19:10.411 --> 02:19:14.620
<v Speaker 3>I could watch from 12 to one at my desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could watch game of thrones on</v>

3046
02:19:14.621 --> 02:19:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can watch.</v>

3047
02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:18.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a different fucking world out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3048
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:21.160
<v Speaker 3>Do you use a use Netflix and use apple</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV?</v>

3049
02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever use that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3050
02:19:22.451 --> 02:19:24.380
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're getting because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>speakers on my.</v>

3051
02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:26.470
<v Speaker 3>I was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what my wife is saying.</v>

3052
02:19:26.471 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does</v>

3053
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:30.920
<v Speaker 2>all the it stuff at the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy that you can see.</v>

3054
02:19:31.590 --> 02:19:33.890
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety nine or whatever the hell it is.</v>

3055
02:19:33.891 --> 02:19:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Percentage of the movies just by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3056
02:19:36.681 --> 02:19:38.450
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what percentage.</v>

3057
02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say 99.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a guess.</v>

3058
02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:45.350
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not even 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What percent of all movies are on itunes</v>

3059
02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:48.020
<v Speaker 2>because independent movies probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't.</v>

3060
02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some independent movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all movies on itunes a lot.</v>

3061
02:19:52.690 --> 02:19:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think all of them because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day I noticed that they just</v>

3062
02:19:55.731 --> 02:20:00.380
<v Speaker 2>recently added an American Werewolf in</v>
<v Speaker 2>London and I was like,</v>

3063
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:02.270
<v Speaker 2>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How weird was it?</v>

3064
02:20:02.271 --> 02:20:03.740
<v Speaker 2>The wolf man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those.</v>

3065
02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Now when we told them on Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is apple TV.</v>

3066
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Then they recently added some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies that were like pretty old movies,</v>

3067
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:16.370
<v Speaker 2>like they just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just added them,</v>

3068
02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:19.850
<v Speaker 2>so I think they're still buying movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and putting them on me.</v>

3069
02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they're doing licensing</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

3070
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:24.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making some sort of a deal,</v>

3071
02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:26.120
<v Speaker 2>but they got a lot of fucking movies is</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point.</v>

3072
02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:29.750
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing is you could just press</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it starts playing.</v>

3073
02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Like when we were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the idea of going to the</v>

3074
02:20:32.631 --> 02:20:34.550
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got make member have blockbuster</v>

3075
02:20:34.551 --> 02:20:37.910
<v Speaker 2>would have those giant shelves filled</v>
<v Speaker 2>with one kind of movie.</v>

3076
02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:43.480
<v Speaker 2>One movie would come out and that movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>would just feel a shelf and like say if</v>

3077
02:20:44.541 --> 02:20:48.080
<v Speaker 2>it was like a transformers or alien or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

3078
02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:49.910
<v Speaker 2>there would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3079
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:52.560
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four levels of them and you would,</v>

3080
02:20:52.570 --> 02:20:55.790
<v Speaker 2>you would get there and they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a couple left and you get lucky.</v>

3081
02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got the last,</v>

3082

3084
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:02.390
<v Speaker 2>that's the first time I went in.</v>

3085
02:21:02.390 --> 02:21:04.280
<v Speaker 2>There was a night I was running from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops.</v>

3086
02:21:04.281 --> 02:21:07.530
<v Speaker 2>After I kidnap Vela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the blockbuster and I,</v>

3087
02:21:07.570 --> 02:21:09.290

<v Speaker 2>that probably get angry.</v>

3093
02:21:23.490 --> 02:21:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I watched the triangle scene at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a mad catch.</v>

3144
02:23:37.571 --> 02:23:39.910
<v Speaker 3>he didn't throw him around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he punched him in the fucking mouth</v>

3145
02:23:39.911 --> 02:23:41.440
<v Speaker 3>a few times in front of his buddies.</v>

3146
02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>

3147
02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:49.480
<v Speaker 3>And one time when I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got out of the fucking jail in</v>

3148
02:23:49.481 --> 02:23:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got out of the halfway house and I got</v>

3149
02:23:53.621 --> 02:23:57.040
<v Speaker 3>into a fight with a guy that cut me off</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they ended up splitting up the car</v>

3150
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:59.080
<v Speaker 3>and something happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

3151
02:23:59.081 --> 02:24:01.570
<v Speaker 3>I slipped and that guy had me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was beating the fuck out of me,</v>

3152
02:24:01.571 --> 02:24:05.080
<v Speaker 3>but then he slipped in the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the cops got there,</v>

3153
02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I was on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pulled this up.</v>

3154
02:24:07.421 --> 02:24:09.640
<v Speaker 3>I was going back to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were going to violate me.</v>

3155
02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I told the cop what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told the cop what happened,</v>

3156
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:16.990
<v Speaker 3>but he was giving the cop a bad attitude</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want right there.</v>

3157
02:24:17.770 --> 02:24:19.500
<v Speaker 3>He was telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do you care?</v>

3158
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:20.343
<v Speaker 3>And the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3159
02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:22.330
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They talked and they pull us back.</v>

3160
02:24:22.331 --> 02:24:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I just told the cop the truth.</v>

3161
02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:26.380
<v Speaker 3>I just got to the halfway house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get violated for this.</v>

3162
02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Go talk to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they came back and I go,</v>

3163
02:24:29.681 --> 02:24:32.290
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to press charges but</v>
<v Speaker 3>shake hands.</v>

3164
02:24:32.291 --> 02:24:34.450
<v Speaker 3>And the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to shake his hand.</v>

3165
02:24:34.990 --> 02:24:36.400
<v Speaker 3>And the cop looks at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks at them.</v>

3166
02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:37.170
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3167
02:24:37.170 --> 02:24:39.310
<v Speaker 3>When we got here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you weren't doing too fucking good.</v>

3168
02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't make me.</v>

3169
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Don't make me put him on fucking top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll get you weren't doing too fucking</v>

3170
02:24:45.221 --> 02:24:46.480

<v Speaker 3>Shake his hand.</v>

3171
02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:49.170
<v Speaker 3>The guy shook my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the end of that.</v>

3172
02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:50.950
<v Speaker 3>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You weren't doing it through good</v>

3173
02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:55.690
<v Speaker 3>cops letting people fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's strange.</v>

3174
02:24:55.870 --> 02:24:58.230
<v Speaker 3>You remember there was that thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going on in the California prisons</v>

3175
02:24:58.231 --> 02:25:00.400
<v Speaker 3>where they haven't liked these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these crazy fights,</v>

3176
02:25:00.401 --> 02:25:05.401
<v Speaker 3>these underground fights and the guards</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like setting things up.</v>

3177
02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:07.390
<v Speaker 3>The gladiator fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>

3178
02:25:07.391 --> 02:25:09.200
<v Speaker 3>There was like a big article about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should.</v>

3184
02:25:24.330 --> 02:25:28.770
<v Speaker 2>and leave town for Christmas and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys got in touch with to promote</v>

3185
02:25:28.771 --> 02:25:32.890
<v Speaker 2>and they brought somebody from boxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to see Mike Tyson.</v>

3186
02:25:33.310 --> 02:25:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I got the fucking idea for</v>

3187
02:25:35.861 --> 02:25:36.671
<v Speaker 2>that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me go.</v>

3188
02:25:36.671 --> 02:25:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Undisputed.</v>

3189
02:25:37.811 --> 02:25:38.451
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

3190
02:25:38.451 --> 02:25:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Let me go ahead and pick that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Undisputed is based on a real story.</v>

3191
02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:47.500
<v Speaker 2>They brought a guy in the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

3192
02:25:47.501 --> 02:25:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much that would be worth</v>

3193
02:25:51.370 --> 02:25:53.470
<v Speaker 2>when prison guards force inmates to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>

3194
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:55.000
<v Speaker 2>That was the wide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

3195
02:25:55.001 --> 02:25:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you googling?</v>

3196
02:25:58.570 --> 02:26:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Undisputed movie real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it based on a real story?</v>

3197
02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movie similarities to real life.</v>

3198
02:26:05.291 --> 02:26:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Tyson's saga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Undisputed.</v>

3199
02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:11.920
<v Speaker 2>But where is the fight that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a fight in jail?</v>

3200
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.030
<v Speaker 2>If Mike Tyson had a fight in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have,</v>

3201
02:26:16.450 --> 02:26:21.320
<v Speaker 2>they would have filmed that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mike Tyson would be talking about</v>

3202
02:26:21.321 --> 02:26:22.090
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3203
02:26:22.090 --> 02:26:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson has that whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3204
02:26:25.271 --> 02:26:27.280
<v Speaker 2>where your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole live show where he talks about</v>

3205
02:26:27.281 --> 02:26:29.020
<v Speaker 2>his entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3206
02:26:29.021 --> 02:26:33.610
<v Speaker 2>if Mike Tyson had that in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will be telling people about it.</v>

3207
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3208
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine that he would ever have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight in jail and not tell anybody about</v>

3209
02:26:40.511 --> 02:26:42.160
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the.</v>

3210
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it about it?</v>

3211
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:45.670
<v Speaker 2>What are you looking up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Center for?</v>

3212
02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone was asking the same question as</v>

3213
02:26:47.491 --> 02:26:49.060
<v Speaker 2>a boxing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3214
02:26:49.090 --> 02:26:51.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe someone's got a link somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are silly.</v>

3215
02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:54.220
<v Speaker 2>There's no links.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would have heard of it.</v>

3216
02:26:54.250 --> 02:26:57.370
<v Speaker 2>We've known there was a video of Tyson</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting in jail.</v>

3217
02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she for sure you're going to tape.</v>

3218
02:27:00.341 --> 02:27:03.130
<v Speaker 2>It was just going to let it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust your memory.</v>

3219
02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:05.920
<v Speaker 2>You're going to bring in riddick bow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like that.</v>

3220
02:27:05.921 --> 02:27:07.480
<v Speaker 2>And you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have Tyson fight him in jail.</v>

3221
02:27:07.690 --> 02:27:10.060
<v Speaker 2>The Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

3222
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mid Nineties.</v>

3223
02:27:11.890 --> 02:27:13.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the exact day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When.</v>

3224
02:27:13.890 --> 02:27:15.730
<v Speaker 2>What year do you think Tyson was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail?</v>

3225
02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Tyson went to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 2000.</v>

3226
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 11 around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3227
02:27:23.290 --> 02:27:25.870
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the more recent one,</v>

3228
02:27:25.871 --> 02:27:29.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't the real Chicago and Illinois.</v>

3229
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the late nineties because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was out.</v>

3230
02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:38.040
<v Speaker 2>He was out and fighting holy field while</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in Encino,</v>

3231
02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:40.360
<v Speaker 2>which I think was 96.</v>

3232
02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3233
02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:49.130
<v Speaker 2>When did he go in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got arrested in [inaudible] 92 that</v>

3234
02:27:49.131 --> 02:27:51.230
<v Speaker 2>says you got a six year prison term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3235
02:27:51.231 --> 02:27:52.380
<v Speaker 2>that was the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>

3236
02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:53.420
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

3237
02:27:53.421 --> 02:27:58.421
<v Speaker 2>How long was Tyson in jail for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still maintains that of all the shit</v>

3238
02:28:00.811 --> 02:28:02.370
<v Speaker 2>he says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's,</v>

3239
02:28:02.590 --> 02:28:03.710
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3240
02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:06.260
<v Speaker 2>That was set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really crazy.</v>

3241
02:28:06.770 --> 02:28:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Then you find out that that same woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>had set somebody else up.</v>

3242
02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:12.860
<v Speaker 2>She had lied about a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one.</v>

3243
02:28:12.890 --> 02:28:13.723
<v Speaker 2>Another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3244
02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:17.720
<v Speaker 2>alleged rape allegedly lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the specifics,</v>

3245
02:28:18.470 --> 02:28:19.670
<v Speaker 2>but that was in her past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3246
02:28:19.671 --> 02:28:22.050
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

3247
02:28:22.090 --> 02:28:25.000
<v Speaker 3>released a winter in March.</v>
<v Speaker 3>March 26.</v>

3248
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:26.020
<v Speaker 3>Ninety two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was sentenced.</v>

3249
02:28:26.021 --> 02:28:27.610
<v Speaker 3>He was released march.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 95.</v>

3250
02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Three years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3251
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:33.580
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long has he been retired?</v>

3252
02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:36.850
<v Speaker 3>He retired right after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3253
02:28:36.851 --> 02:28:39.820
<v Speaker 3>he had a couple of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was the Kevin Ferguson</v>

3254
02:28:39.821 --> 02:28:41.410
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the one where you retired?</v>

3255
02:28:42.490 --> 02:28:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Was his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyson's done the boxing world by</v>

3256
02:28:49.091 --> 02:28:52.570
<v Speaker 3>quitting before the start of the seventh</v>
<v Speaker 3>round against Kevin Mcbride.</v>

3257
02:28:52.660 --> 02:28:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Mcbride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3258
02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:58.360
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3259
02:28:58.370 --> 02:29:00.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Lennox Lewis fight was a bad beating</v>

3260
02:29:00.381 --> 02:29:02.780
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was before that.</v>

3261
02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:04.710
<v Speaker 2>That was one where you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew like,</v>

3262
02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:07.160
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just not the same guy anymore.</v>

3263

3264
02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:12.890

<v Speaker 2>It was a scary guy.</v>

3265
02:29:13.210 --> 02:29:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew as much as anybody knew,</v>

3266
02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:19.900
<v Speaker 2>can only go so long in that business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3267
02:29:20.020 --> 02:29:22.880
<v Speaker 2>is a shelf life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gets out.</v>

3268

02:30:55.141 --> 02:30:56.880

<v Speaker 3>You've pointed out a lot of stuff.</v>

3301
02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:58.950
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was always very smart.</v>

3302
02:30:58.951 --> 02:31:01.920
<v Speaker 3>He never really got hit a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't get in any big,</v>

3303
02:31:01.921 --> 02:31:02.521
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

3304
02:31:02.521 --> 02:31:05.250
<v Speaker 3>big people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3305
02:31:05.251 --> 02:31:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy always stayed pretty clean.</v>

3306
02:31:07.411 --> 02:31:11.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not like he's a Jeffrey Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3307
02:31:11.130 --> 02:31:11.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3308
02:31:11.551 --> 02:31:14.100
<v Speaker 3>He would make fights ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would clench a lot,</v>

3309
02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:17.010
<v Speaker 3>frustrated a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he also could crack,</v>

3310
02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he just was a really boxer.</v>

3311
02:31:20.260 --> 02:31:25.260
<v Speaker 3>The the big coming out party for him was</v>
<v Speaker 3>Felix Trinidad when he fought Felix</v>

3312
02:31:25.270 --> 02:31:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Trinidad and just boxes face off.</v>

3313
02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Everybody just saw like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we thought Felix Trinidad was this</v>

3314
02:31:31.261 --> 02:31:35.610
<v Speaker 3>young hungry lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was taken on the older veteran who is</v>

3315
02:31:35.611 --> 02:31:37.770
<v Speaker 3>probably on his way down to Bernard</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopkins,</v>

3316
02:31:37.771 --> 02:31:41.910
<v Speaker 3>wasn't on his way down like he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just like coming into his own</v>

3317
02:31:41.911 --> 02:31:45.240
<v Speaker 3>stride then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's always been so disciplined,</v>

3318
02:31:45.241 --> 02:31:49.050
<v Speaker 3>man so smart with his diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So smart with how he takes care of his</v>

3319
02:31:49.051 --> 02:31:51.120
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never allows himself to get out of</v>

3320
02:31:51.121 --> 02:31:53.010
<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's never like working back into</v>

3321
02:31:53.011 --> 02:31:57.870
<v Speaker 3>shape and always fights intelligent and</v>
<v Speaker 3>defensively he's always in the right</v>

3322
02:31:57.871 --> 02:32:01.080
<v Speaker 3>position to work for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I 51,</v>

3323
02:32:01.081 --> 02:32:04.770
<v Speaker 3>it might work for very well could.</v>

<v Speaker 3>who was a two division world champ,</v>

3325
02:32:07.891 --> 02:32:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was at least one division</v>

3326
02:32:10.411 --> 02:32:11.880
<v Speaker 3>champ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but John,</v>

3327
02:32:11.881 --> 02:32:15.240
<v Speaker 3>David Jackson and a lot of people forgot</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it was a really high level voxer</v>

3328
02:32:15.730 --> 02:32:16.630

<v Speaker 2>You go in the box and it simulates high</v>

3374
02:34:22.811 --> 02:34:25.300
<v Speaker 2>altitude and you fucking go crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout in there.</v>

3376
02:34:28.750 --> 02:34:30.420

<v Speaker 2>Simulators used to be in the corner.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do you remember?</v>

3528
02:41:16.981 --> 02:41:17.814
<v Speaker 3>Alto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nova.</v>

3529
02:41:19.350 --> 02:41:22.640
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put the video on with the video.</v>

3530
02:41:22.641 --> 02:41:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Can we end with the video please?</v>

3531
02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3532
02:41:30.641 --> 02:41:33.790
<v Speaker 3>I do remember the beginning of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What to play a little bit of it,</v>

3533
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:35.760
<v Speaker 3>but we can't play any of the music for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people at home.</v>

3534
02:41:35.761 --> 02:41:37.140
<v Speaker 3>We'll just watch it for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3535
02:41:37.250 --> 02:41:40.990
<v Speaker 3>After the beginning of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is just a fantasy.</v>

3536
02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I still remember what I see though in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this video permit.</v>

3537
02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:48.970
<v Speaker 3>New Year's eve of 1982 or three volume</v>
<v Speaker 3>young Jamie.</v>

3538
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3539
02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:56.290
<v Speaker 3>This is 83.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3540
02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.670
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the crazy things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good video.</v>

3541
02:42:00.671 --> 02:42:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3542
02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:04.270
<v Speaker 3>you see these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a time capsule.</v>

3543
02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:07.270
<v Speaker 3>This is people from the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3544
02:42:07.271 --> 02:42:10.600
<v Speaker 3>they talk about how music isn't selling</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

3545
02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you guys don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't do these goofy things.</v>

3546
02:42:13.830 --> 02:42:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3547
02:42:15.041 --> 02:42:19.060
<v Speaker 3>it's because the only way to get music</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then was you got to buy it.</v>

3548
02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:20.890
<v Speaker 3>That's not the case anymore.</v>

3549
02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:24.490
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty easy to get music now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's about making it convenient to</v>

3550
02:42:24.491 --> 02:42:27.220
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's Aldo motherfucking Nova with a</v>

<v Speaker 3>if it takes his guitar out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets better,</v>

3562
02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody stand back.</v>

<v Speaker 3>guitar.</v>

3564
02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:06.310

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3586
02:44:11.490 --> 02:44:14.580
