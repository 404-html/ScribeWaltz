00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.341 --> 00:00:06.130
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting too is that there's all these different approaches to</v>

4
00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:07.510
<v Speaker 1>strength and conditioning,</v>

5
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you because one of the</v>

6
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>things that I'd seen was,</v>

7
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Matt working out with you and your guys and he was doing all kinds of crazy</v>

9
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

10
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>like when you devise a plan,</v>

12
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>like for an athlete,</v>

13
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>like a Matte Brown or someone like that,</v>

14
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

15
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.511
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

16
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>You work with them first to try to figure out what they're capable of and then</v>

17
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:26.471
<v Speaker 1>think about like,</v>

18
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:27.520
<v Speaker 1>what their style is.</v>

19
00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

20
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're going to have a different,</v>

21
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 1>a different need if you're a striker versus grappler.</v>

23
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

24
00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:34.631
<v Speaker 2>one thing we did,</v>

25
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 2>we tried to get him more to air condition to do five minute rounds and</v>

26
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:38.230
<v Speaker 2>recovering in one minute.</v>

27
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.801
<v Speaker 2>When I worked,</v>

28
00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 2>everything was five minutes and minute recovery.</v>

29
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Some guys had went through eight rounds.</v>

30
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys there was able to do that.</v>

31
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

32
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.111
<v Speaker 2>pretty good fighters,</v>

33
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:47.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>

35
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 2>13 wins and,</v>

36
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

37
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.763
<v Speaker 2>pro fights,</v>

40
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.813
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

41
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.380
<v Speaker 2>So just word of recovery.</v>

42
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

43
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I want to maximize the amount of work I can do it five minutes and then be able</v>

44
00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.800
<v Speaker 2>to cover in one minute and do it again repeatedly.</v>

45
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 2>That's all I ever did work in five minute intervals.</v>

46
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So did you work with guys that you use heart rate monitors and like how did you</v>

47
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>decide that?</v>

48
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Have they ever done any of that?</v>

49
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Really never know.</v>

50
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 2>My friend John Sailor is got Shinnecock Jujitsu.</v>

51
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 2>These basically I started almost really the first MMA school in America.</v>

52
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:16.871
<v Speaker 2>If you think about,</v>

53
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 2>cause he was judo,</v>

54
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu Samba,</v>

55
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 2>but also striking and he started in 1985.</v>

56
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

57
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.080
<v Speaker 2>And he does everything by heart rate where we do things by percentages.</v>

58
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

59
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.741
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

60
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I said we trade by an,</v>

61
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.001
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

62
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 2>rates of velocity,</v>

63
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.531
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>

64
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 2>strength training at 75 to 85%.</v>

65
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 2>He would do heart rate's like that.</v>

66
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 2>And like if you and I would grapple,</v>

67
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 2>if we could talk to each other for a half hour,</v>

68
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 2>that'd be optimal.</v>

69
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 2>You know me and you can talk while we're doing it.</v>

70
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's optimal heart rate that,</v>

71
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

72
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 2>So he kept track of heart rates,</v>

73
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.420
<v Speaker 2>kind of basically how we do percentage of one rep Max.</v>

74
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 1>So meaning that it's optimal if you could still talk while you're doing right,</v>

75
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.341
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

76
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Circuitry and optimally you're new.</v>

77
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 2>You're not like,</v>

78
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:54.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:55.780
<v Speaker 2>that's how I would be in,</v>

80
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

82
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.850
<v Speaker 1>but if you're gonna fight,</v>

83
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in a fight and it's a very high paced fight,</v>

84
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.630
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely that you're going to achieve much higher rates of heart rate</v>

85
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>would be much more exhausted.</v>

86
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

87
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.381
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

88
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:09.520
<v Speaker 2>that would be up to much how we train our speed date.</v>

89
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Like today for squatting and deadlifting is up the mud.</v>

90
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>They do a 25 squats at one way and two,</v>

91
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.891
<v Speaker 2>and for speed,</v>

92
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 2>strength acceleration and two and 20 dead lifts.</v>

93
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 2>And then the other days Max effort.</v>

94
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you're talking about.</v>

95
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 2>What you go all out and around someone's pushing you,</v>

96
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to take you out,</v>

98
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to fight back.</v>

99
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.821
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

100
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 2>it would see it always changes.</v>

102
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't do the same thing.</v>

103
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 2>It's called law of accommodation few night.</v>

104
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.851
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

105
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 2>if you and I grappled at the same rate all the time,</v>

106
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I would actually catch up to you.</v>

107
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

108
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 2>so you'd have to be able to maximize your potential and run me in the dirt.</v>

109
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you got to have two different days.</v>

110
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

111
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 2>you can't just do the same type of work all the time.</v>

112
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where a lot of projects go wrong.</v>

113
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.091
<v Speaker 2>They get word,</v>

114
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 2>he paced yourself too much.</v>

115
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 2>You see that before fighters,</v>

116
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

117
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.520
<v Speaker 2>the old fighters cover up and uh,</v>

118
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

120
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I watch fights all my life from Rudolph Roberto Duran and Muhammad,</v>

121
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.980
<v Speaker 2>our lab watched him and I'm sure you're,</v>

122
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be a big fight fan and you'd just see how some people get in a</v>

123
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 2>scheduled amount of work per it and that's when you can beat him.</v>

124
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Take him out like another word.</v>

125
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

126
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make you go at my pace,</v>

127
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>not you go with my opinion,</v>

128
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to follow your page.</v>

129
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 2>You'll make you feel mine.</v>

130
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 2>So varying the intensity of the training,</v>

131
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>varying how you do your training.</v>

132
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>You think that's very important?</v>

133
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.131
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>

134
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Hence the change all zone.</v>

135
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 2>So does it have to change all the time because the body just adapts and gets</v>

136
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:27.071
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>

137
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.904
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

138
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>As well as ask why the law of accommodation is you adapt to a training loader</v>

139
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.853
<v Speaker 2>stimulus.</v>

140
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't change it,</v>

141
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:34.661
<v Speaker 2>you get no better.</v>

142
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 2>You actually go backwards.</v>

143
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 2>So you can actually got to change these two meters.</v>

144
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Tom Does a lot of stuff of war barrels.</v>

145
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 2>We push where bells around for half a mile running,</v>

146

181
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>We decide what we're going to do that day cause she strengths measured in time.</v>

182
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not measured in weight.</v>

183
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 2>It's majored in time marrow,</v>

184
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 2>talking about velocities.</v>

185
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

186
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 2>so we just pick an exercise like for you,</v>

187
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 2>if we did a real low box squat,</v>

188
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 2>didn't take longer than squatting 800 pounds,</v>

189
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.540
<v Speaker 2>you're going to squat a inner band.</v>

190
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.830
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

191
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 2>you choked me out after a while.</v>

193
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

194
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Well if we run after a while,</v>

199
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.840

200
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.000
