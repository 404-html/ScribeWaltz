<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>

7
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.803
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>did you have products and stuff that's good to branch out,</v>

9
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:11.290
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

10
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll shit that I'm interested in.</v>

11
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.621
<v Speaker 1>just try it again.</v>

13
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

14
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I tried to keep myself interested.</v>

15
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:16.584
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>

16
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I feel different when I get excited about something like a new exercise or a new</v>

17
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>hobby I'm trying or anything.</v>

18
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I get excited when I'm in,</v>

19
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>so I try to spread that.</v>

20
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>As much as I can.</v>

22
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Cause I tried to think I want to get into other aspects of business.</v>

23
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's cool that you does stuff that,</v>

24
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>that you're interested in.</v>

25
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Because I like comedy,</v>

26
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I talk about this and my light comedy,</v>

27
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>but I understand that is fleeting.</v>

28
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>So if everything in comedy went away for you got supplements is shit.</v>

29
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think comedy is fleeting.</v>

31
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>He really thinks,</v>

32
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like one of the least fleeting leading.</v>

33
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just saying that's maintenance that it needs maiden,</v>

34
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>but thing is in the business like I'm talking about where you know stuff might</v>

35
00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:57.901
<v Speaker 1>be going well,</v>

36
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>but then you now work it as much anymore.</v>

37
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I got a theory about that was that I think that shits in the past.</v>

38
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

39
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's going to happen anymore.</v>

41
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I think guys would go away because they wouldn't get gigs anymore.</v>

42
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't get television shows.</v>

43
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:11.064
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't get all these things,</v>

44
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>but now everybody promotes themselves.</v>

45
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a Twitter account.</v>

46
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a website.</v>

47
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>

48
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>when you get fans now they know where they can find you.</v>

49
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>It used to be,</v>

50
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't on television way,</v>

51
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>where did he go?</v>

52
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Where is this guy?</v>

53
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:24.984
<v Speaker 1>Where did he go?</v>

54
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Vanished.</v>

55
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't just go to his Facebook page and read a blog that he wrote today.</v>

56
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking hilarious.</v>

57
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.031
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

58
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't go and watch a youtube clip that he made when he was fucking around</v>

59
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>his backyard with his dog.</v>

60
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.243
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

61
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>All that shit is new.</v>

62
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

63
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't confident.</v>

65
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally 100% confident.</v>

66
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>As confident.</v>

67
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.481
<v Speaker 1>You're going anywhere,</v>

68
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:43.121
<v Speaker 1>Hannibal Burress,</v>

69
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>but the top side and</v>

70
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>you've inspired me to give my tiny bottles of lotion for hotels business going</v>

71
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>because that's what I'm passionate about.</v>

72
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm passionate about tidy bottles of lotion and that seems like a stable</v>

73
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.471
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

74
00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>People use it.</v>

75
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I want to get in that.</v>

76
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>people do use it.</v>

78
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got to be selling them that shit.</v>

79
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

80
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a good point.</v>

81
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>And you have some better smelling stuff that a smell and stuff and maybe some</v>

82
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>jokes on the lotion.</v>

83
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

84
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.661
<v Speaker 1>Too funny though.</v>

85
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do jerking off with your lotion and cracking up.</v>

86
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.430
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

87
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:23.661
<v Speaker 1>Not that you don't want to use in the middle of it so you don't lose your</v>

89
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.570
<v Speaker 1>stroke.</v>

90
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.041
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to.</v>

91
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Dude loses his stroke when you go limp while jerking off.</v>

92
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

93
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>those are tough times,</v>

94
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>like getting it up again while you're jerking off.</v>

95
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>that's just a lot of work,</v>

97
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's just if you focused,</v>

98
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>if you really,</v>

99
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>if you've really about making it to your goal,</v>

100
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>then you just power through.</v>

101
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>

102
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>It seems frivolous,</v>

103
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just an exercise in achieving your goals.</v>

104
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Fall down nine times.</v>

107
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.540

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Get brain damage.</v>

109
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.470
<v Speaker 1>It sounded like you're hurt.</v>

110
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't just fall down nine times.</v>

138
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>You can't count that because you get to count lying down in bed then too.</v>
