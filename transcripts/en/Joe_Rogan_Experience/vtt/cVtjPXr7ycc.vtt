<v Speaker 1>Oh boy,</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience podcast is </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought to you by the fleshlight flush.</v>

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>It's more well known than dildos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no like one dildo company that's</v>

7
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>known as much as the flashlight is </v>
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put your wiener in winter.</v>

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's for fucking like it's not.</v>

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

12
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point of having a light?</v>

13
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a light.</v>

14
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>That was just a job with John half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron had a great joke about it should </v>

15
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>have a light because no one ever knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>where their flashlight in his,</v>

16
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but everyone always knows where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight is,</v>

17
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>which is very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really and very wood for the folks </v>

18
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.391
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian has just pulled the actual </v>

19
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>fleshlight I it at the bucket and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull it out.</v>

20
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Blanche opened her mouth and she has </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible fish.</v>

21
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the second you did that,</v>

22
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I smell that it was interactive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would be a dog who's sitting in her lap.</v>

23
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.600
<v Speaker 1>That's blanches a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's.</v>

24
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>She can smell anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I thought it was,</v>

25
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>this one's a bottle that's really tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>out essentially is right.</v>

26
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what you're asking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

27
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.730
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go both ways.</v>

28
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a fake one.</v>

29
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that defend you when you see like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake vagina to defend me.</v>

30
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Some people get offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some girls they don't like because you </v>

31
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>should be fucking me instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

32
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some girls,</v>

33
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needy girls.</v>

34
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>It probably would think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

35
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have some crazy girls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

37
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls are like,</v>

38
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>why do you need that?</v>

39
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such odd.</v>

40
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>They can get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You dudes have a.</v>

41
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ask her boyfriend.</v>

42
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ask you if you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a sex toy.</v>

43
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>We want to offer up any information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel free.</v>

44
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Ready now go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you this.</v>

45
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't prescribe to that ideology </v>

46
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>because I feel that it will set you up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for disappointment.</v>

47
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Like no man is ever going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move as rapidly as a vibrator.</v>

48
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>So I just completely abstain from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's fine.</v>

49
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>I've been given like I'll do shows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vehicle get out free dildos and it's</v>

50
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:13.581
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing to walk out of there with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hose and like one time for my birthday a</v>

51
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 1>comic came and he bought like a bag of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex toys and you know,</v>

52
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>your parents come to visit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't want that around and I </v>

53
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>just don't.</v>

54
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

55
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather feel less good most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to get that added.</v>

56
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like a squid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to Joe Rogan.net.</v>

57
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:37.971
<v Speaker 1>Click on the link for the fleshlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enter the code name Rogan and you will </v>

58
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:37.971
<v Speaker 1>get 15 percent off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going.</v>

59
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Sorry Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know a tip that we've never thought </v>

60
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could only have to buy the vagina,</v>

61
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 1>a version of the flashlight because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side does have something that </v>

62
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>looks like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least an asshole enough that.</v>

63
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't fit into the thing,</v>

64
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:55.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to have a different sort of </v>

65
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:55.611
<v Speaker 1>setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can make your own probably.</v>

66
00:02:55.611 --> 00:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to have some sort of a </v>

67
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>different face to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The what you're saying essentially.</v>

69
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is it doesn't have to</v>

70
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>be one or the other.</v>

71
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>It should be both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>You should have it on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

73
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>like a real woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be in a weird.</v>

75
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right next to each other.</v>

76
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.590
<v Speaker 1>We didn't only work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

77
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean just make a flashlight that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on your.</v>

78
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>If you're on your side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're next to each other.</v>

79
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not like this.</v>

80
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Just make a flashlight that you can fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides that has caps on both sides.</v>

81
00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>It just caught like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

82
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>my saber instead like a light saber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

83
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

84
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally got a good idea.</v>

85
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying is it should be two </v>
<v Speaker 1>sided,</v>

86
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>like the butthole should be one option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I feel like sometimes I feel </v>

87
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.471
<v Speaker 1>like a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they don't see what you're </v>

88
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:40.471
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel you.</v>

89
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel you on this.</v>

90
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Would that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that one would cost more than </v>

91
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

92
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.211
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much more I really want a superior </v>

93
00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:51.211
<v Speaker 1>product you'd be putting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

94
00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>the fleshlight as it stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid product,</v>

95
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Brian and I give it two thumbs up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be a subscription base,</v>

96
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:58.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can just like have it,</v>

97
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you get 20 bucks a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have any flashlight you want and</v>

98
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:06.020
<v Speaker 1>then when you cancel it you have to send</v>
<v Speaker 1>them all back of legislator.</v>

99
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.030
<v Speaker 1>The month club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never trust the fact that the one that </v>

100
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.410

<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

<v Speaker 1>because it's part,</v>

102
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:19.141
<v Speaker 1>it's part of a prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should live up to its name </v>

103
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:19.490
<v Speaker 1>and like a carnival game.</v>

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my office man.</v>

119
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>A studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just threw up some pictures and needed</v>

120
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some life on the walls.</v>

121
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I had accumulated a bunch of cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures but done nothing with them.</v>

122
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And then finally I put them up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking room was like right out of </v>

123
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>hoarders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now though.</v>

124
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

125
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>It goes above the litter box to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's true.</v>

126
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the components you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:30.451
<v Speaker 1>My cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knows she doesn't really like to be </v>

128
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:30.451
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>at night than in my office.</v>

130
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's like my kids are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering around the place my kids don't</v>

131
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>wander around is in my office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I figured,</v>

132
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:42.781
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should just keep to her box in my </v>

133
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:42.781
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who should bite the bullet?</v>

134
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It's so gross though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smelling cat shit all day,</v>

135
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gross.</v>

136
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get in there and open the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>and scoop it out and flush it and my cat</v>

137
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:54.060
<v Speaker 1>waits until I'm there to take the nasty </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

138
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Like she waits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know she does because I'll come home </v>

139
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>and I'm checking my email and I hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch,</v>

140
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch them.</v>

141
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Like oh you little bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she just drops a fucking stinker.</v>

142
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I had something worse happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Mike had recently was sick and had </v>

143
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>like some kind of urinary track </v>
<v Speaker 1>infection I guess.</v>

144
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.230
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to get a cranberry juice for </v>

145
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.230
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing.</v>

146
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to give cranberry juice to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cad work.</v>

147
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a good news and bad news.</v>

148
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Urinary tract infection gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was trying,</v>

149
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it started doing that horrible shit were</v>
<v Speaker 1>just start peeing because it couldn't </v>

150
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.841
<v Speaker 1>control itself and it did it in my bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over my head and Cat pee if you know</v>

151
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>anything about canopy and NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked really nice fucking bed</v>

152
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>and now it's just most like happy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've washed it,</v>

153
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>scrubbed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything.</v>

154
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:49.691
<v Speaker 1>So I'm about to find something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>smells worse than copy just because I'm </v>

155
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>so sick of that cat pee smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunate,</v>

156
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:56.831
<v Speaker 1>but you got to get rid of the mattress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mattress that you can get that stuff</v>

157
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>that they sell at your in gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't really work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in,</v>

159
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it works a little sort of what it</v>

160
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

161
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Is it some sort of citrus base thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

162
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>it breaks down the smell of cat urine to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain extent,</v>

163
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's is like glitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's never gonna go away.</v>

164
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>When you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you,</v>

165
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>your grandparents were like mind with </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandparents.</v>

166
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.910
<v Speaker 1>They start shitting in a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it really fucking smells awful </v>

167
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>like old people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit is like the worst drugs in it.</v>

168

<v Speaker 1>like they're dying probably the diet,</v>

<v Speaker 1>take shuts and there would be a spell of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like air freshener in the air that was </v>

172
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>like the most offensive smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The air freshener cover up over shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All these things are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nootropics,</v>

182
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.140
<v Speaker 1>nootropics are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in and they're </v>

183
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:20.140
<v Speaker 1>essentially vitamins and nutrients for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>

184
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I really believe in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they work.</v>

185
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 1>there's scientific studies that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do right now.</v>

187
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already discussed this was a double </v>

188
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo,</v>

189
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>double blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it means.</v>

190
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:37.000
<v Speaker 1>The most stringent scientific tests they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can for figuring out whether or not </v>

191
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>people's performances are improved with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mood's improved.</v>

192
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking.</v>

193
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:45.251
<v Speaker 1>Some people will take a placebo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people will take a combination of </v>

194
00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:45.890
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people will take Alpha brain on its</v>

195
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:48.340
<v Speaker 1>own and we'll see what the results are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

196
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>I have been taking nootropics for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

197
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in it before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy anything,</v>

198
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>just google it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just google the idea.</v>

199
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of really fascinating </v>

200
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.240
<v Speaker 1>papers and different things that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been written on them and there's proof </v>

201
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 1>that some of them actually can help </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with Alzheimer's.</v>

202
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It's really their nutrients for the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind functions couldn't hurt.</v>

203
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to take five htp if </v>

204
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>you're on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>those people are ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>

206
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Totally thought you were just going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the best show ever.</v>

207
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Is there a reason why they decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the triple blind?</v>

208
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.130
<v Speaker 1>They just don't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that means is there is a triple </v>

209
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>blind as to blinds enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You greedy bitch.</v>

210
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As always say,</v>

211
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.430
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

212
00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I take all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's shroom,</v>

213
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 1>tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune.</v>

214
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It's great for your immune system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually somehow or another,</v>

215
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:48.951
<v Speaker 1>it's a mushroom that tricks your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>into thinking that it's a potentially </v>

216
00:09:48.951 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 1>like a bug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cold,</v>

217
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 1>and so your immune system fires up for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight that never takes place.</v>

218
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

219
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

220
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.360
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an immune system booster and probiotics </v>

221
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.631
<v Speaker 1>is something that we don't sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the things that I </v>

222
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:04.491
<v Speaker 1>really recommend if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a person who really cares </v>

223
00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:07.311
<v Speaker 1>about your health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the cool things you can do is </v>

224
00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>enhance your health with organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live organisms,</v>

225
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kombucha tea.</v>

226
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

227
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 1>that stuff is excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep you from getting sick.</v>

228
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

229
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:21.411
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives me an enhanced feeling of </v>

230
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:23.571
<v Speaker 1>wellness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like taking in like healthy </v>

231
00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:23.571
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also take acidophilus.</v>

232
00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:24.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if,</v>

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what grass specific list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we were designed to only eat </v>

247
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.281
<v Speaker 1>grass grass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have these pointy teeth.</v>

248
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that was for like digging big </v>

249
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>things out of the ground compared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We have the most bitch ass teeth ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.180
<v Speaker 1>They're like these little fragile flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

252
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.770
<v Speaker 1>They're designed to chew mushy food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how we eat other animals that are</v>

253
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 1>designed to actually hold onto things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then eat those things,</v>

254
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.160
<v Speaker 1>tear them apart and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at like a,</v>

255

<v Speaker 1>when you live with an animal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>half and eat them.</v>

261
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I haven't got to talk to her for a short</v>

318
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:23.010
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a,</v>

319
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 2>we sat down for about an hour and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about,</v>

320
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 2>she talked a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

321
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 2>She had a really good point about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>people look at the government.</v>

322
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a benevolent father and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely agree with that.</v>

323
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

324
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 2>And she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

326
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 2>She stuck her neck out and she was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that show.</v>

327
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Like a chicken</v>

328
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.430
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

329
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Well she got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got it.</v>

330
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Trumbull</v>

331
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:47.670
<v Speaker 2>and the view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

332
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry she got in trouble in the view</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was um,</v>

333
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 2>she was talking</v>

334
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.130
<v Speaker 1>about nine slash 11 and she was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about tower seven and if you don't know </v>

335
00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.091
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's three towers fell on September </v>

336
00:15:01.091 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 1>11 and two of them obviously I got hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>by planes,</v>

337
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.430
<v Speaker 1>but one of them went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them just went down and there's </v>

338
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 1>the crazy conspiracy theories that say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a controlled demolition.</v>

339
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Now I am the first person to tell you I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am no engineer.</v>

340
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea how buildings are built </v>
<v Speaker 1>or what their tolerances are.</v>

341
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>But if I saw a building like that and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I saw just catch on fire and it had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>holes in it and shit,</v>

343
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.850
<v Speaker 1>but it just felt like that black bitch </v>
<v Speaker 1>apps,</v>

344
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 1>you build this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did you build this?</v>

345
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

346
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Really is what kind of Shitty work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to go down.</v>

347
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was saying it was.</v>

348
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people believe it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled demolition.</v>

349
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think necessarily she is saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is or it isn't.</v>

350
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>And I certainly am not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

351
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I believe more.</v>

352
00:15:43.801 --> 00:15:45.620
<v Speaker 1>It was a controlled demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

353
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 1>But with a by us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

354
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

355
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:53.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's always been the case of </v>

356
00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:53.081
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument.</v>

357
00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:53.081
<v Speaker 1>They don't think it was done by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists.</v>

358
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.140
<v Speaker 1>They think let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No building the tear.</v>

359
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:56.590
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

360
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.560
<v Speaker 1>What if the terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh Oh,</v>

361
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>they did a controlled demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like if somehow they had tea </v>

362
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.050
<v Speaker 1>because I probably could easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would probably be before </v>

363
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 1>hijacking planes and flying them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings before that would be putting a</v>

364
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:14.270
<v Speaker 1>bomb in a building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that easy.</v>

365
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:19.271
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you see what happened in </v>

366
00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma City that was multiple bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

367
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 1>in Oklahoma City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually,</v>

368
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.990
<v Speaker 1>there was all these reports of the FBI </v>
<v Speaker 1>removing bombs from the building like </v>

369
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 1>that didn't explode.</v>

370
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you talk to these guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition experts,</v>

371
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:31.820
<v Speaker 1>they say there's no way that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fertilizer bomb.</v>

372
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that.</v>

373
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:39.611
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the amount of damage that</v>
<v Speaker 1>did and look at where the blast radius </v>

374
00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 1>is from the way it blows out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't blow the.</v>

375
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 1>They're not designed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying spelling because we've all</v>

376
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:50.351
<v Speaker 1>seen the loose change where you watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lights go off around the building </v>

377
00:16:50.351 --> 00:16:51.400
<v Speaker 1>one floor by one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

378
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see they don't see.</v>

379
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what that means though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That also could be.</v>

380
00:16:56.991 --> 00:17:01.040
<v Speaker 1>If the ceiling is coming in and slamming</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the floor,</v>

381
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.030
<v Speaker 1>all the windows would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that that's explosions.</v>

382
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:10.031
<v Speaker 1>If it really was collapsing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See no one's ever seen a building </v>

383
00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:14.141
<v Speaker 1>collapsed like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they say that those are blips </v>

384
00:17:14.141 --> 00:17:17.021
<v Speaker 1>and those are squibs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that because then I'm </v>

385
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:17.021
<v Speaker 1>saying you're.</v>

386
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:18.230
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you know for sure what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is and I'm saying the fuck you do.</v>

387
00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the.</v>

388
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just because someone has to </v>

389
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it was as.</v>

390
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it was an inside job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems odd ergonomically that you</v>

391
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:28.990
<v Speaker 1>would design a building that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>impacted.</v>

392
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire thing would demolish what </v>

393
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.400
<v Speaker 1>structurally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What purpose does that serve?</v>

394
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

395
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird.</v>

396
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could just be in competence.</v>

397
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at humans,</v>

398
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:40.970
<v Speaker 1>that's our most likely option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

399
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:45.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean when did they make the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade center so fucking long ass time </v>

400
00:17:45.971 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 1>ago to get so cocky to build a building </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 100 God damn stories high.</v>

401
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.060
<v Speaker 1>And how long did they think that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>good?</v>

402
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Stay up there for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.830
<v Speaker 1>what if it started falling apart or </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotting what it was,</v>

404
00:17:53.831 --> 00:17:56.710
<v Speaker 1>it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a wonky piece of shit by the time I</v>

405
00:17:56.711 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 1>got hit by those planes.</v>

406
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally true.</v>

407
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucking thing was oldest </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

408
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 1>That thing was around as black and white</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

409
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Jessica Lange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Kong.</v>

410
00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

411
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:11.631
<v Speaker 1>but what's retrofit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the cheapest goddamn floor and the </v>

412
00:18:11.631 --> 00:18:11.631
<v Speaker 1>cheapest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bitter,</v>

413
00:18:11.631 --> 00:18:16.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tells you that how many floors was </v>

414
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 1>fitted with bombs maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the crazy idea.</v>

415
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:19.680
<v Speaker 1>What W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're saying about a building seven</v>

416
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:24.681
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other building that terrorists </v>

417
00:18:24.681 --> 00:18:24.681
<v Speaker 1>could have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

418
00:18:24.681 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I guess they could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how the fuck are they going to get </v>

419
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>in there and put all those explosives </v>
<v Speaker 1>in?</v>

420
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It's dynamite a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Sticks of dynamite.</v>

421
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:32.850
<v Speaker 1>One up your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're working the fucking thing.</v>

422
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Five years everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking putting it into this </v>

423
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.970
<v Speaker 1>closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>

424
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Back then they didn't have security that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks.</v>

425
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:45.270
<v Speaker 1>You're walking down the hallway and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just smell shit.</v>

426
00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Open this door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's in this smells like shit and it's</v>

427
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.160
<v Speaker 1>just shitty dynamite state.</v>

428
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking log house built with</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and dynamite sticks and little </v>

429
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>hairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pee mattress.</v>

430
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.200
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that know that somebody had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something in Oklahoma City on the </v>

431
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:08.380
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

432
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.790
<v Speaker 1>what she said on the view was it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only building in history that never.</v>

433
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:16.190
<v Speaker 1>That collapsed skyscraper that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit by a plane and she's.</v>

434
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.170
<v Speaker 1>She's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

435
00:19:17.171 --> 00:19:17.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

436
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.210
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

437
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and it was the only building in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a skyscraper of its kind that fell from </v>

438
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.101
<v Speaker 1>a fire and she's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it needs anything </v>

439
00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:28.101
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could could be incompetence.</v>

440
00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:32.540
<v Speaker 1>It could be just some crazy coincidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it actually did fall apart like a </v>

441
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.011
<v Speaker 1>controlled demolition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it wasn't a controlled </v>

442
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:37.011
<v Speaker 1>demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>

443
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:37.011
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

444
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:41.391
<v Speaker 1>I think there's so much chaos involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any sort of catastrophic situation </v>

445
00:19:41.391 --> 00:19:43.950
<v Speaker 1>like that and all these reports we heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosions in the building.</v>

446
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really remember what you saw?</v>

447
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much.</v>

448
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.040
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of nuttiness going on when,</v>

449
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.550
<v Speaker 1>when right after something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

450
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.120
<v Speaker 1>you might want to remember something </v>
<v Speaker 1>from before you might.</v>

451
00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 1>You must be so jolted from that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a situation that after it's over,</v>

452
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:00.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

453
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:05.991
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there would be several </v>

454
00:20:05.991 --> 00:20:05.991
<v Speaker 1>people that would have distorted </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

455
00:20:05.991 --> 00:20:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that everyone can </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle truly traumatic incidents.</v>

456
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not claiming and I can more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

457
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

458
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:17.421
<v Speaker 1>I don't think most people can handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really crazy shit going down and </v>

459
00:20:17.421 --> 00:20:20.860
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust a few people's memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where were we?</v>

460
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 1>You got to take it into consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't totally trust it.</v>

461
00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 4>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of trauma that contributes to</v>

462
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:32.430
<v Speaker 4>a confabulation about whether you saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>something or not.</v>

463
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can take those reports all day and I</v>

464
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 4>think there's that mob mentality like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>heard sounds.</v>

465
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so did I.</v>

466
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what creeps me out with always with </v>

467
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.460
<v Speaker 4>American people out and this is how you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get minor conspiracy theorists.</v>

468
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 4>Not even sure if I am one is when there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is no explanation by</v>

469
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 5>your all powerful government and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what leads people to think,</v>

470
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:56.611
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the government was in on it because </v>

471
00:20:56.611 --> 00:20:57.901
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to be the American </v>

472
00:20:57.901 --> 00:20:57.901
<v Speaker 5>government and you don't have an idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>how this happened.</v>

473
00:20:57.901 --> 00:20:59.770
<v Speaker 5>That's when people start to feel unsafe </v>
<v Speaker 5>and get nervous.</v>

474
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 5>When they had bin Laden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't take any pictures.</v>

475
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not One.</v>

476
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 5>I believe they caught him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just odd when there's no answers.</v>

477
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:10.210
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not sure.</v>

478
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 5>JFK.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird thing.</v>

479
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.920
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you not have an answer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to military people,</v>

480
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:19.921
<v Speaker 5>just straight up military people about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Osama bin Laden thing and every one </v>

481
00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:22.090
<v Speaker 5>of them has said that guy was dead for </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

482
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 5>Every one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a couple people that were </v>

483
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:34.861
<v Speaker 5>skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet that where you would have valued </v>

484
00:21:34.861 --> 00:21:34.861
<v Speaker 5>their opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

485
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 5>I bet they fucking tortured him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

486
00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 5>and for years people telling dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

487
00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:43.840
<v Speaker 5>right wing straight lace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't the war.</v>

488
00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 5>Military guys there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

489
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.080
<v Speaker 5>that guy's been dead for years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet his own pee.</v>

490
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're scaled.</v>

491
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 5>I think you've just because you have put</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of bombs somewhere.</v>

492
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:58.291
<v Speaker 5>These are not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not using like biophysics to </v>

493
00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:01.141
<v Speaker 5>kill anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think his own probably friendly </v>

494
00:22:01.141 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 5>fire probably blew himself up on fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>accident.</v>

495
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.540
<v Speaker 5>They might've just fucking crashed one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of their helicopters and this was their </v>

496
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:06.910
<v Speaker 5>crazy cover story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might have fucked up,</v>

497
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 5>crashed when their helicopters and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen boys,</v>

498
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 5>you see lemons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ice lemonade.</v>

499
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:17.210
<v Speaker 5>Here's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crashed a helicopter because we killed </v>

500
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 5>Osama bin Ladin.</v>

501
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

502
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.320
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We lost a billion dollar helicopter.</v>

503
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:21.490
<v Speaker 5>Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

504
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 5>We're going to blow that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

505
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 5>Brave soldiers survived that crash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got it.</v>

506
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.060
<v Speaker 5>We got them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got them.</v>

507
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Speaker 5>We got only dumped him and see we dumped</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

508
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:31.480
<v Speaker 5>It's because we do want to make them </v>
<v Speaker 5>harder.</v>

509
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.800
<v Speaker 5>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're telling everybody you shot him.</v>

510
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.100
<v Speaker 5>It's just an it in visual form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the same as you fucking </v>

511
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.041
<v Speaker 5>admitting it with your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The president getting on TV with his </v>

512
00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:45.520
<v Speaker 5>fucking mouth and admitting it </v>
<v Speaker 5>seriously.</v>

513
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:47.590
<v Speaker 5>He's looking at the camera and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying it.</v>

514
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:50.980
<v Speaker 5>We killed ourselves like we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make him a martyr woody.</v>

515
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:55.990
<v Speaker 5>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There has to be a visual representation </v>

516
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.531
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be something I would have </v>

517
00:22:58.531 --> 00:22:58.630
<v Speaker 5>liked to have seen footage like his face</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you have for us,</v>

518
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.160
<v Speaker 5>but not for them.</v>

519
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Them saying that they're excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they don't want them to be a </v>

520
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.801
<v Speaker 5>martyr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then why the fuck are you admitting you </v>

521
00:23:07.801 --> 00:23:09.661
<v Speaker 5>killed him on TV?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are you getting there wasn't a </v>

522
00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:12.751
<v Speaker 5>Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want the reason they didn't </v>

523
00:23:12.751 --> 00:23:14.340
<v Speaker 5>bury him or do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want them to be a site that </v>

524
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.501
<v Speaker 5>people could go to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reason why they didn't show any </v>

525
00:23:16.501 --> 00:23:16.501
<v Speaker 5>photos is because they didn't want them </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be a martyr as well.</v>

526
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.960
<v Speaker 5>I think that's because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>any photos that epic would it have been </v>

527
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.530
<v Speaker 5>if Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

528
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.590
<v Speaker 5>we've captured and killed Osama bin </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ladin,</v>

529
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.130
<v Speaker 5>but before we did our gis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>each had a turn fucking him in the mouth</v>

530
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 5>and thanks to flip cam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have it all on our youtube page.</v>

531
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.480
<v Speaker 5>Fuck some crazy old terrorists in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mouth.</v>

532
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 5>Very soft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought guys like to do that.</v>

533
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:48.121
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so disturbing seeing that other </v>

534
00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:48.121
<v Speaker 5>guy get captured</v>

535
00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 1>and dragged through the streets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked in the ass Kadafi.</v>

536
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 1>That was so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am good as a stick apparently.</v>

537
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the.</v>

538
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I did something for that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there were a picture we wouldn't</v>

539
00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:00.230
<v Speaker 1>have shown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>

540
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 1>We don't show graphic things like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our people don't like to see that.</v>

541
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 1>We don't like to see death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like people to die and so on.</v>

542
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.220
<v Speaker 1>We want to completely lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see it ever again.</v>

543
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

544
00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:16.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is you get access to </v>

545
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 1>something really shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not really happening.</v>

546
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.180
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you in watching anybody get </v>

547
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:22.180
<v Speaker 1>murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching anybody get fucked up,</v>

548
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:22.910
<v Speaker 1>you have access to something life </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing,</v>

549
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:28.150
<v Speaker 1>but you're not really there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird when you can just access </v>

550
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.941
<v Speaker 1>that all the time because then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting influenced by far more than you </v>

551
00:24:30.941 --> 00:24:31.290
<v Speaker 1>would in a normal life where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually survive.</v>

552
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Also desensitizes us as a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're desensitized to war.</v>

553
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 1>We have all of our video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our media,</v>

554
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:37.970
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like war.</v>

555
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Very few of us have actually will call </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper class,</v>

556
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.970
<v Speaker 1>upper middle class have actually been </v>
<v Speaker 1>made privy to anything tangentially </v>

557
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:49.220
<v Speaker 1>related to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very easy to be like,</v>

558
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:54.221
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just send some troops and I've </v>

559
00:24:54.221 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 1>been to Israel just on vacation and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking hot.</v>

560
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:59.801
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just imagine being over there like </v>

561
00:24:59.801 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 1>with all like we have no frame of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference because we're so desensitized </v>

562
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:03.710
<v Speaker 1>were detached from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

563
00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:08.711
<v Speaker 1>It's not a part of our daily lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have friends and loved ones </v>

564
00:25:08.711 --> 00:25:08.711
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

565
00:25:08.711 --> 00:25:13.050
<v Speaker 1>watched something on tv or where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the amount of money that </v>

566
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.031
<v Speaker 1>it caused to air condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tense and Afghanistan is fucking </v>

567
00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 1>crazy in Iraq and some insane about it.</v>

568
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like billions of dollars in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

569
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.020
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy to keep the AC on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

570
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.180
<v Speaker 1>they're just leading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is nuts.</v>

571
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts that they talk people into it.</v>

572
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.800
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still going on to send troops over.</v>

573
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.430
<v Speaker 1>We're living in a Gi joe movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

574
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.460
<v Speaker 1>He will even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get goosebumps thinking about it at </v>

575
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.101
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it resonates so deeply </v>

576
00:25:45.101 --> 00:25:45.101
<v Speaker 1>with me to think about our troops over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

577
00:25:45.101 --> 00:25:49.421
<v Speaker 1>I think because you're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my country so much that I just </v>

578
00:25:49.421 --> 00:25:53.501
<v Speaker 1>want like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just love my country and anything </v>

579
00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:53.501
<v Speaker 1>having to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

580
00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 1>It's all standing on all my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to be in a patriotic commercial.</v>

581
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you drive a chevy truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blazer?</v>

582
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Everyone thought I was a lesbian for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>longest time.</v>

583
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.610
<v Speaker 1>He plays it for 10 years.</v>

584
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I drove it out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

585
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

586
00:26:06.401 --> 00:26:08.390
<v Speaker 1>the idea of what America is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

587
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.590
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

588
00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people here.</v>

589
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 1>A lot of cool people come from America </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

590
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>But there's also a lot of clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

591
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:17.930
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that represents America as well.</v>

592
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 1>we're doing the shit that we do around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

594
00:26:23.841 --> 00:26:28.841
<v Speaker 1>It's just creepy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also do great things in life,</v>

595
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.010
<v Speaker 1>better for us to be on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some,</v>

596
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.690
<v Speaker 1>some wacky countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

597
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 1>And we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only ones will take your land.</v>

598
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>We'll give it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we'll make reparations.</v>

600
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 1>We were the only ones with a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious about the Indians.</v>

601
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>We</v>

602
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.790
<v Speaker 5>give land back to American Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gave him some,</v>

603
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.200
<v Speaker 5>given the shittiest spots where there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>no deer like Vegas go.</v>

<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 5>11 different Indian.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They can go eat at a restaurant.</v>

608
00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:02.680
<v Speaker 5>You don't need to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the Indians and I'm like,</v>

612
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:13.461

<v Speaker 5>living humans who I know they've </v>

613
00:27:13.461 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 5>benefited from the shitty work of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>past,</v>

628
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 5>but it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>of your check in order to catch it early</v>
<v Speaker 5>of your soul.</v>

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.630
<v Speaker 5>That's like they're into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

634
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.270
<v Speaker 5>There's actually been some talk that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to release the photos of a</v>

635
00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 5>Sama bin Ladin and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

636
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:21.171
<v Speaker 5>And it's like so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm thinking like how long did </v>

637
00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:21.171
<v Speaker 5>it take to make Avatar?</v>

638
00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:21.810
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not the same time.</v>

639
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.350
<v Speaker 5>They've probably got some better </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology that Pixar probably has.</v>

640
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:28.410
<v Speaker 5>Like we have this whole vip section that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't talk funny.</v>

641
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.920
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine if one day there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>cameras that don't just capture a two d </v>

642
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.091
<v Speaker 5>version of what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but somehow or another they figure out </v>

643
00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:40.410
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a camera that can actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>capture three dimensional video that you</v>

644
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:43.650
<v Speaker 5>can walk around inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll create holograms,</v>

645
00:28:43.651 --> 00:28:48.651
<v Speaker 5>like really potent holograms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could actually be there standing </v>

646
00:28:48.651 --> 00:28:53.151
<v Speaker 5>right there next to the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why they killed Osama bin Ladin press </v>

647
00:28:53.151 --> 00:28:53.510
<v Speaker 5>play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

648
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

649
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.360
<v Speaker 5>that's entirely within the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility.</v>

650
00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:59.160
<v Speaker 5>If we can create what we can create </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>

651
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:04.310
<v Speaker 5>I know it's way more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's what we're doing right now is </v>

652
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.520
<v Speaker 5>already impossible to us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

653
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:10.521
<v Speaker 5>I don't see any reason why they can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>come up with some really intense high </v>

654
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:15.771
<v Speaker 5>definition hologram type shit and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>financial reality where you can walk </v>

655
00:29:15.771 --> 00:29:19.461
<v Speaker 5>around in the scene like you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually probably do.</v>

656
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.790
<v Speaker 5>I think American.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

657
00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.240
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would line up for that.</v>

658
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:26.170
<v Speaker 5>Just keep that in Tennessee somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

659
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.320
<v Speaker 5>It's like call of duty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with stopping.</v>

660
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.760
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever been in places like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Tennessee or West Virginia and I spent </v>

661
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.890
<v Speaker 5>Christmas in Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Virginia,</v>

662
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:39.300
<v Speaker 5>Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>backwoods Virginia.</v>

663
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing having Christmas?</v>

664
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.490
<v Speaker 5>Do you know somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>

665
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.500
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a friend from there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was that like?</v>

666
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to the APA Maddix Maddix.</v>

667
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 5>What's in that courthouse?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the civil war.</v>

668
00:29:57.431 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 5>It's like this tiny went to a civil war </v>
<v Speaker 5>gift shop,</v>

669
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.420
<v Speaker 5>which is not really civil war gift shop </v>
<v Speaker 5>as much as this dude just ordered a </v>

670
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:06.420
<v Speaker 5>bunch of shit with confederate flags on </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

671
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.890
<v Speaker 5>So you have like a bathing suit or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

672
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.920
<v Speaker 5>Homework.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really like all small towns in </v>

673
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.050
<v Speaker 5>America are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The more southern you get,</v>

674
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:19.350
<v Speaker 5>the less teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part most of America </v>

675
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.631
<v Speaker 5>looks the same and amazing that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>some assholes out there that are still </v>

676
00:30:21.631 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 5>fighting that war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it heritage not hate.</v>

677
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 5>That's what it says under the </v>
<v Speaker 5>confederate flag because I understand it</v>

678
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 5>means something to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I'm a black person it's still.</v>

679
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.240
<v Speaker 5>That's like a swastika could mean peace </v>
<v Speaker 5>and was it jainism?</v>

680
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.890
<v Speaker 5>But most people are like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of a shitty thing.</v>

681
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The swastika is a very good point.</v>

682
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one believes that.</v>

683
00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:42.550
<v Speaker 5>It means peace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the general of that though.</v>

684
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:46.210
<v Speaker 5>Like who's the guy in charge of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate the kid rock.</v>

685
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.720
<v Speaker 5>He's from Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

686
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird thing that you get as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>south of the north.</v>

687
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 5>The North and the south are still at </v>
<v Speaker 5>odds in some spots.</v>

688
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:03.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They still use terms like Yankees and </v>

689
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:03.330
<v Speaker 5>they get angry if your Yankee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They deal.</v>

690
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:07.530
<v Speaker 5>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird because we don't have that </v>

691
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:07.530
<v Speaker 5>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a clear,</v>

692
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.351
<v Speaker 5>the conquer and the conquered northern </v>
<v Speaker 5>as we don't have that problem with like </v>

693
00:31:10.351 --> 00:31:11.740
<v Speaker 5>we like southern accents sound </v>
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated,</v>

694
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.850
<v Speaker 5>sound hot southern accent makes someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>sounds a man of taste and culture.</v>

695
00:31:20.591 --> 00:31:25.591
<v Speaker 5>Who appreciates the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hear Amanda Tasting called Georgia </v>

696
00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:28.620
<v Speaker 5>Southern Gentlemen as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

697
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.930
<v Speaker 5>Texas?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

698
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.180
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Long drawn out thing.</v>

699
00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.140
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

700
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to Walmart to get some of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

701
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:39.040
<v Speaker 5>but there's also in the dudes that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligent than have that accent.</v>

702
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:44.041
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those things and one of the </v>

703
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:46.021
<v Speaker 5>appeals of Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that that Texas accent was </v>

704
00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:46.021
<v Speaker 5>fucking cool.</v>

705
00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:47.020
<v Speaker 5>It's cool here and people from Texas </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk,</v>

706
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:52.590
<v Speaker 5>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Texas is one of the coolest ways to </v>

707
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.590
<v Speaker 5>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really believed that he'd been.</v>

708
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:56.691
<v Speaker 5>It depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is for anything where you're </v>

709
00:31:56.691 --> 00:31:57.690
<v Speaker 5>from because there's a Texas accent and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then if you're from Dallas.</v>

710
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.880
<v Speaker 5>To me it's this very preachy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just.</v>

711
00:32:00.881 --> 00:32:02.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm reminded of my teachers that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

712
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:03.770
<v Speaker 5>no ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you cannot get it.</v>

713
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's just me.</v>

714
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.400
<v Speaker 5>Did anybody ever do anything to you in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dallas and you drive through,</v>

715
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:11.600
<v Speaker 5>just stuck in your head like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

716
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 5>there's certain states of mind that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>entrap in certain areas.</v>

717
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 5>Like for the longest time I would go by </v>
<v Speaker 5>my high school in Newton,</v>

718
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.660
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts and I would drive by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>high school and I'd be paranoid,</v>

719
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.700
<v Speaker 5>panicked thinking that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the I missed a class and they're going </v>

720
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.201
<v Speaker 5>to drag me back in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to get my diploma and I'm </v>

721
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:31.350
<v Speaker 5>fucked and I have to go back to school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like being from there.</v>

722
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.480
<v Speaker 5>Being from Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think of that teacher talks to you </v>

723
00:32:36.661 --> 00:32:38.170
<v Speaker 5>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't like Jews.</v>

724
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever have a teacher actually say</v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

725
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I did have a friend who,</v>

726
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:48.650
<v Speaker 5>this is my really old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got out unscathed for the most part.</v>

727
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.770
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend who told me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

728
00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:55.980
<v Speaker 5>we were like best friends her with </v>
<v Speaker 5>summer and she told me one day we were </v>

729
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 5>like playing and it was like five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she goes,</v>

730
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.080
<v Speaker 5>if you don't accept Jesus Christ as your</v>
<v Speaker 5>personal Lord and Savior,</v>

731
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:05.110
<v Speaker 5>you are going to go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I guess I had seen a movie recently </v>

732
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 5>that had this wild,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we were like six,</v>

733
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:10.150
<v Speaker 5>five or probably five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I guess I had seen a movie in my </v>

734
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:11.030
<v Speaker 5>automatic response was I have naked </v>
<v Speaker 5>pictures of your mother.</v>

735
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.220
<v Speaker 5>I had heard it like on a movie or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

736
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:18.460
<v Speaker 5>Her mom calls my mom now allows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>said something inappropriate about </v>

737
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.020
<v Speaker 5>having naked pictures of me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My mom was like,</v>

738
00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 5>well to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you told your daughter,</v>

739
00:33:23.781 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 5>told my daughter she was going to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And her answer,</v>

740
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:28.230
<v Speaker 5>her response was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

741
00:33:28.231 --> 00:33:29.660
<v Speaker 5>well we'll have to talk to her about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

742
00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:31.820
<v Speaker 5>She's not supposed to start witness </v>
<v Speaker 5>until she's older.</v>

743
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.130
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

744
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:39.290
<v Speaker 5>We have supposed to start witnessing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

745
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.540
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think of things like that?</v>

746
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 5>Not Southern Gentleman.</v>

747
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

748
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:48.530

<v Speaker 5>but it's also a Jonbenet Ramsey from.</v>

750
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is where that happened.</v>

751
00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:00.490
<v Speaker 5>I still think of hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't think of Dallas in that </v>

752
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:01.780
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

753
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.790
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a perfect combination of southern </v>

754
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.210
<v Speaker 5>charm with money in a snotty attic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the Hollywood of Texas.</v>

755
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.600
<v Speaker 5>They're the people of Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

756
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:12.890
<v Speaker 5>I love Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>new Cambie.</v>

757
00:34:12.891 --> 00:34:15.470
<v Speaker 5>It's got a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the hardest part of yours,</v>

758
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.230
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had more semi black out.</v>

759
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 5>Even the whole state of Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We used to do that.</v>

760
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Addison Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My God.</v>

761
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with Joey Diaz.</v>

762
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:29.270
<v Speaker 5>They'll place was chaos and addison was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the only.</v>

763
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:34.330
<v Speaker 5>This is not no one cares,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but addison was the only county within </v>

764
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.300
<v Speaker 5>Dallas where you could drink for a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>long time,</v>

765
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.780
<v Speaker 5>like in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that was World War II.</v>

766
00:34:37.781 --> 00:34:42.781
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like parents have these special </v>

767
00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:42.781
<v Speaker 5>tickets.</v>

768

<v Speaker 5>You had to have something now it has all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bars,</v>

769
00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:43.340

<v Speaker 5>Obviously.</v>

770
00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:48.690
<v Speaker 5>Kind of makes sense that they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That kind of makes sense because it's </v>

771
00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.910
<v Speaker 5>such a wild place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a perfect place for that Improv.</v>

772
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:54.940
<v Speaker 5>That's a great club.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Math club in pro res should fears </v>

<v Speaker 5>Antonio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not impressed.</v>

776
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm not impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nice.</v>

777
00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:07.130
<v Speaker 5>It's my hometown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they had me ex boyfriends ever show </v>

778
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.130
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] shows.</v>

779
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.590
<v Speaker 5>I've invited them to high school or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

780
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

781
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

782
00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:17.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how you communicate with </v>

783
00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:17.010
<v Speaker 5>your ex boyfriends from high school?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

784
00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.380
<v Speaker 5>but not out of disdain or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just one you know,</v>

785
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:24.290
<v Speaker 5>you don't talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then another one is probably married</v>

786
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:27.350
<v Speaker 5>and don't have any relationships where </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

787
00:35:27.351 --> 00:35:29.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to fucking see him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I swear to Christ.</v>

788
00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.960
<v Speaker 5>None of them know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always ends amicably.</v>

789
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.460
<v Speaker 5>If I saw someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably give him a hug.</v>

790
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they would give me a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hug,</v>

791
00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 5>but you're usually the one that pulls</v>

792
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 1>the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever,</v>

793
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been dumped,</v>

794
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.230
<v Speaker 1>which is not going to be anyone like me </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

795
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just funny.</v>

796
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not out of like,</v>

797
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always win.</v>

798
00:35:58.411 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 1>But just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

799
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:05.121
<v Speaker 1>you always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When somebody come to a natural end and </v>

800
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your spirit,</v>

801
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 1>your competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing.</v>

802
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:12.470
<v Speaker 1>You defend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder for the person doing the </v>

803
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.470
<v Speaker 1>breaking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes it is.</v>

804
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to hurt someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings because I've been in </v>

805
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:17.420
<v Speaker 1>relationships for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just didn't want to hurt someone's</v>

806
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.500
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

807
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're the one that has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the breaking up,</v>

808
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 1>if you're ever feeling bad about in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

809
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:25.500
<v Speaker 1>you can't call them because you're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that initiated it.</v>

810
00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:30.501
<v Speaker 1>That's like a dick thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just have to keep it to yourself </v>

<v Speaker 1>So sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hard.</v>

813
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:39.740

<v Speaker 1>that person needs to find whatever the </v>

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:44.550
<v Speaker 1>How do you fix one of those domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence holes that sometimes you get in</v>

816
00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:46.800
<v Speaker 1>your walls so you know what it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>humongous holding.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

818
00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.380

<v Speaker 1>that really easy to.</v>

819
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever done any wall board?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done any dry wall work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think maybe a patch.</v>

821
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I punched the hole in the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to be careful because you </v>

822
00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:03.130
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the fuck you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could actually,</v>

823
00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Natalie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to have to use a </v>

824
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:07.520
<v Speaker 1>razor knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could accidentally slice.</v>

825
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:07.820
<v Speaker 1>You're an electrical cord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

826
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.320
<v Speaker 1>You know you should hire someone to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

827
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I should leave it as a warning to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next girl.</v>

828
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:18.090
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do glue some false eyelashes </v>

829
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 1>and fake blood around the edges of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

830
00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were going to.</v>

831
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it's in the back.</v>

832
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Make it look like a little like </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

833
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess if the girls had just went right</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

834
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.640
<v Speaker 1>subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing crazy.</v>

836
00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Not a wig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the bathroom now.</v>

837
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toilet.</v>

838
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.180
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like I have a hidden camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there now.</v>

839
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You should put a hit on my girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do.</v>

840
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.450
<v Speaker 1>You should put a camera there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

841
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I should have done a webcam up and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't the toilet roll there and make it</v>

842
00:37:52.951 --> 00:37:55.050
<v Speaker 1>look like a road when that role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one.</v>

843
00:37:55.051 --> 00:37:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Does it allow people to watch you shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like five bucks a month.</v>

844
00:37:57.931 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I bet you would get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you'd pay your rent.</v>

845
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I pay to watch you shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be a good way.</v>

846
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Not Me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would definitely do that.</v>

847
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.010
<v Speaker 1>If they could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could,</v>

848
00:38:08.011 --> 00:38:13.011
<v Speaker 1>if you could have subscribed to a 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour webcam that's only above the </v>

849
00:38:13.011 --> 00:38:13.020
<v Speaker 1>toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would get a lot of.</v>

850
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I put the camera in the toilet to </v>

851
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 1>watch the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably illegal.</v>

852
00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.760
<v Speaker 1>You're saying showing the actual poop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing the actual plant.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Weird show animal poop.</v>

854
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>have the harshest laws and that's how </v>

859
00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.430
<v Speaker 5>they prosecuted him because he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>selling stuff on the Internet.</v>

860
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:45.730
<v Speaker 5>If you sold stuff to that area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's prosecuted by the laws of that area</v>

<v Speaker 1>He played leaving Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving Las Vegas.</v>

945
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:34.330

<v Speaker 1>states in the red states or other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This should be a fucking band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just her for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Can we google it?</v>

950
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is.</v>

951
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Owner of a dog is ripping apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

952
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

953
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:59.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you ask any guys wikipedia,</v>

954
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.780
<v Speaker 1>skinny guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want to dive,</v>

955
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.290
<v Speaker 1>have a boner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think if you asked her,</v>

956
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with no,</v>

957
00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:11.050
<v Speaker 1>if you have a boner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think injuries,</v>

958
00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.150
<v Speaker 2>spinal cord injuries known to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with prep,</v>

959
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.140
<v Speaker 2>a priapism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries,</v>

960
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:24.150
<v Speaker 2>injuries to the cerebellum or spinal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cord are often associated with pariah.</v>

961
00:43:26.051 --> 00:43:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Prism is that it prepares them in living</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients.</v>

962
00:43:29.681 --> 00:43:32.920
<v Speaker 2>So it's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when some people,</v>

963
00:43:32.921 --> 00:43:35.800
<v Speaker 2>when they're talking about like death by</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging executions,</v>

964
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.170
<v Speaker 2>shit like that dude's Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get hard.</v>

965
00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:44.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that because they've observed the </v>

966
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:44.130
<v Speaker 2>effects of the genitals of both men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

967
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:48.661
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they shoot a chicken the head and </v>

968
00:43:48.661 --> 00:43:49.170
<v Speaker 2>then check to see if she's in the lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

969
00:43:49.171 --> 00:43:50.590
<v Speaker 2>The Labia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Labia and quit.</v>

970
00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Quitters becoming gorged and there may </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a discharge of blood from the vagina </v>

00:44:08.231 --> 00:44:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Let anybody fuck us and maybe we'll get </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Tier blood is already your body's,</v>

977
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.350

<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

978
00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a rap song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.930
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>

1040
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.760
<v Speaker 5>Would you ever want to sleep with an </v>
<v Speaker 5>older woman?</v>

1041
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:57.130
<v Speaker 5>Like I was asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1042
00:46:57.131 --> 00:46:58.640
<v Speaker 5>Suzanne somers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like older,</v>

1043
00:46:58.641 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 5>like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 68,</v>

1044
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.660
<v Speaker 5>68,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably not.</v>

1045
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.860
<v Speaker 5>Suzanne somers is probably that unlocked</v>
<v Speaker 5>the secret to living young.</v>

1046
00:47:06.861 --> 00:47:07.930
<v Speaker 5>She has the book on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

1047
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:11.030
<v Speaker 5>Demi Moore on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's not 68 by any means.</v>

1048
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 5>She's like almost 50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1049
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:14.380
<v Speaker 5>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1050
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:18.350
<v Speaker 5>she's hanging in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess she had some sort of a reaction.</v>

1051
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:23.770
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear about that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like red bull or something like </v>

1052
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:23.770
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where they're,</v>

1053
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:23.830
<v Speaker 3>that's know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

1054
00:47:23.831 --> 00:47:28.831
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she apparently drinks nitrates and she </v>

1055
00:47:28.831 --> 00:47:28.831
<v Speaker 3>did Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1056
00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

1057
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.110
<v Speaker 5>Hearing this from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't just say this.</v>

1058
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 5>Allegedly for TMZ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>TMZ was reporting that it was a whatever</v>

1059
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:44.881
<v Speaker 5>the nitrous oxide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which could be true because she had a </v>

1060
00:47:44.881 --> 00:47:44.881
<v Speaker 5>seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She fished,</v>

1061
00:47:44.881 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 5>but that last like five to 10 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've fished before now.</v>

1062
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.690
<v Speaker 5>Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The police report they had,</v>

1063
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.050
<v Speaker 5>they censored the nine one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one call because of personal privacy and</v>

1064
00:47:56.051 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 5>then they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1065
00:47:56.711 --> 00:48:01.711
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the police report came out as that she </v>

1066
00:48:01.711 --> 00:48:01.720
<v Speaker 5>smoked something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you don't smoke.</v>

1067
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 5>So I'm thinking it's Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking that was.</v>

1068
00:48:04.061 --> 00:48:08.470
<v Speaker 5>What was she smoking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you sure that the police report said</v>

1069
00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:10.570
<v Speaker 5>she smoked something or you just hearing</v>
<v Speaker 5>this from tmz?</v>

1070
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.370
<v Speaker 5>TMZ was reporting on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's what it is.</v>

1071
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.540
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say that though.</v>

1072
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Then I'll finish it with allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't.</v>

1073
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we just google it real quick </v>
<v Speaker 5>just so that we don't get in trouble?</v>

1074
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:25.270
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm 99 point nine percent sure.</v>

1075
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.600
<v Speaker 5>What was I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were talking about her.</v>

1076
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

1077
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:34.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel bad if the information is </v>

1078
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.081
<v Speaker 5>probably out there more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're saying that it was nitrous oxide </v>

1079
00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:41.071
<v Speaker 5>and so I heard it was red bull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone called it a death puddle data </v>

1080
00:48:41.071 --> 00:48:41.620
<v Speaker 5>wet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1081
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 5>a smoked.</v>

1082
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Her Pr people wouldn't put a spin on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The media doesn't have an allegiance to </v>

1083
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 5>the truth about celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's whatever they hear,</v>

1084
00:48:53.561 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 5>they're going to NBC right next to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Rachel Maddow.</v>

1085
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.210
<v Speaker 5>You need your own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I said allegiance.</v>

1086
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.100
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd be great at it.</v>

1087
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.640
<v Speaker 5>You're very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got a great vocabulary.</v>

1088
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.670
<v Speaker 5>You'd kick ass on one of those shows and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd be able to make fun of Shit.</v>

1089
00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I want is that what you want to </v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Demi Moore and three m dot TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is their a slash weekly wea.</v>

1102
00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Demi Moore has smoked something similar </v>

1103
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.441
<v Speaker 5>to incense and semi conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Barely said the word voice on the 911 </v>

1104
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 5>call to get more help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So similar to incense.</v>

1105
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.090
<v Speaker 5>Fucking idiot who smoked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Closest thing to.</v>

1106
00:49:58.091 --> 00:50:02.050
<v Speaker 5>Similar to incense of Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think I'm a hundred percent.</v>

1107
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:07.051
<v Speaker 5>She smoked Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't already shifted into a </v>

1108
00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:07.051
<v Speaker 5>different world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1109
00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:08.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have you ever saw that </v>
<v Speaker 5>video is awesome.</v>

1110
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.840
<v Speaker 5>Similar to incidents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's sage.</v>

1111
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.740
<v Speaker 5>Salvia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1112
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.520
<v Speaker 5>Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she went to the other world,</v>

1113
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:20.521
<v Speaker 5>which you can easily do dmt style.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I mean you can get it pretty close </v>

1114
00:50:20.521 --> 00:50:21.170
<v Speaker 5>to dmt kind of effects from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

1115
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.400
<v Speaker 5>but my question is why did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe she,</v>

1116
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 5>her body had a little stroke because of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it or something because of her age,</v>

1117
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.090
<v Speaker 1>because she's not that old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old for a hot chick.</v>

1118
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 1>She's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1119
00:50:33.651 --> 00:50:37.010
<v Speaker 1>like she's in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason I say that because after</v>

1120
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:37.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes,</v>

1121
00:50:37.971 --> 00:50:39.600
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you usually are fine.</v>

1122
00:50:39.601 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 1>So unless the ambulance was right next </v>
<v Speaker 1>door would be speculating.</v>

1123
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm totally speculating.</v>

1124
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Something similar to insights does sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Salvia because sage,</v>

1125
00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:56.681
<v Speaker 1>the sage is something that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently burned to like ward off </v>

1126
00:50:56.681 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 1>spirits and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sage is the Salvia plant.</v>

1127
00:50:58.821 --> 00:51:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like the same plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever was the same.</v>

1128
00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Exactly know what she was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're obviously covering up the </v>

1129
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.431
<v Speaker 1>fact that she was doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want the public to know that </v>

1130
00:51:09.431 --> 00:51:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like something similar to </v>

1131
00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.861
<v Speaker 1>smoking and no one would say that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a ridiculous thing to pull out of </v>

1132
00:51:14.861 --> 00:51:19.151
<v Speaker 1>your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think they want to </v>

1133
00:51:19.151 --> 00:51:19.520
<v Speaker 1>advertise that it was probably because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still legal in most states and they</v>

1134
00:51:19.521 --> 00:51:22.160
<v Speaker 1>just don't want to advertise it at all.</v>

1135
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.450
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

1136
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:28.451
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point because if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an actual illegal drug that would </v>

1137
00:51:28.451 --> 00:51:31.241
<v Speaker 1>want to know what the drug was and since</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably that makes a real a lot of </v>

1138
00:51:31.241 --> 00:51:31.460
<v Speaker 1>sense to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be a fucking detective.</v>

1139
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgot that.</v>

1140
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:38.500
<v Speaker 1>You should just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should really for CSI or something </v>

1141
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:38.820
<v Speaker 1>like you totally did the math there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it was anything else,</v>

1143
00:51:40.131 --> 00:51:42.500
<v Speaker 1>if it was like she was smoking cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Whoa.</v>

1144
00:51:42.501 --> 00:51:43.440
<v Speaker 1>They would tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey she.</v>

1145
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 1>This is a sensational story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a poor girl.</v>

1146
00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:51.041
<v Speaker 1>She's smoking cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is smoking something similar to </v>

1147
00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.490
<v Speaker 1>incense and that's why she salvia can </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck your world up.</v>

1148
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to do is look at that video of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ra on your or me or you talking about my</v>

1149
00:51:56.901 --> 00:51:59.000
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when Ra was on your show?</v>

1150
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was on TV and he did Salvia and </v>

1151
00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:04.170
<v Speaker 1>just melted into everybody.</v>

1152
00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>network and those other shows on there </v>

1171
00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:57.860

00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>television station.</v>

1174
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is the future.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's got some pretty cool things going,</v>

1176
00:53:09.111 --> 00:53:11.660
<v Speaker 1>but that's my little forum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll tell people to go there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're not too sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

1180
00:53:17.991 --> 00:53:20.030
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've just made a date.</v>

1181
00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:25.060
<v Speaker 1>We had a segment called who should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot where we argue the lesser of two </v>

1182
00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.881
<v Speaker 1>evils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It usually has to do with who should be </v>

1183
00:53:27.881 --> 00:53:30.201
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The supplier of the demand and then we </v>

1184
00:53:30.201 --> 00:53:30.201
<v Speaker 1>talk about something so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can either.</v>

1185
00:53:30.201 --> 00:53:34.910
<v Speaker 1>You can pick what side you're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplier or the demand for specific </v>

1186
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:36.210
<v Speaker 1>things for terrible things like guns or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1187
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1188
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:38.700
<v Speaker 1>it's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as heavy handed.</v>

1189
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Like last week I was talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much I hate chocolate fountains,</v>

1190
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 1>so who should be shot the fat fucks that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait in line or the caterer that's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>why is it bad?</v>

1193

<v Speaker 1>Strawberries with chocolate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yummy.</v>

1194
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then people start to get into like,</v>

1195
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else can I dip in the road?</v>

1196
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the end it's all like there's </v>

1197
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:03.720
<v Speaker 1>garbage in it and you partying with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have to stop hanging out with those </v>

1200
00:54:09.801 --> 00:54:09.801
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golden Corral.</v>

1201
00:54:09.801 --> 00:54:12.051
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they have a chocolate </v>

1202
00:54:12.051 --> 00:54:12.051
<v Speaker 1>fountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the golden corral.</v>

1203
00:54:12.051 --> 00:54:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowd.</v>

1204
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've probably somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the valley.</v>

1205
00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:16.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a like a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like it's like a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of food for a little money.</v>

1211
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Not Super Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trying to think of some names in </v>

1212
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.630
<v Speaker 1>different places like tabulate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>escaped me.</v>

1213
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Less nice than a red lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit nicer to is their big thing</v>

1215
00:54:41.431 --> 00:54:43.200
<v Speaker 1>is that they have a chocolate fountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1216
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about if you go to </v>

1217
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.570
<v Speaker 1>somebody's Dope Party and they've got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate fountain,</v>

1218
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:50.850
<v Speaker 1>do you ever go to someone's part of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just goes ridiculous.</v>

1219
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I went to this dude's party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had this crazy party in Malibu and </v>

1220
00:54:56.170 --> 00:55:00.220
<v Speaker 1>he's like some super super billionaire </v>
<v Speaker 1>type character and he had brought in </v>

1221
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:04.101
<v Speaker 1>snow and the whole hill was covered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>snow and people were sledding at the </v>

1222
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:07.140
<v Speaker 1>entrance to your little community you </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>

1223
00:55:07.141 --> 00:55:12.141
<v Speaker 1>There's a big thing that says snow day </v>
<v Speaker 1>like because you know this dude had it </v>

1224
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:19.690
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a ramp built like it was </v>

1225
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 1>constructed because they didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of a grade for a hill.</v>

1226
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.570
<v Speaker 1>So he built it up just for the party or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the party.</v>

1227
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.340
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

1228
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:31.490
<v Speaker 1>They had so much shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no chocolate fountain.</v>

1229
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.560

<v Speaker 1>Strawberries are not the same.</v>

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:44.091
<v Speaker 5>boyfriend about it or something you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want me to go and talks about all </v>

1267
00:57:44.091 --> 00:57:44.091
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think,</v>

1268
00:57:44.091 --> 00:57:44.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are genetically predisposed as women.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We're maternal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We do want that one day.</v>

1270
00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:48.900
<v Speaker 5>So I take care of this little dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't.</v>

00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 5>It's not like on my mind like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to babysit you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Seem creepy as fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that like all </v>

<v Speaker 5>kinds of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1283

<v Speaker 5>growing up as experiencing the different</v>

1284
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:41.071
<v Speaker 5>things that people not only tolerate but</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually love and then you try to bring </v>

<v Speaker 5>I do it all the time.</v>

1287
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.720
<v Speaker 5>I dropped my weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want my baby to look like.</v>

1288
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure somebody has for sure so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>mustangs.</v>

1289
00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:00.560

<v Speaker 5>Babies are a little weird looking at </v>

<v Speaker 5>first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they're terrified to know.</v>

1292
00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:02.500
<v Speaker 5>You look at it terrified object.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1293

<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1296
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 5>it's very tricky man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Raising little babies is very tricky.</v>

1297
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:16.530
<v Speaker 5>Keeping them for diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shots,</v>

1298
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.300
<v Speaker 5>you know not to eat cat poop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine like,</v>

1299
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you</v>

1300
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:25.880
<v Speaker 2>gotta watch them every step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my one and a half year old is just</v>

1301
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:30.881
<v Speaker 2>now at the stage where I can let her get</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one or two feet in front of me </v>

1302
00:59:30.881 --> 00:59:35.720
<v Speaker 2>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be right there right </v>

1303
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:35.720
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

1304
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:35.720
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe a.</v>

1305
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.000
<v Speaker 2>sometimes she'll be in an area where she</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't mess anything up.</v>

1306
00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Speaker 2>She was wandering around the bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1307
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:41.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got an eye on you.</v>

1308
00:59:41.041 --> 00:59:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you walk a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to always be right there in</v>

1309
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:44.720
<v Speaker 2>case you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

1310
00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I like this and stick it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1311
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know anything.</v>

1312
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Your baby</v>

1313
00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:55.080
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How you have that desire to protect her </v>

1314
00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.170
<v Speaker 4>in the like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not hard for you to make sure she's</v>

1315
00:59:56.171 --> 00:59:57.690
<v Speaker 4>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a natural instinct.</v>

1316
00:59:57.910 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Even people who don't have children </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have no idea what it,</v>

1317
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.590
<v Speaker 2>what the experience is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1318
01:00:01.591 --> 01:00:06.591
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I could kind of guess what it </v>

1319
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:07.580
<v Speaker 2>would be like before I actually had </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

1320
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I would think it was probably really </v>
<v Speaker 2>intense love and you know,</v>

1321
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.910
<v Speaker 2>it's probably really hard to probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>test your patience,</v>

1322
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:14.450
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1323
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 2>you really want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like that at all.</v>

1324
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 2>You actually get let get love and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure from it.</v>

1325
01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:24.461
<v Speaker 2>That's what I didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it even like the difficult </v>

1326
01:00:24.461 --> 01:00:27.910
<v Speaker 2>times of raising kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would be stressful and it </v>

1327
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be something that you regret,</v>

1328
01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.460
<v Speaker 2>but you get like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get so much love from it.</v>

1329
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.320
<v Speaker 2>It's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you actually get.</v>

1330
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:36.410
<v Speaker 2>It's rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I didn't anticipate that.</v>

1331
01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:39.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fun involved in raising </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

1332
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're enjoying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1333
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:45.350
<v Speaker 2>and you're enjoying like raising them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking to them and hanging out with</v>

1334
01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:47.060
<v Speaker 2>them and playing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1335
01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:49.310
<v Speaker 2>it's so rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't anticipate that.</v>

1336
01:00:49.311 --> 01:00:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:55.200
<v Speaker 2>loving but difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much different than</v>

1338
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.600
<v Speaker 4>I thought that initially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the fact that you're.</v>

1339
01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.680
<v Speaker 4>This is not a slight against men like </v>
<v Speaker 4>women are obviously more in tune with </v>

1340
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.690
<v Speaker 4>being maternal and mothers and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

1341
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.300
<v Speaker 4>so it's not about being a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you think being a comic,</v>

1342
01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:11.170
<v Speaker 4>because when I watch comics that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>fathers reluctant fathers,</v>

1343
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:16.171
<v Speaker 4>not everyone planned to have a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was get the vibe that people hate </v>

1344
01:01:16.171 --> 01:01:16.480
<v Speaker 4>their marriages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hate their kids,</v>

1345
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.270
<v Speaker 4>so that's always the way I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1346
01:01:19.271 --> 01:01:21.340
<v Speaker 4>I got this kid off my kids annoying and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1347
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.150
<v Speaker 4>do you think you felt that way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because a lot of your friends or whoever</v>

1348
01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.960
<v Speaker 4>you would watch when you were coming up </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a disdain toward being a father.</v>

1349
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:31.830
<v Speaker 4>Think as comics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1350
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all can speak for the whole group </v>

1351
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.490
<v Speaker 2>and say that we're pretty much all </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and super selfish,</v>

1352
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.160
<v Speaker 2>super selfish and fucked up in one way </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another.</v>

1353
01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1354
01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got their own little kink </v>

1355
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:47.340
<v Speaker 2>and most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for most of us,</v>

1356
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.470
<v Speaker 2>it came from our childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1357
01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came from either parents splitting up</v>

1358
01:01:53.731 --> 01:01:58.731
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being ignored or weird shit that makes </v>

1359
01:01:58.731 --> 01:01:59.880
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all of us,</v>

1360
01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:04.680
<v Speaker 2>but the vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overwhelming need to do it.</v>

1361
01:02:04.681 --> 01:02:09.681
<v Speaker 2>So much so that you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to risk your self esteem </v>

1362
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:09.681
<v Speaker 2>by going onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of strangers.</v>

1363
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1364
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.150
<v Speaker 2>and I think when you've been through </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1365
01:02:12.151 --> 01:02:17.151
<v Speaker 2>you're automatically apprehensive as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential parent of like recreating same</v>

1366
01:02:19.411 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 2>sort of environment that you had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience when you were a child.</v>

1367
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>So you're really reluctant to be in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where you,</v>

1368
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:30.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna fuck up the same way </v>

1369
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:30.490
<v Speaker 2>someone fucked up with you.</v>

1370
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one way of looking at it.</v>

1371
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is exactly how I looked at it.</v>

1372
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:36.620
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also the part of being </v>

1373
01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:36.960
<v Speaker 2>connected to this other person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for them,</v>

1374
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.330
<v Speaker 2>not the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other person that you've made with,</v>

1375
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:44.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to choose wisely </v>

1376
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:47.090
<v Speaker 2>because I have friends that have had </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies with fucking crazy people and </v>

1377
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:51.320
<v Speaker 2>their life is chaos there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is craziness and the woman is </v>

1378
01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.951
<v Speaker 2>constantly fucking with them and trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make him jealous and doing horrible </v>

1379
01:02:54.951 --> 01:02:56.790
<v Speaker 2>things and saying bad things to the kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just constant chaos,</v>

1380
01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:02.150
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's got to always deal with </v>

1381
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:03.681
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new boyfriends and all these new </v>

1382
01:03:03.681 --> 01:03:06.351
<v Speaker 2>guys that are run as kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've seen people that have that </v>

1383
01:03:06.351 --> 01:03:08.520
<v Speaker 2>have had kids with the wrong person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just been a disaster.</v>

1384
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.510
<v Speaker 2>So there's that too.</v>

1385
01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:13.690
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird because in my early </v>
<v Speaker 4>twenties,</v>

1386
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.540
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you,</v>

1387
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:20.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on your own for the first time </v>

1388
01:03:20.541 --> 01:03:21.991
<v Speaker 4>and you're whatever I'm in say La and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would watch these male comics and a lot </v>

1389
01:03:21.991 --> 01:03:23.830
<v Speaker 4>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure you and I know several,</v>

1390
01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.430
<v Speaker 4>we have several in common where some guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably in his forties,</v>

1391
01:03:27.431 --> 01:03:30.490
<v Speaker 4>just some woman and she happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the one that stuck around,</v>

1392
01:03:30.491 --> 01:03:33.700
<v Speaker 4>so now he's married and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never hear him talk about his wife.</v>

1393
01:03:33.701 --> 01:03:38.701
<v Speaker 4>He kind of doesn't like her or he like </v>
<v Speaker 4>had sex with a crazy girl and now they </v>

1394
01:03:38.701 --> 01:03:40.720
<v Speaker 4>have a kid and he likes the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he hates the woman.</v>

1395
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:45.900
<v Speaker 4>And I think men get to dictate the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>society feels about marriage because </v>

1396
01:03:46.301 --> 01:03:51.301
<v Speaker 4>just being the stronger of the sexes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever guys like is always like the </v>

1397
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:51.301
<v Speaker 4>cooler thing.</v>

1398
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:53.320
<v Speaker 4>Girls are always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one ever wants to do the girl stuff.</v>

1399
01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:58.350
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like women always want to wear men's </v>

1400
01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:01.111
<v Speaker 4>clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women want to go with the guys are </v>

1401
01:04:01.111 --> 01:04:01.111
<v Speaker 4>always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

1402
01:04:01.111 --> 01:04:04.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girls always want to be part of the </v>

1403
01:04:04.861 --> 01:04:06.481
<v Speaker 4>boy's club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No guys knocking down the door to get </v>

1404
01:04:06.481 --> 01:04:08.721
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The girls club been like to be part of </v>

1405
01:04:08.721 --> 01:04:08.721
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1406
01:04:08.721 --> 01:04:09.970
<v Speaker 4>we want our comedy is male centric and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything we do,</v>

1407
01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:12.460
<v Speaker 4>we want to be one of the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And taken seriously like men,</v>

1408
01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:17.380
<v Speaker 4>so the view on kids and marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you at least as a comic,</v>

1409
01:04:17.381 --> 01:04:22.381
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching them and they seem so </v>
<v Speaker 4>unhappy so it all of a sudden becomes </v>

1410
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:23.210
<v Speaker 4>like uncool to have a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>

1411
01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:26.680
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed a lot of girls saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>things like,</v>

1412
01:04:26.681 --> 01:04:28.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get married.</v>

1413
01:04:28.601 --> 01:04:30.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be in a relationship the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you don't.</v>

1414
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.290
<v Speaker 4>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course you do.</v>

1415
01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:37.530
<v Speaker 4>It's just become the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does your to say that you don't want </v>

1416
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.200
<v Speaker 4>that because women think men find it </v>
<v Speaker 4>more attractive.</v>

1417
01:04:38.530 --> 01:04:41.260
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many women are running that game?</v>

1418
01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.130
<v Speaker 4>So pretend they don't want relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>or they think they don't.</v>

1419
01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:50.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I host a show and I hear girls all the </v>

1420
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:50.131
<v Speaker 4>time and I'm looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a skank horror.</v>

1421
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:54.460
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm looking at your eyeliner job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can tell that you saw dick a lot.</v>

1422
01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:59.320
<v Speaker 4>So I minor tells you that they suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it depends on the book and I've</v>

1423
01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:02.560
<v Speaker 4>loved it for the rest of us can tell you</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to wear like white eyeliner.</v>

1424
01:05:02.561 --> 01:05:04.310
<v Speaker 4>Your let's get serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1425
01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:07.690
<v Speaker 4>Girl with white island lashes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like.</v>

1426
01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:13.580
<v Speaker 4>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depends on where you have your </v>

1427
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:13.580
<v Speaker 4>makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can tell by what you're wearing.</v>

1428
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.890
<v Speaker 4>I can tell and then you hear them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1429
01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:17.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't want a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want a guy checking up me.</v>

1430
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 4>You want</v>

1431
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:23.160
<v Speaker 5>the right that you're not immune to it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you say that because you want to </v>

1432
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.910
<v Speaker 5>draw the guy in like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh really cool.</v>

1433
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:29.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally no woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I like my space,</v>

1434
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.980
<v Speaker 5>but I would be upset if the man I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>dating but never called me weird.</v>

1435
01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:38.530
<v Speaker 5>So grow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not necessarily her fault.</v>

1436
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many at a time?</v>

1437
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:46.250
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a boyfriend and we lived together </v>

1438
01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:51.691
<v Speaker 5>when I was 25 for about a year and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a boyfriend who visited for a </v>

1439
01:05:51.691 --> 01:05:55.981
<v Speaker 5>summer and then I have a boyfriend who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>from months on end but never like we </v>

1440
01:05:56.651 --> 01:06:01.651
<v Speaker 5>both signed the lease and it's always </v>
<v Speaker 5>kills it when you're young or if you'd </v>

1441
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:06.660
<v Speaker 5>like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should never do that when you're </v>

1442
01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:06.660
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen that.</v>

1443
01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.890
<v Speaker 5>I did that when I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's totally killed our relationship.</v>

1444
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:10.090
<v Speaker 5>I really loved her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Before that,</v>

1445
01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.980
<v Speaker 5>she was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1446
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:13.570
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a disaster.</v>

1447
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:16.720
<v Speaker 5>I guess it depends on the car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably in the messier,</v>

1448
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:18.640
<v Speaker 5>like I tend to date guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposite me,</v>

1449
01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.670
<v Speaker 5>so I enjoy living with someone because </v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

1450
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:23.620
<v Speaker 5>it's nice to have someone to hang out </v>
<v Speaker 5>with and talk to.</v>

1451
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 5>That's nice if you find a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's very difficult to do.</v>

1452
01:06:27.131 --> 01:06:30.400
<v Speaker 5>When you're 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>21 you're saying you don't even know how</v>

1453
01:06:30.401 --> 01:06:33.010
<v Speaker 5>crazy you are until you live with </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and then they let you know how</v>

1454
01:06:33.011 --> 01:06:38.011
<v Speaker 5>crazy you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy as of late and it's great because </v>

1455
01:06:38.011 --> 01:06:38.560
<v Speaker 5>then like as a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you like to bake,</v>

1456
01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:43.650
<v Speaker 5>then you can bake for them and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to eat it because guys will eat </v>

1457
01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:44.290
<v Speaker 5>anything you like to bake and not eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1458
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 5>I like to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love baking.</v>

1459
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:49.120
<v Speaker 5>It's Cathartic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have so fascinating.</v>

1460
01:06:49.121 --> 01:06:53.530
<v Speaker 5>Listen to your point of view as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an intelligent woman explained to us the</v>

1461
01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:58.531
<v Speaker 5>traps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That chick setup that we already </v>

1462
01:06:58.531 --> 01:06:58.531
<v Speaker 5>suspected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all knew it.</v>

1463
01:06:58.531 --> 01:06:59.650
<v Speaker 5>We've had these conversations with </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves.</v>

1464
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:03.310
<v Speaker 5>Tell me when a girl says to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want relationship,</v>

1465
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:05.500
<v Speaker 5>what do you think she's telling you we </v>
<v Speaker 5>can fuck.</v>

1466
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:06.910
<v Speaker 5>That's what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means two things.</v>

1467
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:10.010
<v Speaker 5>She probably doesn't like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you may be gone on a couple of times.</v>

1468
01:07:10.011 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just not ready.</v>

1469
01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:12.450
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She does to you,</v>

1470
01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:15.160
<v Speaker 5>but it's a lure if she likes you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's like,</v>

1471
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:16.450
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally cool.</v>

1472
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:19.450
<v Speaker 5>Like she might be a cool girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she does want a relationship.</v>

1473
01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:24.451
<v Speaker 5>No girl wants to be cool with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like sleeping with other girls and </v>

1474
01:07:24.451 --> 01:07:24.451
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if she does,</v>

1475
01:07:24.451 --> 01:07:25.180
<v Speaker 5>she's got that issue.</v>

1476
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:30.450
<v Speaker 5>What about girls?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were this the one hot girl that has all </v>

1477
01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 5>these guy friends?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do that.</v>

1478
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.070
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a tomboy.</v>

1479
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:38.890
<v Speaker 5>When I wrote my cosmo article on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have that in there.</v>

1480
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:39.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.740
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1482
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:49.240
<v Speaker 5>as the girl who was always been a tomboy</v>
<v Speaker 5>and always had guy friends,</v>

1483
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.470
<v Speaker 5>when you have a sick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a serious significant other,</v>

1484
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:58.650
<v Speaker 5>it takes the place of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 5>you form with a lot of guys you don't </v>

1485
01:07:58.650 --> 01:07:59.620
<v Speaker 5>need because you have that male </v>
<v Speaker 5>influence in your life.</v>

1486
01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:01.570
<v Speaker 5>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't just ditch your friends.</v>

1487
01:08:01.571 --> 01:08:03.880
<v Speaker 5>You seem to need it more than most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're very aggressive.</v>

1488
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:06.910
<v Speaker 5>What's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But your womanly,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I actually wanted to take a class.</v>

1515
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:07.250
<v Speaker 5>You would think you'd kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say you grabbed them.</v>

1516
01:09:07.251 --> 01:09:12.251
<v Speaker 5>They start when they bite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are such pussies for countless </v>

1517
01:09:12.251 --> 01:09:14.470
<v Speaker 5>trying to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If a cow was like trying to kill you,</v>

1518
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:18.020
<v Speaker 5>you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he got a hold of your neck,</v>

1519
01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.800
<v Speaker 5>what if he bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll drive it into the concrete.</v>

1520
01:09:21.801 --> 01:09:22.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what if you're both dead?</v>

1521
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:26.350
<v Speaker 5>What if you're both dead owner and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gone?</v>

1522
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:27.710
<v Speaker 5>It's a wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the cat.</v>

1523
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.650
<v Speaker 5>You should have asked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to take like a class.</v>

1524
01:09:30.651 --> 01:09:31.760
<v Speaker 5>I will go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'll tape it.</v>

1525
01:09:31.761 --> 01:09:33.110
<v Speaker 5>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to take like one,</v>

1526
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:35.550
<v Speaker 5>maybe like a boxing class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1527
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't tape it.</v>

1528
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:40.160
<v Speaker 5>What you want to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in the beginning,</v>

1529
01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:45.161
<v Speaker 5>you need someone to stand with you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>and adjust things like adjust your </v>

1530
01:09:45.161 --> 01:09:48.581
<v Speaker 5>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>adjust your hand position because </v>

1531
01:09:48.581 --> 01:09:50.681
<v Speaker 5>especially in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very important that you learn with </v>

1532
01:09:50.681 --> 01:09:52.110
<v Speaker 5>proper technique because the foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the principles that you learn,</v>

1533
01:09:52.111 --> 01:09:53.750
<v Speaker 5>the habits that you formed in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning,</v>

1534
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:56.480
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times they stick with guys and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they get really good.</v>

1535
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.300
<v Speaker 5>So when they get tired they go back to </v>
<v Speaker 5>their shitty technique.</v>

1536
01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.970
<v Speaker 5>So you have to learn correctly from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning.</v>

1537
01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:03.320
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to have to correct </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

1538
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:04.880
<v Speaker 5>So you're thinking while you're out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1539
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:07.790
<v Speaker 5>So from the beginning you only want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it one way the correct way.</v>

1540
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.910
<v Speaker 5>So if you really want to learn how to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1541
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:10.640
<v Speaker 5>where do you live?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1542
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.490
<v Speaker 5>don't tell me on the air in Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1543
01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:14.180
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you doing?</v>

1544
01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:18.890
<v Speaker 5>They're going to find you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you live in the devil's ball sack</v>

1545
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.150
<v Speaker 5>one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you live right there?</v>

1546
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:22.520
<v Speaker 5>Just because you live in like a really </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice neighborhood,</v>

1547
01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:27.810
<v Speaker 5>but like Hollywood is taking it dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm surprised that you're not like </v>

1548
01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:27.810
<v Speaker 5>Burbank.</v>

1549
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.030
<v Speaker 5>Burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1550
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:38.290
<v Speaker 5>Burbank in his butt hole was a nice </v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

1551
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.130
<v Speaker 5>Dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's relaxing.</v>

1552
01:10:40.131 --> 01:10:42.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to worry about people </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking peeing on me.</v>

1553
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:47.470
<v Speaker 5>How much is your rent a month?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A two bedroom apartment is $1,400</v>

1554
01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:49.990
<v Speaker 5>rent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a mortgage yet.</v>

1555
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.240
<v Speaker 5>But have you bought a place in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood?</v>

1556
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:57.230
<v Speaker 5>Did you get a condo or a condo?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not bad.</v>

1557
01:10:57.231 --> 01:11:02.231
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just say like smart and the area is </v>

1558
01:11:02.231 --> 01:11:03.200
<v Speaker 5>getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eighties Hood.</v>

1559
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:07.040
<v Speaker 5>Somebody had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was one of those TV shows.</v>

1560
01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:09.330
<v Speaker 5>They show the insides of people's houses</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1561
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.810
<v Speaker 5>like Paris Hilton or someone famous like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that might not have been her,</v>

1562
01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.000
<v Speaker 5>but someone had a one of apartments in</v>

1563
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.800
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Wilshire,</v>

1564
01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>you know those penthouses on Wilshire </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boulevard where they have like valets.</v>

1565
01:11:19.261 --> 01:11:22.650
<v Speaker 1>They have like 24 hour concierge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the older,</v>

1566
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.820
<v Speaker 1>like all the way to Santa Monica on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to say it was really nice one.</v>

1567
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The super duper luxury apartments.</v>

1568
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:34.700
<v Speaker 1>This was the dopest view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't know what kind of view </v>

1569
01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:37.491
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no views like this in La and </v>

1570
01:11:37.491 --> 01:11:37.491
<v Speaker 1>it's so high that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1571
01:11:37.491 --> 01:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>you're way up there in this tower </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking over the city.</v>

1572
01:11:39.571 --> 01:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1573
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really into living in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I was,</v>

1574
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>this would be with the shit areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's where your grandparents</v>

1575
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>lived that I would want to have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>office in that place.</v>

1576
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:55.190
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it and the thing I thought I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to buy one of those </v>

1577
01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:55.190
<v Speaker 1>apartments and use it as an office.</v>

1578
01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:56.430
<v Speaker 1>That'd be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're really expensive.</v>

1579
01:11:56.431 --> 01:12:01.431
<v Speaker 1>They're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like 20 million bucks or </v>

1580
01:12:01.431 --> 01:12:03.501
<v Speaker 1>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on the west side is as bad as the </v>

1581
01:12:03.501 --> 01:12:03.501
<v Speaker 1>west side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's no comedy clubs over there.</v>

1582
01:12:03.501 --> 01:12:04.580
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

1583
01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I need is in Hollywood.</v>

1584
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>That kind of dictated where I bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>something I liked to.</v>

1585
01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Because you have the luxury of living </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther out.</v>

1586
01:12:13.771 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 1>You have a bit more control over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>career than I do,</v>

1587
01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but you have to go to Hollywood all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time almost every night and you have </v>

1588
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:27.410
<v Speaker 1>your gig set or you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not auditioning like a crazy </v>

1589
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.600
<v Speaker 1>blind move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved down here 10 minute drive.</v>

1590
01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Tango grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Burbank?</v>

1591
01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's I'm living just to have a quiet.</v>

1592
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I can go in my backyard and be quiet </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

1593
01:12:38.571 --> 01:12:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have parking everywhere.</v>

1594
01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:43.350
<v Speaker 1>You have a backyard fenced in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1595
01:12:43.351 --> 01:12:45.360
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can just plan your funeral now.</v>

1596
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your funeral.</v>

1597
01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I go to Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes 10 minutes.</v>

1598
01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm on fucking sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hang out in Sun.</v>

1599
01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Then I drive back home to my nice quiet </v>
<v Speaker 1>castle was that,</v>

1600
01:12:56.071 --> 01:13:01.071
<v Speaker 1>but instead of going and staying in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>party that's in the center up all night </v>

1601
01:13:01.771 --> 01:13:03.690
<v Speaker 1>while people are torturing your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like.</v>

1602
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan.</v>

1603
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you like that kind of city in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York?</v>

1604
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you live in Manhattan?</v>

1605
01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:13.150
<v Speaker 1>What I've missed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I were to move there now it </v>

1606
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:15.771
<v Speaker 1>would kind of be like I'd have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't help me and be like a </v>

1607
01:13:15.771 --> 01:13:18.621
<v Speaker 1>lateral move because it's not like I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think it's so funny when you </v>

1608
01:13:18.621 --> 01:13:21.970
<v Speaker 1>might actually be a step down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to start over with the comedy </v>

1609
01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:21.970
<v Speaker 1>clubs and everything.</v>

1610
01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I meet girls like actresses or </v>

1611
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.490
<v Speaker 1>other hosts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>month?</v>

1615
01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:30.640
<v Speaker 1>You got to go back heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

1616
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.180
<v Speaker 1>You fly to Florida once a year to visit </v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents.</v>

1617
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>You're not bi coastal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was bi coastal for about two months,</v>

1618
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 1>two apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd fly back.</v>

1619
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't even have this fucking place?</v>

1620
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you deal with the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter and get a nice winter in </v>

1621
01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:46.700
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My whole family's from New York.</v>

1623
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1624
01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.580
<v Speaker 1>they're all from New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The city people.</v>

1625
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean they start then and there from </v>
<v Speaker 1>long island and those are the various </v>

1626
01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:00.971
<v Speaker 1>trainings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who are born and raised in New </v>

1627
01:14:00.971 --> 01:14:00.971
<v Speaker 1>York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city,</v>

1628
01:14:00.971 --> 01:14:03.360
<v Speaker 1>the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand.</v>

1629
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.530
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand a lot of parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world today.</v>

1630
01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what a pizza is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

1631
01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them don't drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever drive.</v>

1632
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>They don't ever get licensed</v>

1633
01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 5>so they want to go somewhere on </v>
<v Speaker 5>vacation.</v>

1634
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:16.910
<v Speaker 5>It's a real pain in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to go get a driver's license.</v>

1635
01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:21.911
<v Speaker 5>They take driving classes and learned </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to drive and then when they're on </v>

1636
01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:23.350
<v Speaker 5>the road somewhere they're incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They really shouldn't be driving because</v>

1637
01:14:23.351 --> 01:14:28.351
<v Speaker 5>it's its own microcosm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do relate to how aggressive New </v>

1638
01:14:28.351 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 5>Yorkers are and the like the how </v>
<v Speaker 5>forceful they are when they taught.</v>

1639
01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 5>Like I like that because I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how I come off.</v>

1640
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.600
<v Speaker 5>Do you like like really calm men?</v>

<v Speaker 5>your feet and not,</v>

1643
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:43.560

<v Speaker 5>turn it right.</v>

1647
01:14:50.221 --> 01:14:53.080
<v Speaker 5>Like it's on your book and they can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive,</v>

1648
01:14:53.081 --> 01:14:54.070
<v Speaker 5>like a quiet aggressive.</v>

1649
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.160

<v Speaker 5>but you only like two minutes of a sex </v>

1650

<v Speaker 5>I walked in and you were like,</v>

1665
01:15:41.561 --> 01:15:43.310
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right when I walked in,</v>

1666
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:44.470
<v Speaker 5>you were going after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1667
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.390
<v Speaker 5>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do we keep saying?</v>

1668
01:15:46.391 --> 01:15:47.570
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gave it to her.</v>

1669
01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.600
<v Speaker 5>You were polite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are being mean,</v>

1670
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:57.370
<v Speaker 5>but you were laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was some certain things that she </v>

1671
01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:58.510
<v Speaker 5>was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the way it was.</v>

1672
01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:01.090
<v Speaker 5>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just sad.</v>

1673
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:06.240
<v Speaker 5>You know that that same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like really obvious struggle for </v>

1674
01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.120
<v Speaker 5>attention by being overly sexual to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>that podcast never was released.</v>

1675
01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:11.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:15.380
<v Speaker 5>I always just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1677
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:20.470
<v Speaker 5>It's fun to talk about sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I honestly feel that a straight up </v>

1678
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:23.851
<v Speaker 5>sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can be the lowest form of </v>

1679
01:16:23.851 --> 01:16:23.851
<v Speaker 5>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially between men and women.</v>

1680
01:16:23.851 --> 01:16:28.170
<v Speaker 5>Like if all else fails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can always talk about how you get </v>

1681
01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:29.260
<v Speaker 5>off and so when we go right to that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1682
01:16:29.261 --> 01:16:34.261
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to attempt to discuss </v>

1683
01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:34.261
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>

<v Speaker 5>we get hit on a lot by women.</v>

1686
01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't put myself in situations where </v>
<v Speaker 5>lesbians are coming at me.</v>

1687
01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.400
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like you have to have a fan base </v>

1688
01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.370
<v Speaker 5>of women that are lesbians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever get girls and say,</v>

1689
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:50.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't want just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I figured it out.</v>

1695
01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:10.450
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in any,</v>

1786
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:16.290
<v Speaker 1>like anything you do that's creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be an expression of how</v>

1787
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you view life and the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1788
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.510
<v Speaker 1>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We supposed to never use retarded people</v>

1789
01:21:21.511 --> 01:21:24.480
<v Speaker 1>because they don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't use him as an example.</v>

1790
01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:28.890
<v Speaker 1>What she was laughing at all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes that of yourself and others.</v>

1791
01:21:28.891 --> 01:21:30.930
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it pertains to you,</v>

1792
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:34.720
<v Speaker 1>we have taken exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see people in regular returning,</v>

1793
01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:39.270
<v Speaker 1>like we're now are people that make fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>of themselves.</v>

1794
01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:44.690
<v Speaker 1>What I was doing obviously is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>including a retarded person in my act </v>

1795
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:48.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's where saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's retarded.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

1797
01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:56.361

<v Speaker 1>I think you would want someone to know </v>

1798
01:21:56.361 --> 01:21:57.120
<v Speaker 1>that it hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand where she was coming from.</v>

1799
01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's a comic there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very funny.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but she has a sense of humor about it </v>

1802
01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.670
<v Speaker 1>and like her email is rain mom instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rain.</v>

1803

<v Speaker 1>expense,</v>

1805
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:17.841

<v Speaker 1>she treats him like an adult and so </v>

<v Speaker 1>Pacific.</v>

01:22:27.391 --> 01:22:32.280
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about me making fun of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that she had an issue with that</v>

1812

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the smart one.</v>

1818

1822
01:23:00.301 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Especially if someone was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>malicious.</v>

1823
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Just poop on you and then you put your </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy dog.</v>

1831
01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 5>You're a crazy dog lady.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1832
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:28.740
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to learn some more kid.</v>

1833
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:33.130
<v Speaker 5>Be More of a grappler or kickboxer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything to throw.</v>

1834
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:34.420
<v Speaker 5>Throw Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So girls,</v>

1835
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:36.050
<v Speaker 5>what do you think you'd like to choke a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch?</v>

1836
01:23:36.051 --> 01:23:37.390
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell me the truth.</v>

1837
01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:42.900
<v Speaker 5>I think punching is more useful but no </v>
<v Speaker 5>one expects you to kick him and take him</v>

1838
01:23:43.091 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 5>to the ground on a Saturday night </v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting in line.</v>

1839
01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:46.510
<v Speaker 5>Inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>

1840
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:51.750
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'd have to take an aptitude </v>

1841
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:55.201
<v Speaker 5>test,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a physical aptitude test to see </v>

1842
01:23:55.201 --> 01:23:55.201
<v Speaker 5>which of my limbs is quicker and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll just play to that strength,</v>

1843
01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:59.860
<v Speaker 5>physical aptitude test to see which of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your limbs better with kicking.</v>

1844
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 5>And my quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my quicker with punching like which am I</v>

1845
01:24:01.961 --> 01:24:04.510
<v Speaker 5>better at?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody naturally predisposed to the only</v>

1846
01:24:04.511 --> 01:24:09.511
<v Speaker 5>issue with kicking as it takes a while </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get good at it and you have to think </v>

1847
01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:09.511
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1848
01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.110
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kicked in the legs to do it correctly,</v>

1849
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:13.630
<v Speaker 5>you've got to learn how to leg kick and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to learn a balance.</v>

1850
01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:18.631
<v Speaker 5>You have to have really good balance </v>
<v Speaker 5>because otherwise someone's going to </v>

1851
01:24:18.631 --> 01:24:20.911
<v Speaker 5>take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's easier to take someone down when </v>

1852
01:24:20.911 --> 01:24:21.590
<v Speaker 5>they're kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if chicken into the body or I</v>

1853
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.600
<v Speaker 5>don't ever plan on being in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be nice to know how to defend </v>

1854
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.431
<v Speaker 5>myself in case somebody gets crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to get kicked in the </v>

1855
01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 5>Shin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good thinking.</v>

1856
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.510
<v Speaker 5>That's good to think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1857
01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.810
<v Speaker 5>You don't want you to kicking the leg </v>
<v Speaker 5>kick in the thighs.</v>

1858
01:24:34.811 --> 01:24:38.130
<v Speaker 5>It's really hurt or a lot of times you </v>
<v Speaker 5>get kicked in the CAF,</v>

1859
01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.470
<v Speaker 5>like the lower shin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the fibula,</v>

1860
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:45.490
<v Speaker 5>the little skinny bone Tibia and fibula </v>
<v Speaker 5>dudes will kick the shit out of the </v>

1861
01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:47.260
<v Speaker 5>outside of your outside of your calf.</v>

1862
01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.580
<v Speaker 6>What they should do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>instead of having tasers,</v>

1863
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:54.720
<v Speaker 6>they should have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They should have little necklaces with </v>

1864
01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.161
<v Speaker 6>like little vials that are just filled </v>
<v Speaker 6>with aids blood and then everyone knows </v>

1865
01:24:57.161 --> 01:24:57.470
<v Speaker 6>what that is and so if somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 6>attacking me like,</v>

1866
01:24:57.471 --> 01:24:58.370
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got my blood,</v>

1867
01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:03.130
<v Speaker 6>don't make me throw this on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be.</v>

1868
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:08.131
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>throw it in their face and their eyes </v>

1869
01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:08.131
<v Speaker 6>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You still wouldn't want it to happen.</v>

1870
01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:09.650
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's a little tiny vial.</v>

1871
01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:12.420
<v Speaker 6>I would take my chances,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's related to your violent open to</v>

1872
01:25:12.421 --> 01:25:13.760
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I'd beat your ass.</v>

1873
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:16.870
<v Speaker 6>I think I would rather have aids blood </v>
<v Speaker 6>thrown in my face.</v>

1874
01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:19.400
<v Speaker 6>You unscrewing a vial?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1875
01:25:19.401 --> 01:25:21.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you'd get a guy with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>vial.</v>

1876
01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.620
<v Speaker 6>How big is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like a little.</v>

1877
01:25:24.621 --> 01:25:26.420
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like those little perfume samples.</v>

1878
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:27.650
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that broke on you.</v>

1879
01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:29.730
<v Speaker 6>What if somebody opened a door on it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if.</v>

1880
01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.240
<v Speaker 6>What if it's like a titanium.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a cool kills.</v>

1881
01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.310
<v Speaker 6>Someone like you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll go to jail for that.</v>

1882
01:25:37.311 --> 01:25:41.510
<v Speaker 6>If you willingly knowingly give someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>a attacking you,</v>

1883
01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:43.070
<v Speaker 6>you could just say you just threw some </v>
<v Speaker 6>blood.</v>

1884
01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:44.290
<v Speaker 6>Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why not just have.</v>

1885
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:46.370
<v Speaker 6>That's better than like if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 6>attacked me,</v>

1886
01:25:46.371 --> 01:25:47.540
<v Speaker 6>you're allowed to shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1887
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:49.220
<v Speaker 6>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

1888
01:25:49.221 --> 01:25:49.630
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he.</v>

1889
01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.230
<v Speaker 6>He attacked me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think some blood on him.</v>

1890
01:25:51.231 --> 01:25:53.280
<v Speaker 6>I think that's less than shooting </v>
<v Speaker 6>science attack.</v>

1891
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:58.610
<v Speaker 6>The dumbest thing I've ever walked the </v>
<v Speaker 6>face of the earth.</v>

1892
01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:03.700
<v Speaker 6>You really are the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Blood probably is cheap and like a guy </v>

1893
01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.791
<v Speaker 6>that has aids could sell his blood and </v>
<v Speaker 6>make his own weapons for you and then </v>

1894
01:26:06.791 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 6>that could help him pay his bills for </v>
<v Speaker 6>having aids.</v>

1895
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you?</v>

1896
01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Instead of giving him aids kinsmen </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll mess with them temporarily.</v>

1897
01:26:13.311 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Like mercury poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't look.</v>

1898
01:26:14.781 --> 01:26:19.781
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes this far out and fucking spazzy </v>

01:26:19.781 --> 01:26:21.130
<v Speaker 1>have aids and you're looking for ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>part of his brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that forum sentencing support as aids.</v>

1902
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:33.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a very specific form of AIDS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only hits.</v>

1903
01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>He hits one area of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the form logical sentences.</v>

1904
01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:39.200
<v Speaker 1>That part as ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1905
01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Had AIDS at the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like 23.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nervous.</v>

1909
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Think of all the girls you fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a condom.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Google first came with living in Boston.</v>

1911

<v Speaker 1>you don't have time to put a condom on.</v>

1912
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Girls will get angry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>could get away from those monsters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1944
01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:32.090
<v Speaker 6>she uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't live in the city and so she got </v>

1945
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:35.211
<v Speaker 6>pregnant and then she came back and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>had to like sell all this stuff to pay </v>

1946
01:28:35.211 --> 01:28:37.560
<v Speaker 6>for the baby hammer or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's called abortion.</v>

1947
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:38.480
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1948
01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.220
<v Speaker 6>then I found out from a friend that knew</v>
<v Speaker 6>or there's like,</v>

1949
01:28:41.221 --> 01:28:43.050
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's been doing heroin lately.</v>

1950
01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:43.400
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

1951
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:48.430
<v Speaker 6>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess she's been doing heroin a lot </v>

1952
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.430
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's just fucked up and I'm thinking,</v>

1953
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:49.530
<v Speaker 6>oh great,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fucked a heroin addict,</v>

1954
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:50.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with no condom on,</v>

1955
01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:52.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm like thinking.</v>

1956
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.640
<v Speaker 6>And then one day I have no nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She called me up,</v>

1957
01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:55.230
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>

1958
01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:57.660
<v Speaker 6>I need to talk to you about something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

1959
01:28:57.661 --> 01:28:57.960
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1960
01:28:57.970 --> 01:28:58.270
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1961
01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:00.130
<v Speaker 6>no bad color,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1962
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:03.570
<v Speaker 6>I hung up because my girlfriend was in </v>
<v Speaker 6>bed with me and I was like,</v>

1963
01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:06.420
<v Speaker 6>I can't talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And for a couple of years I was like,</v>

1964
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:11.480
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what did she want to talk to me about </v>

1965
01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:11.480
<v Speaker 6>it?</v>

1966
01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.740
<v Speaker 6>And then so then I went on Google when </v>
<v Speaker 6>Google first came out and I'm like,</v>

1967
01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.490
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking any kind of symptoms I have</v>

1968
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.560
<v Speaker 6>noticed I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one was like sweating at night and </v>

1969
01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:21.560
<v Speaker 6>I'm like typing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sweating at night.</v>

1970
01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:21.560
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1971
01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:22.200
<v Speaker 6>aids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I'll be like,</v>

1972
01:29:22.201 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 6>I want to say that and I got to like </v>
<v Speaker 6>type in something else,</v>

1973
01:29:24.571 --> 01:29:26.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a headache or something that,</v>

1974
01:29:26.971 --> 01:29:27.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>aids,</v>

1975
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:32.590
<v Speaker 6>it kept on going back to AIDS.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for a couple years I was freaked out </v>

1976
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:34.010
<v Speaker 6>and finally I had some kind of a mole </v>
<v Speaker 6>removed and they,</v>

1977
01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:35.760
<v Speaker 6>they had to do a full blood thing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1978
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:38.880
<v Speaker 6>can you add the aids bonus test to that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was fine,</v>

1979
01:29:38.881 --> 01:29:43.881
<v Speaker 6>but it was such a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then later I found out that she </v>

1980
01:29:43.881 --> 01:29:43.881
<v Speaker 6>wanted to tell me that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1981
01:29:43.881 --> 01:29:48.560
<v Speaker 6>she didn't ha was pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she never gotten an abortion and that </v>

1982
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.590
<v Speaker 6>she just wanted money to buy more </v>
<v Speaker 6>heroin.</v>

1983
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 6>She had a confessed to you 10 steps.</v>

1984
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those things while steps </v>

1985
01:29:58.820 --> 01:29:58.820
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1986
01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:02.421
<v Speaker 2>You have to right the wrongs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever dated someone that was an </v>

1987
01:30:02.421 --> 01:30:03.930
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on two dates with a girl wants.</v>

1988
01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:06.090
<v Speaker 2>It was really cool and it turns out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be an alcoholic.</v>

1989
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.130
<v Speaker 2>The first day we had a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1990
01:30:08.131 --> 01:30:09.570
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this chick is so cool.</v>

1991
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.420
<v Speaker 2>She didn't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we did.</v>

1992
01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:17.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just hung out and I remember talking </v>

1993
01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:17.480
<v Speaker 2>to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1994
01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.030

<v Speaker 2>So normal.</v>

1995
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And then the next night it was a at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>bar in Hollywood where there was going </v>

1996
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:26.970

<v Speaker 2>there before me with her friends and she</v>

<v Speaker 2>hammered right away,</v>

1998
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:36.650
<v Speaker 2>hammered and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for some reason mad at me and I </v>

1999
01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:38.460
<v Speaker 2>hadn't done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had done like nothing.</v>

2000
01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I just got there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2001
01:30:40.081 --> 01:30:40.830
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

2002
01:30:43.890 --> 01:30:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2003
01:30:45.810 --> 01:30:47.160
<v Speaker 2>why you so drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2004

<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

2005
01:30:48.901 --> 01:30:50.430
<v Speaker 2>where are your friends if someone here </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you?</v>

2006
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm finding myself like she pulls away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from women.</v>

2007
01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Women are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this one was,</v>

2008
01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:59.280
<v Speaker 2>was never bought one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knocked a glass over and it was like</v>

2009
01:30:59.281 --> 01:31:04.281
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal stumbled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost a shoe and get her shoe and put it </v>

2010
01:31:04.281 --> 01:31:04.281
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2011
01:31:04.281 --> 01:31:05.850
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked you.</v>

2012
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Like the first date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2013
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.200
<v Speaker 2>this girl is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She totally was like girlfriend </v>

2014
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:12.200
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was fun.</v>

2015
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.140
<v Speaker 2>She was friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was nice.</v>

2016
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next night,</v>

2017
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.680
<v Speaker 2>just like to the point of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you ever hang out with </v>

2018
01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.190
<v Speaker 2>someone who gets that drunk go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh God.</v>

2019
01:31:23.191 --> 01:31:28.191
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't get personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then she really will be mad about </v>

2020
01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:30.351
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's also when you look real </v>

2021
01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:32.670
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism in the eyes and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>floating around with the rest of us.</v>

2022
01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Like most people that I know that drink </v>
<v Speaker 2>could not drink from now to the,</v>

2023
01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 2>like between us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Red Duncan,</v>

2024
01:31:40.210 --> 01:31:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>

2025
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.420
<v Speaker 2>all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sat around and we,</v>

2026
01:31:45.421 --> 01:31:50.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we found out that one of us did </v>

2027
01:31:50.421 --> 01:31:50.640
<v Speaker 2>never drank again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that one of us,</v>

2028
01:31:50.641 --> 01:31:51.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just uh,</v>

2029
01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of us just drinks every night now.</v>

2030
01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:58.720
<v Speaker 2>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be more likely to believe that </v>

2031
01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:58.720
<v Speaker 2>they would just give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2032
01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any of us would have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem</v>

2033
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:03.700
<v Speaker 6>giving it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I gave it up the other day for four days</v>

2034
01:32:03.701 --> 01:32:06.640
<v Speaker 6>because I got so drunk Thursday for four</v>
<v Speaker 6>days.</v>

2035
01:32:06.930 --> 01:32:08.170
<v Speaker 6>And did you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did you hear what I did?</v>

2036
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:10.690
<v Speaker 6>How drunk I got Thursday?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even tell you this.</v>

2037
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.410
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I went to,</v>

2038
01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:13.210
<v Speaker 6>that was going to say though,</v>

2039
01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:17.370
<v Speaker 5>but is that before you say this though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that that's most of us,</v>

2040
01:32:17.371 --> 01:32:19.980
<v Speaker 5>but we all do know one person who's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That way.</v>

2041
01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:25.250
<v Speaker 5>We know one person who you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You give them a couple of drinks and </v>

2042
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:27.310
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I didn't know it existed until I met</v>

2043
01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.490
<v Speaker 5>people in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grew up.</v>

2044
01:32:29.491 --> 01:32:34.491
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know anybody like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you meet people in comedy in </v>

2045
01:32:34.491 --> 01:32:34.491
<v Speaker 5>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

2046
01:32:34.491 --> 01:32:38.211
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's true that I remember there's this </v>

2047
01:32:38.211 --> 01:32:38.820
<v Speaker 5>one booker who is super cool and then he</v>
<v Speaker 5>would just be really mean to me.</v>

2048
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:43.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the enemies in comedy and I never </v>

2049
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.870
<v Speaker 5>understood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2050
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:44.610
<v Speaker 5>what did I do wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why is he mad at me?</v>

2051
01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:47.280
<v Speaker 5>And I found out he was a raging </v>
<v Speaker 5>alcoholic and if you're not,</v>

2052
01:32:47.490 --> 01:32:50.100
<v Speaker 5>if you're unaware of those types of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people or how they act,</v>

2053
01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:52.850
<v Speaker 5>you don't know how to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I never knew what it was.</v>

2054
01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:55.750
<v Speaker 5>So bizarre when they literally change </v>
<v Speaker 5>personalities.</v>

2055
01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:58.290
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it's you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And not only that,</v>

2056
01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.180
<v Speaker 5>you're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're trapped with a crazy person.</v>

<v Speaker 6>going to eat,</v>

2066
01:33:21.151 --> 01:33:22.290

2071
01:33:35.151 --> 01:33:35.151
<v Speaker 6>on the hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I got so fucking drunk that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I blacked out.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I completely don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is the outcome?</v>

2074
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:42.900
<v Speaker 6>What's regular proof?</v>

2078
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:49.440

2079
01:33:49.441 --> 01:33:52.140
<v Speaker 6>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's way more powerful than Tequila.</v>

2080
01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:53.910
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And people making themselves.</v>

2090
01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:13.500

<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>are you alone?</v>

2092
01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:19.820
<v Speaker 6>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that night I got home and I was going </v>

2093
01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:19.950
<v Speaker 6>through my phone and I was remembering </v>
<v Speaker 6>all the shit that happened,</v>

2094
01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:22.530
<v Speaker 6>train piece things together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the things I did was at the,</v>

2095
01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.320
<v Speaker 6>at the show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody was yelling out Veronica's name</v>

2096
01:34:25.321 --> 01:34:27.600
<v Speaker 6>when she was on stage at the nightly </v>
<v Speaker 6>show and he was like,</v>

2097
01:34:27.601 --> 01:34:30.080
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2098
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:35.130
<v Speaker 6>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I decided to make fun of them and </v>

2099
01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:35.130
<v Speaker 6>outdo his heckling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I was,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I have it on tape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's on youtube.</v>

2102
01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:45.050

<v Speaker 6>Louder and louder it ever in the eye is </v>

2103
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:48.981
<v Speaker 6>looking back like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is this guy wants Ronica </v>

2104
01:34:48.981 --> 01:34:50.400
<v Speaker 6>so you're not tackling the heckling.</v>

2105
01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:57.520
<v Speaker 6>Why we are so inclined to do the video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Video is hilarious though.</v>

2106
01:34:58.050 --> 01:34:59.830
<v Speaker 6>If you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Veronica,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like all these people kept on coming up.</v>

2199
01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:31.710
<v Speaker 6>But Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 6>all these people,</v>

2203
01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:36.950
<v Speaker 6>my girlfriend's high,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2204

<v Speaker 6>like buttholes showing out and,</v>

2205
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:45.430
<v Speaker 6>and it was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the whole girl ain't even fashionable.</v>

2206
01:38:47.190 --> 01:38:52.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so like all these people kept on </v>

2207
01:38:52.190 --> 01:38:52.190
<v Speaker 6>coming up for money and stuff and her </v>
<v Speaker 6>response,</v>

2208
01:38:52.190 --> 01:38:56.720
<v Speaker 6>like her defense mechanism,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm going to act a crazy person.</v>

2215
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:12.630
<v Speaker 6>I don't think I could do that or think </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just too much confidence.</v>

2216
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 6>Liquid confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's Halloween and if there's ever a </v>
<v Speaker 6>time the butthole was,</v>

<v Speaker 6>guy with his dick out and he goes,</v>

2242
01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:24.861

<v Speaker 6>Like you done this to me many times.</v>

2243
01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:31.190
<v Speaker 6>I think we've all seen enough disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 6>crap like just from him sending a text </v>

2244
01:40:32.161 --> 01:40:35.940
<v Speaker 6>message and it's an image you can't see </v>
<v Speaker 6>what it is.</v>

2245
01:40:35.941 --> 01:40:37.800
<v Speaker 6>Like it's at nighttime at a comedy club </v>
<v Speaker 6>or something like that.</v>

2246
01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:42.980
<v Speaker 6>I clicked on the image and it's a black </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy with a giant Dick and a white guy </v>

2247
01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:46.731
<v Speaker 6>sucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was funny when it's a black guy's </v>

2248
01:40:46.731 --> 01:40:46.731
<v Speaker 6>penis funnier,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no jail.</v>

2249
01:40:46.731 --> 01:40:51.280
<v Speaker 6>This last weekend it was my girlfriend's</v>
<v Speaker 6>birthday and she was turning 30 and I </v>

2250
01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.210
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be a material center.</v>

2251
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:54.370
<v Speaker 6>Neurotic cake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what they do</v>

2252
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.400
<v Speaker 5>when you call for the erotic cake is </v>
<v Speaker 5>they take you through the entire order </v>

2253
01:40:59.400 --> 01:40:59.680
<v Speaker 5>process and at the end tell you how much</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

2254
01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.810
<v Speaker 5>And it was like $200.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we're like,</v>

2255
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:06.870
<v Speaker 5>not even close I guess was a regular </v>
<v Speaker 5>tank.</v>

2256
01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:12.120
<v Speaker 5>You have to pay more for the buck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it depends on how much like at the </v>

2257
01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.581
<v Speaker 5>grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$100 to make a dick can have it </v>

2258
01:41:14.581 --> 01:41:16.921
<v Speaker 5>delivered to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was like in Houston it was so </v>

2259
01:41:16.921 --> 01:41:20.161
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable because I'm already </v>
<v Speaker 5>calling them like it's like a big and I </v>

2260
01:41:20.161 --> 01:41:21.340
<v Speaker 5>had to get a black penis because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>funnier for some peanuts on the cake.</v>

2261
01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:22.250
<v Speaker 5>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alright.</v>

2262
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.280
<v Speaker 5>And he was so over his job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2263
01:41:24.281 --> 01:41:26.200
<v Speaker 5>you won't come.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want hair on the balls.</v>

2264
01:41:26.201 --> 01:41:27.610
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I literally was like,</v>

2265
01:41:27.611 --> 01:41:28.930
<v Speaker 5>please don't ask me that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's uncomfortable.</v>

2266
01:41:28.931 --> 01:41:31.210
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I do is what I do.</v>

2267
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:34.840
<v Speaker 5>So for 200 bucks you got a black penis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I had them write and have an elegant</v>

2268
01:41:34.841 --> 01:41:38.320
<v Speaker 5>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to be like,</v>

2269
01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:42.090
<v Speaker 5>so could you dirties?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I wrote something nice.</v>

2270
01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:47.830
<v Speaker 5>If you're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would you not want to say that?</v>

2271
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:52.930
<v Speaker 5>I wanted it to retain some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Saved that dignity for the tourists.</v>

2272
01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:53.990
<v Speaker 5>Thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:41:53.991 --> 01:41:58.991
<v Speaker 5>You started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to always get boob cakes from my </v>

2274
01:41:58.991 --> 01:41:58.991
<v Speaker 5>family growing up from like 12 on or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

2275
01:41:58.991 --> 01:42:01.000
<v Speaker 5>From them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from them or for them from them,</v>

2276
01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:06.001
<v Speaker 5>like every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like the big thing that my dad </v>

2277
01:42:06.001 --> 01:42:07.210
<v Speaker 5>was 12 or 13 and they were actual </v>
<v Speaker 5>nipples.</v>

2278
01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.680
<v Speaker 5>Well they weren't real enablers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were made out of Hershey kisses </v>

2279
01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.730
<v Speaker 5>Hershey's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it would look like two white </v>

2280
01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:16.730
<v Speaker 5>nipples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called quip.</v>

2281
01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:17.860
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it would look like that.</v>

2282
01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:19.080
<v Speaker 5>It would look like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoops.</v>

2283
01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:19.990
<v Speaker 5>It's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2284
01:42:19.991 --> 01:42:21.590
<v Speaker 5>like I don't think there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2285
01:42:21.670 --> 01:42:26.670
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I feel like there was like gyms </v>

2286
01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:26.670
<v Speaker 5>and the batter or something.</v>

2287
01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:26.670
<v Speaker 5>I take that back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't full boob.</v>

2288
01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:31.651
<v Speaker 5>It was the one where the bikini,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you could see a little boob like in </v>

2289
01:42:31.651 --> 01:42:35.241
<v Speaker 5>it a cakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the older I got I started having </v>

2290
01:42:35.241 --> 01:42:35.350
<v Speaker 5>nipples but my 18th birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the older I got,</v>

2291
01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:40.420
<v Speaker 5>I started moving up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I was 18 with and boy would </v>

2292
01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.130
<v Speaker 5>have changed the cake when I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a black one.</v>

2293
01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.370
<v Speaker 5>You think you ever molested that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't remember.</v>

2294
01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:47.330
<v Speaker 5>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope not.</v>

2295
01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:48.790
<v Speaker 5>I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think something,</v>

2296
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:51.370
<v Speaker 5>something must've happened though right </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you were younger that you're trying</v>

2297
01:42:51.371 --> 01:42:55.180
<v Speaker 5>to block out bouquets growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is weird.</v>

2298
01:42:55.300 --> 01:43:00.300
<v Speaker 5>Why was it cleveland cakes and then I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think when I was 16 it started becoming </v>

2299
01:43:03.401 --> 01:43:08.401
<v Speaker 5>big cakes and almost 18 was black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had open vaginas,</v>

2300
01:43:08.771 --> 01:43:12.010
<v Speaker 5>vaginas with like who is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me slice into this.</v>

2301
01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:15.530
<v Speaker 5>This looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The midwest boom cakes were I guess more</v>

2302
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:16.770
<v Speaker 5>accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2303
01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:19.770
<v Speaker 5>Social well there wasn't a lot to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2304
01:43:19.771 --> 01:43:22.030
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think just anything,</v>

2305
01:43:22.031 --> 01:43:22.720
<v Speaker 5>it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2306
01:43:22.721 --> 01:43:26.350
<v Speaker 5>people that lived in West Virginia and </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're from or where in Ohio,</v>

2307
01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:26.980
<v Speaker 5>Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ohio,</v>

2308
01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:29.200
<v Speaker 5>but I think that whole little chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 5>area,</v>

2309
01:43:29.201 --> 01:43:32.500
<v Speaker 5>I think people were had to look like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sick sense of humor in Texas.</v>

2310
01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.270
<v Speaker 5>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember her sense of humor.</v>

2311
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:39.390
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember like you'd go to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd go to these people's houses and </v>

2312
01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:43.111
<v Speaker 5>they would have like little statues that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were silly and there was a penis </v>

2313
01:43:43.111 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 5>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know,</v>

2314
01:43:43.421 --> 01:43:45.250
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was at your grandma's house.</v>

2315
01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:50.251
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's your grandpa's elephants on </v>

2316
01:43:50.251 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 5>there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You lived in a sad world,</v>

2317
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:58.170
<v Speaker 1>then you go cut wood country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2318
01:43:59.410 --> 01:44:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a Stephen King Movie Kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2319
01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.710
<v Speaker 1>it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a Stephen King.</v>

2320
01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:09.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like people were just not </v>

2321
01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:12.570
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had more humor for humor or sexually </v>

2322
01:44:12.570 --> 01:44:13.260
<v Speaker 1>sexual humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more just perfect.</v>

2323
01:44:13.261 --> 01:44:18.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like your friends in </v>

2324
01:44:18.261 --> 01:44:18.261
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>

2325
01:44:18.261 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking within the dirty comedians </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hanging out with here.</v>

2326
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that they were like,</v>

2327
01:44:22.741 --> 01:44:27.741
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up feeling like everyone had a </v>

2328
01:44:27.741 --> 01:44:31.510
<v Speaker 1>dirty joke thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone's families had like dirty </v>

2329
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:34.781
<v Speaker 1>magazines and everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find the dad's got like some </v>

2330
01:44:34.781 --> 01:44:38.651
<v Speaker 1>playboys and like one or two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not like on the mantle boot cakes.</v>

2331
01:44:38.781 --> 01:44:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I think we're more accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2332
01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that was normal for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that get a boob cleavage cake </v>

2333
01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:46.300
<v Speaker 1>when you're 16.</v>

2334
01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2335
01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:48.230
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>

2336
01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems weird to me.</v>

2337
01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mom have to order it now.</v>

2338
01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.280
<v Speaker 1>My mom would never give me a boot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She should give me Jesus.</v>

2339
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:58.220
<v Speaker 1>You ever have one of your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2340
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:59.080
<v Speaker 1>who had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2341
01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.480
<v Speaker 1>like a buddy of his friend's mom now </v>
<v Speaker 1>just know anybody to do that.</v>

2342
01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2343
01:45:04.581 --> 01:45:09.581
<v Speaker 1>I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew one kid can only see your eyes </v>

2344
01:45:09.581 --> 01:45:09.581
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember one kid who,</v>

2345
01:45:09.581 --> 01:45:11.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked his friend's mom is friends while</v>

2346
01:45:11.251 --> 01:45:16.251
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of a freak and I think they </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoked weed together to bang his </v>

2347
01:45:16.701 --> 01:45:18.650
<v Speaker 1>friend's mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a single mom.</v>

2348
01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I was like 16 or 17 and I think he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year older than us.</v>

2349
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:29.170
<v Speaker 1>He made it been 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been like a year out of </v>

2350
01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:31.571
<v Speaker 1>school and we were sophomores mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying the student's mom for the kid </v>

2351
01:45:32.970 --> 01:45:35.490
<v Speaker 1>whose mom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2352
01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:45:37.341 --> 01:45:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Dudes don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when that.</v>

2354
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was in the boy scouts,</v>

2355
01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:46.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the fucking 18 year old kids was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting on my mom in front of me.</v>

2356
01:45:46.081 --> 01:45:50.210
<v Speaker 1>And it was for the guys who just got out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the.</v>

2357
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:54.000
<v Speaker 1>He's flirting with my mom about the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom was in her thirties.</v>

2358
01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:56.390
<v Speaker 1>She was still pretty hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2359
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:58.790
<v Speaker 1>It was gross though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a little kid going,</v>

2360
01:45:58.791 --> 01:46:00.770
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thinking,</v>

2361
01:46:00.970 --> 01:46:02.840
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with your mom?</v>

2362
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never thought about anyone voting </v>

2363
01:46:07.930 --> 01:46:08.480
<v Speaker 1>that's probably going to go through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head one day.</v>

2364
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:13.830
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to tell some little</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 year old kid to get the fuck away </v>

2365
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.830
<v Speaker 1>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're taking your kid to school.</v>

2366
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's having to take.</v>

2367
01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever want to like teach them?</v>

2368
01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Show them what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2369
01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.160
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grab a boy by the hair.</v>

2370
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Come here and try to find a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2371
01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I really don't have a thing for guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are younger than me at all and so I</v>

2372
01:46:30.810 --> 01:46:35.810
<v Speaker 1>just get very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a PA that works on our show who </v>

2373
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:37.280
<v Speaker 1>is adorable and so cute and I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to him,</v>

2374
01:46:37.281 --> 01:46:39.680
<v Speaker 1>but not in the way that I want to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with him,</v>

2375
01:46:39.681 --> 01:46:44.681
<v Speaker 1>but I know it's hot every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is Joey and every time I see </v>

2376
01:46:44.681 --> 01:46:45.600
<v Speaker 1>him I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2377
01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:49.200
<v Speaker 1>he's so hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>

2378
01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.640
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sleep with him.</v>

2379
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I just want to like hug him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no sexual attraction.</v>

2380
01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I can tell someone's hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have no sexual attraction.</v>

2381
01:46:56.101 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Anyone younger than me because it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>me feel so old.</v>

2382
01:46:59.350 --> 01:47:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't like feeling old in my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

2383
01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not attractive.</v>

2384
01:47:03.841 --> 01:47:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everything starts to hurt.</v>

2385
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I feel so old as it is because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart for 28,</v>

2386
01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:16.560
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is that a problem </v>

2387
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:16.560
<v Speaker 1>must be a problem with dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes.</v>

2388
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.510
<v Speaker 1>The most guys in their twenties or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumber than girls,</v>

2389
01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:22.520
<v Speaker 1>their twenties because of testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone fucking clouds your mind </v>

2390
01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:26.421
<v Speaker 1>and really massively slows down your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to accumulate information </v>

2391
01:47:26.421 --> 01:47:26.680
<v Speaker 1>because there's just so busy chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted.</v>

2392
01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're in your early </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties.</v>

2393
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He barely learn a God damn thing until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like almost 30.</v>

2394
01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:34.590
<v Speaker 1>You're a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the feeling that a lot of guys,</v>

2395
01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:38.820
<v Speaker 1>anybody that knows me obviously isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting on me like they know me,</v>

2396
01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but I get.</v>

2397
01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I get this vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was totally one of the gang,</v>

2398
01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:49.370
<v Speaker 1>but I get this feeling that comics who I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know just from seeing around different </v>

2399
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:53.571
<v Speaker 1>clubs or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're a little afraid of me and </v>

2400
01:47:53.571 --> 01:47:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not because I want to like hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone's feelings,</v>

2401
01:47:53.731 --> 01:47:55.500
<v Speaker 1>but if you come up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say something stupid,</v>

2402
01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be like the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be like,</v>

2403
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:59.550
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they get nervous,</v>

2404
01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.070
<v Speaker 1>but I don't mean to act like a person if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come talk to.</v>

2405
01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Some men are just fucked up talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and some men are so insecure when </v>

2406
01:48:09.110 --> 01:48:13.371
<v Speaker 1>it comes to talking to women that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fall apart and so quickly </v>

2407
01:48:13.371 --> 01:48:13.920
<v Speaker 1>translates to hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what it is.</v>

2408
01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I realized that when I had a friend who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an ugly dude who broke it down to me</v>

2409
01:48:18.511 --> 01:48:20.340
<v Speaker 1>once where he's talking about girls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2410
01:48:20.341 --> 01:48:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to tell them from a girl's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective and I'm like,</v>

2411
01:48:23.401 --> 01:48:28.401
<v Speaker 1>just imagine if you're a girl and a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you is constantly trying to fuck </v>

2412
01:48:28.401 --> 01:48:28.401
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

2413
01:48:28.401 --> 01:48:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2414
01:48:28.411 --> 01:48:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean in any said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's the deal.</v>

2415
01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:31.950
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit,</v>

2416
01:48:31.951 --> 01:48:33.150
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good looking.</v>

2417
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:38.510
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just I'm not so they don't not </v>

2418
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:39.951
<v Speaker 1>attracted to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have to try harder and forced </v>

2419
01:48:39.951 --> 01:48:40.770
<v Speaker 1>myself in say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2420
01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.800
<v Speaker 1>someone will give in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone will just be overwhelmed by his </v>

2421
01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day they get angry</v>

2422
01:48:46.261 --> 01:48:49.000
<v Speaker 1>at you and for a lot of these men it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes.</v>

2423
01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:54.160
<v Speaker 1>They just have this direct association </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their head with women with feeling </v>

2424
01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.401
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling rejected and they just want to </v>

2425
01:48:58.401 --> 01:48:59.730
<v Speaker 1>strike out and that's where a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that anger towards women comes from</v>

2426
01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:03.870
<v Speaker 1>like my twitter feed or my facebook </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown men and this is the weirdest thing</v>

2427
01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:05.580
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand guys can be gross.</v>

2428
01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't fault anyone for you know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck you.</v>

2429
01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:09.460
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2430
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:13.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what people say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I go on my facebook page and you've</v>

2431
01:49:13.711 --> 01:49:15.960
<v Speaker 1>written something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fuck you so hard,</v>

2432
01:49:15.961 --> 01:49:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I come to Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that.</v>

2433
01:49:17.370 --> 01:49:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And your facebook picture is of you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife.</v>

2434
01:49:20.730 --> 01:49:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

2435
01:49:22.351 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Like you just had such an uncontrollable</v>
<v Speaker 1>boner that you had to ejaculate words on</v>

2436
01:49:26.491 --> 01:49:30.060
<v Speaker 1>my page and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not flattering and it's or people,</v>

2437
01:49:30.061 --> 01:49:31.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like really mean,</v>

2438
01:49:31.051 --> 01:49:36.051
<v Speaker 1>like I've been on podcasts before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even probably today and people will be </v>

2439
01:49:36.051 --> 01:49:39.531
<v Speaker 1>like such a fucking color door folk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're aggressive and you're like,</v>

2440
01:49:39.841 --> 01:49:44.841
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I spoke like men get amped for </v>

2441
01:49:44.841 --> 01:49:47.380
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to check my twitter feed right</v>

2442
01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:47.680
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2443
01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:53.670
<v Speaker 5>How you're really going to open it up to</v>
<v Speaker 5>date,</v>

2444
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:59.160
<v Speaker 5>a woman scorned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the word I think a guy scored </v>

2445
01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.520
<v Speaker 5>and it's probably worse because they get</v>
<v Speaker 5>rapey raping a lot of men,</v>

2446
01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:06.840
<v Speaker 5>especially dudes who don't do well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do associate women with being the </v>

2447
01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:06.840
<v Speaker 5>source of their misery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2448
01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 5>It's unfortunate and you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because prostitution is illegal.</v>

2449
01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:12.880
<v Speaker 5>That's why because of prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2450
01:50:12.881 --> 01:50:17.881
<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll be brothels and someone can </v>

2451
01:50:17.881 --> 01:50:17.881
<v Speaker 5>take care of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Physical needs.</v>

2452
01:50:17.881 --> 01:50:18.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that women should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>prostitutes,</v>

2453
01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:22.420
<v Speaker 5>but I am saying there's some women who </v>
<v Speaker 5>are going to be prostitutes and it's not</v>

2454
01:50:22.421 --> 01:50:24.400
<v Speaker 5>a bad thing necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It ain't a bad thing.</v>

2455
01:50:24.401 --> 01:50:27.550
<v Speaker 5>It's a service to the community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's our idea that's bad one.</v>

2456
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:30.640
<v Speaker 5>So okay to massage a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not okay to massage his dick.</v>

2457
01:50:30.850 --> 01:50:34.210
<v Speaker 5>I say bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it should be legal or illegal.</v>

2458
01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:36.480
<v Speaker 5>Totally illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should be regulated.</v>

2459
01:50:36.490 --> 01:50:38.170
<v Speaker 5>The girls should be checked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should do it.</v>

2460
01:50:38.171 --> 01:50:39.910
<v Speaker 5>Like the handle it in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2461
01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:41.530
<v Speaker 5>we're so because we're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2462
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:44.470
<v Speaker 5>I think we've talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

2463
01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:47.020
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grain alcohol is actually 100.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to comprehend that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never sent out God.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Work isn't an fund to be a comedian.</v>

2489
01:51:51.431 --> 01:51:55.170
<v Speaker 5>It'd be fucking ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking never added things.</v>

2490
01:51:55.240 --> 01:52:00.240
<v Speaker 5>I went to South Africa when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>high school and absence was legal there </v>

2491
01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:03.781
<v Speaker 5>and it wasn't legal here yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you hear about the Green Butterfly </v>

2492
01:52:03.781 --> 01:52:04.740
<v Speaker 5>and hallucinating and it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels like black licorice,</v>

2493
01:52:04.741 --> 01:52:06.410
<v Speaker 5>like it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked it.</v>

2494
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:08.920
<v Speaker 5>Didn't drinking a drink and drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get with the sugar.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The thing I just got shit faced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No hallucinations because it's not made </v>

2496
01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:15.400
<v Speaker 5>with wormwood anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what makes you do that.</v>

2497
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:18.940
<v Speaker 5>Can drink absinthe all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will not hallucinate from it.</v>

2498
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:23.990
<v Speaker 5>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does anybody make it the other way with </v>

2499
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:23.990
<v Speaker 5>the wormwood?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody had done it.</v>

2500
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:26.380
<v Speaker 5>So in general I think poisoning you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

2501
01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:28.030
<v Speaker 5>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't like it's just,</v>

2502
01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:31.330
<v Speaker 5>it used to be that way and it's not an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not quite the same as drunk.</v>

2503
01:52:31.330 --> 01:52:32.160
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little bit.</v>

2504
01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.520
<v Speaker 5>I sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say I describe it as that.</v>

2505
01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:37.150
<v Speaker 5>It was like a cousin of drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I also drink a lot of other stuff.</v>

2506
01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:42.660

01:58:25.801 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 5>does it make you love her?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Little bit less.</v>

2621
01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:29.940
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's disappointing.</v>

2622
01:58:29.941 --> 01:58:31.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like finding out your daughter </v>
<v Speaker 5>does.</v>

2623
01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:37.590
<v Speaker 5>She's a good girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean look at that face,</v>

2624
01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:42.360
<v Speaker 5>but that's what my dog does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We eat.</v>

2625
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:45.250
<v Speaker 5>It's not like she takes every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's not going to pass up on it if it's</v>

2626
01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:46.010
<v Speaker 5>on the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2627
01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.640
<v Speaker 5>it's got to have a bit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't you park on gross just with your </v>

2628
01:58:52.451 --> 01:58:54.000
<v Speaker 5>pets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with your daughters?</v>

2629
01:58:54.001 --> 01:58:55.930
<v Speaker 5>Like could you like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever get this like aggressive?</v>

2630
01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 5>Like with my daughter's?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little bit,</v>

2631
01:58:59.201 --> 01:59:04.201
<v Speaker 5>but not really with my pets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was freaked my cat out and my dogs </v>

2632
01:59:04.201 --> 01:59:04.910
<v Speaker 5>pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't really want him getting him to</v>

2633
01:59:04.911 --> 01:59:05.920
<v Speaker 5>do well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to your face,</v>

2634
01:59:05.921 --> 01:59:10.921
<v Speaker 5>but when you love something in my act </v>
<v Speaker 5>they talk about how I want to rip her </v>

2635
01:59:10.921 --> 01:59:10.921
<v Speaker 5>face off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you love something so much,</v>

2636
01:59:10.921 --> 01:59:12.930
<v Speaker 5>I just want to hurt it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's a girl thing.</v>

2637
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:15.370

<v Speaker 5>that's a girl.</v>

2638
01:59:15.371 --> 01:59:20.371
<v Speaker 5>That's why relationships always end up </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking hurt you.</v>

2639
01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:25.240
<v Speaker 5>The little freak seems like that's true </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

2640
01:59:25.241 --> 01:59:29.140
<v Speaker 5>Like good girls always want to hurt with</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They made a fake video about beating him</v>
<v Speaker 5>up and everybody gets so excited that </v>

2671
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:45.910
<v Speaker 5>it'd be that he got beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really horrible,</v>

2672
02:00:45.911 --> 02:00:50.911
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the first time because there </v>

2673
02:00:50.911 --> 02:00:50.911
<v Speaker 5>was one of the first celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things like that where it got fake.</v>

2674
02:00:50.911 --> 02:00:54.961
<v Speaker 5>Something like he punches him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't that a guy gets on stage and the </v>

<v Speaker 5>hate that he received must have been </v>

2680
02:01:09.961 --> 02:01:13.020
<v Speaker 5>horrific to know that people feel like </v>

<v Speaker 5>as an Austin,</v>

2691
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:41.990

<v Speaker 5>that's my spot.</v>

2698

<v Speaker 5>city.</v>

2699
02:02:00.141 --> 02:02:04.970
<v Speaker 5>Aside from when a fan brought a buck </v>
<v Speaker 5>knife to meet me on his belt.</v>

2700
02:02:04.971 --> 02:02:06.540
<v Speaker 5>So you saw it or was behind him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>what is your problem?</v>

2704
02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:11.630
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>where can I park?</v>

2707
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:16.730
<v Speaker 5>And they didn't care that I was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>headline and they're like a.</v>

2708
02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:19.850
<v Speaker 5>There was a hobby lobby across the </v>
<v Speaker 5>street across the freeway,</v>

2709
02:02:20.250 --> 02:02:22.220
<v Speaker 5>just park over at the hobby lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2710
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:25.490
<v Speaker 5>there's no parking from no hobby lobby.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'll just make the height the headliner.</v>

2712
02:02:27.970 --> 02:02:32.970
<v Speaker 5>That's not even true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know there's a back alley where </v>

2713
02:02:32.970 --> 02:02:32.970
<v Speaker 5>there's always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always park right behind.</v>

2714
02:02:32.970 --> 02:02:35.690
<v Speaker 5>Not only do they wait for us to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think we are men.</v>

2715
02:02:35.930 --> 02:02:36.640
<v Speaker 5>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

2716
02:02:36.641 --> 02:02:41.641
<v Speaker 5>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I should've been more assertive </v>

2717
02:02:41.641 --> 02:02:41.641
<v Speaker 5>and general.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should be more aggressive.</v>

2718
02:02:41.641 --> 02:02:42.920
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>was it a girl answering the phone?</v>

2719
02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:45.100
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she didn't know or maybe it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a night,</v>

2720
02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:47.660
<v Speaker 5>like a manager that didn't know and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>not the kind of person they'd be like,</v>

2721
02:02:47.661 --> 02:02:51.880
<v Speaker 5>do you know who I am?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's on her way.</v>

2722
02:02:52.690 --> 02:02:53.510
<v Speaker 5>Go get her.</v>

2723
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:59.780

<v Speaker 5>We're talking about cap cities.</v>

2724
02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:03.320
<v Speaker 5>You were saying you love Austin and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was saying I'll be in San Antonio.</v>

2725
02:03:03.650 --> 02:03:08.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you were talking about them not </v>

2726
02:03:08.650 --> 02:03:08.650
<v Speaker 5>giving you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2727
02:03:08.650 --> 02:03:08.650
<v Speaker 5>lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that that's like a girl.</v>

2728
02:03:08.650 --> 02:03:10.490
<v Speaker 5>The girl just didn't want like she was </v>
<v Speaker 5>answering the phone,</v>

2729
02:03:10.491 --> 02:03:13.100
<v Speaker 5>like fucking female comedian going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>come in and lie on.</v>

2730
02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:18.120
<v Speaker 5>Females ain't even even get it because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't even the first night and I </v>

2731
02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:22.611
<v Speaker 5>think it was so many times we don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize how a lot of people that have </v>

2732
02:03:22.611 --> 02:03:23.600
<v Speaker 5>jobs in general.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were in a comedy club.</v>

2733
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:28.750
<v Speaker 5>They're not necessarily up to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't really know what's going on </v>

2734
02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:32.280
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could've been that or maybe there was </v>

2735
02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:33.851
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there might've been something going on </v>

2736
02:03:33.851 --> 02:03:33.851
<v Speaker 5>where they were doing maintenance and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't park.</v>

2737
02:03:33.851 --> 02:03:37.091
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was such an odd thing and I as a </v>

2738
02:03:37.091 --> 02:03:37.091
<v Speaker 5>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so quick.</v>

2739
02:03:37.091 --> 02:03:41.640
<v Speaker 5>You're so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so easy to get labeled a mean name </v>

2740
02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:41.640
<v Speaker 5>that you stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I just,</v>

2741
02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:42.080
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I'm just very like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2742
02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:44.180
<v Speaker 5>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear that?</v>

2743
02:03:44.181 --> 02:03:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2744
02:03:45.010 --> 02:03:50.010
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is his name again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The good fired and brill who got fired </v>

2745
02:03:50.010 --> 02:03:50.010
<v Speaker 5>from letterman?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He say,</v>

2746
02:03:50.090 --> 02:03:51.140
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2747
02:03:51.141 --> 02:03:52.340
<v Speaker 5>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Women?</v>

2748
02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Something about how women try to be more</v>
<v Speaker 5>like men in their act and that's why </v>

2749
02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:01.961
<v Speaker 5>they're not funny or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I 100 percent think that there's no way </v>

2750
02:04:01.961 --> 02:04:02.720
<v Speaker 5>he got fired because of that one </v>
<v Speaker 5>comment.</v>

2751
02:04:03.170 --> 02:04:04.490
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get serious.</v>

2752
02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:09.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what else he did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no one stands up for women that </v>

2753
02:04:09.610 --> 02:04:12.790
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like women get raped every day and </v>

2754
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.790
<v Speaker 5>people can still keep their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably just a bad poker hand.</v>

2755
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:13.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2756
02:04:13.071 --> 02:04:18.071
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's different when you're on a show </v>

2757
02:04:18.071 --> 02:04:18.071
<v Speaker 5>like that where you hear the judge.</v>

2758
02:04:18.071 --> 02:04:18.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're the one who's a,</v>

2759
02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:23.620
<v Speaker 5>your job is to discern who's capable of </v>
<v Speaker 5>being on the show and if you say </v>

2760
02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:25.850
<v Speaker 5>something so blatantly sexist and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>blatantly judgmental,</v>

2761
02:04:25.851 --> 02:04:29.600
<v Speaker 5>like he's formed an opinion and it's one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the reasons why women can't be funny,</v>

2762
02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:31.620
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't even qualify it with know.</v>

2763
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:36.850
<v Speaker 5>There are some women that try to be like</v>
<v Speaker 5>men and you know that it's a balanced </v>

2764
02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:37.890
<v Speaker 5>and it's a balancing act,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which it is.</v>

2765
02:04:37.891 --> 02:04:40.650
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more difficult for a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some shitty comics,</v>

2766
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:43.680
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them are shitty and watch those</v>

2767
02:04:43.681 --> 02:04:48.681
<v Speaker 5>tapes and I've never sent in a tape so I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was actually upset that his sentence </v>

2768
02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:49.680
<v Speaker 5>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Except for Eliza Schlesinger,</v>

2769
02:04:49.681 --> 02:04:54.681
<v Speaker 5>she's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I genuinely thought I would be included </v>

2770
02:04:54.681 --> 02:04:57.801
<v Speaker 5>in the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were you upset when you hear shit like </v>

2771
02:04:57.801 --> 02:04:57.801
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like someone said,</v>

2772
02:04:57.801 --> 02:04:59.250
<v Speaker 5>do you feel like the debt like gives you</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a ramp that you have to like run up</v>

2773
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:01.440
<v Speaker 5>where everybody else has like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an even start?</v>

2774
02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:06.650
<v Speaker 5>I gotta be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel that my act is just so different </v>

2775
02:05:06.650 --> 02:05:10.911
<v Speaker 5>than every other girl that I just don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>include myself in the same category as </v>

2776
02:05:10.911 --> 02:05:13.260
<v Speaker 5>the most female comics was that I just </v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

2777
02:05:13.261 --> 02:05:14.550
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see the audience,</v>

2778
02:05:14.551 --> 02:05:19.551
<v Speaker 5>I see my material,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see topics that most women talk about </v>

2779
02:05:19.551 --> 02:05:20.820
<v Speaker 5>versus what I talk about and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>approaches and stuff like that.</v>

2780
02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 5>And I just have never viewed women as </v>
<v Speaker 5>the competition.</v>

2781
02:05:25.290 --> 02:05:29.240
<v Speaker 5>I think of everyone as a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just don't.</v>

2782
02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:31.380
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen a girl.</v>

2783
02:05:31.410 --> 02:05:36.410
<v Speaker 5>You really do though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really do think of people as the </v>

2784
02:05:36.410 --> 02:05:38.541
<v Speaker 5>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I always thought it was </v>

2785
02:05:38.541 --> 02:05:38.541
<v Speaker 5>fascinating because that was a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>competitive person,</v>

2786
02:05:38.541 --> 02:05:41.931
<v Speaker 5>but I tried to never look at other </v>
<v Speaker 5>comics has competition because I think </v>

2787
02:05:41.931 --> 02:05:43.350
<v Speaker 5>it's unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the way to look at comics as use</v>

2788
02:05:43.351 --> 02:05:45.810
<v Speaker 5>them for inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be inspired by them,</v>

2789
02:05:45.811 --> 02:05:48.170
<v Speaker 5>but when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like you're playing a game with</v>

2790
02:05:48.171 --> 02:05:49.200
<v Speaker 5>it to keep you from doing it.</v>

2791
02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:54.200
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're playing football </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they can keep you from getting the </v>

2792
02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:54.200
<v Speaker 5>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No direct competition.</v>

2793
02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:54.200
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2794
02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:54.340
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2795
02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:55.530
<v Speaker 5>you're smart about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2796
02:05:55.630 --> 02:05:58.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't go online and watch everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>else and going,</v>

2797
02:05:58.021 --> 02:05:59.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't Google other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like that,</v>

2798
02:05:59.731 --> 02:06:02.510
<v Speaker 5>but I don't ever watch other acts at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>clubs and stuff and I'll.</v>

2799
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:07.550
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I'll go on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll watch certain ones that I really </v>

2800
02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:07.550
<v Speaker 5>liked but I don't do it out of being </v>
<v Speaker 5>envious and I,</v>

2801
02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:08.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you keep an ear to it.</v>

2802
02:06:08.071 --> 02:06:13.071
<v Speaker 5>Oh that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he auditioned for that or she did this </v>

2803
02:06:13.071 --> 02:06:15.531
<v Speaker 5>or that's a showcase you get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like going and watching people online </v>

2804
02:06:15.531 --> 02:06:17.730
<v Speaker 5>because it gives me like a charge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get excited if I see somebody good.</v>

2805
02:06:17.731 --> 02:06:22.731
<v Speaker 5>Like if somebody sends me a clip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey check this guy out and I go watch </v>

2806
02:06:22.731 --> 02:06:22.731
<v Speaker 5>and it's really fun.</v>

2807
02:06:22.731 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking funny.</v>

2808
02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:26.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to write this or I'll get </v>
<v Speaker 5>charged up like,</v>

2809
02:06:26.431 --> 02:06:30.690
<v Speaker 5>well I want to create something cool </v>
<v Speaker 5>that does to me or does to someone else.</v>

2810
02:06:30.691 --> 02:06:34.140
<v Speaker 5>The way that did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt the first time I saw Dane Cook,</v>

2811
02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:35.670
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a long time ago,</v>

2812
02:06:35.671 --> 02:06:40.671
<v Speaker 5>this must have been five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I had just started and someone took </v>

2813
02:06:40.671 --> 02:06:42.180
<v Speaker 5>me the laugh factory and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that tour guides and it was fucking like</v>

2814
02:06:42.181 --> 02:06:44.010
<v Speaker 5>no one else had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When did you start with you?</v>

2815
02:06:44.890 --> 02:06:47.490
<v Speaker 5>I must.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I graduated college in 2005,</v>

2816
02:06:47.491 --> 02:06:49.270
<v Speaker 5>so maybe I start 2006.</v>
<v Speaker 5>2,000.</v>

2817
02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:52.590
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of amazing.</v>

2818
02:06:52.591 --> 02:06:53.120
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you want.</v>

<v Speaker 5>When I see comedy,</v>

2823
02:06:59.641 --> 02:07:01.470
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes me happy.</v>

2824
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:02.340
<v Speaker 5>I've never think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
