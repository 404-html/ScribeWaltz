00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>so intuitive.</v>

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Just point and click and drag and drop all things.</v>

14
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Your average moron like myself can do.</v>

15
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I could make a website with squarespace.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we chose four sites out of 10 amazing ones.</v>

22
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>There were so many amazing sights to even narrow it down to 10 was very</v>

23
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

24
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>but we got these four.</v>

25

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

146
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.661
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

147
00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 2>don't sell yourself short though.</v>

148
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Just your common sense might mean you know more about economics and people who</v>

149
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 2>actually have Nobel prizes in economics.</v>

150
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

151
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I would disagree with you,</v>

152
00:04:56.911 --> 00:05:00.870
<v Speaker 1>but I saw that movie inside job and I saw how the whole system works where they,</v>

153
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>essentially set these financial limitations and then wind up getting jobs after</v>

155
00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:06.301
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

156
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>the economics professors set these limitations and then wind up getting jobs and</v>

158
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>wind up profiting off of the fact that they made it so that these things go</v>

159
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:19.191
<v Speaker 1>through you and your video from occupy Wall Street is one of my all time</v>

160
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:22.800
<v Speaker 1>favorites when you went down there and he said,</v>

161
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I am the one percent,</v>

162
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.840
<v Speaker 1>and you started talking to just knuckleheads,</v>

163
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.720
<v Speaker 1>knock and I know you didn't cherry pick because he had a few intelligent people</v>

164
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:31.554
<v Speaker 1>in there too,</v>

165
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but it was beautifully representative of what's actually going on.</v>

166
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:37.440
<v Speaker 1>This sort of emotional outrage,</v>

167
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

168
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.960
<v Speaker 1>this wanting to understand and explain why our economy is in such a mess,</v>

169
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 1>but having this very distorted perception of the actual facts themselves.</v>

170
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

171
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:47.361
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

172
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:51.710
<v Speaker 2>my purpose of going down there was to call attention to the.</v>

173
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.180
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

174
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I think they misdiagnosed or misunderstood what was really going on.</v>

175
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.410
<v Speaker 2>They bought into this idea that it's capitalism or the free market that is the</v>

176
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:03.344
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

177
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.410
<v Speaker 2>And so they were blaming maybe Wall Street because they looked at Wall Street is</v>

178
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 2>somehow epitomizing American capitalism.</v>

179
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.950
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted to point out that what they were really upset wet,</v>

180
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.370
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

181
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 2>ad was not capitalism,</v>

182
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

183
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.351
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

184
00:06:17.351 --> 00:06:17.431
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

185
00:06:17.431 --> 00:06:17.581
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

186
00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 2>it was because of government.</v>

187
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 2>It was because of central banking and central planning and crony capitalism.</v>

188
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 2>That was the source of all their problems.</v>

189
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 2>That really the solution to the problems is free market capitalism.</v>

190
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 2>They just don't understand it.</v>

191
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 2>And so I wanted to go there and explain to the people in that park,</v>

192
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

193
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>

194
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 2>if people watch the interactions between me and the occupiers,</v>

195
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

196
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.680
<v Speaker 2>to try to really expose how ridiculous the things that they're saying are.</v>

197
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I understood that they were upset and they were frustrated.</v>

198
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

199
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

200
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 2>the source of their frustration was misplaced.</v>

201
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:51.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

202
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't be protesting Washington.</v>

203
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 2>They should be protesting the Federal Reserve Congress.</v>

204
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

205
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.071
<v Speaker 2>not Wall Street.</v>

206
00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:58.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

207
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 2>what's going on on Wall Street is a symptom of the problem,</v>

208
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's not capitalism because when you have the government and Wall Street</v>

209
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 2>working together,</v>

210
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

211
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 2>that's not the free market.</v>

213
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:07.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

214
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 2>the government that is at the source of it,</v>

215
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily the bank's fault,</v>

216
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

217
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.091
<v Speaker 2>it sure they,</v>

218
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants something from government,</v>

219
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 2>but the government should deny right?</v>

220
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:19.831
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

221
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

222
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 2>when somebody wants to bail out or somebody wants something for nothing,</v>

223
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 2>the government should not supply it.</v>

224
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I can't necessarily blame Wall Street for wanting something for nothing,</v>

225
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:31.190
<v Speaker 2>but I blame the government for supplying it.</v>

226
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.731
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

227
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 2>how do,</v>

228
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.313
<v Speaker 2>how do,</v>

229
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>do they supply it?</v>

230
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Do they supply it?</v>

231
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Because the people that are asking for them to supply it are the ones who</v>

232
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:41.440
<v Speaker 1>contributed to their campaigns and got them into office.</v>

233
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And then once they get in there,</v>

234
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:43.834
<v Speaker 1>they acquiesced.</v>

235
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.861
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it.</v>

236
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of it is the,</v>

237
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

238
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>the government wants to maintain the illusion of prosperity,</v>

239
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 2>the illusion of economic growth.</v>

240
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

241
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 2>and so the way they do that now is through the financial markets,</v>

242
00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:57.370
<v Speaker 2>through assets.</v>

243
00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 2>And they get the stock market to go up,</v>

244
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.860
<v Speaker 2>they get the real estate market to go up and somehow they,</v>

245
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:05.980
<v Speaker 2>they pretend that that means that the economy's getting better just because</v>

246
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 2>asset prices are rising,</v>

247
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.910
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really economic growth,</v>

248
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:12.400
<v Speaker 2>just because the price of some asset goes up.</v>

249
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

250
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.600
<v Speaker 2>what's economic growth is when your economy produces more stuff,</v>

251
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:20.830
<v Speaker 2>when you have more output of the goods and services that make people's lives</v>

252
00:08:20.831 --> 00:08:21.131
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

253
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:21.311
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

254
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:23.050
<v Speaker 2>You want to grow your standard of living.</v>

255
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

256
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.600
<v Speaker 2>if people are poor,</v>

258
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 2>they're poor because they don't have enough stuff,</v>

259
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.731
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

260
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:30.640
<v Speaker 2>So we have to produce more stuff for people to consume.</v>

261
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:32.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's not what's happening in the US economy.</v>

262
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not like we've gotten more factories turning out more stuff.</v>

263
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.910
<v Speaker 2>All that they do is they get asset prices to rise so that people can borrow more</v>

264
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:43.240
<v Speaker 2>money against those inflated asset values and then spend it.</v>

265
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:45.640
<v Speaker 2>But we're buying things that are made in other countries.</v>

266
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't evidence economic growth here.</v>

267
00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:51.120
<v Speaker 2>It evidences the economic growth in the countries who are able to produce all</v>

268
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.530
<v Speaker 2>the things that we have to borrow money to consume,</v>

269
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't benefit average American.</v>

270
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 3>That's why the average American is suffering as a result of this massive</v>

271
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:02.750
<v Speaker 3>transfer of wealth that is emanating from,</v>

272
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.631
<v Speaker 3>from government,</v>

273
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 3>from the Federal Reserve,</v>

274
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 3>and from what was what,</v>

275
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 3>what's happening in Congress in the White House,</v>

276
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.240
<v Speaker 3>but they point to these asset markets as evidence that their policies are of</v>

277
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

278
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 3>But then meanwhile,</v>

279
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 3>you know their policies or complete failure if you judge it by what's actually</v>

280
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 3>going on in the economy.</v>

281
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 3>And of course everything they're doing now is just setting the stage for a</v>

282
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 3>economic disaster that is going to be much worse than what we had in 2008.</v>

283
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:30.571
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

284
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 3>you predicted the one in 2008.</v>

285
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

286
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 3>you saw it coming.</v>

287
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

288
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.430
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

289
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 3>you talked about it on multiple occasions that we're eventually going to have</v>

290
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 3>some large real estate clubs.</v>

291
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 3>W when that happens,</v>

292
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 3>this is where I get confused.</v>

293
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 3>So that happens.</v>

294
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 3>And then when there's a real situation like that where banks are in jeopardy,</v>

295
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.040
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

296
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 3>what transpires there,</v>

297
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:52.830
<v Speaker 3>like who votes on it,</v>

298
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:53.140
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

299
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 3>who decides and agrees that you're going to take taxpayer money and what are the</v>

300
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 3>repercussions of them not doing it.</v>

301
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't bail the banks out.</v>

302
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.200
<v Speaker 3>What would have happened?</v>

303
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.441
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

304
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 3>it would have been far more painful certainly at that time to deal with our</v>

305
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

306
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 3>It's always painful.</v>

307
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:08.694
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're,</v>

308
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 3>if you're a drug addict and you want to deal with it and you want to go cold</v>

309
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Turkey and go to rehab,</v>

310
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.461
<v Speaker 3>that's painful.</v>

311
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 3>It's easier to keep taking drugs,</v>

312
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:16.081
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

313
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 3>If you're overweight and you know,</v>

314
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 3>is it easier to go on a diet and exercise?</v>

315
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:22.130
<v Speaker 3>We'll just keep on picking out and you know,</v>

316
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.530
<v Speaker 3>so it's always difficult to do the right thing in the short run,</v>

317
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:27.150
<v Speaker 3>but it pays off in the long run.</v>

318
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 3>And so if you want to go back to the origin of the [inaudible] eight financial</v>

319
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 3>crisis,</v>

320
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.220
<v Speaker 3>you go look to the stock market bubble that burst in 2000 and the recession that</v>

321
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 3>began in 2000.</v>

322
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:38.761
<v Speaker 3>And one,</v>

323
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:39.151
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it,</v>

324
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:39.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

325
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 3>you had the September 11th tragedy,</v>

326
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:42.601
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

327
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:44.750
<v Speaker 3>and we were going into a recession and,</v>

328
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.590
<v Speaker 3>and so instead of allowing the pain of a recession to play out,</v>

329
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 3>and of course nobody enjoys a recession,</v>

330
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 3>but recessions are actually necessary.</v>

331
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 3>That's the process.</v>

332
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.150
<v Speaker 3>We're all the mistakes that were made during the boom or corrected.</v>

333
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 3>And of course we made a lot of mistakes during the tech boom.</v>

334
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 3>A lot of companies were funded,</v>

335
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 3>hired people,</v>

336
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:07.530
<v Speaker 3>rented office space that never should've started because they had no real</v>

337
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:08.191
<v Speaker 3>business plans.</v>

338
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:09.210
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't make any money.</v>

339
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.400
<v Speaker 3>We did a lot of stupid things during the 19 nineties bubble and they needed to</v>

340
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 3>be corrected during the recession.</v>

341
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.330
<v Speaker 3>But the politicians,</v>

342
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:18.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

343
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Bush had just become president.</v>

344
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.670
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want a big recession on his first term because of course he wanted a</v>

345
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:24.504
<v Speaker 3>second term.</v>

346
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 3>And so Alan Greenspan cooperated with Bush because he wanted to get reappointed.</v>

347
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 3>And so they had a big monetary stimulus.</v>

348
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:31.361
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

349
00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:33.750
<v Speaker 3>they dropped interest rates down to one percent,</v>

350
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 3>which is high by today's standards.</v>

351
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 3>But it was a record low back then.</v>

352
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of the money that was going into the stock market went into the real</v>

353
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:43.711
<v Speaker 3>estate market.</v>

354
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 3>So we replaced the stock market bubble with a real estate bubble that actually</v>

355
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 3>had began forming a few years earlier.</v>

356
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 3>But it really gathered momentum after the real estate,</v>

357
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 3>the stock market bubble burst.</v>

358
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 2>And so the real estate bubble got all the air and so now housing prices were</v>

359
00:11:57.971 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 2>going up and because they were going up,</v>

360
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 2>people were.</v>

361
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were rich.</v>

362
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 2>So they went out and spent money.</v>

363
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:03.311
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have.</v>

364
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:05.190
<v Speaker 2>They borrowed it against the appreciating buyer,</v>

365
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.033
<v Speaker 2>their houses.</v>

366
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 2>They bought more houses,</v>

367
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 2>they bought cars,</v>

368
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 2>they took vacations.</v>

369
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 2>And during that time I knew this was a mania.</v>

370
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I knew that the big crisis though for the real estate market was not going to be</v>

371
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 2>the buyer of real estate because in the stock market bubble,</v>

372
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>when the stock market bubble burst,</v>

373
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 2>it was the people who bought stocks who lost because they were buying gambling</v>

374
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:26.134
<v Speaker 2>with their own money.</v>

375
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 2>But when people were buying houses,</v>

376
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 2>they were gambling with the bank's money.</v>

377
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.911
<v Speaker 2>But in fact,</v>

378
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 2>it was taxpayer money because the banks were all guaranteed by the government,</v>

379
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 2>and so I knew when the real estate bubble burst and prices went down that the</v>

380
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:40.570
<v Speaker 2>banks would be insolvent and that the banks would fail.</v>

381
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Now had the government allowed real estate prices to fall,</v>

382
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 2>which was a good thing.</v>

383
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 2>The problem was that they went up.</v>

384
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Coming back down,</v>

385
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 2>was was reality coming back.</v>

386
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Had the government allowed the banks to fail and real estate prices to keep</v>

387
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:54.574
<v Speaker 2>falling.</v>

388
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 2>It would have been more painful in the short run,</v>

389
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>but it would have been necessary pain.</v>

390
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 2>It would have been constructive pain because we would have laid the foundation</v>

391
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 2>for a legitimate economic recovery,</v>

392
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 2>which is what we should've done in 2001.</v>

393
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have had that.</v>

394
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 2>All that monetary stimulus.</v>

395
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have created a housing bubble.</v>

396
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:14.980
<v Speaker 2>We should have just endured the pain and then we would have been in better</v>

397
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

398
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>

399
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.660
<v Speaker 2>They blew up this housing bubble and now when it bursts,</v>

400
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 2>they didn't learn from their mistakes.</v>

401
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.291
<v Speaker 2>Ben Bernanke,</v>

402
00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 2>he just repeated all the mistakes of Alan Greenspan.</v>

403
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Only this time interest rates had to come to zero because you know,</v>

404
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.840
<v Speaker 2>it was an even bigger crisis and now we have all the money printing.</v>

405
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 2>They called quantitative easing,</v>

406
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 2>but we have much easier,</v>

407
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 2>much more aggressive monetary stimulus.</v>

408
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Now we're doing far more damage to the economy.</v>

409
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.330
<v Speaker 2>We've managed to reflate the stock market bubble.</v>

410
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 2>We've reflated the real estate bubble.</v>

411
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 2>We have more debt as a society than ever before.</v>

412
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

413
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 2>the government has more debt,</v>

414
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 2>corporations have more debt,</v>

415
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:51.791
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

416
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:52.391
<v Speaker 2>There's no pen,</v>

417
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:53.360
<v Speaker 2>no d leveraging.</v>

418
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 2>We take,</v>

419
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:59.130
<v Speaker 2>we were in a deep hole and then we dug a lot deeper and we've set the stage a</v>

420
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Ben Bernanke has set the stage for a much greater economic crisis than the one</v>

421
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 2>from 2008.</v>

422
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Speaker 2>It's going to blow up on Janet Yellen,</v>

423
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 2>just like the Greenspan bubble blew up on Bernacchi.</v>

424
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 2>That Bernacchi bubble is going to blow up on yelling.</v>

425
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 2>It's much bigger and I'm afraid that yellen is going to do more of the same.</v>

426
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Only worse when she gets in and,</v>

427
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:19.750
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

428
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 2>and we're in for a,</v>

429
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:20.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 2>a much worse economic crisis because this one I think is going to be where the</v>

431
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:29.200
<v Speaker 2>dollar collapses and that's going to usher in a lot more pain for ordinary</v>

432
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Americans than the bursting of the stock market.</v>

433
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:32.134
<v Speaker 2>Butler of the housing bubble.</v>

434
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Back to that word pain because this where what I really was confused about when</v>

435
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you say that it would have caused a lot more pain if the banks had failed,</v>

436
00:14:38.331 --> 00:14:40.700
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately it would have been better because we were figured out what was</v>

437
00:14:40.701 --> 00:14:42.180
<v Speaker 1>wrong and then and not allow that to go.</v>

438
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.250
<v Speaker 1>What kind of pain would that have been when you're dealing with federally</v>

439
00:14:46.251 --> 00:14:47.084
<v Speaker 1>insured banks?</v>

440
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.920
<v Speaker 1>So if the average person,</v>

441
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 1>how much of their money would be insured?</v>

442
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:51.711
<v Speaker 1>The government,</v>

443
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>if banks collapse and then where does that money come from?</v>

444
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 1>If they have to ensure all the people who had money in the bank accounts?</v>

445
00:14:59.520 --> 00:14:59.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

446
00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Well theoretically right?</v>

447
00:15:00.961 --> 00:15:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean the government now stands behind a,</v>

448
00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

449
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.340
<v Speaker 2>the bank accounts.</v>

450
00:15:05.341 --> 00:15:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

451
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.050
<v Speaker 2>the FDA has a limit,</v>

452
00:15:07.051 --> 00:15:08.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe $250,000,</v>

453
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:09.960
<v Speaker 2>but the government is,</v>

454
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

455
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.131
<v Speaker 2>bailed out,</v>

456
00:15:11.131 --> 00:15:12.610
<v Speaker 2>banks know when they fail,</v>

457
00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:13.560
<v Speaker 2>they bell at everybody.</v>

458
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

459
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a mistake.</v>

460
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.210
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't have any government insured deposits.</v>

461
00:15:18.211 --> 00:15:18.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

462
00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:18.611
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

463
00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:20.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge moral hazard,</v>

464
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:20.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

465
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.201
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

466
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:21.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.230
<v Speaker 2>people now will put their money into banks and no one cares what the bank does</v>

468
00:15:25.231 --> 00:15:28.800
<v Speaker 2>with their money because the government ensures the account so the banks can be</v>

469
00:15:28.801 --> 00:15:31.860
<v Speaker 2>as reckless as they want and there's no free market penalty.</v>

470
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.070
<v Speaker 2>If we had a free market and banking like we had at one point,</v>

471
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.310
<v Speaker 2>banks couldn't be reckless because they wouldn't have any depositors.</v>

472
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Depositors would care about what the bank does with their money.</v>

473
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.770
<v Speaker 2>And so in order to get the positives,</v>

474
00:15:43.771 --> 00:15:47.400
<v Speaker 2>banks would have to be cautious and they would advertise how safe their</v>

475
00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:48.360
<v Speaker 2>portfolios were.</v>

476
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.240
<v Speaker 2>And you would have companies that would rate them and say,</v>

477
00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:52.770
<v Speaker 2>this is a good bank to put your money.</v>

478
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:53.131
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

479
00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:53.641
<v Speaker 2>but right now,</v>

480
00:15:53.641 --> 00:15:54.390
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares.</v>

481
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.223
<v Speaker 2>They're all the same.</v>

482
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:55.771
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

483
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:57.240
<v Speaker 2>And so you'll put your money anywhere.</v>

484
00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.560
<v Speaker 2>How much of your money is insured?</v>

485
00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

486
00:15:59.131 --> 00:16:01.380
<v Speaker 2>it's theoretically the government insurers at all,</v>

487
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 1>but you have $10,000,000 in the bank and the bank fails.</v>

488
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 1>The government gives you 10 million.</v>

489
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

490
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.073
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem no.</v>

491
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

492
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.150
<v Speaker 2>that's what they've done in the past.</v>

493
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.580
<v Speaker 2>They're only technically supposed to give you now $250,000,</v>

494
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 2>but they have given you all of it.</v>

495
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:18.551
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is only smaller banks have failed so far.</v>

496
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:18.990
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

497
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 2>if a large bank were to fail,</v>

498
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough money in the FDC to bail out the depositors.</v>

499
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 2>So the government would have to create it.</v>

500
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:30.050
<v Speaker 2>The Federal Reserve would have to print it into existence.</v>

501
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

502
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 2>and so what's ultimately gonna Happen is sure,</v>

503
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:34.010
<v Speaker 2>we've got all these insured,</v>

504
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Bank du Pont counts,</v>

505
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 2>but if a bit a couple of big banks fail and the government has to print all the</v>

506
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:40.880
<v Speaker 2>money to reimburse the depositors,</v>

507
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.060
<v Speaker 2>you have massive inflation and it,</v>

508
00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:43.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

509
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you get your money back,</v>

510
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 2>but you can't buy anything with it or you can't buy nearly as much.</v>

511
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.900
<v Speaker 2>What would actually happen if the government had done the right thing and</v>

512
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 2>allowed banks to fail?</v>

513
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

514
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.310
<v Speaker 2>then some depositors would have lost money,</v>

515
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 2>some depositors would have not got back one hundred cents on the dollar,</v>

516
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 2>but in the long run that would be better off than getting back all your money</v>

517
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:02.300
<v Speaker 2>and have it not by anything.</v>

518
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

519
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.030
<v Speaker 2>there would have been paying for some people,</v>

520
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:05.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

521
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.640
<v Speaker 2>The government would've been forced to cut a lot of spending.</v>

522
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

523
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 2>the government would have had to lay people off and so that would be good for</v>

524
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Speaker 2>the economy,</v>

525
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.910
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be good in the short run for the guy who got laid off.</v>

526
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Now he has to go get a real job.</v>

527
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

528
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.240
<v Speaker 2>but the government would have to start cutting,</v>

529
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>spending real estate prices would have fallen.</v>

530
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:20.451
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>

531
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:20.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

532
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>some people would lose that home equity.</v>

533
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:22.691
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

534
00:17:22.691 --> 00:17:22.971
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

535
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:25.910
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have a house falling real estate prices are,</v>

536
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 2>is a good thing for you.</v>

537
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:27.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

538
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 2>the government always talks about,</v>

539
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.800
<v Speaker 2>trying to make homeownership affordable.</v>

541
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

542
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 2>the best way to do that as the prices come down,</v>

543
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 2>why is the government trying to stop real estate prices from coming down when</v>

544
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 2>they say they want houses to be affordable?</v>

545
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:42.710
<v Speaker 2>What the government wants is to prop up real estate prices at artificial levels,</v>

546
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 2>so you have to borrow a fortune to buy a house,</v>

547
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.500
<v Speaker 2>but then they want to subsidize the debt so they do the same thing with college.</v>

548
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.050
<v Speaker 2>They want.</v>

549
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 2>They want everyone to go to college,</v>

550
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want college tuition to come down because of the government</v>

551
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 2>guarantees all the student loans and so that's why college is so expensive</v>

552
00:17:57.991 --> 00:18:01.290
<v Speaker 2>because the students take all that government money and they'd been up tuition</v>

553
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 2>and the colleges know that.</v>

554
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.150
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter how high the prices are because the kids are going to get the</v>

555
00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.950
<v Speaker 2>money from the government to pay the price,</v>

556
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile they graduate.</v>

557
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 2>They've got these worthless degrees and they got a pile of debt.</v>

558
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 2>If the government just got out of the way and they didn't give out all this</v>

559
00:18:15.901 --> 00:18:17.550
<v Speaker 2>money to students than the university is,</v>

560
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:20.760
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to slash tuition or they'd have no customers and now you can get a</v>

561
00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 2>college degree without taking out a mortgage.</v>

562
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware that famous Putin quote before the crash about the economy wasn't</v>

563
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.030
<v Speaker 1>hooten said he didn't know.</v>

564
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the United States economy.</v>

565
00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:33.100
<v Speaker 1>It seems they only buy and sell each other's houses.</v>

566
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

567
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

568
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:34.621
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

569
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:37.560
<v Speaker 2>We had an economy that was all about flipping houses.</v>

570
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 2>A strange though,</v>

571
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.890
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

572
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.020
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

573
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.020
<v Speaker 2>we have this service sector economy now that is completely unbelievable,</v>

574
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:45.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

575
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:46.271
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

576
00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 2>it's the result of our ability right to,</v>

577
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.630
<v Speaker 2>to borrow indefinitely from abroad to pay for the products that are manufactured</v>

578
00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Speaker 2>in other countries.</v>

579
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

580
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>but this bubble is going to burst because,</v>

581
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:57.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 2>we can't keep borrowing the world.</v>

583
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Keep,</v>

584
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 2>can't keep lending us money.</v>

585
00:19:01.351 --> 00:19:06.351
<v Speaker 2>It's like a giant vendor financing scheme where other countries produce products</v>

586
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 2>and then they lend us the money to buy those products.</v>

587
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:11.550
<v Speaker 2>But we can't pay back any of the money we've already borrowed yet.</v>

588
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:14.850
<v Speaker 2>They keep lending us more because they don't want to deal with the reality of</v>

589
00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 2>how much money they've lost.</v>

590
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.360
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

591
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.140
<v Speaker 1>what kind of an epic change would be involved in,</v>

592
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 1>in getting away from this trend,</v>

593
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 1>what kind of an epic change would be involved in making sure that the government</v>

594
00:19:24.451 --> 00:19:25.980
<v Speaker 1>doesn't subsidize universities,</v>

595
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:28.920
<v Speaker 1>that making sure that housing costs do go down,</v>

596
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 1>making sure that banks aren't government protected.</v>

597
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.260
<v Speaker 1>What I mean that seems like it would.</v>

598
00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 1>It would take an epic change.</v>

599
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Well that it is.</v>

600
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I think because it's</v>

601
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.730
<v Speaker 2>going to take a crisis and I think fortunately or unfortunately that crisis is</v>

602
00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:43.121
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>

603
00:19:43.121 --> 00:19:46.300
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a crisis that we can't print our way out of that we can't</v>

604
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.800
<v Speaker 2>bail are way out of and,</v>

605
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's where we are.</v>

606
00:19:49.241 --> 00:19:49.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

607
00:19:49.451 --> 00:19:53.240
<v Speaker 2>I think the bubble that we have now is just so big and I think the,</v>

608
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:53.381
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

609
00:19:53.381 --> 00:19:53.551
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

610
00:19:53.551 --> 00:19:55.040
<v Speaker 2>the Fed knows that it's,</v>

611
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.021
<v Speaker 2>it's so big.</v>

612
00:19:56.021 --> 00:19:56.980
<v Speaker 2>It's too big to pop,</v>

613
00:19:56.981 --> 00:19:58.570
<v Speaker 2>forgetting about too big to fail,</v>

614
00:19:58.571 --> 00:20:00.070
<v Speaker 2>that there is no more bubbles.</v>

615
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.210
<v Speaker 2>This is the last Hurrah for,</v>

616
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:03.930
<v Speaker 2>for our phone.</v>

617
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Economy goes.</v>

618
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

619
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.680
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

620
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.060
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing left to do once,</v>

621
00:20:07.061 --> 00:20:11.530
<v Speaker 2>once this collapses and then maybe there'll be the catalyst to do the right</v>

622
00:20:11.531 --> 00:20:11.741
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

623
00:20:11.741 --> 00:20:15.610
<v Speaker 2>but I think the way the collapse is going to come is going to be in the value of</v>

624
00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:16.241
<v Speaker 2>our currency,</v>

625
00:20:16.241 --> 00:20:18.580
<v Speaker 2>which right now is relatively stable.</v>

626
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.070
<v Speaker 2>It's actually risen recently against some currencies,</v>

627
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:21.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

628
00:20:21.671 --> 00:20:23.200
<v Speaker 2>although not all currencies,</v>

629
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.590
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the Fed is going to keep on printing money.</v>

630
00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:30.940
<v Speaker 2>There's an expectation right now that there's a real economic recovery and that</v>

631
00:20:30.941 --> 00:20:34.930
<v Speaker 2>the Fed is going to be able to remove the monetary props.</v>

632
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.200
<v Speaker 2>There is no real recovery and the Fed can't remove the props.</v>

633
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.063
<v Speaker 2>It should,</v>

634
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.030
<v Speaker 2>but the minute it did,</v>

635
00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.440
<v Speaker 2>the whole economy would implode.</v>

636
00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.190
<v Speaker 2>I think as people begun begin to realize that,</v>

637
00:20:45.191 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 2>to appreciate what the Fed created,</v>

638
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

639
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Not a sustainable recovery but it,</v>

640
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.870
<v Speaker 2>but a bubble there.</v>

641
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 2>The world is not going to want our dollars anymore because the Fed has to keep</v>

642
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 2>printing dollars to buy bonds.</v>

643
00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

644
00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 2>so that we can keep borrowing money.</v>

645
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 2>The government can keep borrowing money,</v>

646
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 2>but when people don't want the dollars at the Fed is creating.</v>

647
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Now the value of the dollar starts to go down and that's when you start to see a</v>

648
00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 2>real acceleration in prices for consumer goods.</v>

649
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:11.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

650
00:21:11.781 --> 00:21:14.920
<v Speaker 2>and the government tries to deny that there is inflation,</v>

651
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.540
<v Speaker 2>but there's massive inflation.</v>

652
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not all showing up yet in consumer prices,</v>

653
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:24.331
<v Speaker 2>although a lot of prices looking since 2009 mil prices have more than doubled.</v>

654
00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

655
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.340
<v Speaker 2>I think beef prices chop me.</v>

656
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Prices are up 80,</v>

657
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.171
<v Speaker 2>90 percent.</v>

658
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:29.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

659
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:30.960
<v Speaker 2>look at gasoline price at record highs.</v>

660
00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 2>So the government tells us there's no inflation,</v>

661
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 2>but there's plenty of it,</v>

662
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:35.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to get a lot worse.</v>

663
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.120
<v Speaker 2>That is the bad news.</v>

664
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:37.241
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

665
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 2>the government is actually trying to lay the foundation for higher inflation</v>

666
00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:42.350
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

667
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

668
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.530
<v Speaker 2>by trying to tell us that it's a good thing.</v>

669
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:44.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

670
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

671
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.311
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

672
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to the economist today,</v>

673
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 2>they'll tell you that the scariest thing,</v>

674
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 2>that worst thing that can happen is that we don't have enough inflation.</v>

675
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.680
<v Speaker 2>That we have to make sure that prices are rising fast enough to have economic</v>

676
00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 2>growth.</v>

677
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.960
<v Speaker 2>They used to say that we want stable prices.</v>

678
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Now they tell us that that's dangerous.</v>

679
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad thing because if prices are stable,</v>

680
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 2>they might actually go down a little bit and that would be horrible.</v>

681
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

682
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Speaker 2>So the government wants us to be thankful when the cost of living goes up when</v>

683
00:22:10.271 --> 00:22:11.590
<v Speaker 2>obviously you know,</v>

684
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.920
<v Speaker 2>a good strong economy has fallen consumer prices.</v>

685
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 2>That's the goal of an economy.</v>

686
00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 2>It's to bring prices down so that people can buy more stuff.</v>

687
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Is the problem in competent intervention in the market or is the problem that</v>

688
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just a system that can't be fixed?</v>

689
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.023
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

690
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.550
<v Speaker 2>that right now the system can't be fixed,</v>

691
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:31.660
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to collapse,</v>

692
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.553
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>

693
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.251
<v Speaker 2>So it has to do.</v>

694
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.084
<v Speaker 2>In your opinion,</v>

695
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.110
<v Speaker 2>should it has to?</v>

696
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

697
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>

698
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.710
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of incentives to keep it going right,</v>

699
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 2>to keep the party going as long as possible.</v>

700
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 2>The politicians want to keep it going.</v>

701
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean they love phony prosperity because it's better than reality because if</v>

702
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:48.070
<v Speaker 2>the public knew how screwed they were,</v>

703
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.431
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

704
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 2>they might not reelect the guys that are there,</v>

705
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 2>so they want to keep it going.</v>

706
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 2>They have no incentive to rain on the parade,</v>

707
00:22:54.761 --> 00:22:56.410
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to solve any problems.</v>

708
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

709
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:57.251
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

710
00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 2>they just want to get through the next election,</v>

711
00:22:59.380 --> 00:22:59.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

712
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.611
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street,</v>

713
00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:00.821
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

714
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:01.900
<v Speaker 2>they're making a ton of money.</v>

715
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:02.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

716
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 2>there are people that are making a fortune off of this bad monetary policy and</v>

717
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:08.050
<v Speaker 2>so they don't want it to stop.</v>

718
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to deal with reality.</v>

719
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 2>They want to just keep making,</v>

720
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:11.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

721
00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 2>making hay while the sun shines.</v>

722
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 2>And the academics,</v>

723
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:14.801
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

724
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I think these guys are just clueless.</v>

725
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

726
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 2>so nobody really,</v>

727
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:19.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

728
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Speaker 2>hasn't either understands or has a vested interest to understand the truth.</v>

729
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to keep the party going.</v>

730
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.730
<v Speaker 2>That was exactly what was going on in 2003 and four and five and six when I was</v>

731
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:31.810
<v Speaker 2>going around going on TV shows,</v>

732
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:32.410
<v Speaker 2>given,</v>

733
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.430
<v Speaker 2>given lectures,</v>

734
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

735
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.480
<v Speaker 2>explaining all the problems in the housing market and how the Fed was creating</v>

736
00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:39.760
<v Speaker 2>it and how bad it was going to be when the bubble burst.</v>

737
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wanted to hear it.</v>

738
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:41.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

739
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:43.180
<v Speaker 2>everybody either laughed at me,</v>

740
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:44.170
<v Speaker 2>ridiculed me,</v>

741
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:44.690
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

742
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>this should have been obvious.</v>

743
00:23:46.071 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 2>This should've been crystal clear yet people couldn't see it.</v>

744
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody was blindsided by what happened.</v>

745
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:53.181
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

746
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:53.331
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

747
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:55.160
<v Speaker 2>nobody could have possibly predicted this.</v>

748
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:55.371
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

749
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Of course that was wrong.</v>

750
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

751
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

752
00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

753
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.630
<v Speaker 2>and then instead of,</v>

754
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

755
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.360
<v Speaker 2>learning from the mistakes or instead of,</v>

756
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

757
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:05.660
<v Speaker 2>listening to people like me and I wasn't the only guy that was out there talking</v>

758
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

759
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I just did it maybe more publicly than a lot of people.</v>

760
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.141
<v Speaker 2>But instead of saying,</v>

761
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:09.381
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

762
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:09.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

763
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 2>let's talk to Peter Schiff,</v>

764
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:10.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

765
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:10.940
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

766
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.080
<v Speaker 2>he saw this thing come in,</v>

767
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:12.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

768
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

769
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.121
<v Speaker 2>what does he think,</v>

770
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:14.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:14.630
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

772
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.961
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

773
00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:15.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

774
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.420
<v Speaker 2>a government inquiry,</v>

775
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.081
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

776
00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:19.190
<v Speaker 2>to the financial crisis.</v>

777
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.180
<v Speaker 2>It right after it happened.</v>

778
00:24:20.181 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 2>It was an investigation as to why there was a financial crisis.</v>

779
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:23.781
<v Speaker 2>And you would've thought,</v>

780
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

781
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.733
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book,</v>

782
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 2>predicted the financial crisis,</v>

783
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:29.030
<v Speaker 2>crash proof how to profit from the coming economic collapse that described</v>

784
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 2>exactly what happened.</v>

785
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:30.921
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about it.</v>

786
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I talked about it for years.</v>

787
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I have all these essays on the Internet,</v>

788
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.640
<v Speaker 2>there's all these youtube videos you can see,</v>

789
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.071
<v Speaker 2>conferences.</v>

791
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Look at my mortgage bankers speech from 2006.</v>

792
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

793
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

794
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 2>why don't I go and testify in front of Congress and explain why we had a</v>

795
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:44.474
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis.</v>

796
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.560
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't call me,</v>

797
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:45.951
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

798
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:46.610
<v Speaker 2>not</v>

799
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.100
<v Speaker 1>say something exactly like you said in the first 15 minutes of this.</v>

800
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:49.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

801
00:24:49.681 --> 00:24:50.461
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to hear it.</v>

802
00:24:50.461 --> 00:24:50.821
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

803
00:24:50.821 --> 00:24:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I did testify twice in front of Congress later on and you can see those</v>

804
00:24:54.991 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 2>testimonies are on youtube.</v>

805
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.000
<v Speaker 2>And I was actually surprised that they invited me back a second time after I</v>

806
00:25:00.001 --> 00:25:00.840
<v Speaker 2>testified the first time.</v>

807
00:25:00.841 --> 00:25:03.570
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe some people didn't really realize who I was.</v>

808
00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And so they haven't invited me back a third time,</v>

809
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.031
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

810
00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:06.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

811
00:25:06.211 --> 00:25:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I'd tell them the truth and I treat these guys like they ought to be treated.</v>

812
00:25:09.091 --> 00:25:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't really show any respect for people that are destroying our country.</v>

813
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

814
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.260
<v Speaker 2>and so I put them in their place when,</v>

815
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.001
<v Speaker 2>when I testify,</v>

816
00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:17.370
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't really want anybody testifying,</v>

817
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.001
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

818
00:25:18.001 --> 00:25:18.660
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

819
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

820
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.360
<v Speaker 2>knew why there was a crisis because they already had,</v>

821
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.400
<v Speaker 2>they already had a preconceived conclusion.</v>

822
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.140
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to blame it on capitalism.</v>

823
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.020
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to say we had a crisis because we didn't have enough regulation</v>

824
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.370
<v Speaker 2>because we didn't have enough government,</v>

825
00:25:29.371 --> 00:25:31.680
<v Speaker 2>which of course was the opposite of why we had the crisis.</v>

826
00:25:31.681 --> 00:25:33.780
<v Speaker 2>We had too much regulation and too much government.</v>

827
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.850
<v Speaker 2>The free market would have prevented that crisis.</v>

828
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Now you say that you don't believe in regulation,</v>

829
00:25:39.821 --> 00:25:42.850
<v Speaker 1>but do you agree with when it comes to regulation,</v>

830
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:45.100
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to environmental protections,</v>

831
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.690
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to things like the EPA or when it comes to like situations,</v>

832
00:25:49.691 --> 00:25:53.260
<v Speaker 1>like what do you do about when you have this massive Gulf oil spill,</v>

833
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.840
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in the government should intervene then?</v>

834
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

835
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:56.161
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

836
00:25:56.161 --> 00:25:56.994
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

837
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.740
<v Speaker 2>there are market regulations,</v>

838
00:25:58.741 --> 00:25:58.921
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

839
00:25:58.921 --> 00:26:03.921
<v Speaker 2>Markets in many cases regulate themselves because of the self interests of the</v>

840
00:26:04.081 --> 00:26:04.441
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

841
00:26:04.441 --> 00:26:05.191
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

842
00:26:05.191 --> 00:26:06.660
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about banks,</v>

843
00:26:06.661 --> 00:26:06.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

844
00:26:06.901 --> 00:26:08.070
<v Speaker 2>If there was no government,</v>

845
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm guaranteeing the safety of bank accounts in order for banks to thrive and</v>

846
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:14.640
<v Speaker 2>get customers,</v>

847
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.140
<v Speaker 2>they are going to have to,</v>

848
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

849
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.450
<v Speaker 2>provide a safe platform,</v>

850
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:19.850
<v Speaker 2>a depository of their,</v>

851
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:24.390
<v Speaker 2>of their savings and banks will compete with each other based on who's got the</v>

852
00:26:24.391 --> 00:26:25.230
<v Speaker 2>safest bank.</v>

853
00:26:25.231 --> 00:26:25.821
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you know,</v>

854
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:28.620
<v Speaker 2>where's my money going to be secure because that's really what you're worried</v>

855
00:26:28.621 --> 00:26:29.250
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

856
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.860
<v Speaker 2>And so there is market based regulation.</v>

857
00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:35.070
<v Speaker 2>We're from competition and you get that every place may people say,</v>

858
00:26:35.071 --> 00:26:35.251
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

859
00:26:35.251 --> 00:26:35.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

860
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.820
<v Speaker 2>don't we need the government to make sure that the airlines are safe?</v>

861
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

862
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.020
<v Speaker 2>who's got a vested interest in a safe airline than the owner?</v>

863
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.591
<v Speaker 2>That airline,</v>

864
00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean the last thing a,</v>

865
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 2>an airline wants is a crash.</v>

866
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 2>And the most important thing,</v>

867
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

868
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:49.111
<v Speaker 2>I fly a lot.</v>

869
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:51.660
<v Speaker 2>The most important thing to me is that it's a safe flight.</v>

870
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.351
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

871
00:26:52.351 --> 00:26:52.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

872
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go on a plane on an,</v>

873
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 2>on an airline that,</v>

874
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.050
<v Speaker 2>they cut corners to save a couple of bucks.</v>

876
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:01.080
<v Speaker 2>So there's gonna be a lot of regulation in the market.</v>

877
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:01.831
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

878
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 2>what happens is the government comes in and now they create a moral hazard that</v>

879
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 2>undermines the normal market regulation and replaces it with a government</v>

880
00:27:11.341 --> 00:27:14.640
<v Speaker 2>regulation that's nowhere near as good moral hazard.</v>

881
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:15.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

882
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:15.541
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

883
00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:16.440
<v Speaker 2>moral hazard.</v>

884
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

885
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:17.720
<v Speaker 2>in the bank account,</v>

886
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.290
<v Speaker 2>again in the bank account example,</v>

887
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 2>without government interference,</v>

888
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I care about what the banks do with my money.</v>

889
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just gonna Dump my money in the bank,</v>

890
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

891
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.520
<v Speaker 2>and not worry about it.</v>

892
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do some research before my bank account.</v>

893
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure that the bank is sound.</v>

894
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 2>The bank knows that in order to attract customers,</v>

895
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.150
<v Speaker 2>it has to be safe.</v>

896
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:41.580
<v Speaker 2>It can't just be gambling with depositors money.</v>

897
00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

898
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 2>but when the government steps in,</v>

899
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.920
<v Speaker 2>now no one cares about safety because the government says,</v>

900
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:47.581
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>

901
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 2>we'll make sure the bank is safe.</v>

902
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 2>So now the,</v>

903
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 2>now the depositors say we don't give a damn.</v>

904
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 2>We'll put our money anywhere.</v>

905
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't care which bank it is.</v>

906
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Nobody does any research.</v>

907
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:56.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

908
00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:00.240
<v Speaker 2>people do more research before they buy a microwave oven or a television set.</v>

909
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Then depositing their life savings into a bank.</v>

910
00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:03.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just whichever one is closest,</v>

911
00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:04.140
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

912
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:04.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

913
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put my money there.</v>

914
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:06.900
<v Speaker 2>The banks know this.</v>

915
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

916
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that banks have to do is convince the regulators to give them a</v>

917
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>

918
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 2>But then you got all kinds of corruption you've got and you've got the</v>

919
00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:15.630
<v Speaker 2>government has all kinds of corrupt incentives.</v>

920
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.150
<v Speaker 2>So market based regulation is much better.</v>

921
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:23.100
<v Speaker 2>But certainly I do believe in some types of regulation when it comes to</v>

922
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:25.650
<v Speaker 2>externalities like pollution and things like that.</v>

923
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of that is best done at a local level,</v>

924
00:28:28.591 --> 00:28:29.610
<v Speaker 2>not at the federal level.</v>

925
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:33.180
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it is done through courts because people are still liable in a free</v>

926
00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:33.631
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

927
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 2>So if I damage you in some way,</v>

928
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:36.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

929
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.531
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

930
00:28:37.531 --> 00:28:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm responsible for your damage and you consume me.</v>

931
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 2>And so businesses don't want to be sued.</v>

932
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:43.891
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to,</v>

933
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:44.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

935
00:28:44.721 --> 00:28:44.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

936
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.731
<v Speaker 2>harm other people.</v>

937
00:28:45.731 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 2>And so they're going to guard against that.</v>

938
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at all of the money that society loses,</v>

939
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you know when you buy government debt protection and government regulation,</v>

940
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 2>more money is lost to the cost of regulation.</v>

941
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.831
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

942
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:03.831
<v Speaker 2>Then would be lost through fraud or unscrupulous actors that,</v>

943
00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:04.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

944
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.170
<v Speaker 2>that might steal somebody's money.</v>

945
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:07.841
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

946
00:29:07.841 --> 00:29:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but that money's not coming directly from victims.</v>

947
00:29:10.631 --> 00:29:11.920
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that,</v>

948
00:29:11.921 --> 00:29:12.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:12.610
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

950
00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.680
<v Speaker 1>if you're spending all this money on regulation,</v>

951
00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.071
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

952
00:29:15.071 --> 00:29:16.390
<v Speaker 1>that money is not coming,</v>

953
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.253
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

954
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.800
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money that you would lose if they weren't regulated with directly</v>

955
00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:21.170
<v Speaker 1>affected.</v>

956
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:21.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

957
00:29:21.321 --> 00:29:23.060
<v Speaker 2>it comes from every but like look at my industry,</v>

958
00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:23.320
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

959
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:23.540
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>

960
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.270
<v Speaker 2>I mainly make my money in the investment business.</v>

961
00:29:26.271 --> 00:29:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I have a brokerage firm and an asset advisor company and so I advise people on</v>

962
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.360
<v Speaker 2>how to invest their money.</v>

963
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to spend a ton of money,</v>

964
00:29:35.511 --> 00:29:38.090
<v Speaker 2>a fortune complying with regulation.</v>

965
00:29:38.091 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 2>There's so much regulation in,</v>

966
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>in my industry and it costs me.</v>

967
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:42.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

968
00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:42.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

969
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:43.311
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

970
00:29:43.311 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

971
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what it is over a million dollars a year.</v>

972
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Much more that I have to spend a to stay in business and of course I have to</v>

973
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:53.730
<v Speaker 2>pass on those costs to my clients and of course be cost.</v>

974
00:29:53.731 --> 00:29:54.970
<v Speaker 2>The costs are so big.</v>

975
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of comp,</v>

976
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:56.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:57.170
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

978
00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 2>there's less competition than there would be if the government didn't create all</v>

979
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:03.340
<v Speaker 2>these barriers to entry because if you want to compete with me,</v>

980
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:04.660
<v Speaker 2>you just can't do it.</v>

981
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have enough money to set up the compliance apparatus that the</v>

982
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 2>government requires,</v>

983
00:30:10.451 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot less competition in my industry.</v>

984
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that investors suffer because they don't have as much choices and</v>

985
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 2>everybody has to pay higher prices for their services because the government</v>

986
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 2>requires us to spend all this money supposedly to protect my customers,</v>

987
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.580
<v Speaker 2>but the government doesn't really give a damn about my customers.</v>

988
00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

989
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one that suffers if my customers are mad at me because they take their</v>

990
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 2>business someplace else,</v>

991
00:30:33.011 --> 00:30:33.221
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

992
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

993
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I need happy customers,</v>

994
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 2>so I am going to do what's right for my customers regardless of what the</v>

995
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:38.980
<v Speaker 2>government says.</v>

996
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Now there are some people out there that are gonna steal.</v>

997
00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:42.740
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

998
00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be criminals in every industry.</v>

999
00:30:44.621 --> 00:30:46.580
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be some guy that's gonna,</v>

1000
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1001
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.550
<v Speaker 2>fraudulent the pedal,</v>

1002
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:48.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1003
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 2>penny stocks or something that's going to happen,</v>

1004
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.520
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that's happening now even with all the government.</v>

1005
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Look at Bernie madoff.</v>

1006
00:30:55.451 --> 00:30:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have all this stuff going on on top of it,</v>

1007
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 2>but if we didn't have any of this regulation,</v>

1008
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 2>if we have a free market,</v>

1009
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:02.531
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1010
00:31:02.531 --> 00:31:05.440
<v Speaker 2>there will still be some fools that would lose money,</v>

1011
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.453
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1012
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Speaker 2>the losses would pale in comparison to how much everybody is losing now because</v>

1013
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 2>of the cost of government and at least the people who lose money.</v>

1014
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:16.780
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to accept responsibility for their own bad decisions.</v>

1015
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Why do my clients have to spend all this extra money?</v>

1016
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Because somebody else is foolish with their money because now if you're</v>

1017
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:23.014
<v Speaker 2>responsible,</v>

1018
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 2>you get punished.</v>

1019
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:24.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1020
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 1>this rant started when I was asking you about the BP spill,</v>

1021
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.590
<v Speaker 1>the the idea that the government should possibly regularly that you don't.</v>

1022
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:35.770
<v Speaker 1>You feel that the market should regulate in situations like that where they</v>

1023
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:39.540
<v Speaker 1>should be responsible and be sued and that the government shouldn't step in and</v>

1024
00:31:39.541 --> 00:31:42.490
<v Speaker 1>force it because it seems like when you're dealing with something like bp,</v>

1025
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:46.840
<v Speaker 1>you've got this massive corporation that has untold billions of dollars that</v>

1026
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:51.841
<v Speaker 1>they can funnel and move and adjust and spend two to combat anything that would</v>

1027
00:31:53.621 --> 00:31:54.910
<v Speaker 1>cost them money.</v>

1028
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.341
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1029
00:31:55.341 --> 00:32:00.341
<v Speaker 2>one of the ironies of the whole situation is why are we drilling in such deep</v>

1030
00:32:00.591 --> 00:32:01.610
<v Speaker 2>water in the first place?</v>

1031
00:32:01.611 --> 00:32:06.140
<v Speaker 2>And it has to do with government environmental regulation that made it very</v>

1032
00:32:06.141 --> 00:32:08.420
<v Speaker 2>expensive to drill in shallower water.</v>

1033
00:32:08.421 --> 00:32:09.210
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>

1034
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:09.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1035
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.450
<v Speaker 2>less of an environmental threat.</v>

1037
00:32:11.451 --> 00:32:12.560
<v Speaker 2>It would be a lot easier.</v>

1038
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.730
<v Speaker 2>But the government,</v>

1039
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:13.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1040
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:18.530
<v Speaker 2>with all that regulation actually helped bring that situation about.</v>

1041
00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.750
<v Speaker 2>And also with</v>

1042
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:21.750
<v Speaker 1>cut costs on the,</v>

1043
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.290
<v Speaker 1>the way the well was construct.</v>

1044
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 2>But I also also,</v>

1045
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:29.110
<v Speaker 2>what happened is the government came in and the government cap liability,</v>

1046
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.190
<v Speaker 2>which was a mistake.</v>

1047
00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 2>The government basically told,</v>

1048
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:32.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1049
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 2>companies that your liability is capped at a certain amount.</v>

1050
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:36.730
<v Speaker 2>And that was the government,</v>

1051
00:32:36.731 --> 00:32:37.570
<v Speaker 2>not the free market.</v>

1052
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 2>And so because there was a liability cap imposed by government corporations were</v>

1053
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:42.470
<v Speaker 2>riskier,</v>

1054
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:43.340
<v Speaker 2>so they would've been.</v>

1055
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 2>And then of course then bp said,</v>

1056
00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:45.231
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1057
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:45.420
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1058
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1059
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going to pay even beyond the,</v>

1060
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.350
<v Speaker 2>beyond these camps,</v>

1061
00:32:48.351 --> 00:32:53.351
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of this was a byproduct of other government regulation and moral</v>

1062
00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:54.930
<v Speaker 2>hazard that resulted in,</v>

1063
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:55.710
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1064
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.981
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1065
00:32:55.981 --> 00:32:56.541
<v Speaker 2>in drilling,</v>

1066
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.880
<v Speaker 2>in deep water when we should've been drilling in shallower water,</v>

1067
00:32:58.881 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 2>we should be developing,</v>

1068
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:00.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1069
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:02.420
<v Speaker 2>what if we were developing more up in Alaska,</v>

1070
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.841
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1071
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 2>the government will let you do that.</v>

1072
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.570
<v Speaker 4>And so the people of Alaska don't want it either.</v>

1073
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1074
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.610
<v Speaker 4>actually unchecked wilderness.</v>

1075
00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.710
<v Speaker 4>So I think that people of Alaska do.</v>

1076
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.010
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1077
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:11.620
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>

1078
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.940
<v Speaker 4>I think I talked about all the time I've been to Alaska.</v>

1079
00:33:14.941 --> 00:33:18.960
<v Speaker 4>You when you'd talk to the average person in Alaska about drilling and there's</v>

1080
00:33:18.961 --> 00:33:21.090
<v Speaker 4>some people there that want jobs that might say yes,</v>

1081
00:33:21.091 --> 00:33:23.700
<v Speaker 4>but most people don't have a vested interest in that.</v>

1082
00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.210
<v Speaker 4>They don't want any drilling up there.</v>

1083
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.580
<v Speaker 4>And that place alone,</v>

1084
00:33:26.581 --> 00:33:27.414
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful.</v>

1085
00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1086
00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's also pretty big but not big,</v>

1087
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.570
<v Speaker 4>but they don't want to fuck any of it up because if you start fucking up one</v>

1088
00:33:33.571 --> 00:33:33.961
<v Speaker 4>part,</v>

1089
00:33:33.961 --> 00:33:35.190
<v Speaker 4>why not fuck up other parts?</v>

1090
00:33:35.191 --> 00:33:37.770
<v Speaker 4>Why not before you know you're going to look out and you can see mountains with</v>

1091
00:33:37.771 --> 00:33:38.381
<v Speaker 4>oil wells,</v>

1092
00:33:38.381 --> 00:33:39.890
<v Speaker 4>so you're gonna see a lot of nonsense.</v>

1093
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:41.220
<v Speaker 4>You're to see poisoning of the water.</v>

1094
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.060
<v Speaker 4>You're going to see all that.</v>

1095
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.170
<v Speaker 4>It's the last frontier.</v>

1096
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:43.850
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1097
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:44.061
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1098
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:48.510
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying when it comes to this idea of a government regulation</v>

1099
00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:49.171
<v Speaker 4>and BP,</v>

1100
00:33:49.171 --> 00:33:52.650
<v Speaker 4>but I don't see them spending money to,</v>

1101
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.010
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1102
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:53.843
<v Speaker 4>to fix it.</v>

1103
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1104
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:54.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1105
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>

1106
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:55.730
<v Speaker 2>You know how much,</v>

1107
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1108
00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:57.850
<v Speaker 2>how much money bp last,</v>

1109
00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1110
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 2>you just see what happened to the value of their shares,</v>

1111
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.770
<v Speaker 2>how much money they've had to spend a in litigation and claims</v>

1112
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:04.740
<v Speaker 4>not enough,</v>

1113
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.950
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know if they've done an unbelievable job fucking up the ocean.</v>

1114
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.230
<v Speaker 4>They've killed massive amounts of wildlife.</v>

1115
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:13.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean they should give everything they have ever made ever.</v>

1116
00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:14.131
<v Speaker 4>And then some,</v>

1117
00:34:14.131 --> 00:34:19.110
<v Speaker 4>but then they're not done is an unbelievable disservice to the planet itself.</v>

1118
00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:19.291
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1119
00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:19.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1120
00:34:19.531 --> 00:34:21.330
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people want to vilify.</v>

1121
00:34:21.331 --> 00:34:21.661
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1122
00:34:21.661 --> 00:34:22.890
<v Speaker 4>The big bad oil companies,</v>

1123
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.180
<v Speaker 4>big oil companies,</v>

1124
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:24.750
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1125
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.650
<v Speaker 4>they cut corners and that's why it happened in the first place.</v>

1126
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.191
<v Speaker 4>But okay,</v>

1127
00:34:29.191 --> 00:34:30.930
<v Speaker 4>so let's say we didn't have any oil companies.</v>

1128
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:31.890
<v Speaker 4>I guess they're bad,</v>

1129
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.161
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1130
00:34:32.161 --> 00:34:35.190
<v Speaker 4>So let's not say that that's a general blanket generalization,</v>

1131
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.930
<v Speaker 4>but let's say we have an oil company that's like bp that cuts corners precisely</v>

1132
00:34:39.931 --> 00:34:41.490
<v Speaker 4>to save money and in doing so,</v>

1133
00:34:41.491 --> 00:34:42.840
<v Speaker 4>they cause a massive,</v>

1134
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.140
<v Speaker 4>massive environmental damage that I believe personally you can't put a dollar</v>

1135
00:34:46.141 --> 00:34:46.800
<v Speaker 4>value on.</v>

1136
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.750
<v Speaker 4>What they've done is enormous.</v>

1137
00:34:48.751 --> 00:34:50.640
<v Speaker 4>They've ruined a part of the earth.</v>

1138
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:50.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1139
00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:52.870
<v Speaker 4>but they obviously didn't do it intentionally.</v>

1140
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:55.890
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the data and you know what they didn't do intentionally,</v>

1141
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.680
<v Speaker 4>they made money and in doing that intentionally and making money,</v>

1142
00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:02.640
<v Speaker 4>they made sure that they made as much money as possible in the shortest amount</v>

1143
00:35:02.641 --> 00:35:03.474
<v Speaker 4>of time as possible,</v>

1144
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.880
<v Speaker 4>which led them to cut corners in the construction of the well,</v>

1145
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.820
<v Speaker 4>which makes them ultimately responsible 100 percent for the damage.</v>

1146
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.280
<v Speaker 4>And the damage is bad.</v>

1147
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:11.840
<v Speaker 4>What they don't deserve.</v>

1148
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:12.900
<v Speaker 4>What if we.</v>

1149
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.480
<v Speaker 4>What if we</v>

1150
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.250
<v Speaker 2>punished bp to the point,</v>

1151
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.420
<v Speaker 2>let's say we destroy them,</v>

1152
00:35:16.421 --> 00:35:17.260
<v Speaker 2>we wiped him out,</v>

1153
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.670
<v Speaker 2>wiped out their shareholders.</v>

1154
00:35:18.671 --> 00:35:22.000
<v Speaker 2>The company is bankrupt and they're no longer in the oil drilling business.</v>

1155
00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.133
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>

1156
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.490
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1157
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1158
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.700
<v Speaker 2>we increased the risks so much that nobody wants to listen.</v>

1159
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:27.780
<v Speaker 4>We give them a new job.</v>

1160
00:35:27.781 --> 00:35:29.100
<v Speaker 4>The new job is clean the ocean.</v>

1161
00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.113
<v Speaker 4>That's my new job.</v>

1162
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.171
<v Speaker 4>New Industry.</v>

1163
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:32.004
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1164
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 4>how?</v>

1165
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm in southern California,</v>

1166
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1167
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.300
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

1168
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:35.570
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1169
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.870
<v Speaker 4>if we put the oil companies out of,</v>

1170
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.060
<v Speaker 4>we're not completing them all</v>

1171
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:38.221
<v Speaker 3>at it,</v>

1172
00:35:38.221 --> 00:35:39.054
<v Speaker 3>but believe me,</v>

1173
00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:39.410
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1174
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:40.590
<v Speaker 3>there's several oil companies,</v>

1175
00:35:40.591 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Speaker 3>but no one is responsible,</v>

1176
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:42.811
<v Speaker 3>but something horrible.</v>

1177
00:35:42.811 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 3>What if bp went away and if we raise the risks of drilling for oil,</v>

1178
00:35:47.641 --> 00:35:48.500
<v Speaker 3>if we told companies,</v>

1179
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.960
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1180
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1181
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:51.200
<v Speaker 3>you screw up and you're gone,</v>

1182
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1183
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 3>You're totally wiped out.</v>

1184
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 3>And so now insurance and liability insurance goes up and let's say so now</v>

1185
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:57.930
<v Speaker 3>gasoline has to be,</v>

1186
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.231
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1187
00:35:58.231 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 3>$20 a gallon,</v>

1188
00:35:59.161 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 3>$3 account.</v>

1189
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.331
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>

1190
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:01.150
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

1191
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1192
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:01.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1193
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:01.810
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1194
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:02.240
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1195
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.580
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>

1196
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.110
<v Speaker 3>One company going down is not going to.</v>

1197
00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:04.171
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1198
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:04.261
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1199
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:04.400
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1200
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not $20.</v>

1201
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not one company I'm talking about.</v>

1202
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.440
<v Speaker 3>You're raising the cost throughout the entire.</v>

1203
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.660
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have less people exploring for oil,</v>

1204
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:13.480
<v Speaker 3>less people,</v>

1205
00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.131
<v Speaker 3>less money going,</v>

1206
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:14.250
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1207
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:14.551
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1208
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

1209
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.740
<v Speaker 3>if you look at some of the oil companies,</v>

1210
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.620
<v Speaker 3>they're barely even making money at a $100 oil.</v>

1211
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:19.811
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1212
00:36:19.811 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1213
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 3>I got bad news from and oil prices are going a lot higher anyway.</v>

1214
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 3>They're already going a lot higher.</v>

1215
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:28.200
<v Speaker 3>So people in southern California have got to get ready for $10 a gallon.</v>

1216
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Gasoline or hire someone listened to this conversation,</v>

1217
00:36:31.171 --> 00:36:32.370
<v Speaker 3>listen to you saying this and say,</v>

1218
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:32.521
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1219
00:36:32.521 --> 00:36:33.354
<v Speaker 3>this guy does.</v>

1220
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.950
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that banks should fail,</v>

1221
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:36.090
<v Speaker 3>but oil companies shouldn't.</v>

1222
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.281
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1223
00:36:36.281 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1224
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I think the free market should,</v>

1225
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:38.550
<v Speaker 3>should,</v>

1226
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.590
<v Speaker 3>should be allowed to,</v>

1227
00:36:39.591 --> 00:36:39.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1228
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.673
<v Speaker 3>to operate.</v>

1229
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.513
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1230
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.050
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1231
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 3>and how do you assess liability and something like bp because bp,</v>

1232
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:48.930
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's not enough money in the world will make up for what they've</v>

1233
00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:49.460
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

1234
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1235
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.483
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

1236
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that are filing claims against BP,</v>

1237
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:54.181
<v Speaker 3>they don't have it.</v>

1238
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:54.750
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even ask.</v>

1239
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.730
<v Speaker 3>They just all kinds of false or fraudulent claims are coming in by the damage.</v>

1240
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:00.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there was a few,</v>

1241
00:37:00.571 --> 00:37:02.520
<v Speaker 3>but there's maybe a few of those,</v>

1242
00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:03.270
<v Speaker 3>but you can't.</v>

1243
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.120
<v Speaker 3>You can't doubt that there a lot of people affected by that.</v>

1244
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.050
<v Speaker 3>The fisherman,</v>

1245
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:08.040
<v Speaker 3>but people that work there,</v>

1246
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 3>but how about the actual impact on the earth itself,</v>

1247
00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.670
<v Speaker 3>but shouldn't they be responsible for that?</v>

1248
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:13.650
<v Speaker 3>They are responsible,</v>

1249
00:37:13.651 --> 00:37:17.790
<v Speaker 3>but you can't overlook how are people's lives improved by the fact that we have</v>

1250
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:21.420
<v Speaker 3>oil by the fact that we can drive cars around now if you want to invent oil and</v>

1251
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 3>BP,</v>

1252
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:22.740
<v Speaker 3>but vent cars,</v>

1253
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:23.551
<v Speaker 3>they didn't invent it,</v>

1254
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:26.220
<v Speaker 3>but they're out there producing the oil well,</v>

1255
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 3>but because of that,</v>

1256
00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 3>they should be able to do such a colossal fuck up and then they'll do.</v>

1257
00:37:30.031 --> 00:37:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Business members will make billions of dollars.</v>

1258
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:35.910
<v Speaker 3>The government shouldn't have removed the liability restrictions.</v>

1259
00:37:35.911 --> 00:37:36.840
<v Speaker 3>That said that,</v>

1260
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.090
<v Speaker 3>how much you can sue if you have real damages.</v>

1261
00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 3>I want real market forces,</v>

1262
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:44.130
<v Speaker 3>so you think that the market forces would have influenced them to spend more</v>

1263
00:37:44.131 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 3>money in the construction of the well not cut corners in order to reach it.</v>

1264
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:47.611
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1265
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 3>they might not have even been drilling there.</v>

1266
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:49.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1267
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:50.910
<v Speaker 3>if it was a free market energy,</v>

1268
00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 3>but they might've been trill drilling in areas,</v>

1269
00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:53.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1270
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.110
<v Speaker 3>that were generally safer,</v>

1271
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:57.810
<v Speaker 3>but the government will let people would vote against that.</v>

1272
00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 3>If given the opportunity.</v>

1273
00:37:58.771 --> 00:38:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to have a giant oil rig 50,</v>

1274
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1275
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.900
<v Speaker 3>100 yards off shore where you could see it.</v>

1276
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Most people are gonna say no.</v>

1277
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 3>Most people going to think that if there is a mistake,</v>

1278
00:38:07.471 --> 00:38:08.610
<v Speaker 3>which there are quite often.</v>

1279
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1280
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 3>it's not all the time,</v>

1281
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:12.840
<v Speaker 3>but we can think of several in our lifetimes.</v>

1282
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:17.580
<v Speaker 3>We know about big oil disasters where Exxon val ds or whether it's this,</v>

1283
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:17.941
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1284
00:38:17.941 --> 00:38:18.161
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1285
00:38:18.161 --> 00:38:19.680
<v Speaker 3>this most recent one,</v>

1286
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.000
<v Speaker 3>those happen.</v>

1287
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.740
<v Speaker 3>People don't want that risk.</v>

1288
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1289
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.760
<v Speaker 3>But I mean people also don't want extremely expensive gasoline,</v>

1290
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:27.800
<v Speaker 3>so there's always a tradeoff.</v>

1291
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 3>But the big risks that we face,</v>

1292
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:29.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1293
00:38:29.761 --> 00:38:31.050
<v Speaker 3>you could talk about an oil spill.</v>

1294
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:31.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1295
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:31.861
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1296
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:36.090
<v Speaker 3>the economic catastrophe that the government is in the process of is going</v>

1297
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:40.260
<v Speaker 2>to have such a profound impact across this economy that these,</v>

1298
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:40.601
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1299
00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:41.081
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1300
00:38:41.081 --> 00:38:41.900
<v Speaker 2>while they're bad,</v>

1301
00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:42.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1302
00:38:42.141 --> 00:38:46.210
<v Speaker 2>in our tiny compared to what's coming compared to the economic,</v>

1303
00:38:46.211 --> 00:38:46.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:46.761
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1305
00:38:46.761 --> 00:38:47.680
<v Speaker 2>this is California,</v>

1306
00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:51.250
<v Speaker 2>so we're gonna get a 10 plus on the Richter scale and the things that we're</v>

1307
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 2>talking about really don't even register can on it at all compared to what we're</v>

1308
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 2>going to go through in the United States.</v>

1309
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.200
<v Speaker 2>I cost of government.</v>

1310
00:38:59.201 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 2>You can look at,</v>

1311
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:00.011
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1312
00:39:00.011 --> 00:39:01.990
<v Speaker 2>we think we want government to protect us from this,</v>

1313
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:03.670
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile you've got this huge,</v>

1314
00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:08.671
<v Speaker 2>enormous government that is creating a massive catastrophe that's coming and,</v>

1315
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:09.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1316
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1317
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.370
<v Speaker 2>and then we were probably going to end up with a lot more pollution when we're a</v>

1318
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:14.291
<v Speaker 2>poor nation.</v>

1319
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 2>We can't even afford,</v>

1320
00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:16.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1321
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1322
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.610
<v Speaker 2>to do the things that would keep the environment clean.</v>

1323
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Or we're going to be chopping wood to stay warm and there'll be no pollution.</v>

1324
00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Will go completely cave man.</v>

1325
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1326
00:39:24.191 --> 00:39:25.180
<v Speaker 2>go with the other way.</v>

1327
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 2>And I trading metals that we find on the street.</v>

1328
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1329
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:27.731
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1330
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:31.690
<v Speaker 2>you probably initially there'll probably be some cleaner air here in southern</v>

1331
00:39:31.691 --> 00:39:34.330
<v Speaker 2>California and no one can afford to drive that.</v>

1332
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:34.901
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>

1333
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the next crisis.</v>

1334
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:37.100
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1335
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Come is going to kill the dollar.</v>

1336
00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.930
<v Speaker 2>And then prices are gonna go way up.</v>

1337
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:41.420
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1338
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:41.590
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1339
00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:41.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1340
00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:42.001
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1341
00:39:42.001 --> 00:39:42.341
<v Speaker 2>they made,</v>

1342
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:42.941
<v Speaker 2>ended up with,</v>

1343
00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:43.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1344
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1345
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:43.871
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1346
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:44.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1347
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:44.531
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1348
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:44.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1349
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:45.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1350
00:39:45.101 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1351
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.470
<v Speaker 2>shortages because they might have price controls.</v>

1352
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I think there's going to be big power blackouts because when energy costs really</v>

1353
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:51.640
<v Speaker 2>sore,</v>

1354
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 2>because when the dollar tanks,</v>

1355
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:53.500
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1356
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.210
<v Speaker 2>even though we're producing a lot of oil in theU ,</v>

1357
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.103
<v Speaker 2>s right now,</v>

1358
00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.340
<v Speaker 2>none of it's going to be consumed here.</v>

1359
00:39:57.341 --> 00:40:00.490
<v Speaker 2>It's all going to be shipped over to Asia because their currencies are going to</v>

1360
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:01.310
<v Speaker 2>be stronger.</v>

1361
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1362
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.610
<v Speaker 2>you imagine you've got all these people in China,</v>

1363
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.720
<v Speaker 2>they're working hard,</v>

1364
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.740
<v Speaker 2>they're in factories are producing,</v>

1365
00:40:06.741 --> 00:40:07.574
<v Speaker 2>they're saving,</v>

1366
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.021
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1367
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:08.441
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

1368
00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:08.661
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1369
00:40:08.661 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 2>they're sacrificing to prop up our economy because a lot of the stuff that they</v>

1370
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:14.200
<v Speaker 2>produce get shipped over here.</v>

1371
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1372
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 2>when the dollar collapses,</v>

1373
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.760
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to shift stuff any over over here anymore.</v>

1374
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.330
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna,</v>

1375
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.190
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna make it and then they're going to take it home.</v>

1376
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.580
<v Speaker 2>They're going to consume this stuff and you have a lot of Chinese now that are</v>

1377
00:40:24.581 --> 00:40:25.960
<v Speaker 2>riding around on bicycles.</v>

1378
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:26.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1379
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:26.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1380
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.120
<v Speaker 2>when the dollar collapses,</v>

1381
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:29.680
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to ride bicycles anymore.</v>

1382
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.560
<v Speaker 2>They're going to drive cars and they're going to use a lot of gasoline.</v>

1383
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Americans are going to be riding around on bicycles.</v>

1384
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:41.310
<v Speaker 2>I still don't see how that relates to protecting environments from corporations</v>

1385
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:43.510
<v Speaker 2>that pose massive.</v>

1386
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:43.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1387
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1388
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:49.030
<v Speaker 2>My point is that the greatest threat to America is not corporations.</v>

1389
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.013
<v Speaker 2>It's the government.</v>

1390
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:50.780
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1391
00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.430
<v Speaker 2>and you know the interesting thing when you have a lot of people that are afraid</v>

1392
00:40:54.431 --> 00:40:56.950
<v Speaker 2>of corporations and these big corporations are bad.</v>

1393
00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like you know,</v>

1394
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1395
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:02.950
<v Speaker 2>but what could a corporation in general do to you if they can make a product and</v>

1396
00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:04.030
<v Speaker 2>they can hope that you buy it,</v>

1397
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:09.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's your decision you choose and the way a corporation or which is just a</v>

1398
00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:10.121
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

1399
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:10.331
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1400
00:41:10.331 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 2>It's just the ownership structure is a corporation.</v>

1401
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 2>And the corporation run by people just like everybody else.</v>

1402
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 2>But if a corporation wants you to buy their product,</v>

1403
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.240
<v Speaker 2>they have to give you a good deal.</v>

1404
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:21.250
<v Speaker 2>They got to give you a better price than somebody else.</v>

1405
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:22.660
<v Speaker 2>They got to give you a higher quality.</v>

1406
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.890
<v Speaker 2>They have to win your business and you only buy their products or consume their</v>

1407
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:27.724
<v Speaker 2>services if,</v>

1408
00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.020
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1409
00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 2>if it's to your advantage to do so.</v>

1410
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.840
<v Speaker 2>So it's all voluntary cooperation,</v>

1411
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 2>both sides benefit or nobody would trade.</v>

1412
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1413
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at government,</v>

1414
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.250
<v Speaker 2>it's very different.</v>

1415
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1416
00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a voluntary relationship with the government.</v>

1417
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:40.820
<v Speaker 2>The government is forced.</v>

1418
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 2>The government says you have to do this or we're putting you in jail.</v>

1419
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

1420
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to force you to do this.</v>

1421
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1422
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

1423
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna require you to do that.</v>

1424
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.800
<v Speaker 2>You have to pay this tax.</v>

1425
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:49.634
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't do it,</v>

1426
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:50.510
<v Speaker 2>we put you in jail.</v>

1427
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 2>So government has real power.</v>

1428
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Corporations have no power.</v>

1429
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.770
<v Speaker 2>The government has all the power.</v>

1430
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:56.300
<v Speaker 2>So we should fear government</v>

1431
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.410
<v Speaker 1>have money though.</v>

1432
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.290
<v Speaker 1>If corporates and save money and there is a government,</v>

1433
00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:03.090
<v Speaker 1>the corporations can influence the government.</v>

1434
00:42:03.091 --> 00:42:04.140
<v Speaker 1>It's always been the case.</v>

1435
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It always will.</v>

1436
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.280
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't always been the case,</v>

1437
00:42:06.281 --> 00:42:06.881
<v Speaker 2>but you're right,</v>

1438
00:42:06.881 --> 00:42:11.710
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that if we allow corporations to buy government influence that</v>

1439
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:16.490
<v Speaker 2>corporations shouldn't be able to donate to political parties about might be a</v>

1440
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:16.860
<v Speaker 2>potluck,</v>

1441
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.940
<v Speaker 2>good reform because let individuals do it,</v>

1442
00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:19.780
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1443
00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 2>but if we allow corporations right,</v>

1444
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.900
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1445
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1446
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:24.760
<v Speaker 2>to buy influence,</v>

1447
00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:25.421
<v Speaker 2>then that,</v>

1448
00:42:25.421 --> 00:42:26.111
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>

1449
00:42:26.111 --> 00:42:28.300
<v Speaker 2>But the problem isn't that the corporations are buying it.</v>

1450
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.850
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that we allow the government to sell it or to peddle associated.</v>

1451
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.510
<v Speaker 2>If we were to go back to the constitution,</v>

1452
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1453
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.500
<v Speaker 2>but if we forced the government to obey the law,</v>

1454
00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.240
<v Speaker 2>then there is no influence to sell.</v>

1455
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:40.890
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1456
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.910
<v Speaker 2>if all we get from government is freedom,</v>

1457
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1458
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.111
<v Speaker 2>And Liberty,</v>

1459
00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:46.660
<v Speaker 2>which means we have laws that protect private property,</v>

1460
00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.570
<v Speaker 2>but we don't create special privileges for some people,</v>

1461
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.100
<v Speaker 2>then there's no power to lobby,</v>

1462
00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:51.934
<v Speaker 2>to lobby for.</v>

1463
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:56.050
<v Speaker 2>But right now we allow our politicians to sell power to the highest bidder.</v>

1464
00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.850
<v Speaker 2>That's not the Ford of the bitters.</v>

1465
00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.030
<v Speaker 2>The fault of the bitters because if I'm a business and I don't try to get a</v>

1466
00:43:01.031 --> 00:43:02.020
<v Speaker 2>favor from government,</v>

1467
00:43:02.021 --> 00:43:04.180
<v Speaker 2>what if my competition gets a favor and,</v>

1468
00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:08.140
<v Speaker 2>and then uses government power to squash me so everybody is forced to bid for</v>

1469
00:43:08.141 --> 00:43:08.830
<v Speaker 2>that power.</v>

1470
00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.240
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is government.</v>

1471
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:13.360
<v Speaker 2>We have to take the power away from government and then there's no more lobbying</v>

1472
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.090
<v Speaker 2>because there's nothing to lobby for.</v>

1473
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.431
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1474
00:43:15.431 --> 00:43:16.001
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>

1475
00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So how about a situation where like in the movie,</v>

1476
00:43:18.671 --> 00:43:23.671
<v Speaker 1>inside job we have these economics professors that they set these standards and</v>

1477
00:43:24.971 --> 00:43:27.580
<v Speaker 1>give advice and then they wind up getting jobs with banks.</v>

1478
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:30.130
<v Speaker 1>You clearly need economic advisors though.</v>

1479
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.840
<v Speaker 1>If I do,</v>

1480
00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.550
<v Speaker 1>don't the government in my.</v>

1481
00:43:33.551 --> 00:43:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm a senator and my background is in real estate sales or what have you.</v>

1482
00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1483
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.980
<v Speaker 1>let's say he's a businessman.</v>

1484
00:43:38.981 --> 00:43:41.200
<v Speaker 1>He sells computers and then he gets into politics.</v>

1485
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:42.121
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1486
00:43:42.121 --> 00:43:44.760
<v Speaker 1>What do you really know about economics?</v>

1487
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a degree in economics to trillium.</v>

1488
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1489
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I think if you have a degree in economics,</v>

1490
00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:52.060
<v Speaker 2>then you've probably lost you.</v>

1491
00:43:52.061 --> 00:43:56.130
<v Speaker 2>You probably know more about economics before you get your degree then after,</v>

1492
00:43:56.131 --> 00:43:56.491
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1493
00:43:56.491 --> 00:43:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you say you need economic advisors,</v>

1494
00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:00.810
<v Speaker 2>so we have a council of economic advisors for the president,</v>

1495
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.810
<v Speaker 2>but that we didn't even have that before the Second World War.</v>

1496
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:06.210
<v Speaker 2>There were no economic advisors advising the president,</v>

1497
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:11.130
<v Speaker 2>but America became the wealthiest country the world had ever known.</v>

1498
00:44:11.131 --> 00:44:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean America in 1945,</v>

1499
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1500
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.050
<v Speaker 2>There is no comparison to America today.</v>

1501
00:44:16.051 --> 00:44:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1502
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.333
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1503
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:17.970
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1504
00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.140
<v Speaker 2>It was a completely different planet.</v>

1505
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1506
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.290
<v Speaker 2>being American was something totally different than what it means now.</v>

1507
00:44:22.291 --> 00:44:25.860
<v Speaker 2>There was no other country where the standard of living was even anywhere close</v>

1508
00:44:25.861 --> 00:44:26.694
<v Speaker 2>to what we enjoyed,</v>

1509
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:27.840
<v Speaker 2>but we built that.</v>

1510
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 2>We built the wealthiest,</v>

1511
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:30.930
<v Speaker 2>this wealthiest society in the history of the world,</v>

1512
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 2>way wealthier than</v>

1513
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.030
<v Speaker 3>we are today in,</v>

1514
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:33.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1515
00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:34.290
<v Speaker 3>in relative terms,</v>

1516
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.780
<v Speaker 3>without any economic advisors and all.</v>

1517
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1518
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.520
<v Speaker 3>we should fire everybody in Washington who was economic advisor and the title</v>

1519
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 3>that we don't need an economic advisors.</v>

1520
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.210
<v Speaker 3>The best economy is a free economy.</v>

1521
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.710
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need micromanaged,</v>

1522
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.250
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>

1523
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:47.560
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

1524
00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.150
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be a socialist and you want to try to micromanage and centrally</v>

1525
00:44:51.151 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 3>planned the economy,</v>

1526
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 3>then you need advisors,</v>

1527
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.780
<v Speaker 3>but if you believe in capitalism,</v>

1528
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.070
<v Speaker 3>there is no advice,</v>

1529
00:44:56.071 --> 00:44:59.490
<v Speaker 3>just let the market function and then you're going to have the most efficient</v>

1530
00:44:59.491 --> 00:44:59.851
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>

1531
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:03.150
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have the most efficient allocation of resources you're going to</v>

1532
00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:03.280
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1533
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 3>The higher standard of living for your people is when the government comes in</v>

1534
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:11.220
<v Speaker 3>and tries to substitute individual judgments for the free market.</v>

1535
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.480
<v Speaker 3>That's when you create problems,</v>

1536
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't the whole situation after World War II based on the fact that most</v>

1537
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:18.210
<v Speaker 3>of the planet had been at war.</v>

1538
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 3>The economic situation in Europe was terrible because they had massive amounts</v>

1539
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:23.281
<v Speaker 3>of destruction,</v>

1540
00:45:23.281 --> 00:45:24.440
<v Speaker 3>massive loss of lives.</v>

1541
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1542
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Japan had just surrendered to the United States.</v>

1543
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:28.980
<v Speaker 3>China was a communist country.</v>

1544
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:33.330
<v Speaker 3>There was so much even about the world and the job to say how great America was</v>

1545
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.770
<v Speaker 3>is to compare it to what?</v>

1546
00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.673
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1547
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Then go before the war.</v>

1548
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Look at 19,</v>

1549
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:38.610
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

1550
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1551
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.230
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the rate of economic growth in the United States in the 19th</v>

1552
00:45:43.231 --> 00:45:43.740
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>

1553
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:47.070
<v Speaker 3>take take the end of the civil war to the beginning of the first world war,</v>

1554
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.650
<v Speaker 3>so forget about all the destruction.</v>

1555
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.871
<v Speaker 3>Europe.</v>

1556
00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 3>You look at 18,</v>

1557
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:51.540
<v Speaker 3>65 to 1913.</v>

1558
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.180
<v Speaker 3>You look at the change in wealth.</v>

1559
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:54.970
<v Speaker 3>There was a.</v>

1560
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.250
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing like America.</v>

1561
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:56.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1562
00:45:56.581 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 3>why do you think all the immigrants were pouring into America from Europe?</v>

1563
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.690
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't because they wanted to get on welfare because we had no welfare.</v>

1564
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:04.830
<v Speaker 3>They wanted freedom.</v>

1565
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 3>We had something that the world didn't have.</v>

1566
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.050
<v Speaker 3>You can come to America and do what you wanted.</v>

1567
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:09.970
<v Speaker 3>There was no income tax.</v>

1568
00:46:09.971 --> 00:46:11.280
<v Speaker 3>There was no social security tax.</v>

1569
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.540
<v Speaker 3>You can start a business.</v>

1570
00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:13.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1571
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.340
<v Speaker 3>there was no labor law.</v>

1572
00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:14.851
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

1573
00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can get a job.</v>

1574
00:46:15.931 --> 00:46:16.980
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can hire somebody,</v>

1575
00:46:16.981 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 3>but it can fire somebody.</v>

1576
00:46:17.971 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have the government looking over your shoulder and we created massive</v>

1577
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:22.800
<v Speaker 3>amounts of wealth,</v>

1578
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 3>not just for,</v>

1579
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:24.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1580
00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.510
<v Speaker 3>the rockefellers and the carnegies and you know,</v>

1581
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.390
<v Speaker 3>the vanderbilts,</v>

1582
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.950
<v Speaker 3>but for average people to standard of living rose rapidly.</v>

1583
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Poor people from all over the world came to America,</v>

1584
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:35.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1585
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:35.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1586
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1587
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.181
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1588
00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:36.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1589
00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1590
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:39.300
<v Speaker 3>to pursue whatever they couldn't pursue in their own countries because they</v>

1591
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:40.120
<v Speaker 3>didn't have the freedom,</v>

1592
00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 3>but it was also a new territory.</v>

1593
00:46:41.791 --> 00:46:45.750
<v Speaker 3>It was a completely new uncharted land that had just started to set up cities</v>

1594
00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:46.980
<v Speaker 3>within the last hundred years.</v>

1595
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:49.380
<v Speaker 3>People had heard about all the jobs that were available.</v>

1596
00:46:49.381 --> 00:46:50.430
<v Speaker 3>It was just a new why.</v>

1597
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Speaker 3>But why were those jobs there?</v>

1598
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 3>It was because we were free to create them.</v>

1599
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.310
<v Speaker 3>And in their own countries they didn't have that level of freedom.</v>

1600
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.181
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

1601
00:46:57.181 --> 00:47:00.390
<v Speaker 3>It was capitalism on a scale that was never before.</v>

1602
00:47:00.391 --> 00:47:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Tried and,</v>

1603
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:01.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1604
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.910
<v Speaker 3>and this is where it's succeeded.</v>

1605
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:05.650
<v Speaker 3>And we created that level of wealth without planners,</v>

1606
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.940
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1607
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.470
<v Speaker 3>without economic advisors,</v>

1608
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.760
<v Speaker 3>without these taxes,</v>

1609
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.020
<v Speaker 3>without these regulations.</v>

1610
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:10.771
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1611
00:47:10.771 --> 00:47:11.760
<v Speaker 3>even though we had,</v>

1612
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:12.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1613
00:47:12.061 --> 00:47:12.721
<v Speaker 3>a lot of very,</v>

1614
00:47:12.721 --> 00:47:13.650
<v Speaker 3>very wealthy people,</v>

1615
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 3>how do they get wealthy?</v>

1616
00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:18.870
<v Speaker 3>They got wealthy by satisfying the demands and the needs of,</v>

1617
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:19.090
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1618
00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 3>of the masses of average people.</v>

1619
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.860
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1620
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.150
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1621
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:24.000
<v Speaker 3>and everybody got wealthy together today.</v>

1622
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:24.834
<v Speaker 3>What do we have now?</v>

1623
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:26.000
<v Speaker 3>How do people get removed now?</v>

1624
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Everybody didn't get wealthy together.</v>

1625
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of people that were poor as fuck back then as well as today.</v>

1626
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:31.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1627
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:31.361
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1628
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:31.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1629
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1630
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.740
<v Speaker 3>There's always going to be.</v>

1631
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1632
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:32.920
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1633
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.250
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1634
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.190
<v Speaker 3>There were people that were poor relative to people who were rich.</v>

1635
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 3>But if you take the typical person in 18,</v>

1636
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 3>65,</v>

1637
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1638
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:40.290

1639
00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:40.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 3>He typical person to live on a farm.</v>

1642
00:47:43.931 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 3>We did.</v>

1643
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:48.320
<v Speaker 3>They were both farmers telling them where people are going to New York to</v>

1644
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.261
<v Speaker 3>Boston.</v>

1645
00:47:50.261 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1646
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.680
<v Speaker 3>There were some people we were in a percentage of people lived in,</v>

1647
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1648
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:55.151
<v Speaker 3>look it up.</v>

1649
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:55.971
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact person,</v>

1650
00:47:55.971 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 3>but people.</v>

1651
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 3>But even if they lived in New York,</v>

1652
00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1653
00:47:58.210 --> 00:47:58.690
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1654
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have any electricity,</v>

1655
00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:00.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1656
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:01.090
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1657
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:01.290
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1658
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:02.470
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have indoor plumbing,</v>

1659
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 3>have gangs of New York style,</v>

1660
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't have air conditioning.</v>

1661
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:06.480
<v Speaker 3>They lived,</v>

1662
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1663
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.470
<v Speaker 3>but by,</v>

1664
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 3>by 1913 right now you had a lot of people living in cities,</v>

1665
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:13.600
<v Speaker 3>but they had indoor plumbing.</v>

1666
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.620
<v Speaker 3>They had electric lights.</v>

1667
00:48:14.621 --> 00:48:15.580
<v Speaker 3>They had to telephone.</v>

1668
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1669
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.271
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1670
00:48:16.271 --> 00:48:16.561
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1671
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:17.110
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>

1672
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:17.411
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1673
00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:17.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1674
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:21.520
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of gadgets that made their lives better.</v>

1675
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:22.780
<v Speaker 3>That didn't exist.</v>

1676
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1677
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.681
<v Speaker 3>in 18,</v>

1678
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:24.371
<v Speaker 3>65.</v>

1679
00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:26.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody's life got better,</v>

1680
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 3>but he got a symptom of just technological innovation and the constant</v>

1681
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:31.840
<v Speaker 3>improvement of,</v>

1682
00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:33.820
<v Speaker 3>of devices and things that we've always gone through.</v>

1683
00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1684
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:35.080
<v Speaker 3>we didn't always go through it.</v>

1685
00:48:35.081 --> 00:48:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1686
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:36.610
<v Speaker 3>things have always gone through that.</v>

1687
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.340
<v Speaker 3>If you go back for thousands of years,</v>

1688
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:40.540
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have that kind of progress.</v>

1689
00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:40.691
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1690
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:41.310
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

1691
00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:42.400
<v Speaker 3>because it's exponential,</v>

1692
00:48:42.401 --> 00:48:43.090
<v Speaker 3>but if you were,</v>

1693
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:46.060
<v Speaker 3>but it was the freedom that we had and that enabled us to do it.</v>

1694
00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:46.211
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1695
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:47.230
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't an accident,</v>

1696
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:50.470
<v Speaker 3>sort of a lot of things that was created in Europe.</v>

1697
00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:52.480
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of things that were created in China.</v>

1698
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 3>They developed over the world.</v>

1699
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.870
<v Speaker 3>If you look at where America was,</v>

1700
00:48:55.871 --> 00:48:56.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1701
00:48:56.081 --> 00:48:59.380
<v Speaker 3>going into the first world war and you look at like all the cars and all the,</v>

1702
00:48:59.381 --> 00:48:59.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1703
00:48:59.581 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 3>the 90 percent of everything was here.</v>

1704
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:02.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1705
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:02.950
<v Speaker 3>we made everything.</v>

1706
00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:04.120
<v Speaker 3>We consumed everything.</v>

1707
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.280
<v Speaker 3>We had our standard of living unparalleled.</v>

1708
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1709
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.350
<v Speaker 3>poor people in America were,</v>

1710
00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:08.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1711
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:09.910
<v Speaker 3>were wealthy in other countries.</v>

1712
00:49:09.911 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 3>That's where the whole expression ugly American came from and somebody in</v>

1713
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 3>American would go to Europe,</v>

1714
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.641
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1715
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Speaker 3>and they were just a school teacher or a plumber and they got there and they</v>

1716
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:22.210
<v Speaker 3>thought they were king because everything was so cheap compared to things.</v>

1717
00:49:22.211 --> 00:49:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Here we have so much that,</v>

1718
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.340
<v Speaker 3>that people didn't know the term ugly American came from us being assholes</v>

1719
00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:28.174
<v Speaker 3>because we</v>

1720
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.110
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to speak the language.</v>

1721
00:49:32.111 --> 00:49:33.190
<v Speaker 3>We would go over there.</v>

1722
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:33.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1723
00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.510
<v Speaker 3>you speak English.</v>

1724
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 3>We went to France.</v>

1725
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:36.070
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1726
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.300
<v Speaker 3>the attitude that we had when we got there of superiority and how,</v>

1727
00:49:39.301 --> 00:49:41.920
<v Speaker 3>which we were and how everybody didn't have any of the things that we had.</v>

1728
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.360
<v Speaker 3>That was really where it came from.</v>

1729
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.290
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we'll listen to.</v>

1730
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing you're guessing as well.</v>

1731
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Neither one of us were in Europe in the fifties,</v>

1732
00:49:47.941 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 3>so we don't really know where that term actually came up,</v>

1733
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:51.100
<v Speaker 3>but that's how,</v>

1734
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.140
<v Speaker 3>that's how it ordinate require assholes.</v>

1735
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a big percentage of us that are shitheads and we go to other</v>

1736
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:56.441
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

1737
00:49:56.441 --> 00:49:56.981
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it.</v>

1738
00:49:56.981 --> 00:49:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people that are American,</v>

1739
00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.090
<v Speaker 3>they're another countries act stupid,</v>

1740
00:50:01.091 --> 00:50:02.050
<v Speaker 3>but not so much anymore.</v>

1741
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:02.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1742
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 3>we'd go to other countries and now we have complained about how expensive</v>

1743
00:50:04.931 --> 00:50:05.351
<v Speaker 3>everything is.</v>

1744
00:50:05.351 --> 00:50:08.080
<v Speaker 3>We don't brag about how cheap it is because those days are.</v>

1745
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Those days are gone and of course you know,</v>

1746
00:50:10.001 --> 00:50:13.320
<v Speaker 3>back then all the products were made in America and we exported all those</v>

1747
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:13.631
<v Speaker 3>products.</v>

1748
00:50:13.631 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 3>I think that because we had cheap wait labor,</v>

1749
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 3>we had the highest wages in the world.</v>

1750
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on there.</v>

1751
00:50:18.581 --> 00:50:23.581
<v Speaker 3>I certainly think that creativity and innovation help or it helps it to be free,</v>

1752
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:28.000
<v Speaker 3>to have freedom certainly is gonna enhance the ability to create and</v>

1753
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.900
<v Speaker 4>an ability to put out new inventions and new things that are gonna make life</v>

1754
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:33.510
<v Speaker 4>easier.</v>

1755
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1756
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:33.930
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1757
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1758
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.061
<v Speaker 4>no question about it,</v>

1759
00:50:35.061 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that that has to be all completely unregulated by the government</v>

1760
00:50:38.991 --> 00:50:42.170
<v Speaker 4>makes me very nervous and I know the word that I don't trust the government</v>

1761
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:42.411
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

1762
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:42.661
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1763
00:50:42.661 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the word the government,</v>

1764
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.480
<v Speaker 4>but I think an unregulated industry that can pollute like bp has is incredibly</v>

1765
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:51.480
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

1766
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.160
<v Speaker 3>But you've got regulation though.</v>

1767
00:50:53.161 --> 00:50:54.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean the government takes it down.</v>

1768
00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:55.141
<v Speaker 3>Like here,</v>

1769
00:50:55.141 --> 00:50:57.090
<v Speaker 3>if you want to cut hair,</v>

1770
00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:58.980
<v Speaker 3>do you want to be a barber?</v>

1771
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.570
<v Speaker 3>You got to get licensed.</v>

1772
00:51:00.571 --> 00:51:01.800
<v Speaker 3>You got to take exams,</v>

1773
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:02.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1774
00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean why does it.</v>

1775
00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 3>You don't want some crazy ass hole.</v>

1776
00:51:04.941 --> 00:51:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't know how to use a pair of scissors.</v>

1777
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.770
<v Speaker 3>We'll just open up a shop.</v>

1778
00:51:07.771 --> 00:51:09.600
<v Speaker 3>And you're the first guy who works on pretty much.</v>

1779
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:09.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1780
00:51:09.781 --> 00:51:09.901
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1781
00:51:09.901 --> 00:51:10.920
<v Speaker 3>So you get a bad haircut.</v>

1782
00:51:10.921 --> 00:51:11.641
<v Speaker 3>You don't go back.</v>

1783
00:51:11.641 --> 00:51:11.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1784
00:51:11.851 --> 00:51:13.290
<v Speaker 3>what's the worst thing that can happen?</v>

1785
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1786
00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:14.401
<v Speaker 3>In haircuts.</v>

1787
00:51:14.401 --> 00:51:15.234
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1788
00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.680
<v Speaker 3>How about fixing a car?</v>

1789
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:17.520
<v Speaker 3>But even book,</v>

1790
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.440
<v Speaker 3>even the car tire could come,</v>

1791
00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.480
<v Speaker 3>fly down the highway and die.</v>

1792
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:21.961
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1793
00:51:21.961 --> 00:51:22.450
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1794
00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:23.790
<v Speaker 3>so if there's a mechanic,</v>

1795
00:51:23.791 --> 00:51:24.061
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1796
00:51:24.061 --> 00:51:24.250
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1797
00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:25.590
<v Speaker 3>that get it has a,</v>

1798
00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1799
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:28.440
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't know how to put out a tire and you know,</v>

1800
00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:30.300
<v Speaker 3>a couple of people have an accident.</v>

1801
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.200
<v Speaker 3>He's out of business.</v>

1802
00:51:31.201 --> 00:51:32.850
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to go out of business.</v>

1803
00:51:32.851 --> 00:51:33.870
<v Speaker 3>People are going to die.</v>

1804
00:51:33.871 --> 00:51:36.510
<v Speaker 3>I think money is not as important as making sure this guy,</v>

1805
00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 3>no set of fixed cars,</v>

1806
00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.880
<v Speaker 3>but if family say,</v>

1807
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:41.100
<v Speaker 3>but if you invest money in a business,</v>

1808
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.610
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1809
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:44.250
<v Speaker 3>the most important thing you have is your reputation,</v>

1810
00:51:44.251 --> 00:51:44.911
<v Speaker 3>your brand,</v>

1811
00:51:44.911 --> 00:51:45.571
<v Speaker 3>your customer,</v>

1812
00:51:45.571 --> 00:51:46.404
<v Speaker 3>goodwill.</v>

1813
00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:49.080
<v Speaker 3>The business owner is going to make sure,</v>

1814
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:49.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1815
00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.060
<v Speaker 3>That he's got,</v>

1816
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:51.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1817
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:52.950
<v Speaker 3>mechanics that know what they're doing.</v>

1818
00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 3>He's going to not,</v>

1819
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:56.690
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take a chance and maybe they'll go out of business,</v>

1820
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.690
<v Speaker 3>but they might fuck up.</v>

1821
00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:57.990
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1822
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.340
<v Speaker 3>people aren't rational.</v>

1823
00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:02.400
<v Speaker 3>You're here idea that everyone who starts a business is going to know exactly</v>

1824
00:52:02.401 --> 00:52:03.640
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing because they have to.</v>

1825
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.550
<v Speaker 3>The ones that don't posture,</v>

1826
00:52:05.551 --> 00:52:07.600
<v Speaker 3>the ones that don't know what they're doing will go under,</v>

1827
00:52:07.601 --> 00:52:07.871
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1828
00:52:07.871 --> 00:52:08.341
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't.</v>

1829
00:52:08.341 --> 00:52:09.180
<v Speaker 3>You stop that.</v>

1830
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:11.040
<v Speaker 3>If it's a case of something being safe.</v>

1831
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:11.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1832
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.610
<v Speaker 3>someone's a doctor.</v>

1833
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Dentist.</v>

1834
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.740
<v Speaker 3>If someone's working on your health or working on your car or working on your</v>

1835
00:52:16.741 --> 00:52:17.041
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

1836
00:52:17.041 --> 00:52:17.251
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1837
00:52:17.251 --> 00:52:17.791
<v Speaker 3>they put your,</v>

1838
00:52:17.791 --> 00:52:20.850
<v Speaker 3>your pipes in incorrectly and your fucking house catches on fire.</v>

1839
00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.190
<v Speaker 3>You don't think you should have to be certified by at least,</v>

1840
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.060
<v Speaker 3>but hold on a second,</v>

1841
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:28.860
<v Speaker 3>but at least some sort of a standard in their industry or industry agrees upon</v>

1842
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:29.340
<v Speaker 3>standard.</v>

1843
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have to come from government doesn't make what they used to have</v>

1844
00:52:32.401 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 3>before government is it.</v>

1845
00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.730
<v Speaker 3>You would join a society,</v>

1846
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:35.971
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1847
00:52:35.971 --> 00:52:39.690
<v Speaker 3>A voluntary society which would give you like a good housekeeping seal of</v>

1848
00:52:39.691 --> 00:52:40.410
<v Speaker 3>approval.</v>

1849
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:40.891
<v Speaker 3>So you would say,</v>

1850
00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:41.101
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1851
00:52:41.101 --> 00:52:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mechanic and look,</v>

1852
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:47.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm a member of this organization and they come and they periodically examined</v>

1853
00:52:47.191 --> 00:52:49.800
<v Speaker 3>my business and they certified that I have all the safety.</v>

1854
00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean the free market will find solutions so that companies can say,</v>

1855
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:54.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1856
00:52:54.361 --> 00:52:54.661
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1857
00:52:54.661 --> 00:52:57.540
<v Speaker 3>like a better business bureau kind of seal of approval,</v>

1858
00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.310
<v Speaker 3>but when the government does it,</v>

1859
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:03.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it's not nearly as effective and I think it does create a moral hazard.</v>

1860
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:03.541
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

1861
00:53:03.541 --> 00:53:04.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1862
00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of corruption there.</v>

1863
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.330
<v Speaker 3>But even look,</v>

1864
00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:07.163
<v Speaker 3>it goes to everything.</v>

1865
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.480
<v Speaker 3>You need licenses to arrange flowers.</v>

1866
00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.240
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to get a job as a floral arranger,</v>

1867
00:53:12.241 --> 00:53:13.320
<v Speaker 3>you got to get a government licensed.</v>

1868
00:53:13.321 --> 00:53:13.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1869
00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.540
<v Speaker 3>so what if the guy doesn't arrange the flowers,</v>

1870
00:53:15.541 --> 00:53:15.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1871
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:16.800
<v Speaker 3>What's the big deal?</v>

1872
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:17.970
<v Speaker 3>But you know what happens?</v>

1873
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:18.860
<v Speaker 3>You have who,</v>

1874
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.860
<v Speaker 3>who suffers from all these occupational licensing laws and regulations.</v>

1875
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:23.940
<v Speaker 3>It's poor people.</v>

1876
00:53:23.941 --> 00:53:26.580
<v Speaker 3>It's inner city people that never can get jobs.</v>

1877
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:28.140
<v Speaker 3>They never can improve their skills.</v>

1878
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 3>They're permanently locked out of a profession or an occupation.</v>

1879
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:31.561
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

1880
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:34.800
<v Speaker 3>the consumer has fewer choices and has to pay higher prices.</v>

1881
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.180
<v Speaker 3>We all suffer from this.</v>

1882
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:36.361
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1883
00:53:36.361 --> 00:53:36.871
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>

1884
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:37.141
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1885
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:37.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1886
00:53:37.321 --> 00:53:39.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe a few people that wouldn't have got bad haircuts,</v>

1887
00:53:39.931 --> 00:53:40.380
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

1888
00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1889
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.551
<v Speaker 3>well let that happen.</v>

1890
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have that than everybody have to pay more for a haircut.</v>

1891
00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 3>The haircut example,</v>

1892
00:53:45.241 --> 00:53:45.541
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1893
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:45.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you.</v>

1894
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:46.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1895
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a frivolous thing.</v>

1896
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not that big a deal.</v>

1897
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:53.400
<v Speaker 3>The real issue I have is with things like construction or things like electrical</v>

1898
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:58.550
<v Speaker 3>things that involves safety and I think you and I are both not in favor of the</v>

1899
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 3>government regulating these things because I don't necessarily think they're</v>

1900
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:02.550
<v Speaker 3>going to do the best job.</v>

1901
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.320
<v Speaker 3>The industry itself should regulate.</v>

1902
00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:08.370
<v Speaker 3>If the industry could prove some sort of a very efficient,</v>

1903
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:11.040
<v Speaker 3>very competent and very educated regulatory system,</v>

1904
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:12.690
<v Speaker 3>then the government should just step down and say,</v>

1905
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1906
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:14.010
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to do this anymore.</v>

1907
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Speaker 3>We're going to let the hair cutters,</v>

1908
00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:16.800
<v Speaker 3>association of America,</v>

1909
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.470
<v Speaker 3>most people,</v>

1910
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.930
<v Speaker 3>most of these organizations started out in the private sector.</v>

1911
00:54:21.931 --> 00:54:25.410
<v Speaker 3>But the reason they got government involved is they wanted protection from</v>

1912
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:26.244
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

1913
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:28.440
<v Speaker 3>And so whenever you like and why and what and how so?</v>

1914
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:28.741
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1915
00:54:28.741 --> 00:54:29.350
<v Speaker 3>because let's,</v>

1916
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.420
<v Speaker 3>let's assume that we're,</v>

1917
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1918
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.520
<v Speaker 3>we know we were basket weavers,</v>

1919
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:32.821
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1920
00:54:32.821 --> 00:54:33.121
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

1921
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:33.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1922
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:34.990
<v Speaker 3>we all weave baskets and be the best way.</v>

1923
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Let's say we have a society where you say,</v>

1924
00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:37.291
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1925
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:37.561
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1926
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:38.670
<v Speaker 3>if you pay your dues,</v>

1927
00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:39.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1928
00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:39.350
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

1929
00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 3>we'll give you a certified member of basket weavers of America.</v>

1930
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:44.640
<v Speaker 3>And if anybody sees that sign on your shop,</v>

1931
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.890
<v Speaker 3>they know that you really know how to weave a basket.</v>

1932
00:54:46.891 --> 00:54:48.690
<v Speaker 3>You went through our vigorous training program.</v>

1933
00:54:48.691 --> 00:54:49.501
<v Speaker 3>You took a course,</v>

1934
00:54:49.501 --> 00:54:50.334
<v Speaker 3>you know we have,</v>

1935
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:51.263
<v Speaker 3>but now,</v>

1936
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 3>but once you have this group,</v>

1937
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:53.070
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1938
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1939
00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:58.380
<v Speaker 3>If we could simply require everybody to be a member of our group and make it</v>

1940
00:54:58.381 --> 00:55:00.330
<v Speaker 3>illegal for them to sell any baskets.</v>

1941
00:55:00.331 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 3>If they're not a member of our group,</v>

1942
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.070
<v Speaker 3>then we can charge a lot more money if we can because we won't have competition.</v>

1943
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:06.350
<v Speaker 3>So they go to Washington,</v>

1944
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:06.631
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1945
00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:06.781
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1946
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:10.620
<v Speaker 3>why don't you require anybody who weaves baskets to join our organization and</v>

1947
00:55:10.621 --> 00:55:11.580
<v Speaker 3>forced them into it?</v>

1948
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1949
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.961
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm in.</v>

1950
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:13.950
<v Speaker 3>In the brokerage industry.</v>

1951
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm only allowed to be a stockbroker because I'm a member of Finra right now.</v>

1952
00:55:18.301 --> 00:55:19.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a member of Finra.</v>

1953
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather just be a stockbroker and not be a member of member,</v>

1954
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.453
<v Speaker 3>but that's it.</v>

1955
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

1956
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:25.560
<v Speaker 3>It's the government made it illegal,</v>

1957
00:55:25.561 --> 00:55:27.120
<v Speaker 3>so in order for me to be a stockbroker,</v>

1958
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I have to be in this organization and I have to spend millions of dollars a year</v>

1959
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 3>to comply with all these ridiculous rules and regulations,</v>

1960
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:37.590
<v Speaker 3>but the net effect of it is that there's a lot fewer brokers than there would be</v>

1961
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.410
<v Speaker 3>if we didn't have finra and I.</v>

1962
00:55:39.411 --> 00:55:41.700
<v Speaker 3>I know now if Finra was voluntary,</v>

1963
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 3>if it was private,</v>

1964
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 3>then I could just say,</v>

1965
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:43.861
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1966
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm a broker and I'm not a member of Finra.</v>

1967
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.680
<v Speaker 3>So caveat emptor,</v>

1968
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1969
00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:47.581
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1970
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:47.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1971
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.820
<v Speaker 3>I would much rather have that than have to be,</v>

1972
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:51.570
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1973
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:52.920
<v Speaker 3>all these organizations,</v>

1974
00:55:52.921 --> 00:55:53.880
<v Speaker 3>they always want it.</v>

1975
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.920
<v Speaker 3>They always want the government to,</v>

1976
00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1977
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:57.250
<v Speaker 3>prevent,</v>

1978
00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:57.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1979
00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 3>forced people to join so that they can charge more money and have less</v>

1980
00:56:00.781 --> 00:56:01.420
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

1981
00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.140
<v Speaker 3>But I think also the idea is that the government is going to be the one that's</v>

1982
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:04.681
<v Speaker 3>impartial.</v>

1983
00:56:04.681 --> 00:56:07.860
<v Speaker 3>The government's going to be standing outside looking at this industry having no</v>

1984
00:56:07.861 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 3>vested interest in you profiting over you or you over you and say,</v>

1985
00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:11.791
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1986
00:56:11.791 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 3>these are the rules and this is how we can make this fair and ethical.</v>

1987
00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:14.921
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1988
00:56:14.921 --> 00:56:15.571
<v Speaker 3>the governments,</v>

1989
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:18.870
<v Speaker 3>the idea that most people have about the but they do have a vested interest</v>

1990
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:20.370
<v Speaker 3>because now this organization,</v>

1991
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1992
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>that got the government to force everybody to join it.</v>

1993
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Now they're going to give donations to the government to continue to help</v>

1994
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:29.020
<v Speaker 3>support those.</v>

1995
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Stopped for you and I when we became a week.</v>

1996
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:32.400
<v Speaker 3>But we said that that's not legal anymore,</v>

1997
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 3>but we haven't stopped that,</v>

1998
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 3>so it's still going on.</v>

1999
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:35.050
<v Speaker 3>So that did,</v>

2000
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:35.530
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2001
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem,</v>

2002
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:39.670
<v Speaker 3>if we step in and stop that no one is allowed to give any more money to the</v>

2003
00:56:39.671 --> 00:56:40.031
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

2004
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 3>No campaigns,</v>

2005
00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:41.440
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>

2006
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:41.550
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2007
00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 3>that's actually not even going to stop it.</v>

2008
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:44.430
<v Speaker 3>What has to stop it is you have to,</v>

2009
00:56:44.431 --> 00:56:47.530
<v Speaker 3>you have to take away the government's power to do all these things because</v>

2010
00:56:47.531 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 3>they're going to,</v>

2011
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 3>as long as I have the power,</v>

2012
00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:49.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2013
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:50.051
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be.</v>

2014
00:56:50.051 --> 00:56:52.810
<v Speaker 3>People will get around those requirements and there'll be ways to do it.</v>

2015
00:56:52.811 --> 00:56:55.210
<v Speaker 3>You have to limit the power of government,</v>

2016
00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:58.220
<v Speaker 3>which is what we did so successfully for our first hundred,</v>

2017
00:56:58.221 --> 00:57:00.070
<v Speaker 3>150 years as a republic.</v>

2018
00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 3>We were very successful at limiting the power of government.</v>

2019
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.330
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we achieved so much.</v>

2020
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.201
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>

2021
00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2022
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.940
<v Speaker 3>we lost that advantage.</v>

2023
00:57:06.941 --> 00:57:07.431
<v Speaker 3>The government,</v>

2024
00:57:07.431 --> 00:57:07.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2025
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.310
<v Speaker 3>was chained up by the constitution.</v>

2026
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2027
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.430
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2028
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:12.010
<v Speaker 3>it freed itself from those chains.</v>

2029
00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:12.350
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2030
00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:14.220
<v Speaker 3>and so now it does whatever it wants and,</v>

2031
00:57:14.221 --> 00:57:17.680
<v Speaker 3>and we're suffering as a result because we've lost a lot of freedom and by</v>

2032
00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 3>losing the freedom we lost all the opportunity and economic growth that went</v>

2033
00:57:20.921 --> 00:57:21.640
<v Speaker 3>along with it.</v>

2034
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:21.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2035
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:26.350
<v Speaker 3>but someone has got to keep these corrupt evil fucks that have billions of</v>

2036
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 3>dollars from running a muck at this situation.</v>

2037
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.631
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2038
00:57:28.631 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 3>who's going to run right now?</v>

2039
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to run a muck?</v>

2040
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to run a muck?</v>

2041
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2042
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 3>How did this financial crisis happened?</v>

2043
00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.380
<v Speaker 3>And it happened from people running them out,</v>

2044
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't have run a muck at the government wasn't.</v>

2045
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:40.040
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't guaranteeing their,</v>

2046
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 3>their businesses,</v>

2047
00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:41.531
<v Speaker 3>their loans,</v>

2048
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:42.341
<v Speaker 3>their portfolios,</v>

2049
00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:46.030
<v Speaker 3>but you think that they acted knowing that they could fail and if they did fail,</v>

2050
00:57:46.031 --> 00:57:46.980
<v Speaker 3>the government bailed them out.</v>

2051
00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:47.580
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2052
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Or you reacted in Hubris thinking they wouldn't fail.</v>

2053
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:52.300
<v Speaker 3>They're going to pull this off.</v>

2054
00:57:52.301 --> 00:57:53.230
<v Speaker 3>They've been pulling this off.</v>

2055
00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Do you think all these people knew that the edge was coming and they just kept</v>

2056
00:57:55.841 --> 00:57:56.310
<v Speaker 3>running?</v>

2057
00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2058
00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:58.870
<v Speaker 3>government with some didn't.</v>

2059
00:57:58.871 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 3>It was a little bit of both,</v>

2060
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:01.660
<v Speaker 3>but if the government wasn't there,</v>

2061
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:02.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2062
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Saying I'll catch you if you fall,</v>

2063
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.560
<v Speaker 3>then you're not going to get up on that high wire.</v>

2064
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.560
<v Speaker 3>I you're going to be a lot more cautious with what you're doing or you agree</v>

2065
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:09.880
<v Speaker 3>that you would be more cautious,</v>

2066
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:13.270
<v Speaker 3>but I think that people are assholes and I think that people who have a lot of</v>

2067
00:58:13.271 --> 00:58:16.270
<v Speaker 3>money and a lot of Hubris and a lot of ego and it probably on pills,</v>

2068
00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do some wild,</v>

2069
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:18.100
<v Speaker 3>wacky shit.</v>

2070
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:18.933
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2071
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:20.830
<v Speaker 3>they have and they always will in a free market.</v>

2072
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 3>They won't.</v>

2073
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.930
<v Speaker 3>You know it getting rich and a free market,</v>

2074
00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:24.040
<v Speaker 3>but they will.</v>

2075
00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:24.550
<v Speaker 3>They will.</v>

2076
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:26.500
<v Speaker 3>They may fail in doing so,</v>

2077
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.470
<v Speaker 3>but they certainly will know when.</v>

2078
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.030
<v Speaker 3>See people when,</v>

2079
00:58:30.031 --> 00:58:30.330
<v Speaker 3>when you.</v>

2080
00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:31.420
<v Speaker 3>When you earn a lot of money,</v>

2081
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:33.100
<v Speaker 3>the most important thing is not to lose it,</v>

2082
00:58:33.101 --> 00:58:33.281
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2083
00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:37.060
<v Speaker 3>You want to protect what you were in and so people are going to act to preserve</v>

2084
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:37.631
<v Speaker 3>what they have.</v>

2085
00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:39.370
<v Speaker 3>There's fear and greed that that are,</v>

2086
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.690
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

2087
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:40.451
<v Speaker 3>that are that are there.</v>

2088
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:40.691
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2089
00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:41.560
<v Speaker 3>people want more,</v>

2090
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to give up what they have.</v>

2091
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:44.710
<v Speaker 3>The government comes in and says,</v>

2092
00:58:44.711 --> 00:58:45.544
<v Speaker 3>don't worry,</v>

2093
00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:47.200
<v Speaker 3>be a take all the risks you want.</v>

2094
00:58:47.201 --> 00:58:48.011
<v Speaker 3>We got you covered.</v>

2095
00:58:48.011 --> 00:58:48.844
<v Speaker 3>We've got your back.</v>

2096
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:51.880
<v Speaker 3>That's what was going on in Wall Street with all this cheap money.</v>

2097
00:58:51.881 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 3>They make it a lot less expensive for everybody to lever up and go out and</v>

2098
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 3>borrow and speculate and you know all this wealth that is being generated for a</v>

2099
00:58:58.931 --> 00:59:00.100
<v Speaker 3>small number of people,</v>

2100
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:00.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2101
00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:05.170
<v Speaker 3>this is not the way it used to be when you would get rich by helping everybody,</v>

2102
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:09.610
<v Speaker 3>by providing people with a goods and services and creating jobs.</v>

2103
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:11.680
<v Speaker 3>That's how people got rich 100 years ago.</v>

2104
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:13.120
<v Speaker 3>That's not how they're getting rich now.</v>

2105
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.470
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

2106
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:15.010
<v Speaker 3>they're getting rich off the government.</v>

2107
00:59:15.011 --> 00:59:15.940
<v Speaker 3>They're getting rich by.</v>

2108
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.230
<v Speaker 3>They get the money first.</v>

2109
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:17.951
<v Speaker 3>They get the money,</v>

2110
00:59:17.951 --> 00:59:18.371
<v Speaker 3>cheapest.</v>

2111
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:21.320
<v Speaker 3>They get to borrow money at practically nothing and speculate with it.</v>

2112
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 3>They create no</v>

2113
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.840
<v Speaker 2>real wealth for society,</v>

2114
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:24.471
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2115
00:59:24.471 --> 00:59:26.300
<v Speaker 2>but they're getting rich on their own.</v>

2116
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.590
<v Speaker 2>But all of this is phony.</v>

2117
00:59:27.591 --> 00:59:29.750
<v Speaker 2>All this is going to end in complete disaster,</v>

2118
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 2>but it is not the market's fault.</v>

2119
00:59:32.091 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 2>It is not capitalism that has done this.</v>

2120
00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.181
<v Speaker 2>It's the government.</v>

2121
00:59:35.181 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 2>It's the central bank,</v>

2122
00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:38.830
<v Speaker 4>I think we both agree on government intervention,</v>

2123
00:59:38.831 --> 00:59:42.700
<v Speaker 4>but I think where we're disagreeing is on human nature and I think that people</v>

2124
00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:44.320
<v Speaker 4>are naturally greedy.</v>

2125
00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:44.710
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2126
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:45.240
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2127
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:49.090
<v Speaker 4>they're naturally likely to do something illegal and try to get away with it.</v>

2128
00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Not sure they are.</v>

2129
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.240
<v Speaker 4>If they can profit off of it or you know,</v>

2130
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:55.240
<v Speaker 4>mom neither by why do you believe somebody else's?</v>

2131
00:59:55.241 --> 00:59:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Because there's murderers in the world,</v>

2132
00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:57.311
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>

2133
00:59:57.311 --> 00:59:59.770
<v Speaker 4>Look at the crime reports on the internet or read the news.</v>

2134
00:59:59.771 --> 01:00:00.160
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2135
01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.970
<v Speaker 4>there's a million things that go on everyday that will prove to you that people</v>

2136
01:00:03.971 --> 01:00:05.440
<v Speaker 4>don't abide by the law when they,</v>

2137
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.780
<v Speaker 4>when they don't have to do or they think they can get away with it.</v>

2138
01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:08.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:00:08.011 --> 01:00:08.221
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2140
01:00:08.221 --> 01:00:09.660
<v Speaker 2>there are bad people in the world.</v>

2141
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.640
<v Speaker 2>I know they're,</v>

2142
01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I think they're in the minority.</v>

2143
01:00:11.881 --> 01:00:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I think the majority of people are good.</v>

2144
01:00:13.621 --> 01:00:14.850
<v Speaker 2>I think there are bad people.</v>

2145
01:00:14.851 --> 01:00:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

2146
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.740
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are in government,</v>

2147
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:17.251
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2148
01:00:17.251 --> 01:00:17.481
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

2149
01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:19.980
<v Speaker 2>and they have a lot of power there and bad people gravitate to govern.</v>

2150
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.250
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think that that keeps people from doing some of these bad things?</v>

2151
01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Knowing that they're going to get in big trouble front.</v>

2152
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:25.391
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2153
01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2154
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:25.761
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2155
01:00:25.761 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean most people,</v>

2156
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2157
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't steal because it's wrong.</v>

2158
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2159
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't not steal because I might go to jail.</v>

2160
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2161
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I just morally know that I'm not going to take somebody that doesn't belong to</v>

2162
01:00:36.051 --> 01:00:36.560
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2163
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2164
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:38.950
<v Speaker 2>And most of us are the same way that it's not,</v>

2165
01:00:38.951 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 2>it's not that we're,</v>

2166
01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:39.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2167
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:42.860
<v Speaker 2>and most people and most people who get rich are good,</v>

2168
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:43.850
<v Speaker 2>hardworking,</v>

2169
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:45.050
<v Speaker 2>honorable people.</v>

2170
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Most the majority.</v>

2171
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Is it even one out of 100 to 100,</v>

2172
01:00:49.721 --> 01:00:51.700
<v Speaker 4>which is one percent of people that are scumbags.</v>

2173
01:00:51.701 --> 01:00:51.911
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2174
01:00:51.911 --> 01:00:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Fuck up and do a lot when you're dealing with 300 million.</v>

2175
01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:54.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2176
01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.720
<v Speaker 2>but didn't get a good free market economy.</v>

2177
01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:58.670
<v Speaker 2>The scumbags are only gonna go so far,</v>

2178
01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2179
01:00:59.120 --> 01:00:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2180
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.890
<v Speaker 2>They're going to ultimately get,</v>

2181
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.760
<v Speaker 2>get weeded out.</v>

2182
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2183
01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.410
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna.</v>

2184
01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:02.551
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

2185
01:01:02.551 --> 01:01:02.800
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2186
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2187
01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:03.380
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2188
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't build a great business,</v>

2189
01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:06.380
<v Speaker 2>lasting business.</v>

2190
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:07.161
<v Speaker 2>Being a scumbag.</v>

2191
01:01:07.161 --> 01:01:07.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2192
01:01:07.341 --> 01:01:09.020
<v Speaker 2>you maybe you can succeed in the short run,</v>

2193
01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:12.170
<v Speaker 2>but eventually you're going to go away and that's the free market is going to</v>

2194
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:14.510
<v Speaker 2>purge itself of the bad operators and yes,</v>

2195
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.950
<v Speaker 2>some people are going to get ripped off.</v>

2196
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the nature of it.</v>

2197
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:17.953
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2198
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.771
<v Speaker 2>in a free market,</v>

2199
01:01:18.771 --> 01:01:22.190
<v Speaker 2>fewer people will get ripped off then in the type of government market we have</v>

2200
01:01:22.191 --> 01:01:22.371
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2201
01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 2>But I am not afraid.</v>

2202
01:01:23.631 --> 01:01:28.631
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about a businessman and entrepreneur because I know that all of</v>

2203
01:01:28.881 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 2>my associations with him,</v>

2204
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 2>absent government or voluntary,</v>

2205
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:35.840
<v Speaker 2>all he can do is try to offer me a good deal and I can turn it down.</v>

2206
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.670
<v Speaker 2>But when they go to government and say,</v>

2207
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 2>we're going to force you to buy this product,</v>

2208
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:39.771
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2209
01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>here were the obamacare.</v>

2210
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:40.821
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2211
01:01:40.821 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>you've got to buy insurance.</v>

2212
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:42.441
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2213
01:01:42.441 --> 01:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2214
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:43.090
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

2215
01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:43.341
<v Speaker 2>what have,</v>

2216
01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:43.851
<v Speaker 2>I don't need it.</v>

2217
01:01:43.851 --> 01:01:44.684
<v Speaker 2>What if I don't like it?</v>

2218
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:44.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2219
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:45.061
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2220
01:01:45.061 --> 01:01:47.930
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to make a decision because in a free market,</v>

2221
01:01:47.931 --> 01:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>if I buy something,</v>

2222
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:50.390
<v Speaker 2>it's because I thought it was good for me.</v>

2223
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:50.601
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2224
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:51.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm wrong,</v>

2225
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:54.950
<v Speaker 2>but at least I came to a decision that I thought something was in my interest,</v>

2226
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.710
<v Speaker 2>but now the government says you have to do something whether you think it's in</v>

2227
01:01:57.711 --> 01:01:58.544
<v Speaker 2>your interest or not,</v>

2228
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.660
<v Speaker 2>and that's and that's power and that's something that people should be afraid</v>

2229
01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:02.751
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

2230
01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>When the government can force you to do things that you don't want to do,</v>

2231
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.870
<v Speaker 2>corporations can't do that unless they get the government involved to help them</v>

2232
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:10.940
<v Speaker 2>and that's not the fault of the corporation.</v>

2233
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:13.610
<v Speaker 2>It's the fault of the government or the people that allow the government to have</v>

2234
01:02:13.611 --> 01:02:14.444
<v Speaker 2>that power.</v>

2235
01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.330
<v Speaker 4>I feel you.</v>

2236
01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.490
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying and I agree with you.</v>

2237
01:02:17.491 --> 01:02:18.061
<v Speaker 4>For the most part.</v>

2238
01:02:18.061 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 4>I think the only problem that</v>

2239
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm having with what you're saying is the idea that the government would</v>

2240
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>regulate environmental protection or that rather industry or business would</v>

2241
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>regulate environmental protection.</v>

2242
01:02:29.161 --> 01:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they would.</v>

2243
01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that if,</v>

2244
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>if they were in a situation where they're making billions of dollars and they</v>

2245
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>had some sort of a catastrophic oil spill or chemical spill or some sort of a</v>

2246
01:02:36.901 --> 01:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>disaster,</v>

2247
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>they would cover it up just like it's been proven that's been done with</v>

2248
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:40.741
<v Speaker 1>fracking.</v>

2249
01:02:40.741 --> 01:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a real issue with fracking right now in America and if you've</v>

2250
01:02:45.091 --> 01:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>watched any of the documentaries or read any of the articles that are written</v>

2251
01:02:48.061 --> 01:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>about people's areas,</v>

2252
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.213
<v Speaker 1>farms,</v>

2253
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>water supplies,</v>

2254
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>destroyed the oxygen level in the atmosphere changes.</v>

2255
01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.091
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2256
01:02:55.091 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2257
01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:56.243
<v Speaker 3>I level,</v>

2258
01:02:56.270 --> 01:03:01.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm involved pretty heavy with fracking myself because we have a lot of wells</v>

2259
01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.080
<v Speaker 3>that we own.</v>

2260
01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.670
<v Speaker 3>I own myself and my own on behalf of my favorite cracker.</v>

2261
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.411
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

2262
01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:05.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2263
01:03:05.621 --> 01:03:06.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm in North Dakota.</v>

2264
01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm up in the bock and I started there about three years ago.</v>

2265
01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.760
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>

2266
01:03:10.761 --> 01:03:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2267
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's tremendous wealth that's been created up in,</v>

2268
01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:14.380
<v Speaker 3>up in,</v>

2269
01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.820
<v Speaker 3>up in that region in North Dakota.</v>

2270
01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:18.310
<v Speaker 3>And it's one of the bright spots of the US economy.</v>

2271
01:03:18.311 --> 01:03:18.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2272
01:03:18.491 --> 01:03:20.710
<v Speaker 3>fortunately the energy industry,</v>

2273
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2274
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:21.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2275
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:21.810
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2276
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2277
01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:24.010
<v Speaker 3>domestically is doing something,</v>

2278
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2279
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a pocket of strength and,</v>

2280
01:03:25.781 --> 01:03:25.960
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2281
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.111
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2282
01:03:26.111 --> 01:03:26.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2283
01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:26.951
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2284
01:03:26.951 --> 01:03:28.750
<v Speaker 3>we're an island of strength and see a weakness.</v>

2285
01:03:28.751 --> 01:03:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean most of what's going on is bad,</v>

2286
01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:33.490
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of the things that we got going and we're going to need to</v>

2287
01:03:33.491 --> 01:03:34.111
<v Speaker 3>develop our,</v>

2288
01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:34.491
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2289
01:03:34.491 --> 01:03:34.860
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2290
01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:37.240
<v Speaker 3>our energy resources even more effectively,</v>

2291
01:03:37.241 --> 01:03:40.300
<v Speaker 3>especially once the dollar cloud are the actual invite since,</v>

2292
01:03:40.301 --> 01:03:40.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2293
01:03:40.661 --> 01:03:40.901
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

2294
01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:41.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2295
01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 3>while I'm doing the actual environmental,</v>

2296
01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:46.300
<v Speaker 3>you're already environmental problems with fracking.</v>

2297
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:46.811
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2298
01:03:46.811 --> 01:03:46.961
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2299
01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:48.340
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more,</v>

2300
01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.640
<v Speaker 3>I think you have a lot of people on the left who,</v>

2301
01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:51.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2302
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:54.190
<v Speaker 3>they're really socialist but they don't want to come out and,</v>

2303
01:03:54.191 --> 01:03:54.610
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>

2304
01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:54.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2305
01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.960
<v Speaker 3>they were communists or whatever,</v>

2306
01:03:55.961 --> 01:03:56.530
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2307
01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:57.363
<v Speaker 3>so they want to,</v>

2308
01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2309
01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:58.540
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>

2310
01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.000
<v Speaker 3>everything in environmentalist language.</v>

2311
01:04:01.001 --> 01:04:01.121
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2312
01:04:01.121 --> 01:04:03.910
<v Speaker 3>what they really want to take away private property.</v>

2313
01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2314
01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:04.820
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2315
01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.160
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to come out and say it.</v>

2316
01:04:06.161 --> 01:04:08.140
<v Speaker 3>So they close themselves.</v>

2317
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Did everybody that doesn't want frackers to ruin the</v>

2318
01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:13.523
<v Speaker 3>drinking water?</v>

2319
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:14.950
<v Speaker 3>They certainly have in many places.</v>

2320
01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:15.671
<v Speaker 3>They're not ruining.</v>

2321
01:04:15.671 --> 01:04:16.504
<v Speaker 3>They have water.</v>

2322
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Why have these companies that have been fracking come in and shipped fresh water</v>

2323
01:04:19.951 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 1>to these people that have lost their drinking water where they can fucking light</v>

2324
01:04:23.371 --> 01:04:24.204
<v Speaker 1>it on fire now?</v>

2325
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.710
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

2326
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:25.261
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

2327
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not happening in any circumstance whatsoever.</v>

2328
01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>

2329
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.381
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2330
01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I will go out and you laugh about that.</v>

2331
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:31.590
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a goal to North Dakota,</v>

2332
01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:32.440
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2333
01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:32.741
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2334
01:04:32.741 --> 01:04:33.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2335
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:34.510
<v Speaker 3>do I have to go to North Dakota to get an answer?</v>

2336
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.920
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2337
01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.080
<v Speaker 3>but it's not this horrible thing.</v>

2338
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:37.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2339
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I think safe places,</v>

2340
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I think they overplay the what's going on and you know,</v>

2341
01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:42.931
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2342
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:43.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2343
01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:43.923
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>

2344
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:45.560
<v Speaker 3>They've been doing this with,</v>

2345
01:04:45.561 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2346
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:46.471
<v Speaker 3>with various,</v>

2347
01:04:46.471 --> 01:04:46.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2348
01:04:46.651 --> 01:04:47.880
<v Speaker 3>we got to save this species,</v>

2349
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:49.700
<v Speaker 3>this subspecies subspecies.</v>

2350
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:50.371
<v Speaker 3>We can't go here.</v>

2351
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:51.140
<v Speaker 3>We can't get.</v>

2352
01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.470
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of it did,</v>

2353
01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:55.140
<v Speaker 3>did an environmental disaster happened in the Gulf?</v>

2354
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:59.070
<v Speaker 3>Did millions and millions of gallons of oil gets built?</v>

2355
01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.300
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2356
01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:00.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying please did it.</v>

2357
01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2358
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:01.381
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2359
01:05:01.381 --> 01:05:04.800
<v Speaker 3>There was an environmental concern that that could take place almost anywhere in</v>

2360
01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:08.610
<v Speaker 3>the country because the systems that we have in place are not foolproof and this</v>

2361
01:05:08.611 --> 01:05:09.450
<v Speaker 3>is a new thing</v>

2362
01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:10.530
<v Speaker 1>that is not just,</v>

2363
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>not just is it a new thing,</v>

2364
01:05:13.231 --> 01:05:14.670
<v Speaker 1>but most people are not even aware of it.</v>

2365
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>They start getting aware of it.</v>

2366
01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>They start seeing things like people's water being able</v>

2367
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.000
<v Speaker 3>to be lit on fire.</v>

2368
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:21.910
<v Speaker 3>They start talking to people that have been forced out of their farms because</v>

2369
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:23.680
<v Speaker 3>they're groundwater's polluted.</v>

2370
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:24.523
<v Speaker 3>They're there,</v>

2371
01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 3>they can smell it in the air.</v>

2372
01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.410
<v Speaker 3>This is some sick shit and now they're ruining parts of the country.</v>

2373
01:05:29.411 --> 01:05:30.180
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

2374
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 3>the accident with bp and it wasn't just bp was there's other companies involved.</v>

2375
01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2376
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:38.890
<v Speaker 3>but the accident there happened with all the regulation that we have.</v>

2377
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.031
<v Speaker 3>But it did happen.</v>

2378
01:05:40.031 --> 01:05:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2379
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:40.481
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2380
01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 3>But we have regulation but the regulation preventatively,</v>

2381
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:45.080
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying more regularly,</v>

2382
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying more regulation,</v>

2383
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying should you do it at all just because the fact that you can do it and</v>

2384
01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:53.500
<v Speaker 3>maybe make wealth out of it if you are causing massive environmental disaster.</v>

2385
01:05:53.501 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2386
01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Should that be okay just because you're making money,</v>

2387
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:56.831
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

2388
01:05:56.831 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 3>if you want to have a tradeoff,</v>

2389
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.800
<v Speaker 3>if you want to say no,</v>

2390
01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:01.210
<v Speaker 3>drilling offshore,</v>

2391
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:01.960
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2392
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.880
<v Speaker 3>because something bad might happen.</v>

2393
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.800
<v Speaker 3>If you want to eliminate all that water,</v>

2394
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 3>that oil,</v>

2395
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.020
<v Speaker 3>then be prepared to pay a lot more for gasoline and a lot and a lot more for</v>

2396
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:13.690
<v Speaker 3>products that we consume that not only have gasoline,</v>

2397
01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:14.650
<v Speaker 3>but by the way right now,</v>

2398
01:06:14.651 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 3>and of course this is going to change,</v>

2399
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.940
<v Speaker 3>but most of the stuff that we consume in America isn't made here.</v>

2400
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.590
<v Speaker 3>It has to get shipped here on a,</v>

2401
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:20.861
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>

2402
01:06:20.861 --> 01:06:24.450
<v Speaker 3>on a big ship that comes across from China and it takes a lot of gasoline and</v>

2403
01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:25.150
<v Speaker 3>get it over here.</v>

2404
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:27.490
<v Speaker 3>So every single thing that we buy in America,</v>

2405
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2406
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.630
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of energy that goes into getting it here.</v>

2407
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:35.320
<v Speaker 3>And so if we're going to make energy much more expensive because we want to make</v>

2408
01:06:35.321 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 3>sure that we can have another environmental accident,</v>

2409
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:38.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2410
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Then we better be prepared to accept the lower standard of living that,</v>

2411
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:43.120
<v Speaker 3>that comes with that.</v>

2412
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.410
<v Speaker 3>But you see what you're doing here,</v>

2413
01:06:44.411 --> 01:06:45.340
<v Speaker 3>this problematic.</v>

2414
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:50.430
<v Speaker 3>You are automatically leaning towards the profit side over the environment side.</v>

2415
01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.440
<v Speaker 3>This is what makes people really nervous about people that are really into the</v>

2416
01:06:53.441 --> 01:06:54.190
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

2417
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:57.550
<v Speaker 3>What your concern is is not about the earth itself,</v>

2418
01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.680
<v Speaker 3>the very place where your children are grow up.</v>

2419
01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 3>That's not what you're concerned about.</v>

2420
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:03.610
<v Speaker 3>You're not concerned about that you were concerned about the devastation to the</v>

2421
01:07:03.611 --> 01:07:07.600
<v Speaker 3>market by regulating these businesses and forcing them to raise the price of</v>

2422
01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:10.900
<v Speaker 3>gasoline and everyone's going to suffer because we didn't let everybody take</v>

2423
01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:14.870
<v Speaker 3>this fucking wacky chance and pump fluid into the ground and pull out oil or</v>

2424
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 3>what I'm not saying,</v>

2425
01:07:16.361 --> 01:07:18.430
<v Speaker 3>do you see that argument is a very callous because.</v>

2426
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:23.670
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not saying that a business shouldn't be held responsible for the damages</v>

2427
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.580
<v Speaker 3>it causes.</v>

2428
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:28.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying just responsible fracking is fucking dangerous.</v>

2429
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.170
<v Speaker 3>Everybody that's fracking isn't,</v>

2430
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.381
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2431
01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:33.110
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

2432
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:33.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2433
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:35.650
<v Speaker 3>causing pollution for somebody else.</v>

2434
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.840
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of people are well then,</v>

2435
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:41.110
<v Speaker 3>but then that can be addressed on a case by case basis.</v>

2436
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Mean those places are poisoned,</v>

2437
01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:43.870
<v Speaker 3>poison those.</v>

2438
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Once those farms are ruined,</v>

2439
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:50.080
<v Speaker 3>there's family farms that people can't have cattle graze in anymore because the</v>

2440
01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:50.980
<v Speaker 3>cattle are getting sick.</v>

2441
01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.530
<v Speaker 3>They can't grow food there.</v>

2442
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:52.871
<v Speaker 3>The pull,</v>

2443
01:07:52.871 --> 01:07:53.471
<v Speaker 3>the big problem,</v>

2444
01:07:53.471 --> 01:07:56.410
<v Speaker 3>the biggest problems of farmers have is the government and it's like farm</v>

2445
01:07:56.411 --> 01:07:56.801
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>

2446
01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:57.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not fracking.</v>

2447
01:07:57.970 --> 01:07:58.990
<v Speaker 3>If you want to find out what the,</v>

2448
01:07:59.160 --> 01:07:59.993
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2449
01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:01.240
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with our farms.</v>

2450
01:08:01.241 --> 01:08:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean go get rid of the Department of Agriculture will get rid of all</v>

2451
01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.500
<v Speaker 3>necessarily government programs.</v>

2452
01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Government allowed people the frackers to use.</v>

2453
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:10.360
<v Speaker 3>They'll all that water and fracking.</v>

2454
01:08:10.361 --> 01:08:12.480
<v Speaker 3>I kick him millions of gallons of water.</v>

2455
01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Small farmers come on my radio show and they tell me about all the problems</v>

2456
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.380
<v Speaker 2>that the government is created for them,</v>

2457
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:18.940
<v Speaker 2>putting them out of business and,</v>

2458
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:19.150
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2459
01:08:19.150 --> 01:08:19.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2460
01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>and the things that they're doing to regulate them out of existence.</v>

2461
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Government is evil,</v>

2462
01:08:23.431 --> 01:08:25.320
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't have anything to do with fracking.</v>

2463
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:26.580
<v Speaker 1>The dangers,</v>

2464
01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.470
<v Speaker 1>the dangers of fracking are very real.</v>

2465
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2466
01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I think the dangers are way overblown and I think that maybe you've,</v>

2467
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2468
01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you've read some things and you've got,</v>

2469
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:34.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2470
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you've seen some of this stuff and I think it is distorting the reality of</v>

2471
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:39.223
<v Speaker 2>fracking.</v>

2472
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>It is not,</v>

2473
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2474
01:08:41.271 --> 01:08:41.721
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

2475
01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 2>as dangerous as some people would like everybody to believe.</v>

2476
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2477
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.553
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2478
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>more significant to me than the RTU.</v>

2479
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>If there's an environmental disaster,</v>

2480
01:08:50.421 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big concern to me.</v>

2481
01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's as big as.</v>

2482
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:53.860
<v Speaker 2>So why,</v>

2483
01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.131
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

2484
01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:56.110
<v Speaker 2>why would it be more of a concern for you?</v>

2485
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:56.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2486
01:08:56.411 --> 01:08:56.531
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2487
01:08:56.531 --> 01:08:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2488
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.350
<v Speaker 1>because I'm,</v>

2489
01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not invested,</v>

2490
01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't have invested interest in profit.</v>

2491
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You've already said that you profited off of fracking,</v>

2492
01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.410
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

2493
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:06.300
<v Speaker 2>But I would tell you this,</v>

2494
01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>if we were not producing all that energy that we're producing now out of North</v>

2495
01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Dakota,</v>

2496
01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:10.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2497
01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:12.730
<v Speaker 2>prices would be much already.</v>

2498
01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2499
01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:13.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2500
01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:13.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2501
01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I'm not saying to sky,</v>

2502
01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.380
<v Speaker 2>the sky's going to fall anyway because we got,</v>

2503
01:09:16.381 --> 01:09:18.450
<v Speaker 2>we got bigger problems than fracking,</v>

2504
01:09:18.451 --> 01:09:19.000
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2505
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.770
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we have been able to generate more energy,</v>

2506
01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2507
01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:25.020
<v Speaker 2>that's something that we've done.</v>

2508
01:09:25.021 --> 01:09:27.180
<v Speaker 2>That's been a net positive that's been helping us.</v>

2509
01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.320
<v Speaker 2>If we didn't have that,</v>

2510
01:09:28.321 --> 01:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>things would be a lot worse.</v>

2511
01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:29.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2512
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:31.380
<v Speaker 2>if you think the economy is bad right now,</v>

2513
01:09:31.530 --> 01:09:35.130
<v Speaker 2>it would be a lot worse if we weren't generating that for that energy.</v>

2514
01:09:35.131 --> 01:09:37.740
<v Speaker 2>If instead we had to borrow money to buy that,</v>

2515
01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:38.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2516
01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:40.170
<v Speaker 2>from Saudi Arabia or wherever we're importing it,</v>

2517
01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:41.280
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>

2518
01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.390
<v Speaker 2>it would be even worse.</v>

2519
01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.531
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2520
01:09:43.531 --> 01:09:44.730
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong when people.</v>

2521
01:09:44.731 --> 01:09:47.460
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times people have a bad view of profits,</v>

2522
01:09:47.461 --> 01:09:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean prophets or some kind of evil bad thing.</v>

2523
01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:50.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2524
01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:50.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2525
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:51.860
<v Speaker 1>that's not what we're saying here.</v>

2526
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2527
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:56.600
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about is environmental concern over profits and the you have this</v>

2528
01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.560
<v Speaker 1>profits over environmental concern when you keep going,</v>

2529
01:09:59.670 --> 01:09:59.900
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2530
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a few little things might happen here and there,</v>

2531
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.560
<v Speaker 1>but look at how much money we're gonna save.</v>

2532
01:10:03.561 --> 01:10:04.340
<v Speaker 1>If we do this,</v>

2533
01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.720
<v Speaker 1>look at how much money is looking,</v>

2534
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.720
<v Speaker 1>how much wealth,</v>

2535
01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:06.901
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2536
01:10:06.901 --> 01:10:09.660
<v Speaker 2>if you look around the world and you look at which countries have the most</v>

2537
01:10:09.661 --> 01:10:10.410
<v Speaker 2>pollution,</v>

2538
01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:13.650
<v Speaker 2>generally it's the countries that had the most government and the countries that</v>

2539
01:10:13.651 --> 01:10:14.850
<v Speaker 2>have less pollution,</v>

2540
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.020
<v Speaker 2>will have less government.</v>

2541
01:10:16.021 --> 01:10:16.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2542
01:10:16.231 --> 01:10:16.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2543
01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:16.811
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2544
01:10:16.811 --> 01:10:17.170
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2545
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:21.570
<v Speaker 2>a clean environment is a valuable asset that the market will preserve.</v>

2546
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Am I saying that there should be no.</v>

2547
01:10:23.311 --> 01:10:24.144
<v Speaker 2>Regulation</v>

2548
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:26.700
<v Speaker 1>is ruined.</v>

2549
01:10:26.701 --> 01:10:27.534
<v Speaker 1>It's ruined.</v>

2550
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.300
<v Speaker 1>You're extracting money out of an area by.</v>

2551
01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2552
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 2>If you look at that area is ruined and polluted.</v>

2553
01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:36.980
<v Speaker 2>It's where you can look at some of the areas of Africa where,</v>

2554
01:10:36.981 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2555
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.970
<v Speaker 2>where a lot of private money has come in and tried to create,</v>

2556
01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2557
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:45.500
<v Speaker 2>a wildlife reserves where there's now instead of hunting elephants now for their</v>

2558
01:10:45.501 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 2>ivory,</v>

2559
01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:48.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people now they're spending money,</v>

2560
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:48.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2561
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:49.910
<v Speaker 2>preserving them because people,</v>

2562
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:50.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2563
01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.500
<v Speaker 2>they want to come in and take a safari there and they want to see them in there</v>

2564
01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:54.260
<v Speaker 2>and habitat.</v>

2565
01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:59.090
<v Speaker 2>So you have entrepreneurs seeing a profit in preserving an environment in a way</v>

2566
01:10:59.091 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 2>that they can profit from it.</v>

2567
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:01.730
<v Speaker 2>If there wasn't a way to profit from it,</v>

2568
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 2>people wouldn't be explaining the money to do that.</v>

2569
01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Actually a really good example because you know how they really profit off of</v>

2570
01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:07.401
<v Speaker 1>elephants.</v>

2571
01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:09.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the big ways allowing hunters to go over there.</v>

2572
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:12.980
<v Speaker 1>They have people spending money to kill these.</v>

2573
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the idea</v>

2574
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.900
<v Speaker 3>of preserving.</v>

2575
01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:14.961
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2576
01:11:14.961 --> 01:11:15.051
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2577
01:11:15.051 --> 01:11:15.141
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2578
01:11:15.141 --> 01:11:15.241
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2579
01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 3>The people that are trying to preserve them or trying to stop the poaching.</v>

2580
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Poaching.</v>

2581
01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:21.510
<v Speaker 3>We were talking to regulating hunting.</v>

2582
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:21.671
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2583
01:11:21.671 --> 01:11:21.841
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2584
01:11:21.841 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 3>they have regulated hunting expeditions for elephants.</v>

2585
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2586
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.750
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

2587
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:26.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2588
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.221
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2589
01:11:26.221 --> 01:11:26.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2590
01:11:26.521 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 3>I know there's some big game hunting and I'm sure that,</v>

2591
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2592
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.530
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that there's hunting there,</v>

2593
01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:30.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2594
01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2595
01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.430
<v Speaker 3>they're not hunting them to extinction.</v>

2596
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:36.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it costs to shoot an elephant hunter probably.</v>

2597
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're going to have the head mount that had taken back and was</v>

2598
01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.140
<v Speaker 3>just to pay to have.</v>

2599
01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a very expensive but they have to keep it alive.</v>

2600
01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.090
<v Speaker 3>But in order to be there to shoot it,</v>

2601
01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 3>it has to exist.</v>

2602
01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 3>You can't wipe out,</v>

2603
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:47.000
<v Speaker 3>you can't wipe out the,</v>

2604
01:11:47.001 --> 01:11:47.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2605
01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:47.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2606
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 3>the herd.</v>

2607
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 3>But could you imagine if that argument was used for people?</v>

2608
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Well then we have to keep the population healthy by hunting them.</v>

2609
01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.650
<v Speaker 3>We have to do it not to shoot a few people every now and then.</v>

2610
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.310
<v Speaker 3>That would be,</v>

2611
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.860
<v Speaker 3>that would be an,</v>

2612
01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:57.950
<v Speaker 3>it costs a million dollars.</v>

2613
01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:58.561
<v Speaker 3>You'd be on here.</v>

2614
01:11:58.561 --> 01:12:00.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a million dollars in profit is generated.</v>

2615
01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:01.050
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot a person,</v>

2616
01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.610
<v Speaker 3>that's how much gas would cost if you didn't shoot that would take one person,</v>

2617
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Speaker 3>you shoot them and they got everybody else healthy and well fed.</v>

2618
01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:10.320
<v Speaker 3>We had a hunger games type scenario where we had to kill a couple of people</v>

2619
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:10.711
<v Speaker 3>every year,</v>

2620
01:12:10.711 --> 01:12:11.910
<v Speaker 3>but everybody else live great.</v>

2621
01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that's got nothing to do with what I'm good at,</v>

2622
01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:18.540
<v Speaker 3>what my argument that you often offered left field,</v>

2623
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:20.580
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not even the left guy.</v>

2624
01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:21.041
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2625
01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:21.310
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2626
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:22.770
<v Speaker 3>the environment is not left.</v>

2627
01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.940
<v Speaker 3>It's not always left.</v>

2628
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:25.950
<v Speaker 3>It to the extent the earth itself,</v>

2629
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:27.280
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that you know,</v>

2630
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:32.420
<v Speaker 3>we need regulation for externalities that result from pollution.</v>

2631
01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:35.910
<v Speaker 3>It can be done at a more local level than having</v>

2632
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 3>the funding where South Dakota going to get the money to pursue a gigantic oil</v>

2633
01:12:42.481 --> 01:12:44.460
<v Speaker 3>company that's ruining its environment.</v>

2634
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.080
<v Speaker 3>There aren't,</v>

2635
01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.430
<v Speaker 3>well the northwest,</v>

2636
01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 3>North Dakota where all the fracking is,</v>

2637
01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:51.600
<v Speaker 3>but let's say South Dakota comes up with a new fracking or where do you think</v>

2638
01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:54.090
<v Speaker 3>the federal government gets the money from the North Dakotans.</v>

2639
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean the federal government doesn't have any money that's taken from us.</v>

2640
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:58.410
<v Speaker 3>So why send it to Washington?</v>

2641
01:12:58.411 --> 01:12:58.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2642
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 3>you're out here in California.</v>

2643
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Why does California have to send me to Washington and Beg for it back?</v>

2644
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean let California deal with its own problems and keep the money here,</v>

2645
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 3>but when you're thinking about all the income tax and deals with it,</v>

2646
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:10.790
<v Speaker 3>who's going to do with it?</v>

2647
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 3>If the government doesn't deal with it in South Dakota,</v>

2648
01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 3>doesn't deal with it.</v>

2649
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Who deals with the people who have to go up against the frackers and show up</v>

2650
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:16.711
<v Speaker 3>with torches?</v>

2651
01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:20.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a government in South Dakota that government's going to deal with,</v>

2652
01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.080
<v Speaker 3>but if you're going to let a government do it,</v>

2653
01:13:22.081 --> 01:13:23.550
<v Speaker 3>why does it have to be the federal government,</v>

2654
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Washington?</v>

2655
01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Why can't it be a local government so the government is okay with the federal</v>

2656
01:13:27.631 --> 01:13:28.171
<v Speaker 3>government's not.</v>

2657
01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:28.351
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2658
01:13:28.351 --> 01:13:31.050
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to regulating environmental protection,</v>

2659
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.340
<v Speaker 3>the closer you are to the the what you're regulating,</v>

2660
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 3>the more efficient it's going to be the least corrupt it's going to be.</v>

2661
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:39.450
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to regulate,</v>

2662
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:42.390
<v Speaker 3>you want to regulate as close to the activity as possible.</v>

2663
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.170
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to have it outsourced to Washington dc because it's going to cost</v>

2664
01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:47.970
<v Speaker 3>much more and it's going to be less effective,</v>

2665
01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:51.960
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people want Washington to pay for it because somehow they think it</v>

2666
01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:52.920
<v Speaker 3>doesn't cost anything,</v>

2667
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.860
<v Speaker 3>but it actually costs more when Washington pays for it.</v>

2668
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Then when your local government pays for it,</v>

2669
01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 3>but most of the stuff is going to be in the courts.</v>

2670
01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:05.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that a business should be able to dump pollution onto your.</v>

2671
01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:06.990
<v Speaker 3>You know your property.</v>

2672
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:09.000
<v Speaker 3>You can sue them for that.</v>

2673
01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:09.661
<v Speaker 3>That's a tort.</v>

2674
01:14:09.661 --> 01:14:10.530
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>

2675
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:11.910
<v Speaker 3>They have take care of it,</v>

2676
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.690
<v Speaker 2>have to make sure that they don't know,</v>

2677
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:16.740
<v Speaker 4>but that's sort of disingenuous because you know how incredibly difficult it is</v>

2678
01:14:16.741 --> 01:14:19.320
<v Speaker 4>for a farmer to sue a gigantic corporation.</v>

2679
01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.580
<v Speaker 4>They've ruined all their land.</v>

2680
01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.190
<v Speaker 4>The corporation has billions of dollars spent.</v>

2681
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2682
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:23.660
<v Speaker 4>they won't.</v>

2683
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.151
<v Speaker 4>The lawyer,</v>

2684
01:14:24.151 --> 01:14:24.990
<v Speaker 4>the lawyers,</v>

2685
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:28.310
<v Speaker 2>the lawyers will take the case on a contingency.</v>

2686
01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.960
<v Speaker 2>If you've got a big plaintiff,</v>

2687
01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:31.273
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

2688
01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.480
<v Speaker 2>People don't have a profit.</v>

2689
01:14:32.481 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 2>The problem that we have in this country with Laura's,</v>

2690
01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.870
<v Speaker 2>it's too easy to sue people.</v>

2691
01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2692
01:14:36.201 --> 01:14:38.270
<v Speaker 2>there's so much lawsuits here because you know,</v>

2693
01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:38.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2694
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:40.340
<v Speaker 2>if you sue somebody,</v>

2695
01:14:40.341 --> 01:14:43.940
<v Speaker 2>you basically can extort money out of the cost so much to defendant agree with</v>

2696
01:14:43.941 --> 01:14:45.380
<v Speaker 2>you that there are frivolous lawsuits.</v>

2697
01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.490
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of them.</v>

2698
01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.610
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not that people can't sue if they've been wrong.</v>

2699
01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.800
<v Speaker 2>We have too many people suing who haven't been wrong,</v>

2700
01:14:51.801 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's because they're shaking down.</v>

2701
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:57.350
<v Speaker 4>But it's crazy to pretend that corporations would automatically give people</v>

2702
01:14:57.351 --> 01:14:58.490
<v Speaker 4>money if they were wrong,</v>

2703
01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:00.100
<v Speaker 4>that they would like,</v>

2704
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:02.660
<v Speaker 4>all someone has to do is get together a lawyer and sue them.</v>

2705
01:15:02.661 --> 01:15:03.261
<v Speaker 4>It'd be easy.</v>

2706
01:15:03.261 --> 01:15:04.370
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to be easy.</v>

2707
01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.870
<v Speaker 4>They're going to fight tooth and claw.</v>

2708
01:15:05.871 --> 01:15:07.760
<v Speaker 4>They're going to put it off as long as possible.</v>

2709
01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.230
<v Speaker 4>They're going to drag you through the mud.</v>

2710
01:15:09.231 --> 01:15:10.880
<v Speaker 4>They're going to drown you in legal fees.</v>

2711
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:11.750
<v Speaker 4>That's what they do.</v>

2712
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:12.800
<v Speaker 4>That's what they've done,</v>

2713
01:15:12.801 --> 01:15:17.590
<v Speaker 4>but they've got to pay those legal fees and pennies to them in comparison with</v>

2714
01:15:17.591 --> 01:15:18.201
<v Speaker 4>what they'd have to pay.</v>

2715
01:15:18.201 --> 01:15:20.210
<v Speaker 4>If they gave you millions dogs to the ruin your farm.</v>

2716
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2717
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.020
<v Speaker 4>they could save and legal fees by just dragging the case out and using quality</v>

2718
01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:26.300
<v Speaker 4>lawyers that really know how to manipulate the system.</v>

2719
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.640
<v Speaker 4>The idea that they would do it on their own because of the market,</v>

2720
01:15:28.641 --> 01:15:30.740
<v Speaker 4>is that I have a problem with that.</v>

2721
01:15:30.741 --> 01:15:32.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who should regulate it.</v>

2722
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:34.700
<v Speaker 4>You seem to think that the state government will be qualified.</v>

2723
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.790
<v Speaker 4>I see state governments as being woefully understaffed,</v>

2724
01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:39.080
<v Speaker 4>woefully underfunded.</v>

2725
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:41.060
<v Speaker 4>California is fucking bankrupt,</v>

2726
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:43.310
<v Speaker 4>so going after anybody</v>

2727
01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.840
<v Speaker 2>fornia is underfunded.</v>

2728
01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:46.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2729
01:15:46.021 --> 01:15:47.000
<v Speaker 2>look at all the revenue.</v>

2730
01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Look at all the income taxes that are paid in the state of California.</v>

2731
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Look at all the property taxes that are sent up there to Sacramento.</v>

2732
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2733
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:56.690
<v Speaker 2>California is the problems in California,</v>

2734
01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.380
<v Speaker 2>not because the government doesn't have enough money.</v>

2735
01:15:58.410 --> 01:15:59.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a government has too much money,</v>

2736
01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:01.860
<v Speaker 2>there's too much garbage is too much tax.</v>

2737
01:16:01.861 --> 01:16:03.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much regulation.</v>

2738
01:16:03.031 --> 01:16:05.790
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people who work for government because they have to be</v>

2739
01:16:05.791 --> 01:16:06.990
<v Speaker 2>supported by everybody else.</v>

2740
01:16:06.991 --> 01:16:07.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2741
01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:08.340
<v Speaker 2>they don't produce anything.</v>

2742
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:08.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2743
01:16:08.851 --> 01:16:10.050
<v Speaker 2>most people who work for government,</v>

2744
01:16:10.051 --> 01:16:11.430
<v Speaker 2>not only don't they produce anything,</v>

2745
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.770
<v Speaker 2>they get in the way of other people who would produce stuff,</v>

2746
01:16:13.771 --> 01:16:14.820
<v Speaker 2>but the government won't let them,</v>

2747
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:15.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2748
01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:18.660
<v Speaker 2>so we're all poor because we have to pay the salaries while these government</v>

2749
01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:19.140
<v Speaker 2>workers.</v>

2750
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:22.920
<v Speaker 2>And now if you actually look at how much government workers make relative to</v>

2751
01:16:22.921 --> 01:16:23.970
<v Speaker 2>private sector workers,</v>

2752
01:16:24.090 --> 01:16:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you throw in all the benefits.</v>

2753
01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:28.500
<v Speaker 2>The average person working for government is making twice as much as the average</v>

2754
01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:29.760
<v Speaker 2>person working in the private sector.</v>

2755
01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think all the wealthiest counties in America are all surrounding</v>

2756
01:16:33.481 --> 01:16:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Washington in DC?</v>

2757
01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2758
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:37.230
<v Speaker 2>they're sucking the life out of the rest of the country.</v>

2759
01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:38.151
<v Speaker 2>They're all,</v>

2760
01:16:38.151 --> 01:16:38.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2761
01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:41.550
<v Speaker 2>they're all getting rich lobbyists and politicians and the lawyers because</v>

2762
01:16:41.551 --> 01:16:42.750
<v Speaker 2>that's where all the power is.</v>

2763
01:16:42.751 --> 01:16:45.840
<v Speaker 2>That's where you know as well as Washington gets wealthier.</v>

2764
01:16:45.841 --> 01:16:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else gets poor because they don't make anything.</v>

2765
01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:49.410
<v Speaker 2>They don't produce anything.</v>

2766
01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.540
<v Speaker 2>They suck the blood out of everybody else.</v>

2767
01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:51.821
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2768
01:16:51.821 --> 01:16:53.050
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you on that.</v>

2769
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.741
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're.</v>

2770
01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:56.890
<v Speaker 4>We're in total agreement with where we seem to differ is on the idea of</v>

2771
01:16:56.891 --> 01:16:57.970
<v Speaker 4>environmental protection.</v>

2772
01:16:58.210 --> 01:16:59.230
<v Speaker 4>That's where we seem to.</v>

2773
01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:01.000
<v Speaker 4>You seem to think the market will take care of it.</v>

2774
01:17:01.001 --> 01:17:03.280
<v Speaker 4>I seem to think there's no fucking way the market would ever take care of it</v>

2775
01:17:03.281 --> 01:17:04.210
<v Speaker 4>unless you held a gun to their head.</v>

2776
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2777
01:17:05.711 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I would be okay if they left all the environmental rules place that I</v>

2778
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.080
<v Speaker 3>think shouldn't be there because this.</v>

2779
01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Which ones specifically are.</v>

2780
01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:13.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2781
01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.040
<v Speaker 3>do you know which ones do you have a problem with you don't think should be</v>

2782
01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:16.510
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

2783
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2784
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:20.840
<v Speaker 3>because I've heard you say that you think the EPA should have the environmental</v>

2785
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 3>code book in front of me.</v>

2786
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2787
01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure as a scientist or someone has a vested interest in fracking and it</v>

2788
01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:26.040
<v Speaker 3>must be a few concerns.</v>

2789
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2790
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:26.600
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2791
01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.790
<v Speaker 3>I just know that I think there's more laws on the books then,</v>

2792
01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.360
<v Speaker 3>then we should have certainly for the federal,</v>

2793
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:35.990
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying my point is even if I'd be fine leaving them all there because</v>

2794
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.940
<v Speaker 3>the problem that we are creating from excess environmental regulation right is</v>

2795
01:17:40.941 --> 01:17:43.160
<v Speaker 3>small compared to all the other problems.</v>

2796
01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:43.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2797
01:17:43.491 --> 01:17:44.960
<v Speaker 3>like you'd have to reset rubber regulation.</v>

2798
01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:46.580
<v Speaker 3>You always talking about what about drugs,</v>

2799
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.821
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2800
01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:47.121
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>

2801
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:47.954
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2802
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.850
<v Speaker 3>the government needs to uh,</v>

2803
01:17:49.851 --> 01:17:50.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2804
01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.470
<v Speaker 3>make sure that the drugs are safe.</v>

2805
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:51.891
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2806
01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:52.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2807
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that more people die because drugs that might've helped them are</v>

2808
01:17:55.941 --> 01:17:56.960
<v Speaker 3>kept off the market.</v>

2809
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Then people who die because a drug,</v>

2810
01:17:59.230 --> 01:17:59.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2811
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:00.100
<v Speaker 3>killed,</v>

2812
01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:00.620
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2813
01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:05.150
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reason that pharmaceuticals and drugs are so expensive in</v>

2814
01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 3>America is because it's so expensive to get something approved by the FDA.</v>

2815
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:13.280
<v Speaker 3>I think we had a much better and much healthier system before the FDA existed.</v>

2816
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.400
<v Speaker 3>And at least initially the FDA only made you prove that your drugs weren't</v>

2817
01:18:19.101 --> 01:18:19.934
<v Speaker 3>harmful.</v>

2818
01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:23.840
<v Speaker 3>Now you have to prove that they're not harmful and that they work right,</v>

2819
01:18:23.841 --> 01:18:25.100
<v Speaker 3>that they're efficacious.</v>

2820
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:26.870
<v Speaker 3>And that is extremely expensive.</v>

2821
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.823
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2822
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.700
<v Speaker 3>how would you,</v>

2823
01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:32.390
<v Speaker 3>how could you possibly sell something if you don't prove it's not dangerous?</v>

2824
01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:32.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2825
01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:33.130
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2826
01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:33.850
<v Speaker 3>let's that.</v>

2827
01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2828
01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:35.900
<v Speaker 3>because the doctor has to prescribe it.</v>

2829
01:18:35.901 --> 01:18:37.550
<v Speaker 3>So let's say I'm a medical doctor,</v>

2830
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:38.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2831
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.010
<v Speaker 3>And let's say I'm your doctor and you trust me.</v>

2832
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:41.870
<v Speaker 3>And I actually looked at a drug and I,</v>

2833
01:18:41.871 --> 01:18:44.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm convinced based on my examination,</v>

2834
01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:45.590
<v Speaker 3>I looked at their own studies.</v>

2835
01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm convinced it's a good drug and I think it's going to help you.</v>

2836
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.681
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2837
01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:48.970
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2838
01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:49.660
<v Speaker 3>but companies,</v>

2839
01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Studies all the time like who's this town?</v>

2840
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:52.281
<v Speaker 3>But why?</v>

2841
01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:55.010
<v Speaker 3>But why do you trust the FDA?</v>

2842
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Why do you trust them?</v>

2843
01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Do we need to trust someone?</v>

2844
01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:00.110
<v Speaker 3>But who would you rather trust?</v>

2845
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:03.770
<v Speaker 3>A doctor that you know or some bureaucrat you've never met who doesn't even know</v>

2846
01:19:03.771 --> 01:19:04.281
<v Speaker 3>who you are.</v>

2847
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:08.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't think my doctor has enough time to review all of the medication in the</v>

2848
01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:09.890
<v Speaker 3>world and all the studies that have been done,</v>

2849
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:14.660
<v Speaker 3>all the different classes have been done on different types of people.</v>

2850
01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2851
01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Let's forget about the harm part because that's a little bit.</v>

2852
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Maybe no,</v>

2853
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:21.650
<v Speaker 3>but advocacy is important,</v>

2854
01:19:21.651 --> 01:19:22.880
<v Speaker 3>but the hard part is probably the most.</v>

2855
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.620
<v Speaker 3>The efficacy as the more expensive.</v>

2856
01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2857
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:28.400
<v Speaker 3>But the advocacy should also be in place for things like cancer drugs and</v>

2858
01:19:28.401 --> 01:19:31.160
<v Speaker 3>dealing with things like devastate the immune system and may or may not be,</v>

2859
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:33.020
<v Speaker 3>but if it doesn't harm you,</v>

2860
01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:33.351
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2861
01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:34.184
<v Speaker 3>If they were profit,</v>

2862
01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:35.960
<v Speaker 3>if it can harm you,</v>

2863
01:19:35.961 --> 01:19:37.610
<v Speaker 3>then why can't the garment lit it on the market?</v>

2864
01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:38.780
<v Speaker 3>Why is it bullshit?</v>

2865
01:19:38.781 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Because I let people decide if it's bullshit.</v>

2866
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Let doctors decide.</v>

2867
01:19:42.051 --> 01:19:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Let patients decide what if there's a drug that would save me?</v>

2868
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2869
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:46.161
<v Speaker 3>but the government says,</v>

2870
01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:46.311
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2871
01:19:46.311 --> 01:19:47.330
<v Speaker 3>we want to keep testing it.</v>

2872
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:48.260
<v Speaker 3>We know it can't hurt you,</v>

2873
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:50.450
<v Speaker 3>but we want to just do another three years of testing.</v>

2874
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.871
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

2875
01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I die while I'm waiting for that drug to come.</v>

2876
01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:53.511
<v Speaker 3>Why can't I say,</v>

2877
01:19:53.511 --> 01:19:53.661
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2878
01:19:53.661 --> 01:19:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about the test,</v>

2879
01:19:54.801 --> 01:19:55.634
<v Speaker 3>I just want to drug,</v>

2880
01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.690
<v Speaker 3>and the governor says you can't.</v>

2881
01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:57.651
<v Speaker 3>You have to wait,</v>

2882
01:19:57.651 --> 01:20:00.920
<v Speaker 3>and I know that there are a lot of drugs that work that they don't let on the</v>

2883
01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:01.530
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

2884
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:01.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2885
01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:05.780
<v Speaker 3>and you're talking about what about what if I'm a big pharmaceutical company and</v>

2886
01:20:05.781 --> 01:20:09.510
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of money and some small company that comes out with a new pill</v>

2887
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 3>that's better than mine that has no side effects.</v>

2888
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it on the market.</v>

2889
01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.213
<v Speaker 3>What do I do?</v>

2890
01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:17.340
<v Speaker 3>I give money to do my politician in my hip pocket.</v>

2891
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Can I say you killed that drug because that's better than my drug.</v>

2892
01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:24.180
<v Speaker 3>It has less side effects and I don't want the competition so they keep it up,</v>

2893
01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:30.180
<v Speaker 3>but that really has nothing to do with the Fba solved in these conspiracies.</v>

2894
01:20:30.581 --> 01:20:30.791
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2895
01:20:30.791 --> 01:20:33.780
<v Speaker 3>but a politician are on these committees can squash these structures.</v>

2896
01:20:33.781 --> 01:20:34.770
<v Speaker 3>You don't think they do that.</v>

2897
01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:35.731
<v Speaker 3>You don't think you,</v>

2898
01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:35.891
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2899
01:20:35.891 --> 01:20:39.330
<v Speaker 3>You talked about how you're saying that how evil companies are when they.</v>

2900
01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.050
<v Speaker 3>When they get in bed,</v>

2901
01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:42.240
<v Speaker 3>you don't think some people are evil,</v>

2902
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.450
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2903
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:44.640
<v Speaker 3>but wouldn't some of those evil people you know,</v>

2904
01:20:44.641 --> 01:20:48.480
<v Speaker 3>try to have their friends in government squash and competitor's product?</v>

2905
01:20:48.481 --> 01:20:49.250
<v Speaker 3>It's very possible.</v>

2906
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:50.250
<v Speaker 3>That would be a crime.</v>

2907
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2908
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.301
<v Speaker 3>but they do it anyway.</v>

2909
01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:52.890
<v Speaker 3>You don't think politicians commit crimes,</v>

2910
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.750
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think that that would always take place?</v>

2911
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Those kinds of crimes?</v>

2912
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:55.950
<v Speaker 3>It takes.</v>

2913
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:56.221
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2914
01:20:56.221 --> 01:20:57.330
<v Speaker 3>because of the FDA,</v>

2915
01:20:57.331 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 3>so you think that if there was no regulatory commissions or no governing bodies</v>

2916
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.130
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to drugs,</v>

2917
01:21:02.131 --> 01:21:05.160
<v Speaker 3>that what we will do is just put it all on the market and we would all figure</v>

2918
01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:06.060
<v Speaker 3>out what was effective.</v>

2919
01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:08.670
<v Speaker 3>What was that look at a minimum.</v>

2920
01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:09.573
<v Speaker 3>Just say,</v>

2921
01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.130
<v Speaker 3>show that it doesn't hurt you,</v>

2922
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 3>but the minute you have to prove that it works,</v>

2923
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:15.300
<v Speaker 3>it's so easy for them to say,</v>

2924
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:15.511
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2925
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 3>the proof isn't conclusive.</v>

2926
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.760
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to prove you.</v>

2927
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:20.730
<v Speaker 3>It's too subjective because showing that it doesn't harm you.</v>

2928
01:21:20.731 --> 01:21:20.941
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2929
01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:22.050
<v Speaker 3>You can show that yes,</v>

2930
01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:23.070
<v Speaker 3>people took this drug,</v>

2931
01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:23.911
<v Speaker 3>may didn't get sick.</v>

2932
01:21:23.911 --> 01:21:24.601
<v Speaker 3>They didn't get harmed.</v>

2933
01:21:24.601 --> 01:21:28.380
<v Speaker 3>When there's drugs out there that actually do work and you're taking a drug that</v>

2934
01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:31.740
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work because the company lied and then attempts to years to find out</v>

2935
01:21:31.741 --> 01:21:32.610
<v Speaker 3>because it's a new product.</v>

2936
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Now you're assuming that your doctor's an idiot who prescribed it to you.</v>

2937
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 3>How would the doctor know if he prescribed phen phen or via all these different</v>

2938
01:21:39.241 --> 01:21:42.390
<v Speaker 3>drugs that have been pulled off the market medical school after they have been</v>

2939
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.700
<v Speaker 3>prescribed by people who went to medical school,</v>

2940
01:21:44.701 --> 01:21:47.880
<v Speaker 3>but if your doctor doesn't know who went to medical school and is a doctor,</v>

2941
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:51.240
<v Speaker 3>how does some bureaucrat and the FDA know who maybe didn't go to medical school</v>

2942
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.910
<v Speaker 3>and isn't competent enough to be a doctor?</v>

2943
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:56.820
<v Speaker 3>That's why these companies to show a tremendous amount of work showing the</v>

2944
01:21:56.821 --> 01:21:58.440
<v Speaker 3>efficacy and safety of their product.</v>

2945
01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:00.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what the FDA's job is.</v>

2946
01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:01.800
<v Speaker 3>It might not be that good at it.</v>

2947
01:22:01.801 --> 01:22:02.940
<v Speaker 3>It might cost a lot of money,</v>

2948
01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:07.710
<v Speaker 3>but the idea behind it is that you have these stringent ex extremely while.</v>

2949
01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:08.131
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

2950
01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:08.311
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2951
01:22:08.311 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 3>it takes you a lot more time to develop a drug and it takes a lot more money.</v>

2952
01:22:12.241 --> 01:22:12.991
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

2953
01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:13.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2954
01:22:13.171 --> 01:22:14.700
<v Speaker 3>two companies can only,</v>

2955
01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:14.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2956
01:22:14.911 --> 01:22:16.320
<v Speaker 3>you have some illnesses,</v>

2957
01:22:16.321 --> 01:22:18.990
<v Speaker 3>are some diseases that only affect a small number of people.</v>

2958
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:20.970
<v Speaker 3>And so because it's so expensive,</v>

2959
01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.080
<v Speaker 3>nobody can do it.</v>

2960
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:22.551
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

2961
01:22:22.551 --> 01:22:22.711
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2962
01:22:22.711 --> 01:22:24.120
<v Speaker 3>what did drug companies need to do?</v>

2963
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:26.670
<v Speaker 3>They come up with cures for baldness,</v>

2964
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.941
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2965
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:29.160
<v Speaker 3>because that they can mass market or they want to,</v>

2966
01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:29.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2967
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:30.840
<v Speaker 3>deal with erectile dysfunction,</v>

2968
01:22:30.841 --> 01:22:32.230
<v Speaker 3>but if you've got a,</v>

2969
01:22:32.231 --> 01:22:32.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2970
01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:34.380
<v Speaker 3>a disease that might kill you,</v>

2971
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:36.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's only affecting a small percent of the population.</v>

2972
01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Nobody can afford to spend the R and D on it.</v>

2973
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.930
<v Speaker 3>It's to the government makes it so expensive for companies to do this.</v>

2974
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Why not just get out of the way?</v>

2975
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Why not trust human beings and just don't assume that everybody else is an idiot</v>

2976
01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.500
<v Speaker 3>and let people make decisions for themselves.</v>

2977
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.851
<v Speaker 3>But I know,</v>

2978
01:22:50.851 --> 01:22:51.091
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2979
01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:51.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2980
01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I can smell the pot when I walk in here,</v>

2981
01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:53.281
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2982
01:22:53.281 --> 01:22:53.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2983
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:54.060
<v Speaker 3>how dare you,</v>

2984
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:54.271
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2985
01:22:54.271 --> 01:22:54.781
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

2986
01:22:54.781 --> 01:22:55.410
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2987
01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:55.831
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

2988
01:22:55.831 --> 01:22:57.630
<v Speaker 3>I want marijuana to be legalized,</v>

2989
01:22:57.690 --> 01:23:00.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean so because I trust people to make decisions.</v>

2990
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:02.010
<v Speaker 3>Well you don't want that because if people are going to get high,</v>

2991
01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:04.700
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna not let you frack what are they doing?</v>

2992
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 3>But I'm sure you agree with me,</v>

2993
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:07.631
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2994
01:23:07.631 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 3>that marijuana should be legal to smoke marijuana.</v>

2995
01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:12.130
<v Speaker 3>What certainly should be illegal to do?</v>

2996
01:23:12.131 --> 01:23:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Almost everything because everything that doesn't hurt people,</v>

2997
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.870
<v Speaker 3>but there's a difference between different.</v>

2998
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.033
<v Speaker 3>In what way?</v>

2999
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3000
01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:23.730
<v Speaker 3>you trust people to smoke pot responsibly or to drink or if you're smoking pot,</v>

3001
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:24.910
<v Speaker 3>you're not fracking.</v>

3002
01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:26.680
<v Speaker 3>They're two different things.</v>

3003
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:28.743
<v Speaker 3>Case scenario,</v>

3004
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 3>you might get you guys,</v>

3005
01:23:30.611 --> 01:23:30.860
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>

3006
01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:31.693
<v Speaker 3>because you're in the room,</v>

3007
01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:33.460
<v Speaker 3>you get might get some secondhand pot.</v>

3008
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 3>You know the difference between that and the environmental protection.</v>

3009
01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.550
<v Speaker 3>This is a huge difference between that and regular regulating environmental</v>

3010
01:23:39.551 --> 01:23:40.384
<v Speaker 3>disasters or.</v>

3011
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:41.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3012
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:44.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm just very consistent in,</v>

3013
01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:45.640
<v Speaker 3>in my view of the world,</v>

3014
01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:45.851
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3015
01:23:45.851 --> 01:23:46.301
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3016
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:49.360
<v Speaker 3>I believe that we're all about money and Martin.</v>

3017
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3018
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.720
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3019
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:51.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm about individual liberty and freedom.</v>

3020
01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:52.870
<v Speaker 3>You're also about the market.</v>

3021
01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:53.160
<v Speaker 3>None of that.</v>

3022
01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.770
<v Speaker 3>But that's because that's an expression of free people coming together in a free</v>

3023
01:23:56.771 --> 01:23:57.310
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

3024
01:23:57.310 --> 01:24:02.310
<v Speaker 3>It's individuals making exchanges that are mutually beneficial to both parties.</v>

3025
01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what freedom is all about.</v>

3026
01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:05.410
<v Speaker 3>The minute you involve government,</v>

3027
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.420
<v Speaker 3>the minute you have laws and regulations,</v>

3028
01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:10.690
<v Speaker 3>what that does is diminish our freedom because the government tells us what we</v>

3029
01:24:10.691 --> 01:24:11.440
<v Speaker 3>can't do,</v>

3030
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:11.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3031
01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.240
<v Speaker 3>If the government doesn't say we can,</v>

3032
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:13.961
<v Speaker 3>we can't do it,</v>

3033
01:24:13.961 --> 01:24:14.794
<v Speaker 3>then we can do it.</v>

3034
01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.980
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why government laws should all about,</v>

3035
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:21.910
<v Speaker 3>should be about protecting private property and life and liberty that,</v>

3036
01:24:21.911 --> 01:24:22.091
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3037
01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:25.150
<v Speaker 3>I can do whatever I want as long as I don't infringe upon you,</v>

3038
01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:25.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3039
01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

3040
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:26.291
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3041
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:26.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3042
01:24:26.531 --> 01:24:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I have a right to pursue my own happiness.</v>

3043
01:24:28.331 --> 01:24:29.920
<v Speaker 3>But I can't steal from you to do it.</v>

3044
01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:30.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

3045
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:31.750
<v Speaker 3>I can't injure you.</v>

3046
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:32.380
<v Speaker 3>And that's where,</v>

3047
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:32.621
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3048
01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:34.000
<v Speaker 3>I can't pollute your air.</v>

3049
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:35.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't pollute your water.</v>

3050
01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:36.280
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you there.</v>

3051
01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.750
<v Speaker 3>But as long as I'm not harming you,</v>

3052
01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:40.730
<v Speaker 3>if you're polluting my water.</v>

3053
01:24:40.731 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 3>And I said I can't do that.</v>

3054
01:24:42.101 --> 01:24:43.570
<v Speaker 3>But you do if you're fracking.</v>

3055
01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.330
<v Speaker 3>But your response to that</v>

3056
01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.010
<v Speaker 3>and you can get money.</v>

3057
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:48.521
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3058
01:24:48.521 --> 01:24:49.000
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

3059
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.630
<v Speaker 3>but do you see that that is not a,</v>

3060
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:51.850
<v Speaker 3>that's not an answer,</v>

3061
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.510
<v Speaker 3>but people don't want to get sued and mean people that are going to.</v>

3062
01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.840
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing something like fracking is generating billions of dollars and</v>

3063
01:24:58.841 --> 01:25:00.010
<v Speaker 3>you have to pay off a million here,</v>

3064
01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:02.140
<v Speaker 3>a million there because you fuck up some guys farm.</v>

3065
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.760
<v Speaker 3>That's not that big of a deal.</v>

3066
01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.500
<v Speaker 3>You know that's not the answer.</v>

3067
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:06.970
<v Speaker 3>The answer is not.</v>

3068
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 3>You can give them money or they can give you money because they ruin your life.</v>

3069
01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Well if you.</v>

3070
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.830
<v Speaker 3>If if you say,</v>

3071
01:25:11.831 --> 01:25:12.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3072
01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.820
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to have any fracking because a couple of farms got fucked up.</v>

3073
01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3074
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.200
<v Speaker 3>If that's the tradeoff,</v>

3075
01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:21.880
<v Speaker 3>if we value those forms that heavily with the whole nation is going to be worse</v>

3076
01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:25.120
<v Speaker 3>off including those far because I'm sure the farmers will get compensated.</v>

3077
01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:27.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know the particular situation and talk about,</v>

3078
01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:30.190
<v Speaker 3>but you know how many farmers are now multimillionaires because they lived in</v>

3079
01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 3>North Dakota and now they can frack instead of farm.</v>

3080
01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3081
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:37.480
<v Speaker 3>so many farmers are are making a fortune and you're trying to find the one that</v>

3082
01:25:37.481 --> 01:25:38.051
<v Speaker 3>that suffering,</v>

3083
01:25:38.051 --> 01:25:38.560
<v Speaker 3>but I can.</v>

3084
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I can show you many more.</v>

3085
01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.270
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot more.</v>

3086
01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:43.000
<v Speaker 3>The earth itself,</v>

3087
01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:43.511
<v Speaker 3>the earth,</v>

3088
01:25:43.511 --> 01:25:46.390
<v Speaker 3>forget about the what whether we frack or not,</v>

3089
01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:46.841
<v Speaker 3>frank,</v>

3090
01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:49.150
<v Speaker 3>that the wildlife or the fresh water,</v>

3091
01:25:49.151 --> 01:25:50.680
<v Speaker 3>all those things that poop poisoning,</v>

3092
01:25:50.681 --> 01:25:51.850
<v Speaker 3>that stuff is bad.</v>

3093
01:25:51.851 --> 01:25:53.640
<v Speaker 3>It's a big kind of chuckle about.</v>

3094
01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the earth is going to,</v>

3095
01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:56.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3096
01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.850
<v Speaker 3>obviously it can't care,</v>

3097
01:25:57.851 --> 01:26:00.220
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think we're going to destroy the planet.</v>

3098
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3099
01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.960
<v Speaker 3>whether or not we frack or not you,</v>

3100
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to,</v>

3101
01:26:04.161 --> 01:26:05.120
<v Speaker 3>in the scheme of things,</v>

3102
01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.440
<v Speaker 3>make a difference in our,</v>

3103
01:26:06.441 --> 01:26:08.690
<v Speaker 3>in our ecosystem or our environment can let me know.</v>

3104
01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 3>We'll make a difference in our standard of living.</v>

3105
01:26:10.581 --> 01:26:11.091
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

3106
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you a question.</v>

3107
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:12.141
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3108
01:26:12.141 --> 01:26:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's say let's pick a lake.</v>

3109
01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 3>Lake Michigan.</v>

3110
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3111
01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Say if you,</v>

3112
01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 3>if there was something that you could do that with guaranteed.</v>

3113
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Kill every fish in Lake Michigan forever,</v>

3114
01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:25.070
<v Speaker 3>but provide massive economic prosperity to everyone else in the country.</v>

3115
01:26:25.071 --> 01:26:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Lift us out of a recession.</v>

3116
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.160
<v Speaker 3>Would you be in favor of doing it?</v>

3117
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:28.671
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3118
01:26:28.671 --> 01:26:30.320
<v Speaker 3>what kind of prosperity you talking about?</v>

3119
01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 3>She's just like the fucking best.</v>

3120
01:26:32.571 --> 01:26:33.890
<v Speaker 3>It's ever been times 10.</v>

3121
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 3>So you're telling those kills off everything in Lake Michigan,</v>

3122
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.960
<v Speaker 3>everything near the lake is dead.</v>

3123
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:40.340
<v Speaker 3>You can't do no fishing,</v>

3124
01:26:40.341 --> 01:26:40.851
<v Speaker 3>no camp,</v>

3125
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:41.840
<v Speaker 3>but everybody else.</v>

3126
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're talking like roaring 20 [inaudible] like the jetsons.</v>

3127
01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:49.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about a future Utopian world and all we got to sacrifice as</v>

3128
01:26:49.091 --> 01:26:51.860
<v Speaker 3>deficient and forever just in that one leg.</v>

3129
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3130
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Forever probably.</v>

3131
01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like a decent chance of terrible trade off.</v>

3132
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Is that the only way we could do it?</v>

3133
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:57.231
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3134
01:26:57.231 --> 01:26:57.591
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

3135
01:26:57.591 --> 01:27:00.590
<v Speaker 3>but you're telling me you care more about those fish than all then your fellow</v>

3136
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 3>human being though I have more faith in my fellow human being.</v>

3137
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.690
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

3138
01:27:03.690 --> 01:27:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I think it's possible for us to achieve prosperity without killing the fun out</v>

3139
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:08.600
<v Speaker 3>of everything in Lake Michigan.</v>

3140
01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:11.300
<v Speaker 3>But that's not the trade off.</v>

3141
01:27:11.301 --> 01:27:11.751
<v Speaker 3>You told me,</v>

3142
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:13.730
<v Speaker 3>you said if we get it instantaneously,</v>

3143
01:27:13.731 --> 01:27:14.630
<v Speaker 3>create all this.</v>

3144
01:27:14.631 --> 01:27:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Well those fish trap.</v>

3145
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

3146
01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:18.201
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3147
01:27:18.201 --> 01:27:18.561
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

3148
01:27:18.561 --> 01:27:19.394
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

3149
01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 3>But I hold human life more valuable than than a fish.</v>

3150
01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:23.750
<v Speaker 3>We eat fish,</v>

3151
01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:24.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3152
01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't need human beings.</v>

3153
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:25.930
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

3154
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:28.190
<v Speaker 3>I probably eat fish more than anything else.</v>

3155
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Of course you understand though,</v>

3156
01:27:29.901 --> 01:27:33.500
<v Speaker 3>as an intelligent man that the ecosystem is incredibly complex and when you kill</v>

3157
01:27:33.501 --> 01:27:34.340
<v Speaker 3>off an entire lake,</v>

3158
01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:35.570
<v Speaker 3>you don't just affect the fish.</v>

3159
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.370
<v Speaker 3>You affect everything anywhere near.</v>

3160
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:37.851
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3161
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:38.930
<v Speaker 3>probably the whole contract,</v>

3162
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.530
<v Speaker 3>I doubt.</v>

3163
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:43.070
<v Speaker 3>I doubt the whole country would collapse if we didn't have that one collapsed.</v>

3164
01:27:43.071 --> 01:27:44.240
<v Speaker 3>We could adapt human beings.</v>

3165
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:45.103
<v Speaker 3>We're incredibly in.</v>

3166
01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:46.910
<v Speaker 3>You said we were going to have a massive,</v>

3167
01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:47.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3168
01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:50.120
<v Speaker 3>tenfold increase in our collective standard of living.</v>

3169
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.070
<v Speaker 3>We're going to pull those out.</v>

3170
01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:56.060
<v Speaker 3>But doesn't that mean by definition that we didn't have any downside from the</v>

3171
01:27:56.061 --> 01:27:57.560
<v Speaker 3>loss of one of the Great Lakes,</v>

3172
01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:00.770
<v Speaker 3>the Great Lakes itself,</v>

3173
01:28:00.771 --> 01:28:02.090
<v Speaker 3>the lake itself is fucked.</v>

3174
01:28:02.091 --> 01:28:03.310
<v Speaker 3>One of the great wonders of.</v>

3175
01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.720
<v Speaker 3>But you told us that everybody else would.</v>

3176
01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:08.270
<v Speaker 3>We would all be better off including the people who used to live by the lake</v>

3177
01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.300
<v Speaker 3>because just because some,</v>

3178
01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.830
<v Speaker 3>because everybody will be better off,</v>

3179
01:28:12.831 --> 01:28:14.660
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean that's the only way we could do it.</v>

3180
01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I think there could be a way to do that without doing that and that should be</v>

3181
01:28:18.651 --> 01:28:19.820
<v Speaker 3>pursued above all else.</v>

3182
01:28:19.821 --> 01:28:24.080
<v Speaker 3>The idea of figuring out a way to make this world better without polluting it.</v>

3183
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.231
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3184
01:28:24.231 --> 01:28:25.790
<v Speaker 3>we already know how to make the world better.</v>

3185
01:28:25.791 --> 01:28:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's freedom.</v>

3186
01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.130
<v Speaker 3>It's the freer we are,</v>

3187
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:31.070
<v Speaker 3>the more prosperous we're going to be and the enemy of freedom is government</v>

3188
01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

3189
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:32.960
<v Speaker 3>If you have a little bit of government,</v>

3190
01:28:32.961 --> 01:28:33.650
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing.</v>

3191
01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:36.770
<v Speaker 3>If you have just enough government to secure your freedoms and secure your</v>

3192
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:37.250
<v Speaker 3>liberties,</v>

3193
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:37.850
<v Speaker 3>liberties,</v>

3194
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:42.110
<v Speaker 3>then you have prosperity but too much government then it's an impediment to</v>

3195
01:28:42.111 --> 01:28:42.980
<v Speaker 3>liberty and prosperity.</v>

3196
01:28:42.981 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 3>But what we should really be talking about is what's going to happen.</v>

3197
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3198
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 3>and you've got all this propaganda out there by the government that is being</v>

3199
01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:50.151
<v Speaker 3>spread by,</v>

3200
01:28:50.151 --> 01:28:50.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3201
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:51.320
<v Speaker 3>by Wall Street as well.</v>

3202
01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.540
<v Speaker 3>That what Ben Bernanke,</v>

3203
01:28:52.541 --> 01:28:56.360
<v Speaker 3>he has done his work that we've got a real economic recovery that the jobs are</v>

3204
01:28:56.361 --> 01:28:57.194
<v Speaker 3>on their way,</v>

3205
01:28:57.230 --> 01:28:58.250
<v Speaker 3>that there no inflation.</v>

3206
01:28:58.251 --> 01:28:59.360
<v Speaker 3>All of this is wrong.</v>

3207
01:28:59.510 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 3>The economy is suffering because</v>

3208
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.030
<v Speaker 2>of what the government is doing.</v>

3209
01:29:03.031 --> 01:29:03.960
<v Speaker 2>There is no recovery.</v>

3210
01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I think we're in a depression.</v>

3211
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I think we've been at the depression the whole time.</v>

3212
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I think the numbers are manipulated.</v>

3213
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I think the government is understating the true rate of inflation,</v>

3214
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 2>so that means it looks like the economy is growing,</v>

3215
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually contracting.</v>

3216
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.640
<v Speaker 2>That's why the labor forces is imploding.</v>

3217
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.451
<v Speaker 2>That's why people,</v>

3218
01:29:18.451 --> 01:29:18.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3219
01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:19.560
<v Speaker 2>there was no good jobs.</v>

3220
01:29:19.561 --> 01:29:21.530
<v Speaker 2>That's why people have a following,</v>

3221
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:25.320
<v Speaker 2>a standard of living of people feel like it's a recession because it is.</v>

3222
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.530
<v Speaker 2>The government is trying to pretend that it's not because they point to the</v>

3223
01:29:28.531 --> 01:29:29.221
<v Speaker 2>stock market,</v>

3224
01:29:29.221 --> 01:29:31.470
<v Speaker 2>but so what stocks are going up doesn't mean anything.</v>

3225
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not even that earnings are going up.</v>

3226
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Corporations aren't really earning more money just to stock prices are going up</v>

3227
01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 2>and there are a lot of people would say,</v>

3228
01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:38.091
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3229
01:29:38.091 --> 01:29:40.440
<v Speaker 2>the corporations have a lot of cash.</v>

3230
01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:41.071
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3231
01:29:41.071 --> 01:29:41.904
<v Speaker 2>because they borrowed it,</v>

3232
01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.010
<v Speaker 2>they only have that cash because they issued debt.</v>

3233
01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Corporations now have more debt than ever before.</v>

3234
01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Even if you net out the cash,</v>

3235
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.580
<v Speaker 2>the government has more debt than ever before.</v>

3236
01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Americans have more debt.</v>

3237
01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Look at all the student loans we have.</v>

3238
01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Look at the mortgage debt,</v>

3239
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:56.183
<v Speaker 2>credit card debt,</v>

3240
01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:59.760
<v Speaker 2>we are leveraged up to the hilt and the only way we keep this thing going is</v>

3241
01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:02.460
<v Speaker 2>because we can borrow more because the people loaning us the money.</v>

3242
01:30:02.461 --> 01:30:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Don't realize that we're too broke to pay it back,</v>

3243
01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.890
<v Speaker 4>but he like apple that has billions of dollars.</v>

3244
01:30:07.330 --> 01:30:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3245
01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.540
<v Speaker 4>apple's a good company.</v>

3246
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.700
<v Speaker 4>How many companies are like that out?</v>

3247
01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.930
<v Speaker 2>They're not that many w.</v>

3248
01:30:10.931 --> 01:30:11.764
<v Speaker 2>We need more of them.</v>

3249
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:12.970
<v Speaker 4>How many do you think there are that,</v>

3250
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.610
<v Speaker 4>that have like a pile of cash?</v>

3251
01:30:14.611 --> 01:30:16.740
<v Speaker 4>Not that many because most of them have cash,</v>

3252
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:17.610
<v Speaker 4>but then they have debt.</v>

3253
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3254
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Apple just issued a bunch of debt.</v>

3255
01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:20.311
<v Speaker 2>By the way they,</v>

3256
01:30:20.311 --> 01:30:20.500
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3257
01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.960
<v Speaker 2>they issued longterm debt.</v>

3258
01:30:21.961 --> 01:30:23.820
<v Speaker 2>So some of that cash they borrowed.</v>

3259
01:30:24.170 --> 01:30:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3260
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:25.111
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3261
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:27.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the cash that apple has is offshore.</v>

3262
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.820
<v Speaker 2>They can't even bring it home because the tax rates would kill him.</v>

3263
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:30.631
<v Speaker 2>So the tax,</v>

3264
01:30:30.631 --> 01:30:32.010
<v Speaker 2>the money is out of the country.</v>

3265
01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.120
<v Speaker 4>When you see things like France imposing a 75 percent tax on the very wealthy,</v>

3266
01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.540
<v Speaker 4>does that freak you out?</v>

3267
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:39.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3268
01:30:39.001 --> 01:30:40.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not that much lower here.</v>

3269
01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:40.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3270
01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:41.790
<v Speaker 2>you're living in California,</v>

3271
01:30:41.791 --> 01:30:42.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3272
01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.140
<v Speaker 2>So the California income tax is 13 point three is the top,</v>

3273
01:30:46.170 --> 01:30:46.890
<v Speaker 2>but the federal,</v>

3274
01:30:46.890 --> 01:30:47.870
<v Speaker 2>what's the federal tax?</v>

3275
01:30:47.871 --> 01:30:48.960
<v Speaker 2>It's 39 point nine.</v>

3276
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:52.050
<v Speaker 2>So call it 40 plus you get another four percent for obamacare.</v>

3277
01:30:52.290 --> 01:30:54.300
<v Speaker 2>So you got 44 percent federal tax.</v>

3278
01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Obamacare,</v>

3279
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:55.541
<v Speaker 2>really four percent.</v>

3280
01:30:55.541 --> 01:30:56.430
<v Speaker 2>So four percent extra,</v>

3281
01:30:56.431 --> 01:30:57.091
<v Speaker 2>three point nine.</v>

3282
01:30:57.091 --> 01:30:57.660
<v Speaker 2>So called force.</v>

3283
01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:59.310
<v Speaker 2>You've got 44 percent federal tax,</v>

3284
01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:00.810
<v Speaker 2>then you add California,</v>

3285
01:31:00.811 --> 01:31:00.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3286
01:31:00.991 --> 01:31:01.800
<v Speaker 2>So 44,</v>

3287
01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:02.633
<v Speaker 2>57.</v>

3288
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:05.640
<v Speaker 2>So you're at like 57 percent marginal tax rate in California,</v>

3289
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:07.050
<v Speaker 2>but that's just your income tax.</v>

3290
01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:08.480
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

3291
01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:08.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3292
01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:10.410
<v Speaker 2>what about your property taxes,</v>

3293
01:31:10.411 --> 01:31:11.420
<v Speaker 2>your sales taxes,</v>

3294
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:12.600
<v Speaker 2>all the other taxes you pay.</v>

3295
01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean the government's taken 57 percent and then out of the 43 percent you got</v>

3296
01:31:16.381 --> 01:31:17.214
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

3297
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.521
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3298
01:31:17.521 --> 01:31:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at listening to one of your other podcasts and you were talking</v>

3299
01:31:21.131 --> 01:31:22.020
<v Speaker 2>and you said something like,</v>

3300
01:31:22.021 --> 01:31:22.261
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3301
01:31:22.261 --> 01:31:22.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3302
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the government to take half more than half or something like that.</v>

3303
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.113
<v Speaker 2>Why half?</v>

3304
01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Why do you know a medieval serf?</v>

3305
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:31.410
<v Speaker 2>And this is futile system of serfdom,</v>

3306
01:31:31.411 --> 01:31:33.390
<v Speaker 2>which was considered very repressive.</v>

3307
01:31:33.391 --> 01:31:33.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3308
01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:34.470
<v Speaker 2>in the Middle Ages,</v>

3309
01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:36.240
<v Speaker 2>if you were a serf,</v>

3310
01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:40.590
<v Speaker 2>you had to give the Lord 25 percent of what you produced 20,</v>

3311
01:31:40.591 --> 01:31:44.490
<v Speaker 2>so you were in the 25 percent tax bracket and you got to keep seventy five cents</v>

3312
01:31:44.491 --> 01:31:47.070
<v Speaker 2>on the dollar and that was considered exploitation.</v>

3313
01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:49.170
<v Speaker 2>What I would give to be,</v>

3314
01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I would love to be able to be as free as a surf.</v>

3315
01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:54.780
<v Speaker 2>If the government just treated me like a lord treated the surf,</v>

3316
01:31:55.050 --> 01:31:55.390
<v Speaker 2>it'd be.</v>

3317
01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:56.223
<v Speaker 2>That'd be awesome.</v>

3318
01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:56.461
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

3319
01:31:56.461 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 2>they have to cut my taxes in half to get my tax bracket down to just 25 percent</v>

3320
01:32:00.491 --> 01:32:01.510
<v Speaker 2>so I could be a surf.</v>

3321
01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 2>But at one point in America,</v>

3322
01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.990
<v Speaker 2>the government took nothing,</v>

3323
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.831
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

3324
01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:06.580
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3325
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:09.770
<v Speaker 2>when they first created the income tax right in 1913,</v>

3326
01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:09.910
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

3327
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:11.500
<v Speaker 2>it got an income tax a hundred years ago.</v>

3328
01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.180
<v Speaker 2>The reason that they created it was because the government told average</v>

3329
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:17.014
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

3330
01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:20.710
<v Speaker 2>if we tax the top one percent of the top one percent,</v>

3331
01:32:20.711 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 2>it was a tiny tax.</v>

3332
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.570
<v Speaker 2>You had to earn something like the equivalent of like $2 million a year before</v>

3333
01:32:25.571 --> 01:32:28.700
<v Speaker 2>you had to get into the one percent bracket and the top bracket was seven</v>

3334
01:32:28.701 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

3335
01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.730
<v Speaker 2>but what Congress told the average American is that if we can tax the very</v>

3336
01:32:33.731 --> 01:32:34.930
<v Speaker 2>wealthy a tiny bit,</v>

3337
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.000
<v Speaker 2>you won't have to pay any taxes at all.</v>

3338
01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:42.100
<v Speaker 2>We'll get rid of all of the duties and the import taxes and all of the federal</v>

3339
01:32:42.101 --> 01:32:44.650
<v Speaker 2>government because the federal government was tiny back then they said,</v>

3340
01:32:44.651 --> 01:32:47.860
<v Speaker 2>we'll pay for everything just by a tiny little tax on the rich.</v>

3341
01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3342
01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Now the income tax taxes,</v>

3343
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:55.570
<v Speaker 2>the average guy at rates far in excess of anything contemplated for the</v>

3344
01:32:55.571 --> 01:32:56.321
<v Speaker 2>rockefellers,</v>

3345
01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:57.070
<v Speaker 2>the vanderbilts.</v>

3346
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3347
01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:57.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3348
01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.661
<v Speaker 2>we got caught.</v>

3349
01:32:58.661 --> 01:32:59.620
<v Speaker 2>That was the original,</v>

3350
01:32:59.621 --> 01:32:59.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3351
01:32:59.801 --> 01:33:01.780
<v Speaker 2>99 percent versus the one percent,</v>

3352
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:02.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3353
01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Because the 99 percent wanted the income tax on the one percent and now they're</v>

3354
01:33:06.491 --> 01:33:11.320
<v Speaker 2>clobbered with tax rates that nobody would have even considered because the top</v>

3355
01:33:11.321 --> 01:33:13.540
<v Speaker 2>tax bracket initially was seven percent.</v>

3356
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:14.770
<v Speaker 2>That was as high as it went.</v>

3357
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:15.460
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

3358
01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:15.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3359
01:33:15.641 --> 01:33:17.590
<v Speaker 2>there was no social security taxes back then.</v>

3360
01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:18.700
<v Speaker 2>There were no state income taxes,</v>

3361
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:20.380
<v Speaker 2>so Americans were really free.</v>

3362
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:21.580
<v Speaker 2>You kept it all.</v>

3363
01:33:22.290 --> 01:33:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3364
01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:23.403
<v Speaker 2>everything you weren't.</v>

3365
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you that I think we pay too much in taxes,</v>

3366
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:31.510
<v Speaker 1>but my question would be how would we run this country if we didn't have all</v>

3367
01:33:33.111 --> 01:33:35.120
<v Speaker 1>that money going and how do we run it back then?</v>

3368
01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a different country or less people.</v>

3369
01:33:37.581 --> 01:33:38.414
<v Speaker 1>There's far less,</v>

3370
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3371
01:33:39.670 --> 01:33:39.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3372
01:33:39.921 --> 01:33:40.680
<v Speaker 1>isn't that funny?</v>

3373
01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Population was growing faster.</v>

3374
01:33:42.421 --> 01:33:42.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

3375
01:33:42.761 --> 01:33:46.710
<v Speaker 2>you think about how we were able to win the Second World War because you</v>

3376
01:33:46.711 --> 01:33:47.011
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>

3377
01:33:47.011 --> 01:33:47.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3378
01:33:47.161 --> 01:33:47.300
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3379
01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:47.440
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3380
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:47.641
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3381
01:33:47.641 --> 01:33:49.410
<v Speaker 2>we kicked the crap out of Japan,</v>

3382
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:50.191
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

3383
01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:50.960
<v Speaker 2>we single handled,</v>

3384
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.550
<v Speaker 2>we fought wars in the Pacific and in Europe.</v>

3385
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Where did all the factories come from to produce all those planes and those</v>

3386
01:33:58.111 --> 01:33:59.160
<v Speaker 2>tanks and those bombs.</v>

3387
01:33:59.161 --> 01:34:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean the government didn't create the free market built up that,</v>

3388
01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:03.480
<v Speaker 2>that arsenal.</v>

3389
01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:06.110
<v Speaker 2>We had the industry that enabled us to go and,</v>

3390
01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:06.620
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3391
01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:07.830
<v Speaker 2>and when those wars.</v>

3392
01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:09.810
<v Speaker 2>But that happened without government.</v>

3393
01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:10.830
<v Speaker 2>It happened,</v>

3394
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:11.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3395
01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:13.650
<v Speaker 2>it was in the absence of government because government was,</v>

3396
01:34:13.651 --> 01:34:13.930
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

3397
01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:14.880
<v Speaker 2>was caught in a cage.</v>

3398
01:34:14.881 --> 01:34:15.870
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't interfere.</v>

3399
01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:17.850
<v Speaker 2>And so we created all this wealth.</v>

3400
01:34:17.851 --> 01:34:19.260
<v Speaker 2>The country ran very,</v>

3401
01:34:19.261 --> 01:34:21.190
<v Speaker 2>very well up until night.</v>

3402
01:34:21.191 --> 01:34:22.050
<v Speaker 2>The 19 twenties,</v>

3403
01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:22.953
<v Speaker 2>19 thirties,</v>

3404
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:23.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3405
01:34:23.221 --> 01:34:24.600
<v Speaker 2>we had a great country,</v>

3406
01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.610
<v Speaker 2>go back and look at the 18 nineties,</v>

3407
01:34:26.611 --> 01:34:29.880
<v Speaker 2>nineties decades were phenomenal economic growth.</v>

3408
01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Now when people say,</v>

3409
01:34:30.901 --> 01:34:31.291
<v Speaker 2>well Peter,</v>

3410
01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:31.501
<v Speaker 2>shift,</v>

3411
01:34:31.501 --> 01:34:33.450
<v Speaker 2>you want to go back to the 18 nineties,</v>

3412
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go back to the 18 nineties technology clearly.</v>

3413
01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3414
01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:41.460
<v Speaker 2>We've benefited from the technological advancements that have taken place.</v>

3415
01:34:41.610 --> 01:34:42.443
<v Speaker 2>But if we had,</v>

3416
01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:45.540
<v Speaker 2>if we had the same amount of government today is we had back then,</v>

3417
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:47.970
<v Speaker 2>we would have much more in the way of technology.</v>

3418
01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.310
<v Speaker 2>We would have a much better standard of living.</v>

3419
01:34:50.311 --> 01:34:51.300
<v Speaker 2>We would all be.</v>

3420
01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.400
<v Speaker 2>I think the environment would be much better shape.</v>

3421
01:34:53.401 --> 01:34:54.630
<v Speaker 2>We'd have a cleaner environment.</v>

3422
01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Had we been able to progress at the rate that we,</v>

3423
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>we were progressing back</v>

3424
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

3425
01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.173
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>

3426
01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:00.810
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel the Murray?</v>

3427
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:02.540
<v Speaker 4>Because the wealthier you are,</v>

3428
01:35:02.541 --> 01:35:05.150
<v Speaker 4>the more you can take care of your environment because it takes,</v>

3429
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.810
<v Speaker 4>it takes,</v>

3430
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:07.220
<v Speaker 4>it takes well to be able to do it.</v>

3431
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:10.100
<v Speaker 4>And we would be a wealthier country today if we were freer,</v>

3432
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 4>if we didn't have to keep us from taking care of our environment as wealth.</v>

3433
01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:14.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3434
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:15.080
<v Speaker 4>I think if we are.</v>

3435
01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.430
<v Speaker 4>You look at some of the poorest countries,</v>

3436
01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:18.200
<v Speaker 4>they don't have any money to take care of their environment.</v>

3437
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:21.350
<v Speaker 4>Now I guess if you're so poor that you can't do anything.</v>

3438
01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:23.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe the environment was pretty good in the stone age,</v>

3439
01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:25.400
<v Speaker 4>but when you want to be in the stone age,</v>

3440
01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:29.120
<v Speaker 4>what more gunk countries are more economically prosperous than us.</v>

3441
01:35:29.121 --> 01:35:29.780
<v Speaker 4>And how fall?</v>

3442
01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:30.680
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of boat.</v>

3443
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.210
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of countries that have that.</v>

3444
01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Well China,</v>

3445
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:33.440
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

3446
01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.530
<v Speaker 4>how fucked up is trying to environment pretty bad.</v>

3447
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:36.500
<v Speaker 4>It is pretty bad.</v>

3448
01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:37.120
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3449
01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.480
<v Speaker 4>and they're richer than us right now.</v>

3450
01:35:38.481 --> 01:35:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3451
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.430
<v Speaker 4>Well not on a per capita basis,</v>

3452
01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 4>but kind of Richard the knots right now.</v>

3453
01:35:43.050 --> 01:35:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Well they are doing better than us because they don't have any regulation there.</v>

3454
01:35:47.501 --> 01:35:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Completely not knowing their environment.</v>

3455
01:35:48.831 --> 01:35:49.250
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>

3456
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:51.160
<v Speaker 4>It's not that they don't have any regulation.</v>

3457
01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.580
<v Speaker 4>If they do,</v>

3458
01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.200
<v Speaker 4>they actually have less than us though,</v>

3459
01:35:54.201 --> 01:35:55.760
<v Speaker 4>which is why they're producing so much.</v>

3460
01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:59.450
<v Speaker 4>That's why they have fucking no skies that are black.</v>

3461
01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:03.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally you drive down the street and see half the people in masks on.</v>

3462
01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:03.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3463
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.510
<v Speaker 4>I know and all this stuff they're producing.</v>

3464
01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:06.560
<v Speaker 4>We get it here in America.</v>

3465
01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.370
<v Speaker 4>We are going towards producing over the environment.</v>

3466
01:36:10.371 --> 01:36:10.881
<v Speaker 4>You're doing that.</v>

3467
01:36:10.881 --> 01:36:11.181
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3468
01:36:11.181 --> 01:36:15.700
<v Speaker 4>you immediately side towards this is the glass half full assay either producing</v>

3469
01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:16.101
<v Speaker 4>all these things.</v>

3470
01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:16.940
<v Speaker 4>They're making all this money.</v>

3471
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.690
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

3472
01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:21.860
<v Speaker 2>if the Chinese weren't obsessed with selling stuff to Americans who can't afford</v>

3473
01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:22.610
<v Speaker 2>to pay for it,</v>

3474
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:25.220
<v Speaker 2>if they simply let their currency go up in value,</v>

3475
01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:25.760
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3476
01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.820
<v Speaker 2>their own citizens would be able to consume those products and they'd have a lot</v>

3477
01:36:28.821 --> 01:36:30.380
<v Speaker 2>more wealth to take care of their environment.</v>

3478
01:36:30.381 --> 01:36:30.990
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

3479
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.180
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

3480
01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:34.860
<v Speaker 2>They're sacrificing to keep our economy propped up and I think that</v>

3481
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.500
<v Speaker 4>are people going,</v>

3482
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:36.530
<v Speaker 4>what are they going to do for a living?</v>

3483
01:36:36.850 --> 01:36:39.640
<v Speaker 4>So many of these people are actually making things for Americans.</v>

3484
01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:42.790
<v Speaker 4>They're going to stop and just concentrate on their economy and concentrated</v>

3485
01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:43.090
<v Speaker 4>will.</v>

3486
01:36:43.090 --> 01:36:43.923
<v Speaker 4>We'll have to go back.</v>

3487
01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll go back to world war two.</v>

3488
01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3489
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:46.860
<v Speaker 2>So during the Second World War,</v>

3490
01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:47.943
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3491
01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Americans were employed either if you were a man,</v>

3492
01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:52.230
<v Speaker 2>you were in the army,</v>

3493
01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:53.130
<v Speaker 2>if you were a one.</v>

3494
01:36:53.131 --> 01:36:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you were four f you or you were working for factor that made bombs,</v>

3495
01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:57.120
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

3496
01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:57.391
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3497
01:36:57.391 --> 01:37:00.150
<v Speaker 2>who were formerly housewives for now in factories working,</v>

3498
01:37:00.151 --> 01:37:00.781
<v Speaker 2>making bombs.</v>

3499
01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:02.520
<v Speaker 2>So everybody had jobs.</v>

3500
01:37:02.521 --> 01:37:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was making stuff for the war.</v>

3501
01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3502
01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:05.400
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile,</v>

3503
01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.410
<v Speaker 2>everything that you needed was rationed at home.</v>

3504
01:37:07.411 --> 01:37:09.150
<v Speaker 2>It was very tough being in the U,</v>

3505
01:37:09.151 --> 01:37:12.420
<v Speaker 2>s during the war because we had nothing because everything was used,</v>

3506
01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:12.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3507
01:37:12.850 --> 01:37:13.130
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

3508
01:37:13.130 --> 01:37:13.980
<v Speaker 2>to supply the war.</v>

3509
01:37:14.250 --> 01:37:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Now as the war was nearing an end,</v>

3510
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:19.380
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of economists who were advising the president,</v>

3511
01:37:19.381 --> 01:37:20.250
<v Speaker 2>your President Truman,</v>

3512
01:37:20.730 --> 01:37:21.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3513
01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:25.260
<v Speaker 2>we can end the war because there's going to be massive unemployment because all</v>

3514
01:37:25.261 --> 01:37:27.240
<v Speaker 2>the soldiers are going to be unemployed.</v>

3515
01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.250
<v Speaker 2>The people making bombs are going to be unemployed.</v>

3516
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.930
<v Speaker 2>We know what are we going to do?</v>

3517
01:37:30.931 --> 01:37:33.090
<v Speaker 2>And they were actually worried about this is so stupid.</v>

3518
01:37:33.091 --> 01:37:34.470
<v Speaker 2>It was to have economic advisors.</v>

3519
01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:35.700
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3520
01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.850
<v Speaker 2>but then the war ended and did we have a collapse?</v>

3521
01:37:38.851 --> 01:37:39.001
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3522
01:37:39.001 --> 01:37:42.870
<v Speaker 2>we had a boom because now all the people that were making stuff that blew up</v>

3523
01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 2>started to make things that we actually wanted.</v>

3524
01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:45.281
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3525
01:37:45.281 --> 01:37:48.430
<v Speaker 4>And so pigeons of those industries were in fact in war,</v>

3526
01:37:48.431 --> 01:37:48.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3527
01:37:48.670 --> 01:37:48.790
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3528
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:49.210
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3529
01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:49.421
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3530
01:37:49.421 --> 01:37:50.770
<v Speaker 4>It was when I would start it off.</v>

3531
01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:51.723
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3532
01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.520
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3533
01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:52.950
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3534
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:53.230
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

3535
01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:53.610
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3536
01:37:53.610 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 4>that we had factories were making automobiles</v>

3537
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.873
<v Speaker 3>before the war.</v>

3538
01:37:57.090 --> 01:37:57.331
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

3539
01:37:57.331 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 3>all those factories started making tanks.</v>

3540
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:01.230
<v Speaker 3>We were making commercial airplanes.</v>

3541
01:38:01.231 --> 01:38:02.930
<v Speaker 3>We started to make military airplanes.</v>

3542
01:38:02.931 --> 01:38:06.030
<v Speaker 3>So the factories came for a civilian purpose.</v>

3543
01:38:06.150 --> 01:38:08.970
<v Speaker 3>And then they were retrofitted for military purpose.</v>

3544
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:10.860
<v Speaker 3>When the government started ordering all this stuff,</v>

3545
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 4>didn't the government give the economy a bump?</v>

3546
01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:15.140
<v Speaker 4>I know by buying this stuff.</v>

3547
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:16.673
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3548
01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:16.851
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3549
01:38:16.851 --> 01:38:17.031
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3550
01:38:17.031 --> 01:38:21.050
<v Speaker 3>The economy suffered because of all those resources being squandered by the</v>

3551
01:38:21.051 --> 01:38:21.381
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

3552
01:38:21.381 --> 01:38:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Now maybe we needed to do that.</v>

3553
01:38:22.851 --> 01:38:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we needed to get rid of Adolf Hitler.</v>

3554
01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we needed to fight that.</v>

3555
01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.800
<v Speaker 3>But Peter Schiff.</v>

3556
01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3557
01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:32.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the things you could say that we're better off in the long run</v>

3558
01:38:32.751 --> 01:38:34.130
<v Speaker 3>because we got rid of Adolf Hitler.</v>

3559
01:38:34.131 --> 01:38:35.450
<v Speaker 3>But in the short run,</v>

3560
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:39.320
<v Speaker 3>the fact that we had to divert all those resources out of peacetime production</v>

3561
01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.340
<v Speaker 3>to military production was,</v>

3562
01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.160
<v Speaker 3>was a burden on the economy.</v>

3563
01:38:43.161 --> 01:38:45.140
<v Speaker 3>People suffered during the war.</v>

3564
01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:45.660
<v Speaker 3>Now they,</v>

3565
01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:45.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3566
01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.420
<v Speaker 3>they didn't complain because we were.</v>

3567
01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:48.560
<v Speaker 3>The war was on.</v>

3568
01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.320
<v Speaker 3>But this is my point about China right now.</v>

3569
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:55.640
<v Speaker 3>You have all these factories in China and the Chinese are working there,</v>

3570
01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:59.210
<v Speaker 3>but the stuff that they're making is going to America.</v>

3571
01:38:59.690 --> 01:39:03.030
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda like when we had factories and we were making stuff for,</v>

3572
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:03.770
<v Speaker 3>for the war,</v>

3573
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:05.740
<v Speaker 3>they're making stuff that they can't use it,</v>

3574
01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3575
01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.460
<v Speaker 3>we're using it now.</v>

3576
01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:11.210
<v Speaker 3>If they let their own currency go up because the Chinese government is actively</v>

3577
01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.680
<v Speaker 3>suppressing the value of their currency.</v>

3578
01:39:12.681 --> 01:39:15.770
<v Speaker 3>That's why they have 4 trillion in foreign reserves.</v>

3579
01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:19.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why China is the biggest owner of us treasuries other than the Federal</v>

3580
01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Reserve,</v>

3581
01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:22.760
<v Speaker 3>because they keep buying them up in order to keep their currency from going up.</v>

3582
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:24.800
<v Speaker 3>But when they keep their currency from going up,</v>

3583
01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.560
<v Speaker 3>they keep their own citizens from buying their own products.</v>

3584
01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:30.290
<v Speaker 3>But if the Chinese let their currency go up,</v>

3585
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:32.090
<v Speaker 3>the the idea is that,</v>

3586
01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:32.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3587
01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:34.040
<v Speaker 3>if Americans now you know,</v>

3588
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:35.750
<v Speaker 3>can't afford to buy Chinese products,</v>

3589
01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.790
<v Speaker 3>all those Chinese workers are going to lose their jobs.</v>

3590
01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:38.091
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3591
01:39:38.091 --> 01:39:38.570
<v Speaker 3>they won't.</v>

3592
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Just like the soldiers didn't lose.</v>

3593
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:42.320
<v Speaker 3>The factory's still there,</v>

3594
01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.920
<v Speaker 3>they just made stuff for American.</v>

3595
01:39:43.921 --> 01:39:46.490
<v Speaker 3>So you've got all these factories that Chinese people,</v>

3596
01:39:46.491 --> 01:39:48.050
<v Speaker 3>there's almost a billion people in China.</v>

3597
01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.850
<v Speaker 3>They need a lot more stuff than we do.</v>

3598
01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.670
<v Speaker 3>They need all the stuff that they're producing in those factories.</v>

3599
01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:54.050
<v Speaker 3>They don't need us to consume it.</v>

3600
01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:56.540
<v Speaker 3>They're perfectly happy to consume that stuff.</v>

3601
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:59.190
<v Speaker 3>The reason they can't consume it as they can't afford it because their currency</v>

3602
01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:00.024
<v Speaker 3>is too weak,</v>

3603
01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:04.190
<v Speaker 3>but the Chinese government less their currency go up and now all of a sudden the</v>

3604
01:40:04.191 --> 01:40:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Chinese are going to have the jobs and the stuff.</v>

3605
01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.830
<v Speaker 3>See Right now they get the jobs and we get the stuff that's a lousy trade off</v>

3606
01:40:09.831 --> 01:40:10.520
<v Speaker 3>for them,</v>

3607
01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:13.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's good for us because we get stuff without having to work for it.</v>

3608
01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:14.720
<v Speaker 3>They get to work without any of this stuff.</v>

3609
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:16.350
<v Speaker 3>But that's what you want when you.</v>

3610
01:40:16.351 --> 01:40:17.270
<v Speaker 3>When you have a job,</v>

3611
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:18.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't want the job,</v>

3612
01:40:18.561 --> 01:40:20.660
<v Speaker 3>you want the stuff that you can buy with your paycheck.</v>

3613
01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Nobody works.</v>

3614
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:22.161
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3615
01:40:22.161 --> 01:40:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't work because they enjoy work.</v>

3616
01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:24.470
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3617
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.760
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3618
01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:25.970
<v Speaker 3>they look forward to quitting time.</v>

3619
01:40:25.971 --> 01:40:27.050
<v Speaker 3>They look forward to the weekend,</v>

3620
01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:28.430
<v Speaker 3>they want to spend the money,</v>

3621
01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:31.730
<v Speaker 3>and right now the Chinese aren't able to spend it because we're spending it for</v>

3622
01:40:31.731 --> 01:40:32.210
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

3623
01:40:32.210 --> 01:40:32.451
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

3624
01:40:32.451 --> 01:40:33.560
<v Speaker 4>but how do you stop this?</v>

3625
01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.910
<v Speaker 4>Look at these images.</v>

3626
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.660
<v Speaker 4>What images?</v>

3627
01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:37.610
<v Speaker 4>These images of pollution in China,</v>

3628
01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:38.990
<v Speaker 4>how would you stop that?</v>

3629
01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Because obviously they have less regulation than us and this is the result of</v>

3630
01:40:42.561 --> 01:40:42.681
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3631
01:40:42.681 --> 01:40:43.550
<v Speaker 4>They have slaves.</v>

3632
01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:45.470
<v Speaker 4>Pennies an hour.</v>

3633
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:47.360
<v Speaker 4>They don't have of the environment.</v>

3634
01:40:47.361 --> 01:40:48.194
<v Speaker 4>Might as well be slaves.</v>

3635
01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:48.301
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3636
01:40:48.301 --> 01:40:50.060
<v Speaker 4>they're not in these factories.</v>

3637
01:40:50.061 --> 01:40:50.600
<v Speaker 4>What is it called?</v>

3638
01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:51.111
<v Speaker 4>Foxconn.</v>

3639
01:40:51.111 --> 01:40:51.944
<v Speaker 4>Foxconn.</v>

3640
01:40:52.090 --> 01:40:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I had a woman on my,</v>

3641
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:53.951
<v Speaker 2>I forget her name,</v>

3642
01:40:53.951 --> 01:40:57.520
<v Speaker 2>she was Chinese American and she lived with a Chinese peasants for wild.</v>

3643
01:40:57.521 --> 01:41:00.400
<v Speaker 2>She wrote a book and I asked her,</v>

3644
01:41:00.401 --> 01:41:00.611
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3645
01:41:00.611 --> 01:41:00.731
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3646
01:41:00.731 --> 01:41:00.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3647
01:41:00.851 --> 01:41:02.260
<v Speaker 2>because these are all these young girls.</v>

3648
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:05.380
<v Speaker 2>It was about Chinese women and they would leave the farms and they would go and</v>

3649
01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:09.220
<v Speaker 2>live in cities and work at work in these factories.</v>

3650
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:10.121
<v Speaker 2>And I asked her,</v>

3651
01:41:10.121 --> 01:41:10.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3652

01:41:10.861 --> 01:41:11.290
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:12.190
<v Speaker 2>they're very happy.</v>

3655
01:41:12.191 --> 01:41:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Their lives are much better.</v>

3656
01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3657
01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:14.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3658
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:14.261

01:41:14.261 --> 01:41:14.471
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3660
01:41:14.471 --> 01:41:15.251
<v Speaker 2>they're out on their own.</v>

3661
01:41:15.251 --> 01:41:16.510
<v Speaker 2>They were able to leave their home.</v>

3662
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:17.530
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

3663
01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:17.960
<v Speaker 2>they aren't,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>

3672
01:41:23.561 --> 01:41:24.940
<v Speaker 2>they're actually enjoying their lives.</v>

3673

01:41:28.661 --> 01:41:29.920
<v Speaker 2>They're living in their parents' basements.</v>

3682
01:41:29.921 --> 01:41:31.740
<v Speaker 2>They can't get out from under their college debt</v>

3683
01:41:33.230 --> 01:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>stories like this,</v>

3684
01:41:34.161 --> 01:41:35.600
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a bunch of slaves.</v>

3685
01:41:35.630 --> 01:41:36.770
<v Speaker 1>And you understand,</v>

3686
01:41:36.771 --> 01:41:38.690
<v Speaker 1>you're a very smart guy and you understand what you're doing here.</v>

3687
01:41:38.691 --> 01:41:42.560
<v Speaker 1>You're flavoring this argument by these anecdotal stories about this person is</v>

3688
01:41:42.561 --> 01:41:43.460
<v Speaker 1>so much happier now.</v>

3689
01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:46.400
<v Speaker 1>And I knew a lady who knew the peasants and peasants are happy.</v>

3690
01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:46.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3691
01:41:46.721 --> 01:41:48.680
<v Speaker 1>that's what rich people saying when they don't have to live in China.</v>

3692
01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:49.573
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

3693
01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.230
<v Speaker 2>look at that fucking sky over there.</v>

3694
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:54.030
<v Speaker 2>She uses and you know that.</v>

3695
01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:57.350
<v Speaker 2>And when the Chinese cut the cord from the United States,</v>

3696
01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.510
<v Speaker 2>when they stopped subsidizing our economy,</v>

3697
01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:01.220
<v Speaker 2>when they let their currency go up,</v>

3698
01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:05.060
<v Speaker 2>they will be able to deal with air pollution and they're also going to enjoy a</v>

3699
01:42:05.061 --> 01:42:06.460
<v Speaker 2>greater benefit for their efforts.</v>

3700
01:42:06.461 --> 01:42:07.294
<v Speaker 2>But nobody.</v>

3701
01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.270
<v Speaker 2>But nobody puts it.</v>

3702
01:42:08.271 --> 01:42:11.720
<v Speaker 2>If somebody in China right moves from a form into,</v>

3703
01:42:11.721 --> 01:42:12.021
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

3704
01:42:12.021 --> 01:42:13.940
<v Speaker 2>into a city and gets a job at a factory,</v>

3705
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.500
<v Speaker 2>nobody is forcing them to do that.</v>

3706
01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:18.830
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't do that if they're live didn't improve as a result of doing it.</v>

3707
01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm now their lives would be a lot better if the government didn't suppress</v>

3708
01:42:22.671 --> 01:42:23.390
<v Speaker 2>their currency,</v>

3709
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:25.490
<v Speaker 2>but America's lives would be a lot worse.</v>

3710
01:42:25.491 --> 01:42:27.440
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately that is what's going to come.</v>

3711
01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:27.831
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3712
01:42:27.831 --> 01:42:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Because we are living right know,</v>

3713
01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.340
<v Speaker 2>because of all the,</v>

3714
01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:31.560
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

3715
01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.630
<v Speaker 2>all of their production.</v>

3716
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3717
01:42:33.170 --> 01:42:35.690
<v Speaker 2>And so imagine what it would be like in America,</v>

3718
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.201
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3719
01:42:36.201 --> 01:42:36.951
<v Speaker 2>If we couldn't,</v>

3720
01:42:36.951 --> 01:42:40.010
<v Speaker 2>if we could only consume the things that our own factories could produce.</v>

3721
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:40.860
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

3722
01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:41.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3723
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.690
<v Speaker 2>what if,</v>

3724
01:42:41.690 --> 01:42:44.630
<v Speaker 2>what if Walmart only has stuff made in America on the shelves?</v>

3725
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:45.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3726
01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:46.873
<v Speaker 2>what could you buy?</v>

3727
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Not much.</v>

3728
01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Not as much.</v>

3729
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3730
01:42:49.941 --> 01:42:50.181
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3731
01:42:50.181 --> 01:42:50.780
<v Speaker 2>barely you.</v>

3732
01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:50.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3733
01:42:50.961 --> 01:42:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you certainly couldn't buy anything that plugs in,</v>

3734
01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:53.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3735
01:42:53.301 --> 01:42:54.280
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't buy anything that,</v>

3736
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:57.320
<v Speaker 2>that was electronic or they've had an on off switch or something,</v>

3737
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:59.470
<v Speaker 2>but you couldn't buy much in the way of,</v>

3738
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.130
<v Speaker 2>of furniture or clothing.</v>

3739
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Assume that just like the regular market itself.</v>

3740
01:43:04.221 --> 01:43:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel like if government regulation stepped out,</v>

3741
01:43:06.561 --> 01:43:07.730
<v Speaker 1>if we had less imports,</v>

3742
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:09.710
<v Speaker 1>we would pick up the slack with American.</v>

3743
01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Well instruction and innovation and by designing of new materials.</v>

3744
01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3745
01:43:14.490 --> 01:43:14.940
<v Speaker 2>not with,</v>

3746
01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.190
<v Speaker 2>not with the regulatory and tax system we have now.</v>

3747
01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:19.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why the businesses left because you know,</v>

3748
01:43:19.450 --> 01:43:19.650
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3749
01:43:19.650 --> 01:43:22.470
<v Speaker 2>and so what would happen is yes we would have to produce it ourselves,</v>

3750
01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:24.900
<v Speaker 2>but we would produce a lot less of it at a much,</v>

3751
01:43:24.901 --> 01:43:27.510
<v Speaker 2>much higher costs because manufacturing be impeded by governor.</v>

3752
01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:28.860
<v Speaker 2>It'd be much more expensive.</v>

3753
01:43:28.861 --> 01:43:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3754
01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3755
01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:30.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3756
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:31.530
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have middle class people,</v>

3757
01:43:31.531 --> 01:43:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3758
01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3759
01:43:32.370 --> 01:43:33.660
<v Speaker 2>walking out of Walmart with,</v>

3760
01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3761
01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:34.700
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

3762
01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:35.820
<v Speaker 2>with the shopping cart</v>

3763
01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:36.430
<v Speaker 1>slum,</v>

3764
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:38.020
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say things like,</v>

3765
01:43:38.021 --> 01:43:41.290
<v Speaker 1>the reason why people go from farms to cities is because they make a choice.</v>

3766
01:43:41.291 --> 01:43:42.124
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good show.</v>

3767
01:43:42.130 --> 01:43:43.930
<v Speaker 1>And they made a choice because it's better for them that yes,</v>

3768
01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.040
<v Speaker 1>these people are fucked.</v>

3769
01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Like they're in a terrible,</v>

3770
01:43:46.151 --> 01:43:46.541
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

3771
01:43:46.541 --> 01:43:50.980
<v Speaker 1>terrible situation and horrible spot on earth economic depression beyond,</v>

3772
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:52.080
<v Speaker 1>for the average</v>

3773
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:52.230
<v Speaker 3>user.</v>

3774
01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:52.910
<v Speaker 3>That is that.</v>

3775
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:53.660
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

3776
01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:53.841
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3777
01:43:53.841 --> 01:43:54.051
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3778
01:43:54.051 --> 01:43:54.741
<v Speaker 3>the human kid,</v>

3779
01:43:54.741 --> 01:43:55.060
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3780
01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:55.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3781
01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:56.390
<v Speaker 3>the human condition,</v>

3782
01:43:56.391 --> 01:43:56.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3783
01:43:56.710 --> 01:43:57.230
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

3784
01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:58.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't have anything when you know,</v>

3785
01:43:58.580 --> 01:43:59.480
<v Speaker 3>when you first start out,</v>

3786
01:43:59.481 --> 01:43:59.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3787
01:43:59.710 --> 01:44:01.910
<v Speaker 3>You've got to improve your life.</v>

3788
01:44:01.911 --> 01:44:05.450
<v Speaker 3>You make decisions that that's why what I was at occupy Wall Street,</v>

3789
01:44:05.451 --> 01:44:08.990
<v Speaker 3>this decision that they're making allows them to make $5 a week and jump off</v>

3790
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:09.590
<v Speaker 3>buildings.</v>

3791
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:10.460
<v Speaker 3>That decision,</v>

3792
01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:10.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3793
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:11.563
<v Speaker 3>but that.</v>

3794
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:13.880
<v Speaker 3>But that's a better opportunity than the one that they've,</v>

3795
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:14.923
<v Speaker 3>that they gave up.</v>

3796
01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:16.490
<v Speaker 3>They both suck.</v>

3797
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:18.770
<v Speaker 3>But this idea that your anecdotal story,</v>

3798
01:44:18.771 --> 01:44:21.620
<v Speaker 3>but I had a friend who she lived with and they're all happy.</v>

3799
01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.000
<v Speaker 3>What are the over in America?</v>

3800
01:44:23.001 --> 01:44:25.750
<v Speaker 3>People just don't make any money or a lot of governments on your.</v>

3801
01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:26.691
<v Speaker 3>Forget about China.</v>

3802
01:44:26.691 --> 01:44:28.970
<v Speaker 3>There are people here in America to a good example though,</v>

3803
01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:29.490
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3804
01:44:29.490 --> 01:44:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Let me bring this back to home so I don't have to talk about an anecdote.</v>

3805
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.900
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3806
01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:33.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3807
01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:34.310
<v Speaker 3>there's a big movement now.</v>

3808
01:44:34.311 --> 01:44:37.130
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are saying that people that work in the fast food industry or</v>

3809
01:44:37.131 --> 01:44:39.290
<v Speaker 3>people that work at Walmart should be paid more money.</v>

3810
01:44:39.291 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't be paid the minimum wage.</v>

3811
01:44:41.061 --> 01:44:42.530
<v Speaker 3>And of course there should be no minimum wage.</v>

3812
01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 3>The minimum wage is,</v>

3813
01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:44.391
<v Speaker 3>does a lot of harm.</v>

3814
01:44:44.391 --> 01:44:46.370
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the stupidest laws that we've got a.</v>

3815
01:44:46.371 --> 01:44:47.390
<v Speaker 3>But there are people say,</v>

3816
01:44:47.391 --> 01:44:47.810
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3817
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:48.380
<v Speaker 3>they should,</v>

3818
01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:49.610
<v Speaker 3>we should pay pay.</v>

3819
01:44:49.611 --> 01:44:51.020
<v Speaker 3>The more they're being exploited,</v>

3820
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3821
01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.210
<v Speaker 3>They should get paid $15 an hour,</v>

3822
01:44:53.211 --> 01:44:54.044
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

3823
01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:57.500
<v Speaker 3>But if somebody has a job at Walmart and Walmart's pain,</v>

3824
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3825
01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:58.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3826
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.760
<v Speaker 3>8:50,</v>

3827
01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.151
<v Speaker 3>an hour,</v>

3828
01:44:59.151 --> 01:44:59.841
<v Speaker 3>$9 an hour,</v>

3829
01:44:59.841 --> 01:45:00.291
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

3830
01:45:00.291 --> 01:45:01.250
<v Speaker 3>And they took that job,</v>

3831
01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:05.270
<v Speaker 3>they took that job because Walmart offered them a better deal than anybody else</v>

3832
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.200
<v Speaker 3>because if somebody's off,</v>

3833
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.780
<v Speaker 3>I'll offer them a better deal where they would have taken that job instead.</v>

3834
01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:12.830
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that somebody voluntarily accepted a job at a given rate of pay</v>

3835
01:45:13.090 --> 01:45:14.390
<v Speaker 3>means that they're not being exploited.</v>

3836
01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Nobody volunteers to be exploited.</v>

3837
01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:18.020
<v Speaker 3>If that's the best job you can get,</v>

3838
01:45:18.021 --> 01:45:19.910
<v Speaker 3>then you should be thankful that Walmart is.</v>

3839
01:45:19.911 --> 01:45:21.950
<v Speaker 3>They're offering it because they outbid everybody else.</v>

3840
01:45:21.951 --> 01:45:24.650
<v Speaker 3>They're offering you a better deal than you can get someplace else.</v>

3841
01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:24.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3842
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:29.510
<v Speaker 3>the idea is to keep away from some sort of a Fox con type scenario.</v>

3843
01:45:29.511 --> 01:45:33.410
<v Speaker 3>We're one group has a gigantic amount of money and they take advantage of these</v>

3844
01:45:33.411 --> 01:45:34.580
<v Speaker 3>incredibly poor people,</v>

3845
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:36.260
<v Speaker 3>but how are they nominate a tiny,</v>

3846
01:45:36.261 --> 01:45:36.651
<v Speaker 3>tiny,</v>

3847
01:45:36.651 --> 01:45:40.100
<v Speaker 3>tiny amount of money and forcing them to work ungodly hours to the point where</v>

3848
01:45:40.101 --> 01:45:43.400
<v Speaker 3>they have to put nets all around their building right there.</v>

3849
01:45:43.410 --> 01:45:43.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3850
01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:44.210
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>

3851
01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:45.043
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

3852
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:48.170
<v Speaker 3>if I do not agree that it's a strange situation,</v>

3853
01:45:48.171 --> 01:45:53.171
<v Speaker 3>if I advertise a job at a particular rate of pay and somebody shows up,</v>

3854
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 3>you know when Walmart runs an ad,</v>

3855
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.531
<v Speaker 3>they get like,</v>

3856
01:45:55.531 --> 01:45:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3857
01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:57.320
<v Speaker 3>50 applicants per position.</v>

3858
01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.140
<v Speaker 3>So obviously they're not trying.</v>

3859
01:46:00.141 --> 01:46:01.280
<v Speaker 3>They're not exploiting people.</v>

3860
01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3861
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:02.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3862
01:46:02.890 --> 01:46:04.640
<v Speaker 3>50 people wouldn't apply for the job.</v>

3863
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:05.583
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3864
01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Walmart was out there and getting people and they had people with guns standing</v>

3865
01:46:09.531 --> 01:46:12.290
<v Speaker 3>around the workers making sure that they didn't leave and then you'd have a</v>

3866
01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:12.860
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

3867
01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:15.470
<v Speaker 3>but nobody is forcing anybody to take these jobs.</v>

3868
01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.450
<v Speaker 3>They're taking them because it's the best job they can get.</v>

3869
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:21.110
<v Speaker 3>And why is that and why is Walmart bad for offering somebody the best job they</v>

3870
01:46:21.111 --> 01:46:21.650
<v Speaker 3>can get?</v>

3871
01:46:21.650 --> 01:46:21.771
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

3872
01:46:21.771 --> 01:46:22.461
<v Speaker 3>Some people will say,</v>

3873
01:46:22.461 --> 01:46:22.581
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3874
01:46:22.581 --> 01:46:23.810
<v Speaker 3>they should offer even more money.</v>

3875
01:46:23.811 --> 01:46:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Why the worker not worth it?</v>

3876
01:46:25.611 --> 01:46:26.930
<v Speaker 3>They don't have enough productivity.</v>

3877
01:46:26.931 --> 01:46:28.010
<v Speaker 3>They don't have enough skills.</v>

3878
01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 3>And you do a lot of people,</v>

3879
01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:31.010
<v Speaker 3>and this is what I did with occupy Wall Street,</v>

3880
01:46:31.011 --> 01:46:34.490
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people who want to criticize people who hire people and they said,</v>

3881
01:46:34.491 --> 01:46:34.611
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3882
01:46:34.611 --> 01:46:35.930
<v Speaker 3>you don't pay your workers enough money.</v>

3883
01:46:36.230 --> 01:46:37.340
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any employees.</v>

3884
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:38.620
<v Speaker 3>They don't pay their workers anything.</v>

3885
01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:38.961
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3886
01:46:38.961 --> 01:46:39.111
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3887
01:46:39.111 --> 01:46:41.240
<v Speaker 3>you don't think the guy at Walmart is making enough money.</v>

3888
01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:42.830
<v Speaker 3>Then you hire them and pay them more.</v>

3889
01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:44.540
<v Speaker 3>So how to sound like Foxconn happen.</v>

3890
01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:48.110
<v Speaker 3>How do you have a gigantic business and makes billions of dollars and pays</v>

3891
01:46:48.111 --> 01:46:49.380
<v Speaker 3>people pennies and met,</v>

3892
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:50.880
<v Speaker 3>makes them work 16 hours a day.</v>

3893
01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Takes advantage of these people that don't have any other opportunity.</v>

3894
01:46:54.130 --> 01:46:56.220
<v Speaker 3>Makes anybody work six hours a day.</v>

3895
01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:56.940
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to.</v>

3896
01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.140
<v Speaker 3>Who are you talking about?</v>

3897
01:46:58.141 --> 01:46:58.591
<v Speaker 3>Foxconn.</v>

3898
01:46:58.591 --> 01:47:00.270
<v Speaker 3>People don't have ungodly hours that they work.</v>

3899
01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what their hours are,</v>

3900
01:47:01.831 --> 01:47:04.920
<v Speaker 3>but there no one's forced to work the hours they choose to work the hours that I</v>

3901
01:47:04.921 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 3>don't think they have a lot of choice.</v>

3902
01:47:05.971 --> 01:47:07.290
<v Speaker 3>I think if we want to keep their job,</v>

3903
01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:08.210
<v Speaker 3>they have to do it right.</v>

3904
01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:11.490
<v Speaker 3>If they want to keep their job and they must like it and there's many other</v>

3905
01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:12.324
<v Speaker 3>opportunities,</v>

3906
01:47:12.570 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 3>but then they shouldn't be glad they got that one.</v>

3907
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

3908
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:17.880
<v Speaker 3>But are they should be glad that someone's paying them pennies.</v>

3909
01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3910
01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:22.440
<v Speaker 3>if that's this big evil corporation,</v>

3911
01:47:22.441 --> 01:47:23.580
<v Speaker 3>this is the idea that people have.</v>

3912
01:47:23.710 --> 01:47:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3913
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:25.040
<v Speaker 3>but what does that company,</v>

3914
01:47:26.210 --> 01:47:26.400
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

3915
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.211
<v Speaker 3>What did that quote come to those?</v>

3916
01:47:27.211 --> 01:47:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>

3917
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 3>they're doing what they'd done for thousands of years,</v>

3918
01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 3>but obviously the company is an improvement over what they were doing or they</v>

3919
01:47:31.951 --> 01:47:33.210
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't choose to work there.</v>

3920
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:35.250
<v Speaker 3>And what happens is you can't make that leap,</v>

3921
01:47:35.251 --> 01:47:38.640
<v Speaker 3>but unless you're in that environment and you understand those people,</v>

3922
01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:43.590
<v Speaker 3>and I'm assuming that people are rational and I don't want a super impose my</v>

3923
01:47:43.591 --> 01:47:44.910
<v Speaker 3>judgment over somebody else's.</v>

3924
01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:46.320
<v Speaker 3>If somebody makes a decision,</v>

3925
01:47:46.321 --> 01:47:46.591
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3926
01:47:46.591 --> 01:47:48.630
<v Speaker 3>just like you want to choose to smoke marijuana,</v>

3927
01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:48.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3928
01:47:48.970 --> 01:47:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Fun.</v>

3929
01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:50.071
<v Speaker 3>Bringing that up,</v>

3930
01:47:50.071 --> 01:47:50.291
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3931
01:47:50.291 --> 01:47:50.660
<v Speaker 3>You know what you mean?</v>

3932
01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Nervous.</v>

3933
01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:51.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3934
01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.190
<v Speaker 3>because you want to make a choice and I agree.</v>

3935
01:47:53.191 --> 01:47:54.180
<v Speaker 3>You should have that choice.</v>

3936
01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3937
01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't drink coffee apps.</v>

3938
01:47:56.210 --> 01:47:57.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to make things I want to do.</v>

3939
01:47:57.841 --> 01:47:58.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't want them to,</v>

3940
01:47:58.430 --> 01:48:01.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't wanna I don't want to make caffeine illegal because that's not because</v>

3941
01:48:01.711 --> 01:48:04.860
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is illegal in California.</v>

3942
01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:06.300
<v Speaker 3>Well only it's only medical.</v>

3943
01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:07.970
<v Speaker 3>You Got A.</v>

3944
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3945
01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3946
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 3>but in some places even that,</v>

3947
01:48:10.261 --> 01:48:10.711
<v Speaker 3>but there's other.</v>

3948
01:48:10.711 --> 01:48:10.921
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3949
01:48:10.921 --> 01:48:11.341
<v Speaker 3>I think they,</v>

3950
01:48:11.341 --> 01:48:12.570
<v Speaker 3>I think cocaine should be legal.</v>

3951
01:48:12.571 --> 01:48:13.800
<v Speaker 3>I think heroin should be legal,</v>

3952
01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:14.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3953
01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.410
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean I think people should go out and shoot up.</v>

3954
01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3955
01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.110
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3956
01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:20.520
<v Speaker 3>but I recognize all the damage that the government does.</v>

3957
01:48:20.521 --> 01:48:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it infringement on,</v>

3958
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.280
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3959
01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:22.801
<v Speaker 3>on liberty,</v>

3960
01:48:22.801 --> 01:48:25.800
<v Speaker 3>I think people should be able to choose to make a bad decision if that's what</v>

3961
01:48:25.801 --> 01:48:26.634
<v Speaker 3>they want to do</v>

3962
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.020
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3963
01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Colorado,</v>

3964
01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:29.453
<v Speaker 3>North Korea,</v>

3965
01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:29.940
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

3966
01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:31.350
<v Speaker 3>well then they got something right over there.</v>

3967
01:48:31.351 --> 01:48:31.531
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3968
01:48:31.531 --> 01:48:32.364
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3969
01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:34.440
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't my arguments right out the window,</v>

3970
01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:35.041
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

3971
01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:35.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3972
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:36.750
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not that.</v>

3973
01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:37.111
<v Speaker 3>I forgot.</v>

3974
01:48:37.111 --> 01:48:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what I was.</v>

3975
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3976
01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:38.911
<v Speaker 3>So the government,</v>

3977
01:48:38.911 --> 01:48:40.110
<v Speaker 3>but the government not only,</v>

3978
01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:40.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3979
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3980
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:41.221
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

3981
01:48:41.221 --> 01:48:41.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3982
01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:44.340
<v Speaker 3>does that infringe upon your liberties and freedoms,</v>

3983
01:48:44.670 --> 01:48:46.640
<v Speaker 3>but it actually creates a lot of problems.</v>

3984
01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:48.660
<v Speaker 3>The biggest problems in America is not drugs,</v>

3985
01:48:48.661 --> 01:48:49.590
<v Speaker 3>but the war on drugs.</v>

3986
01:48:49.591 --> 01:48:49.771
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3987
01:48:49.771 --> 01:48:50.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

3988
01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:52.920
<v Speaker 3>that's what does a lot much more harm to the economy.</v>

3989
01:48:52.921 --> 01:48:53.400
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3990
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.540
<v Speaker 3>I actually think that more people do drugs because they're illegal than if they</v>

3991
01:48:57.541 --> 01:48:57.840
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

3992
01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.381
<v Speaker 3>they'd probably,</v>

3993
01:48:58.381 --> 01:48:58.951
<v Speaker 3>if they were legal,</v>

3994
01:48:58.951 --> 01:49:01.710
<v Speaker 3>but certainly they would be safer if they were illegal.</v>

3995
01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.480
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't be dealing with criminals,</v>

3996
01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:03.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3997
01:49:03.961 --> 01:49:08.961
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather buy drugs from accompany a pharmaceutical company then from a gang in</v>

3998
01:49:09.001 --> 01:49:10.020
<v Speaker 3>south central La.</v>

3999
01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:10.351
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4000
01:49:10.351 --> 01:49:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I think they're,</v>

4001
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:15.120
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be more concerned about the brand and the and the purity of</v>

4002
01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:17.910
<v Speaker 3>their products than the crips or the bloods or wherever.</v>

4003
01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:18.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4004
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:19.010
<v Speaker 3>you have to go to,</v>

4005
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:20.820
<v Speaker 3>to buy your heroin down here.</v>

4006
01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:21.810
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4007
01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:22.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4008
01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I and I and what I,</v>

4009
01:49:23.521 --> 01:49:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Johnson and Johnson,</v>

4010
01:49:24.481 --> 01:49:25.590
<v Speaker 3>we have the best heroin.</v>

4011
01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:25.741
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4012
01:49:25.741 --> 01:49:26.320
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

4013
01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.153
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

4014
01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.380
<v Speaker 3>Whatever I don't want.</v>

4015
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Look nobody,</v>

4016
01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:29.400
<v Speaker 3>nobody.</v>

4017
01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:30.031
<v Speaker 3>People here,</v>

4018
01:49:30.031 --> 01:49:30.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4019
01:49:30.211 --> 01:49:31.320
<v Speaker 3>you get your car ripped off,</v>

4020
01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:33.750
<v Speaker 3>someone steals your radio or they break into your house.</v>

4021
01:49:33.751 --> 01:49:33.931
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

4022
01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:35.760
<v Speaker 3>Because they need money to buy illegal drugs.</v>

4023
01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:36.930
<v Speaker 3>If drugs were free,</v>

4024
01:49:36.931 --> 01:49:38.100
<v Speaker 3>there'd be a lot less expensive.</v>

4025
01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.700
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't have to steal to buy it.</v>

4026
01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:39.901
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4027
01:49:39.901 --> 01:49:40.510
<v Speaker 3>You can buy it,</v>

4028
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

4029
01:49:40.890 --> 01:49:43.290
<v Speaker 3>So now you have all kinds of victims,</v>

4030
01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:44.010
<v Speaker 3>meaning drugs.</v>

4031
01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:46.720
<v Speaker 3>When you say free meaning legal drugs,</v>

4032
01:49:46.850 --> 01:49:47.950
<v Speaker 3>if drugs were legal,</v>

4033
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.570
<v Speaker 2>they would be a lot less expensive.</v>

4034
01:49:49.710 --> 01:49:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4035
01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:53.830
<v Speaker 2>And so drug addicts wouldn't have to commit crimes to support their habit.</v>

4036
01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:54.011
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4037
01:49:54.011 --> 01:49:54.740
<v Speaker 2>this is subsided</v>

4038
01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:55.610
<v Speaker 1>by the prohibition,</v>

4039
01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:55.911
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4040
01:49:55.911 --> 01:49:59.660
<v Speaker 1>It's very obvious that the prohibition propped up sorts of illegal activities</v>

4041
01:49:59.661 --> 01:50:00.650
<v Speaker 1>that Al Capone,</v>

4042
01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:01.631
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

4043
01:50:01.631 --> 01:50:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's where it started,</v>

4044
01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

4045
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:04.203
<v Speaker 2>But you've got.</v>

4046
01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

4047
01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:06.030
<v Speaker 2>if you know the,</v>

4048
01:50:06.090 --> 01:50:06.281
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4049
01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:10.930
<v Speaker 2>the people who would be most against legalizing drugs is organized crime because</v>

4050
01:50:10.931 --> 01:50:12.310
<v Speaker 2>that takes away all their money.</v>

4051
01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:12.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4052
01:50:12.491 --> 01:50:13.750
<v Speaker 1>here's their argument against that.</v>

4053
01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the situation in Florida where Florida for the longest time didn't</v>

4054
01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:18.790
<v Speaker 1>have a database?</v>

4055
01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:23.080
<v Speaker 1>They had these things called pain management centers where people would go in</v>

4056
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:24.093
<v Speaker 1>and they would say,</v>

4057
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.521
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4058
01:50:24.521 --> 01:50:25.240
<v Speaker 1>my head hurts.</v>

4059
01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:25.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4060
01:50:25.371 --> 01:50:25.781
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4061
01:50:25.781 --> 01:50:26.740
<v Speaker 1>We'll go right next door.</v>

4062
01:50:26.741 --> 01:50:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll write you up some oxycontin.</v>

4063
01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 1>And they would go to in the same facility,</v>

4064
01:50:29.861 --> 01:50:33.400
<v Speaker 1>they'd go to a doctor and then to the pharmacist that only prescribed pain</v>

4065
01:50:33.401 --> 01:50:33.850
<v Speaker 1>pills.</v>

4066
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:34.601
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

4067
01:50:34.601 --> 01:50:37.750
<v Speaker 1>they have this massive amount of people that are addicted to Oxycontin is in</v>

4068
01:50:37.751 --> 01:50:38.141
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

4069
01:50:38.141 --> 01:50:38.660
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

4070
01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:42.580
<v Speaker 1>there's an area of Florida leading up to the northern states that's called the</v>

4071
01:50:42.581 --> 01:50:43.870
<v Speaker 1>oxycontin express.</v>

4072
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Vanguard actually did a show in it called the oxycontin express and we had them</v>

4073
01:50:47.741 --> 01:50:49.540
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast and talked about it and it's,</v>

4074
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:54.750
<v Speaker 1>there's 90 percent of all oxycontin in the country is prescribed in Florida.</v>

4075
01:50:56.170 --> 01:50:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4076
01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:57.580
<v Speaker 1>and why is that?</v>

4077
01:50:57.610 --> 01:50:58.750
<v Speaker 1>It's because of deregulation.</v>

4078
01:50:58.751 --> 01:51:02.200
<v Speaker 1>It's because of a lack of regulation is because they weren't forced to have a</v>

4079
01:51:02.201 --> 01:51:06.340
<v Speaker 1>database where they made sure that people weren't doing something unethical and</v>

4080
01:51:06.341 --> 01:51:08.590
<v Speaker 1>just prescribing pain pills all willy nilly.</v>

4081
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:10.240
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of goes against your theory.</v>

4082
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4083
01:51:10.881 --> 01:51:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it goes against.</v>

4084
01:51:12.001 --> 01:51:12.360
<v Speaker 2>So I got,</v>

4085
01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:15.140
<v Speaker 2>I am not really familiar with it because I'm hearing about it for the first time</v>

4086
01:51:15.141 --> 01:51:15.561
<v Speaker 2>from you.</v>

4087
01:51:15.561 --> 01:51:16.071
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>

4088
01:51:16.071 --> 01:51:19.100
<v Speaker 2>but I know it's not that there was no regulation down there because obviously</v>

4089
01:51:19.101 --> 01:51:19.970
<v Speaker 2>these are doctors.</v>

4090
01:51:19.971 --> 01:51:21.200
<v Speaker 2>If they're writing prescriptions,</v>

4091
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:21.621
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4092
01:51:21.621 --> 01:51:22.840
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot of regulation,</v>

4093
01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4094
01:51:23.250 --> 01:51:24.950
<v Speaker 2>involved in that process.</v>

4095
01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.740
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not familiar with it to really comment on it.</v>

4096
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4097
01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:28.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4098
01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:30.890
<v Speaker 1>well then then that's unfair to try to bring it up to you,</v>

4099
01:51:30.891 --> 01:51:31.180
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

4100
01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:35.000
<v Speaker 1>that is a huge issue and it's an issue in Florida because Florida is such a</v>

4101
01:51:35.010 --> 01:51:35.600
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

4102
01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:38.550
<v Speaker 2>But I do believe that the war on drugs is destroyed.</v>

4103
01:51:38.551 --> 01:51:39.301
<v Speaker 2>Our inner cities.</v>

4104
01:51:39.301 --> 01:51:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It's corrupted police forces.</v>

4105
01:51:41.071 --> 01:51:43.290
<v Speaker 2>It's screwed up a police,</v>

4106
01:51:43.291 --> 01:51:43.381
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4107
01:51:43.381 --> 01:51:47.250
<v Speaker 2>south of the border and now you have a situation to where your inner city kid</v>

4108
01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:51.000
<v Speaker 2>and you know you've got minimum wage laws and you've got occupational licensing</v>

4109
01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:54.930
<v Speaker 2>laws that make it almost impossible for young kid to get a legitimate job yet</v>

4110
01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.920
<v Speaker 2>you've got the gang bangers flashing around,</v>

4111
01:51:56.921 --> 01:51:57.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4112
01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:57.990
<v Speaker 2>a wad of cash.</v>

4113
01:51:58.110 --> 01:51:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4114
01:51:58.530 --> 01:51:59.370
<v Speaker 2>just deal drugs.</v>

4115
01:51:59.371 --> 01:52:00.204
<v Speaker 2>You can make a lot of money.</v>

4116
01:52:00.650 --> 01:52:05.120
<v Speaker 1>You think that minimum wage and the difficulty in getting licensed for certain</v>

4117
01:52:05.121 --> 01:52:07.100
<v Speaker 1>positions are what's keeping people down?</v>

4118
01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

4119
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:08.511
<v Speaker 1>minimum wages.</v>

4120
01:52:08.511 --> 01:52:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Keeping people down.</v>

4121
01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

4122
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:10.360
<v Speaker 1>How has that,</v>

4123
01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:10.990
<v Speaker 1>how has that?</v>

4124
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.141
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4125
01:52:11.141 --> 01:52:11.974
<v Speaker 2>because remember,</v>

4126
01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:12.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4127
01:52:12.970 --> 01:52:13.571
<v Speaker 2>when you're young,</v>

4128
01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:14.470
<v Speaker 2>when you're a teenager,</v>

4129
01:52:14.530 --> 01:52:14.741
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4130
01:52:14.741 --> 01:52:15.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a lot of skills.</v>

4131
01:52:15.731 --> 01:52:15.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4132
01:52:15.881 --> 01:52:16.360
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>

4133
01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.040
<v Speaker 2>you might've never had been had a job.</v>

4134
01:52:18.041 --> 01:52:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4135
01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:21.970
<v Speaker 2>and what's more important in getting a job is not necessarily the paycheck.</v>

4136
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:22.930
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of secondary.</v>

4137
01:52:22.931 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 2>It's what you learn on the job.</v>

4138
01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:25.981
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

4139
01:52:25.981 --> 01:52:28.000
<v Speaker 2>when I had my first jobs and I was working on me,</v>

4140
01:52:28.210 --> 01:52:28.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4141
01:52:28.391 --> 01:52:31.840
<v Speaker 2>you're living at home talking about outside of high school or in high school,</v>

4142
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:34.680
<v Speaker 2>the all that's important is the money's the only thing that's.</v>

4143
01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:34.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4144
01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:35.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4145
01:52:35.070 --> 01:52:35.320
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4146
01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean when we,</v>

4147
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:37.631
<v Speaker 2>when you are,</v>

4148
01:52:37.631 --> 01:52:37.841
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4149
01:52:37.841 --> 01:52:38.710
<v Speaker 2>you want the money,</v>

4150
01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:38.921
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4151
01:52:38.921 --> 01:52:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Because you want money for,</v>

4152
01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.820
<v Speaker 2>to take a girl out on a date or maybe you need gas money,</v>

4153
01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:43.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4154
01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:44.260
<v Speaker 2>But you don't need rent money.</v>

4155
01:52:44.261 --> 01:52:45.050
<v Speaker 2>You're living at home.</v>

4156
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't need food.</v>

4157
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

4158
01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:48.020
<v Speaker 2>your overhead is taking care of.</v>

4159
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:53.290
<v Speaker 2>The real benefit is acquiring skills on the job training that will enable you to</v>

4160
01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:58.480
<v Speaker 2>earn more money as you get older and take on more responsibility in these</v>

4161
01:52:58.481 --> 01:52:58.911
<v Speaker 2>skills.</v>

4162
01:52:58.911 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 2>When you're working at a burger joint,</v>

4163
01:53:00.771 --> 01:53:01.160
<v Speaker 2>what am I.</v>

4164
01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:02.180
<v Speaker 2>What skills am I getting?</v>

4165
01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Working at Newport creamery,</v>

4166
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.343
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot like.</v>

4167
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example of gas stations because gas stations are good example.</v>

4168
01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:10.670
<v Speaker 2>I worked at a gas station because at one point in time there were a lot of jobs</v>

4169
01:53:10.671 --> 01:53:12.690
<v Speaker 2>for young kids at gas stations and,</v>

4170
01:53:12.850 --> 01:53:13.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4171
01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:13.561
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4172
01:53:13.561 --> 01:53:14.990
<v Speaker 2>and they work mainly for tips.</v>

4173
01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:15.191
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4174
01:53:15.191 --> 01:53:15.311
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4175
01:53:15.311 --> 01:53:16.250
<v Speaker 2>they would pump gas,</v>

4176
01:53:16.251 --> 01:53:17.810
<v Speaker 2>they would check the air in the tires,</v>

4177
01:53:17.811 --> 01:53:20.300
<v Speaker 2>they'd wash your windows and they didn't make very much,</v>

4178
01:53:20.301 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 2>but between Philips and these were the pump jockeys,</v>

4179
01:53:22.701 --> 01:53:23.630
<v Speaker 2>right between Phillips,</v>

4180
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:27.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe they worked with a mechanic and they helped out to mechanics and you know,</v>

4181
01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:30.670
<v Speaker 2>a lot of auto mechanics got their start as a,</v>

4182
01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:31.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4183
01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:32.970
<v Speaker 2>pumped jockeys and you know,</v>

4184
01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:33.320
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

4185
01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:33.831
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>

4186
01:53:33.831 --> 01:53:34.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4187
01:53:34.011 --> 01:53:36.740
<v Speaker 2>they were able to become a mechanic and they can earn more money as some of them</v>

4188
01:53:36.741 --> 01:53:39.120
<v Speaker 2>may be eventually opened up their own gas station and you know,</v>

4189
01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:40.640
<v Speaker 2>became entrepreneurs and had a few,</v>

4190
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:41.870
<v Speaker 2>but they got started,</v>

4191
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:42.381
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4192
01:53:42.381 --> 01:53:42.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4193
01:53:42.741 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 2>at an entry level position.</v>

4194
01:53:44.210 --> 01:53:44.811
<v Speaker 2>Now of course,</v>

4195
01:53:44.811 --> 01:53:45.650
<v Speaker 2>the minimum wage law,</v>

4196
01:53:46.150 --> 01:53:47.270
<v Speaker 2>it's all self serve.</v>

4197
01:53:47.271 --> 01:53:47.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4198
01:53:47.451 --> 01:53:48.350
<v Speaker 2>you go to a gas station,</v>

4199
01:53:48.351 --> 01:53:49.161
<v Speaker 2>there's no human beings there.</v>

4200
01:53:49.161 --> 01:53:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's one guy that's in a little booth that's Kinda overseeing,</v>

4201
01:53:52.101 --> 01:53:52.581
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4202
01:53:52.581 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 2>if you want to check your air in your tire,</v>

4203
01:53:54.021 --> 01:53:54.621
<v Speaker 2>you do yourself,</v>

4204
01:53:54.621 --> 01:53:55.431
<v Speaker 2>you want to wash your windows,</v>

4205
01:53:55.431 --> 01:53:56.300
<v Speaker 2>you wash your own windows.</v>

4206
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:58.820
<v Speaker 2>All those jobs had been eliminated by the minimum wage,</v>

4207
01:53:59.030 --> 01:54:02.720
<v Speaker 2>but so as the opportunities that came with them and now if you want to get a</v>

4208
01:54:02.721 --> 01:54:04.490
<v Speaker 2>mechanic where you got to go to vocational school,</v>

4209
01:54:04.491 --> 01:54:05.271
<v Speaker 2>you got to pay money,</v>

4210
01:54:05.271 --> 01:54:06.200
<v Speaker 2>you got to go into debt,</v>

4211
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:06.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4212
01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:08.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can learn to be a mechanic,</v>

4213
01:54:08.271 --> 01:54:09.080
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4214
01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:13.640
<v Speaker 2>on the job training was how young people use to acquire skills in and now we've</v>

4215
01:54:13.641 --> 01:54:15.380
<v Speaker 2>got all those guys going to college.</v>

4216
01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:16.700
<v Speaker 2>They get a philosophy degree.</v>

4217
01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:17.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4218
01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:18.140
<v Speaker 2>they spend six years,</v>

4219
01:54:18.141 --> 01:54:18.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4220
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:18.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4221
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:20.330
<v Speaker 2>barfing at frat parties,</v>

4222
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.010
<v Speaker 2>but they graduate with a huge debt.</v>

4223
01:54:22.011 --> 01:54:22.844
<v Speaker 2>They know nothing.</v>

4224
01:54:23.150 --> 01:54:23.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4225
01:54:23.391 --> 01:54:25.250
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them would have been better off getting a,</v>

4226
01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.800
<v Speaker 2>getting a low paying job and learning how to do something.</v>

4227
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:29.510
<v Speaker 2>During this time of this,</v>

4228
01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:32.990
<v Speaker 2>when people did learn how to be a mechanic by becoming a pump jockey,</v>

4229
01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:34.370
<v Speaker 2>there was a minimum wage in effect.</v>

4230
01:54:34.770 --> 01:54:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4231
01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:38.690
<v Speaker 2>the minimum wage in America didn't start until 1938,</v>

4232
01:54:38.730 --> 01:54:40.400
<v Speaker 2>but I was at a gas station,</v>

4233
01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:40.701
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

4234
01:54:40.701 --> 01:54:42.350
<v Speaker 2>but let me minimum wage.</v>

4235
01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:47.620
<v Speaker 2>It started in 1938 and it only affected some certain federal workers.</v>

4236
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:48.910
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

4237
01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:50.930
<v Speaker 2>and it was 25,</v>

4238
01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:52.280
<v Speaker 2>twenty five cents an hour.</v>

4239
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:56.570
<v Speaker 2>It didn't apply to most workers until the mid 19 sixties.</v>

4240
01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.470
<v Speaker 2>So it was the war on poverty that really brought about the,</v>

4241
01:55:00.471 --> 01:55:00.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4242
01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:01.641
<v Speaker 2>the minimum wage.</v>

4243
01:55:01.641 --> 01:55:02.110
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4244
01:55:02.110 --> 01:55:02.380
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4245
01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:04.310
<v Speaker 2>and of course over time,</v>

4246
01:55:04.311 --> 01:55:08.030
<v Speaker 2>as the minimum wage got higher and higher during the sixties and seventies,</v>

4247
01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:10.430
<v Speaker 2>that's when it really began to take a bigger toll.</v>

4248
01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:10.691
<v Speaker 2>But at,</v>

4249
01:55:10.691 --> 01:55:13.160
<v Speaker 2>like if you look now at like black teenage unemployment,</v>

4250
01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:14.120
<v Speaker 2>which is off the charts,</v>

4251
01:55:14.121 --> 01:55:14.571
<v Speaker 2>which is what,</v>

4252
01:55:14.571 --> 01:55:14.950
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

4253
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:15.330
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>

4254
01:55:15.330 --> 01:55:16.790
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of much exactly what it is.</v>

4255
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:18.740
<v Speaker 2>But if you go back before the minimum wage,</v>

4256
01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:19.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4257
01:55:19.730 --> 01:55:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Black teenage unemployment was 15 percent,</v>

4258
01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.380
<v Speaker 2>it was actually lower than white teenage unemployment.</v>

4259
01:55:24.650 --> 01:55:25.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4260
01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:25.970
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4261
01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:26.330
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4262
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.531
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4263
01:55:26.531 --> 01:55:27.360
<v Speaker 2>and all this stuff,</v>

4264
01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.193
<v Speaker 2>you take it,</v>

4265
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.430
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4266
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:32.180
<v Speaker 2>you take the bottom rung off the job ladder and you just obliterate it,</v>

4267
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.500
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4268
01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:32.650
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4269
01:55:32.650 --> 01:55:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4270
01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:35.120
<v Speaker 2>you just make it impossible for young,</v>

4271
01:55:35.121 --> 01:55:37.040
<v Speaker 2>unskilled people to get a job.</v>

4272
01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:39.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just a minimum wage because that's the beginning,</v>

4273
01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:40.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4274
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Because if you employ somebody at the minimum wage,</v>

4275
01:55:41.961 --> 01:55:43.710
<v Speaker 2>you still got to pay payroll taxes,</v>

4276
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:45.390
<v Speaker 2>you gotta pay unemployment taxes,</v>

4277
01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 2>you've got other mandated costs,</v>

4278
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:50.640
<v Speaker 2>legal costs that increase the cost of hiring.</v>

4279
01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:52.680
<v Speaker 2>So maybe even though the minimum wage is seven,</v>

4280
01:55:52.690 --> 01:55:53.580
<v Speaker 2>25 an hour,</v>

4281
01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:56.220
<v Speaker 2>it may be a cost you 10 bucks to hire the guy an hour,</v>

4282
01:55:56.221 --> 01:55:57.290
<v Speaker 2>even though you only give them seven.</v>

4283
01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five is cost you 10 bucks.</v>

4284
01:55:59.640 --> 01:55:59.970
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

4285
01:55:59.970 --> 01:56:02.220
<v Speaker 2>what if their productivity is only worth $6?</v>

4286
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:03.001
<v Speaker 2>You can't hire him.</v>

4287
01:56:03.001 --> 01:56:03.834
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

4288
01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:05.520
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to hire him to lose money.</v>

4289
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:06.750
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to train somebody.</v>

4290
01:56:06.751 --> 01:56:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4291
01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:07.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4292
01:56:07.501 --> 01:56:08.400
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people,</v>

4293
01:56:08.401 --> 01:56:09.270
<v Speaker 2>these success stories,</v>

4294
01:56:09.271 --> 01:56:09.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4295
01:56:09.421 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 2>people go from the mail room to the board room,</v>

4296
01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:11.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4297
01:56:11.581 --> 01:56:12.480
<v Speaker 2>it's harder to start,</v>

4298
01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:12.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4299
01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.950
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom because it's hard to get your foot on the bottom right because you</v>

4300
01:56:15.951 --> 01:56:16.001
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

4301
01:56:16.001 --> 01:56:20.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to be at a much higher level and it disproportionately impacts poor</v>

4302
01:56:20.641 --> 01:56:21.300
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

4303
01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Inner City kids,</v>

4304
01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:23.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4305
01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:23.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4306
01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:24.131
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4307
01:56:24.131 --> 01:56:28.020
<v Speaker 2>and it favors these minimum wage laws will favor skilled workers over unskilled</v>

4308
01:56:28.021 --> 01:56:29.760
<v Speaker 2>workers because if I have to pay a certain wage,</v>

4309
01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:31.980
<v Speaker 2>well then maybe I'll hire somebody that has more skill.</v>

4310
01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:32.641
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

4311
01:56:32.641 --> 01:56:33.750
<v Speaker 2>it was the skilled workers,</v>

4312
01:56:33.751 --> 01:56:36.300
<v Speaker 2>the labor unions that lobbied for the minimum wage,</v>

4313
01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:39.720
<v Speaker 2>not because it benefited them because they made much more than minimum wage.</v>

4314
01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:43.470
<v Speaker 2>What they wanted to do is make it expensive to hire unskilled labor.</v>

4315
01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:45.120
<v Speaker 2>So you wouldn't hire the unskilled labor,</v>

4316
01:56:45.121 --> 01:56:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you would just hire the union labor.</v>

4317
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:47.711
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

4318
01:56:47.711 --> 01:56:51.160
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying essentially is that minimum wages is more government</v>

4319
01:56:51.161 --> 01:56:56.161
<v Speaker 1>intrusion and the more freedom that you have the government take away from you,</v>

4320
01:56:56.530 --> 01:56:58.660
<v Speaker 1>whether it's minimum wage freedom,</v>

4321
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:59.703
<v Speaker 1>whether it's tax free,</v>

4322
01:56:59.710 --> 01:57:01.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is the worst is going to be,</v>

4323
01:57:01.901 --> 01:57:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have more regulations,</v>

4324
01:57:03.131 --> 01:57:04.300
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have more people involved,</v>

4325
01:57:04.301 --> 01:57:04.991
<v Speaker 1>more red tape,</v>

4326
01:57:04.991 --> 01:57:05.650
<v Speaker 1>more bullshit,</v>

4327
01:57:05.650 --> 01:57:06.483
<v Speaker 1>more waste.</v>

4328
01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4329
01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I should have a right to work,</v>

4330
01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:10.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4331
01:57:10.090 --> 01:57:11.280
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

4332
01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:12.920
<v Speaker 2>if I want to write it,</v>

4333
01:57:12.921 --> 01:57:13.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4334
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:13.690
<v Speaker 2>and look,</v>

4335
01:57:13.690 --> 01:57:13.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4336
01:57:13.901 --> 01:57:14.681
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing,</v>

4337
01:57:14.681 --> 01:57:16.360
<v Speaker 2>look at all these lawsuits now,</v>

4338
01:57:16.361 --> 01:57:18.550
<v Speaker 2>the internships in the entertainment industry,</v>

4339
01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:18.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4340
01:57:18.821 --> 01:57:20.200
<v Speaker 2>this has the perverse effect of it.</v>

4341
01:57:20.201 --> 01:57:24.190
<v Speaker 2>So the government made it illegal to pay somebody below the minimum wage,</v>

4342
01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.990
<v Speaker 2>but it was okay if they worked for free.</v>

4343
01:57:26.250 --> 01:57:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4344
01:57:26.590 --> 01:57:29.680
<v Speaker 2>So now you have all these interns who probably would have been paid something if</v>

4345
01:57:29.681 --> 01:57:30.730
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't for the minimum wage,</v>

4346
01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.710
<v Speaker 2>but since it was illegal to pay them something,</v>

4347
01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.120
<v Speaker 2>they ended up working for nothing.</v>

4348
01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:34.871
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

4349
01:57:34.871 --> 01:57:36.910
<v Speaker 2>now they're suing and they're winning lawsuits say,</v>

4350
01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:37.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4351
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:38.260
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay me.</v>

4352
01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.120
<v Speaker 2>So now they're going to destroy the internships.</v>

4353
01:57:40.121 --> 01:57:43.030
<v Speaker 2>And now a lot of these companies that used to have internships aren't going to</v>

4354
01:57:43.031 --> 01:57:43.610
<v Speaker 2>have them anyway.</v>

4355
01:57:43.610 --> 01:57:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't the interns get college credit?</v>

4356
01:57:45.130 --> 01:57:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that the whole idea behind it.</v>

4357
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Some of them do,</v>

4358
01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:47.971
<v Speaker 2>but then.</v>

4359
01:57:47.971 --> 01:57:51.030
<v Speaker 2>But then that was even worse because what would happen sometimes in order to</v>

4360
01:57:51.031 --> 01:57:54.450
<v Speaker 2>keep themselves safe because the employers didn't want to run a foul of the</v>

4361
01:57:54.451 --> 01:57:55.284
<v Speaker 2>employment law.</v>

4362
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 2>So they would only give you the internship if you got it through a college.</v>

4363
01:57:58.500 --> 01:57:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4364
01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:01.840
<v Speaker 2>So now what would happen is you'd actually have to pay to be an intern because</v>

4365
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:05.490
<v Speaker 2>you'd go and pay tuition to a college just so you can go and work for free.</v>

4366
01:58:05.850 --> 01:58:06.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4367
01:58:06.061 --> 01:58:09.330
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be better not to pay the tuition and go into debt and just work for</v>

4368
01:58:09.331 --> 01:58:11.490
<v Speaker 2>a low wage than to pay to work for no wage.</v>

4369
01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:11.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4370
01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:15.240
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens when you have all these government regulations.</v>

4371
01:58:15.241 --> 01:58:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is worse off.</v>

4372
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:18.180
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

4373
01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:18.541
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4374
01:58:18.541 --> 01:58:19.201
<v Speaker 2>people think,</v>

4375
01:58:19.201 --> 01:58:21.690
<v Speaker 2>oh these young people are being exploited.</v>

4376
01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:21.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4377
01:58:21.841 --> 01:58:22.674
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

4378
01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not exploitation in.</v>

4379
01:58:23.941 --> 01:58:27.840
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times it's the best thing that can happen to them is they get a job and</v>

4380
01:58:27.841 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4381
01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:28.651
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

4382
01:58:28.651 --> 01:58:28.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4383
01:58:28.861 --> 01:58:29.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4384
01:58:29.041 --> 01:58:31.020
<v Speaker 2>you can't raise a family on the minimum wage.</v>

4385
01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:31.711
<v Speaker 2>Of course not.</v>

4386
01:58:31.711 --> 01:58:32.850
<v Speaker 2>And you shouldn't even try.</v>

4387
01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4388
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.730
<v Speaker 2>if all you can do is flip burgers,</v>

4389
01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:37.200
<v Speaker 2>why are you starting a family?</v>

4390
01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4391
01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:38.110
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

4392
01:58:38.110 --> 01:58:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4393
01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:38.950
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4394
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:39.120
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4395
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.980
<v Speaker 2>you got to develop your skills.</v>

4396
01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 2>You got to be able</v>

4397
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.760
<v Speaker 3>to earn more money than that before you take on those extra responsibilities.</v>

4398
01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:46.691
<v Speaker 3>But if you say,</v>

4399
01:58:46.691 --> 01:58:46.930
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4400
01:58:46.930 --> 01:58:50.380
<v Speaker 3>every wage has to be a wage that could let you know,</v>

4401
01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:51.310
<v Speaker 3>support a family,</v>

4402
01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.110
<v Speaker 3>then there are no entry level jobs.</v>

4403
01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Well then how do you enter the labor market if there's no entry level position,</v>

4404
01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4405
01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:57.131
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4406
01:58:57.131 --> 01:58:59.140
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a situation like a fast food Gig,</v>

4407
01:58:59.200 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4408
01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 3>where does that lead to the manager?</v>

4409
01:59:01.570 --> 01:59:01.811
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4410
01:59:01.811 --> 01:59:01.991
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

4411
01:59:01.991 --> 01:59:02.181
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

4412
01:59:02.181 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

4413
01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:02.890
<v Speaker 3>how do you know,</v>

4414
01:59:02.890 --> 01:59:04.490
<v Speaker 3>rise through the ranks at a fast food.</v>

4415
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Some people write,</v>

4416
01:59:05.801 --> 01:59:07.000
<v Speaker 3>some people start out,</v>

4417
01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:07.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4418
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:08.031
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4419
01:59:08.031 --> 01:59:08.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4420
01:59:08.261 --> 01:59:10.100
<v Speaker 3>cooking French fries or mopping up and,</v>

4421
01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:12.580
<v Speaker 3>and go onto b if own a franchise.</v>

4422
01:59:12.581 --> 01:59:12.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4423
01:59:12.731 --> 01:59:15.130
<v Speaker 3>so you can certainly move up and there are people,</v>

4424
01:59:15.370 --> 01:59:15.581
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4425
01:59:15.581 --> 01:59:17.090
<v Speaker 3>I think the guy who's about to be this,</v>

4426
01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.550
<v Speaker 3>the new CEO of Walmart,</v>

4427
01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:22.450
<v Speaker 3>his first job was working on a loading dock and what are the distribution</v>

4428
01:59:22.451 --> 01:59:24.160
<v Speaker 3>centers and now he's the be as CEO.</v>

4429
01:59:24.250 --> 01:59:25.870
<v Speaker 3>He worked his way up to the very top of the call.</v>

4430
01:59:25.871 --> 01:59:26.704
<v Speaker 3>You went to college.</v>

4431
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4432
01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:28.001
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's not,</v>

4433
01:59:28.001 --> 01:59:30.190
<v Speaker 3>but that's how he got his foot in the door and I probably,</v>

4434
01:59:30.191 --> 01:59:30.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4435
01:59:30.371 --> 01:59:30.880
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4436
01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.431
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

4437
01:59:31.431 --> 01:59:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean they wouldn't have hired him to run the company and let's,</v>

4438
01:59:33.650 --> 01:59:34.460
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

4439
01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:35.560
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>

4440
01:59:35.561 --> 01:59:36.130
<v Speaker 3>but maybe,</v>

4441
01:59:36.130 --> 01:59:36.490
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

4442
01:59:36.490 --> 01:59:37.830
<v Speaker 3>maybe the fact that he worked there,</v>

4443
01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:38.080
<v Speaker 3>gave,</v>

4444
01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:41.080
<v Speaker 3>maybe that gave him a leg up to making sure that definitely had an impact.</v>

4445
01:59:41.110 --> 01:59:43.570
<v Speaker 3>But if you take a look at something that works at Mcdonald's,</v>

4446
01:59:43.810 --> 01:59:47.230
<v Speaker 3>you don't necessarily have to work up the chain of Mcdonald's.</v>

4447
01:59:47.710 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald's could be your first job.</v>

4448
01:59:49.121 --> 01:59:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

4449
01:59:49.330 --> 01:59:50.470
<v Speaker 3>what were my first jobs?</v>

4450
01:59:50.471 --> 01:59:51.730
<v Speaker 3>I delivered groceries.</v>

4451
01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:53.350
<v Speaker 3>I bagged groceries.</v>

4452
01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:53.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4453
01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:54.311
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4454
01:59:54.311 --> 01:59:54.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4455
01:59:54.850 --> 01:59:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I sold a clothing retail in the mall.</v>

4456
01:59:57.701 --> 01:59:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I sold shoes.</v>

4457
01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:00.190
<v Speaker 3>I sold cable door to door.</v>

4458
02:00:00.330 --> 02:00:00.701
<v Speaker 3>And they say,</v>

4459
02:00:00.701 --> 02:00:00.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4460
02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4461
02:00:01.061 --> 02:00:02.540
<v Speaker 3>did I move up in the know,</v>

4462
02:00:02.650 --> 02:00:03.100
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

4463
02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:05.410
<v Speaker 3>I ended up getting other jobs where,</v>

4464
02:00:05.411 --> 02:00:05.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4465
02:00:05.770 --> 02:00:07.360
<v Speaker 3>the sales skills were important,</v>

4466
02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:07.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4467
02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:08.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4468
02:00:08.051 --> 02:00:08.800
<v Speaker 3>you get you just,</v>

4469
02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:12.550
<v Speaker 3>even when I got my first job at a supermarket and a lot of times I was just</v>

4470
02:00:12.551 --> 02:00:13.750
<v Speaker 3>mopping up the floors.</v>

4471
02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:16.180
<v Speaker 3>I was bagging the groceries and I would deliver the groceries.</v>

4472
02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:18.130
<v Speaker 3>But you just learn to show up at time,</v>

4473
02:00:18.370 --> 02:00:18.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4474
02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.320
<v Speaker 3>and now you have something that you've done.</v>

4475
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4476
02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:21.191
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it.</v>

4477
02:00:21.191 --> 02:00:23.800
<v Speaker 3>So you get a job at Mcdonald's and then you get a job someplace else.</v>

4478
02:00:23.801 --> 02:00:24.700
<v Speaker 3>That's better because,</v>

4479
02:00:24.701 --> 02:00:24.781
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4480
02:00:24.781 --> 02:00:25.930
<v Speaker 3>what did you do before you were here?</v>

4481
02:00:25.931 --> 02:00:26.081
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4482
02:00:26.081 --> 02:00:26.914
<v Speaker 3>I worked at Mcdonald's.</v>

4483
02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 3>How long were you there?</v>

4484
02:00:27.851 --> 02:00:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I was there for a couple of years.</v>

4485
02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:29.021
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

4486
02:00:29.021 --> 02:00:29.890
<v Speaker 3>I still have the job.</v>

4487
02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:31.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh well that means at least you didn't get fired.</v>

4488
02:00:32.050 --> 02:00:32.650
<v Speaker 3>You have the job.</v>

4489
02:00:32.650 --> 02:00:33.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4490
02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:33.910
<v Speaker 3>you've got something.</v>

4491
02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:35.500
<v Speaker 3>You've got to start somewhere.</v>

4492
02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Everybody starts somewhere and you can't expect to get paid a lot of money when</v>

4493
02:00:39.761 --> 02:00:41.200
<v Speaker 3>you first start out.</v>

4494
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.850
<v Speaker 3>You've got to make yourself more valuable because what you are when individuals,</v>

4495
02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.950
<v Speaker 3>we sell our labor to the highest bidder,</v>

4496
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:48.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4497
02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:52.630
<v Speaker 3>and so what you have to do is you've got to figure out how can I increase my</v>

4498
02:00:52.631 --> 02:00:56.770
<v Speaker 3>value to a potential employer so that he'll pay me more money but isn't the idea</v>

4499
02:00:56.771 --> 02:00:58.870
<v Speaker 3>of minimum wage just to keep it from being gross,</v>

4500
02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:00.940
<v Speaker 3>not make it so it is low.</v>

4501
02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:02.320
<v Speaker 3>$15 an hour is pretty low.</v>

4502
02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:06.450
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly difficult to make a living getting $15 an hour.</v>

4503
02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:09.700
<v Speaker 3>But I must say you don't have to make a living and feed yourself if,</v>

4504
02:01:09.710 --> 02:01:10.000
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

4505
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:10.600
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

4506
02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:14.830
<v Speaker 3>if they enforced a minimum wage of $15 an hour on like Mcdonald's,</v>

4507
02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:16.360
<v Speaker 3>there would be no human beings working there.</v>

4508
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:17.290
<v Speaker 3>It would all be automated.</v>

4509
02:01:17.410 --> 02:01:17.870
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't,</v>

4510
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:18.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4511
02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:18.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4512
02:01:18.611 --> 02:01:21.400
<v Speaker 3>there might be one guy there that made sure that the robots didn't,</v>

4513
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.721
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4514
02:01:21.721 --> 02:01:21.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4515
02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:22.753
<v Speaker 3>didn't break down,</v>

4516
02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:23.501
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4517
02:01:23.501 --> 02:01:25.890
<v Speaker 3>there'd be machines making a hamburger is make it a French fries.</v>

4518
02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't be like a gas station.</v>

4519
02:01:26.981 --> 02:01:27.641
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't that be good?</v>

4520
02:01:27.641 --> 02:01:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Just like we were talking about deregulation and the government forcing them to</v>

4521
02:01:30.281 --> 02:01:35.281
<v Speaker 3>get real jobs for the people that work in the fast food burger king and get them</v>

4522
02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:36.620
<v Speaker 3>out there,</v>

4523
02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:37.211
<v Speaker 3>but then they would.</v>

4524
02:01:37.211 --> 02:01:38.990
<v Speaker 3>What would they do then just go on welfare for them.</v>

4525
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:41.750
<v Speaker 3>Figure out a way to get a real job,</v>

4526
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:42.051
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

4527
02:01:42.051 --> 02:01:44.210
<v Speaker 3>but that is their entry to the job market.</v>

4528
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:45.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have no skills.</v>

4529
02:01:45.471 --> 02:01:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

4530
02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:46.131
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>

4531
02:01:46.131 --> 02:01:47.480
<v Speaker 3>if these people had better skills,</v>

4532
02:01:47.481 --> 02:01:48.710
<v Speaker 3>would they be working at Mcdonald's?</v>

4533
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.981
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

4534
02:01:48.981 --> 02:01:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Part of the problem is,</v>

4535
02:01:49.911 --> 02:01:50.480
<v Speaker 3>and this isn't,</v>

4536
02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:54.680
<v Speaker 3>you know that there are some people that really could be working better jobs,</v>

4537
02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:58.640
<v Speaker 3>but they're not because we have this phony economy that is preventing those</v>

4538
02:01:58.641 --> 02:01:59.870
<v Speaker 3>better jobs from being created.</v>

4539
02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:00.500
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>

4540
02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:01.221
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

4541
02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:04.670
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of people now that are working at Mcdonald's because that's all</v>

4542
02:02:04.671 --> 02:02:06.080
<v Speaker 3>they can get and you know,</v>

4543
02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:06.541
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>

4544
02:02:06.541 --> 02:02:07.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4545
02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:08.930
<v Speaker 3>at least they got that to fall back on.</v>

4546
02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:11.570
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is why aren't there better jobs?</v>

4547
02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't the jobs that would normally be there for you to work up right?</v>

4548
02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:16.610
<v Speaker 3>To the jobs that are higher up on the ladder,</v>

4549
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:17.660
<v Speaker 3>where are those jobs?</v>

4550
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:20.510
<v Speaker 3>And those jobs are being destroyed by the government because we need more</v>

4551
02:02:20.511 --> 02:02:21.200
<v Speaker 3>savings.</v>

4552
02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.550
<v Speaker 3>We need more capital investment.</v>

4553
02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:24.680
<v Speaker 3>We need higher interest rates for that to happen.</v>

4554
02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:29.060
<v Speaker 3>And the government is so busy inflating this bubble economy that they're sucking</v>

4555
02:02:29.061 --> 02:02:30.440
<v Speaker 3>all the air out of the real economy.</v>

4556
02:02:30.441 --> 02:02:34.250
<v Speaker 3>They're diverting resources from main street to Wall Street and they are</v>

4557
02:02:34.251 --> 02:02:36.290
<v Speaker 3>preventing these jobs from being created,</v>

4558
02:02:36.291 --> 02:02:36.611
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

4559
02:02:36.611 --> 02:02:38.510
<v Speaker 3>are destroying a lot of the jobs that exist.</v>

4560
02:02:38.630 --> 02:02:40.490
<v Speaker 3>So how would you fix that if you,</v>

4561
02:02:40.491 --> 02:02:41.090
<v Speaker 3>if um,</v>

4562
02:02:41.090 --> 02:02:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Obama and I say Peter Schiff,</v>

4563
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I heard you on the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

4564
02:02:44.481 --> 02:02:47.540
<v Speaker 3>You make a lot of sense as I got working for me.</v>

4565
02:02:47.541 --> 02:02:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Fucking suck.</v>

4566
02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Come over here man.</v>

4567
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Sit down.</v>

4568
02:02:49.890 --> 02:02:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Tell me what the fuck to do.</v>

4569
02:02:50.901 --> 02:02:51.651
<v Speaker 3>What can I do here?</v>

4570
02:02:51.651 --> 02:02:53.720
<v Speaker 3>How do we fix this mess other than resigning?</v>

4571
02:02:53.721 --> 02:02:54.554
<v Speaker 3>But I guess if he's,</v>

4572
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:57.590
<v Speaker 3>if he's actually going to list out a way to make friends,</v>

4573
02:02:57.591 --> 02:02:58.940
<v Speaker 3>but if he's actually going to listen to me,</v>

4574
02:02:58.941 --> 02:02:59.990
<v Speaker 3>that I don't want him to resign.</v>

4575
02:03:00.810 --> 02:03:02.900
<v Speaker 3>If he actually has that kind of epiphany.</v>

4576
02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:03.793
<v Speaker 3>Let's pretend,</v>

4577
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:04.280
<v Speaker 3>well 10,</v>

4578
02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's the president and you've got to convince him.</v>

4579
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4580
02:03:06.771 --> 02:03:08.590
<v Speaker 3>well then you got a.</v>

4581
02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:09.740
<v Speaker 3>What would you tell them to do?</v>

4582
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:10.640
<v Speaker 3>What would you tell him to do?</v>

4583
02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:11.720
<v Speaker 3>He's got to start,</v>

4584
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:12.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4585
02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.300
<v Speaker 3>repealing rules and regulations and,</v>

4586
02:03:14.490 --> 02:03:14.870
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4587
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:19.820
<v Speaker 3>and shrinking government and closing down agencies and departments and laying</v>

4588
02:03:19.821 --> 02:03:23.310
<v Speaker 3>off government workers and government workers.</v>

4589
02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:23.810
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

4590
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:24.643
<v Speaker 3>where do you start?</v>

4591
02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:25.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll start at the top.</v>

4592
02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:26.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4593
02:03:26.141 --> 02:03:28.220
<v Speaker 3>we've got fire the president.</v>

4594
02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:29.960
<v Speaker 3>You want to save the company?</v>

4595
02:03:30.230 --> 02:03:31.190
<v Speaker 3>You've got to go under yourself.</v>

4596
02:03:31.191 --> 02:03:31.641
<v Speaker 3>But I said,</v>

4597
02:03:31.641 --> 02:03:33.280
<v Speaker 3>get rid of all of the economic advisors.</v>

4598
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Look at the Department of Energy,</v>

4599
02:03:35.021 --> 02:03:36.150
<v Speaker 3>the Department of Agriculture,</v>

4600
02:03:36.151 --> 02:03:37.160
<v Speaker 3>the Department of Education,</v>

4601
02:03:37.161 --> 02:03:37.610
<v Speaker 3>assholes.</v>

4602
02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:38.443
<v Speaker 3>Every one of them.</v>

4603
02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:39.801
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are,</v>

4604
02:03:39.801 --> 02:03:40.291
<v Speaker 3>some of them are,</v>

4605
02:03:40.291 --> 02:03:42.260
<v Speaker 3>but we can't afford them and they're not helping.</v>

4606
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:43.730
<v Speaker 3>They're not making the country richer.</v>

4607
02:03:43.731 --> 02:03:44.660
<v Speaker 3>They're making it poor.</v>

4608
02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:46.490
<v Speaker 3>We didn't always have these departments.</v>

4609
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:49.580
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these departments weren't even created until the second half of the</v>

4610
02:03:49.581 --> 02:03:50.414
<v Speaker 3>20th century.</v>

4611
02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:53.180
<v Speaker 3>America made it without all those agencies and departments.</v>

4612
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:56.900
<v Speaker 3>We didn't even have the Department of energy came in in the late 19 seventies.</v>

4613
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4614
02:03:57.171 --> 02:03:57.921
<v Speaker 3>what do we need it for it?</v>

4615
02:03:57.921 --> 02:03:58.340
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

4616
02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:00.260
<v Speaker 3>when we first developed the Department of Energy,</v>

4617
02:04:00.590 --> 02:04:03.350
<v Speaker 3>it was because we imported like 30 percent of our oil.</v>

4618
02:04:03.351 --> 02:04:04.370
<v Speaker 3>We said this is too much.</v>

4619
02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:05.690
<v Speaker 3>We have to do something about it.</v>

4620
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:06.980
<v Speaker 3>So then we were report 40,</v>

4621
02:04:06.981 --> 02:04:07.880
<v Speaker 3>70 percent of our oil.</v>

4622
02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Department of Energy doesn't produce any energy.</v>

4623
02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:12.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just produces jobs for bureaucrats,</v>

4624
02:04:12.651 --> 02:04:15.680
<v Speaker 3>but there's all these agencies and departments that we can't afford.</v>

4625
02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:16.550
<v Speaker 3>We never needed them.</v>

4626
02:04:16.670 --> 02:04:19.400
<v Speaker 3>It was a way for politicians to buy votes and to peddle influence.</v>

4627
02:04:19.610 --> 02:04:20.510
<v Speaker 3>We got to get rid of it.</v>

4628
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:24.200
<v Speaker 3>But what we also have to do is get to the Federal Reserve because interest rates</v>

4629
02:04:24.201 --> 02:04:25.010
<v Speaker 3>have to go up.</v>

4630
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4631
02:04:25.131 --> 02:04:27.020
<v Speaker 3>let's say you can have zero percent interest rate.</v>

4632
02:04:27.021 --> 02:04:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Let's pretend we're taking care of this right now.</v>

4633
02:04:28.371 --> 02:04:29.480
<v Speaker 3>So Department of Energy,</v>

4634
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:30.350
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking useless.</v>

4635
02:04:30.351 --> 02:04:31.340
<v Speaker 3>They don't do anything for us.</v>

4636
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4637
02:04:31.491 --> 02:04:32.590
<v Speaker 3>they're the worst than useless.</v>

4638
02:04:32.630 --> 02:04:33.291
<v Speaker 3>They were useless.</v>

4639
02:04:33.291 --> 02:04:34.130
<v Speaker 3>That would be an improvement.</v>

4640
02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 3>So obviously the world has changed drastically since the time when</v>

4641
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.060
<v Speaker 2>we imported 50 percent and maybe the our needs are,</v>

4642
02:04:41.210 --> 02:04:42.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4643
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 2>greatly disproportionate to back then as well.</v>

4644
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:46.110
<v Speaker 2>That's why we need 70 percent.</v>

4645
02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:49.780
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying is there's no benefit in having the department for</v>

4646
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:50.623
<v Speaker 2>Education.</v>

4647
02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:53.660
<v Speaker 2>We would produce a lot more energy without the departments.</v>

4648
02:04:53.690 --> 02:04:56.670
<v Speaker 2>We'd have much better education without the department of Education and they do</v>

4649
02:04:56.671 --> 02:04:57.500
<v Speaker 2>read the department.</v>

4650
02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:58.720
<v Speaker 2>What are they getting away?</v>

4651
02:04:58.920 --> 02:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>

4652
02:04:59.490 --> 02:04:59.611
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4653
02:04:59.611 --> 02:04:59.971
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4654
02:04:59.971 --> 02:05:01.140
<v Speaker 2>we have to pay their salaries.</v>

4655
02:05:01.170 --> 02:05:01.351
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4656
02:05:01.351 --> 02:05:01.621
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4657
02:05:01.621 --> 02:05:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Pay The expensive.</v>

4658
02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:05.970
<v Speaker 2>It's expensive to support all these bureaucrats.</v>

4659
02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:07.320
<v Speaker 2>And then once they have a job,</v>

4660
02:05:07.321 --> 02:05:08.730
<v Speaker 2>they got to figure out something to do.</v>

4661
02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:09.930
<v Speaker 2>They got to make up stuff.</v>

4662
02:05:09.931 --> 02:05:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how government works.</v>

4663
02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Government doesn't want to solve a problem because then there's no need for the</v>

4664
02:05:14.551 --> 02:05:15.150
<v Speaker 2>agency.</v>

4665
02:05:15.150 --> 02:05:16.770
<v Speaker 2>The minute you have a problem and you say,</v>

4666
02:05:16.771 --> 02:05:17.011
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4667
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:18.120
<v Speaker 2>let's have the government solve it,</v>

4668
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:21.030
<v Speaker 2>the last thing they want to do is solve it because then there's no reason to</v>

4669
02:05:21.031 --> 02:05:21.660
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

4670
02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 2>They want the problem to get bigger so they can demand more resources.</v>

4671
02:05:24.961 --> 02:05:25.930
<v Speaker 2>They can have more people.</v>

4672
02:05:25.931 --> 02:05:26.764
<v Speaker 2>A bigger department,</v>

4673
02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:31.020
<v Speaker 2>so it's like the opposite of a capitalism and it's not the survival of the</v>

4674
02:05:31.021 --> 02:05:31.411
<v Speaker 2>fittest.</v>

4675
02:05:31.411 --> 02:05:31.600
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4676
02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:31.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4677
02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:32.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4678
02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:32.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4679
02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:32.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4680
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:33.051
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4681
02:05:33.051 --> 02:05:34.260
<v Speaker 2>the worst you do your job,</v>

4682
02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:35.250
<v Speaker 2>the more you're rewarded,</v>

4683
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:35.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4684
02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:36.241
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4685
02:05:36.241 --> 02:05:39.240
<v Speaker 2>and so you don't want to have government doing all these things.</v>

4686
02:05:39.241 --> 02:05:40.500
<v Speaker 2>You want to let the market,</v>

4687
02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:43.170
<v Speaker 2>you want individuals that have a vested interest.</v>

4688
02:05:43.171 --> 02:05:44.460
<v Speaker 2>You want the profit incentive,</v>

4689
02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:45.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4690
02:05:45.090 --> 02:05:45.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4691
02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:46.470
<v Speaker 2>the invisible hand,</v>

4692
02:05:46.650 --> 02:05:48.150
<v Speaker 2>all the benefits of capitalism.</v>

4693
02:05:48.151 --> 02:05:50.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to get screwed up by government.</v>

4694
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:55.290
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that we have to understand is we can't have this phony service</v>

4695
02:05:55.291 --> 02:05:55.621
<v Speaker 2>sector,</v>

4696
02:05:55.621 --> 02:05:56.130
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

4697
02:05:56.130 --> 02:05:59.400
<v Speaker 2>We can't have everybody working in healthcare and education.</v>

4698
02:05:59.490 --> 02:06:01.200
<v Speaker 2>We can't send every kid to college.</v>

4699
02:06:01.201 --> 02:06:03.900
<v Speaker 2>This idea that everybody needs to go to college is nonsense.</v>

4700
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't need to go to college.</v>

4701
02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:06.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4702
02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.260
<v Speaker 2>at one point,</v>

4703
02:06:07.410 --> 02:06:07.711
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4704
02:06:07.711 --> 02:06:07.890
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

4705
02:06:07.890 --> 02:06:08.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4706
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.701
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

4707
02:06:08.701 --> 02:06:08.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4708
02:06:08.881 --> 02:06:10.080
<v Speaker 2>before the Second World War,</v>

4709
02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:11.560
<v Speaker 2>maybe I don't know what,</v>

4710
02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:13.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even one out of 10 people went to college.</v>

4711
02:06:14.230 --> 02:06:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4712
02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:17.910
<v Speaker 2>but if you went to college is because you want it to be a doctor or you want it</v>

4713
02:06:17.911 --> 02:06:19.470
<v Speaker 2>to be something that you really needed to go.</v>

4714
02:06:19.650 --> 02:06:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean now you have more people waiting on tending bar,</v>

4715
02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:23.761
<v Speaker 2>waiting tables,</v>

4716
02:06:23.761 --> 02:06:26.040
<v Speaker 2>driving cab with college degrees.</v>

4717
02:06:26.041 --> 02:06:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Some of them have advanced degrees.</v>

4718
02:06:27.450 --> 02:06:27.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4719
02:06:27.630 --> 02:06:28.470
<v Speaker 2>you want to get a laugh.</v>

4720
02:06:28.471 --> 02:06:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I did this video,</v>

4721
02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:30.333
<v Speaker 2>know if you saw it.</v>

4722
02:06:30.450 --> 02:06:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I was in New Orleans and I was working walking down Bourbon Street and I was</v>

4723
02:06:34.141 --> 02:06:36.810
<v Speaker 2>interviewing people and asking them,</v>

4724
02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:37.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4725
02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:41.160
<v Speaker 2>if they graduated from college and what their major was and when they graduated</v>

4726
02:06:41.161 --> 02:06:42.060
<v Speaker 2>and they all did and never.</v>

4727
02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Some of them had two or three degrees and they were all,</v>

4728
02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:44.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4729
02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:49.850
<v Speaker 2>bartenders are bouncers at strip clubs are pedicab drivers are screening the</v>

4730
02:06:50.070 --> 02:06:50.280
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

4731
02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had a college degree but nobody needed it.</v>

4732
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:55.400
<v Speaker 2>But they all had debt that they were working off.</v>

4733
02:06:55.401 --> 02:06:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4734
02:06:55.590 --> 02:06:59.580
<v Speaker 2>the idea that we have to send every kid to college regardless of their aptitude,</v>

4735
02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.060
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether or not you know,</v>

4736
02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.480
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have any real benefit who benefits from this?</v>

4737
02:07:03.481 --> 02:07:04.261
<v Speaker 2>It's the colleges,</v>

4738
02:07:04.261 --> 02:07:05.041
<v Speaker 2>the universities.</v>

4739
02:07:05.041 --> 02:07:09.000
<v Speaker 2>The administrators that make a fortune off of all this money and the kids</v>

4740
02:07:09.001 --> 02:07:11.820
<v Speaker 2>graduate with a worthless degree because everybody else has one.</v>

4741
02:07:11.821 --> 02:07:12.870
<v Speaker 2>So who cares?</v>

4742
02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:16.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anything but you've got all this debt and are the kids better off</v>

4743
02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:18.810
<v Speaker 2>spending the first six years of adulthood,</v>

4744
02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:19.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4745
02:07:19.650 --> 02:07:20.580
<v Speaker 2>in college,</v>

4746
02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:20.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4747
02:07:20.941 --> 02:07:21.200
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

4748
02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:21.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4749
02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:21.781
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them,</v>

4750
02:07:21.781 --> 02:07:24.510
<v Speaker 2>they move out of their parents' house because they can borrow all this money to</v>

4751
02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:27.090
<v Speaker 2>live off campus or Frat or live in the dorms.</v>

4752
02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.440
<v Speaker 2>But now they are 22,</v>

4753
02:07:28.441 --> 02:07:28.891
<v Speaker 2>23,</v>

4754
02:07:28.891 --> 02:07:29.790
<v Speaker 2>24 years old.</v>

4755
02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:31.500
<v Speaker 2>They have such a pile of debt,</v>

4756
02:07:31.501 --> 02:07:32.331
<v Speaker 2>they can never get out from it.</v>

4757
02:07:32.331 --> 02:07:33.600
<v Speaker 2>And now they're back home for good.</v>

4758
02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd rather have kids stay at home,</v>

4759
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4760
02:07:36.970 --> 02:07:37.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4761
02:07:37.271 --> 02:07:38.620
<v Speaker 4>after they graduate high school,</v>

4762
02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:39.910
<v Speaker 4>get a low paying job,</v>

4763
02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:41.140
<v Speaker 4>don't take on any debt,</v>

4764
02:07:41.290 --> 02:07:42.400
<v Speaker 4>maybe get some skills.</v>

4765
02:07:42.401 --> 02:07:43.930
<v Speaker 4>And then when they're 20 or 23,</v>

4766
02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:44.950
<v Speaker 4>then they can move out.</v>

4767
02:07:44.951 --> 02:07:46.030
<v Speaker 4>They can rent their own place,</v>

4768
02:07:46.031 --> 02:07:46.990
<v Speaker 4>they're self sufficient.</v>

4769
02:07:47.290 --> 02:07:47.891
<v Speaker 4>Instead they're,</v>

4770
02:07:47.891 --> 02:07:48.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4771
02:07:48.130 --> 02:07:48.660
<v Speaker 4>the now,</v>

4772
02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:48.850
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

4773
02:07:48.850 --> 02:07:49.570
<v Speaker 4>now they got no,</v>

4774
02:07:49.570 --> 02:07:50.890
<v Speaker 4>they got no options because they,</v>

4775
02:07:50.891 --> 02:07:51.130
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4776
02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:51.410
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4777
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:52.930
<v Speaker 4>they follow the government's advice.</v>

4778
02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:53.351
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4779
02:07:53.351 --> 02:07:57.430
<v Speaker 4>obviously some have options and obviously some people go to college to get jobs</v>

4780
02:07:57.431 --> 02:08:00.280
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know what the percentage is of people that have successful careers</v>

4781
02:08:00.281 --> 02:08:00.851
<v Speaker 4>after college,</v>

4782
02:08:00.851 --> 02:08:02.520
<v Speaker 4>but I assume it's,</v>

4783
02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:03.210
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

4784
02:08:03.210 --> 02:08:03.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4785
02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:03.761
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>

4786
02:08:03.761 --> 02:08:06.970
<v Speaker 4>we're not dealing with a nation of constantly advancing homeless people where</v>

4787
02:08:06.971 --> 02:08:09.910
<v Speaker 4>every year the homeless population goes up 3 million.</v>

4788
02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:13.550
<v Speaker 4>Most people on college campuses have.</v>

4789
02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:16.420
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason for them to be there and they will not benefit from,</v>

4790
02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:17.260
<v Speaker 4>from being there.</v>

4791
02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:17.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4792
02:08:17.450 --> 02:08:18.310
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot,</v>

4793
02:08:18.650 --> 02:08:21.940
<v Speaker 4>there's a growing process going on and I agree with you that if you look at the</v>

4794
02:08:21.941 --> 02:08:22.601
<v Speaker 4>end result,</v>

4795
02:08:22.601 --> 02:08:22.751
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4796
02:08:22.751 --> 02:08:24.100
<v Speaker 4>most of them didn't benefit from it,</v>

4797
02:08:24.101 --> 02:08:27.370
<v Speaker 4>but they probably did anyway because they benefited from knowing that this is</v>

4798
02:08:27.371 --> 02:08:28.450
<v Speaker 4>not how to get through in life.</v>

4799
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.980
<v Speaker 4>They benefited from knowing that you,</v>

4800
02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:31.841
<v Speaker 4>you look,</v>

4801
02:08:31.841 --> 02:08:33.520
<v Speaker 4>some people that they went to college with,</v>

4802
02:08:33.521 --> 02:08:36.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure did some extensive,</v>

4803
02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:38.560
<v Speaker 4>a lesson for society.</v>

4804
02:08:38.561 --> 02:08:41.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm on this page with you there of education.</v>

4805
02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:42.250
<v Speaker 4>Fuck them too.</v>

4806
02:08:42.251 --> 02:08:42.550
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4807
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Let's get rid of them and the energy guys.</v>

4808
02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.370
<v Speaker 4>So what are we down to?</v>

4809
02:08:45.490 --> 02:08:45.641
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4810
02:08:45.641 --> 02:08:46.870
<v Speaker 4>we got to get rid of a lot more,</v>

4811
02:08:46.871 --> 02:08:48.760
<v Speaker 4>but we got to go after the entitlements.</v>

4812
02:08:48.761 --> 02:08:50.470
<v Speaker 4>We've got to go after social security and Medicare.</v>

4813
02:08:50.471 --> 02:08:50.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4814
02:08:50.651 --> 02:08:51.850
<v Speaker 4>these are disasters.</v>

4815
02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:52.691
<v Speaker 4>You got to lighten up.</v>

4816
02:08:52.691 --> 02:08:53.380
<v Speaker 4>You want to drink?</v>

4817
02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:54.660
<v Speaker 4>You want a little bit on drinking?</v>

4818
02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:55.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking alcohol.</v>

4819
02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:56.641
<v Speaker 4>What do you got?</v>

4820
02:08:56.641 --> 02:08:57.010
<v Speaker 4>A beer.</v>

4821
02:08:57.010 --> 02:08:57.840
<v Speaker 4>You want a little scotch?</v>

4822
02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:58.673
<v Speaker 4>A little whiskey,</v>

4823
02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.901
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4824
02:08:58.901 --> 02:08:59.734
<v Speaker 4>I could go for some.</v>

4825
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.881
<v Speaker 4>Get some.</v>

4826
02:09:00.881 --> 02:09:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Get some whiskey for this fellow.</v>

4827
02:09:02.170 --> 02:09:02.980
<v Speaker 4>He needs to lighten up.</v>

4828
02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:03.813
<v Speaker 4>What time is it?</v>

4829
02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:04.691
<v Speaker 4>Plenty of times.</v>

4830
02:09:04.691 --> 02:09:05.261
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about.</v>

4831
02:09:05.261 --> 02:09:08.860
<v Speaker 4>The Internet goes on forever and time is illusion created by the man.</v>

4832
02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:10.600
<v Speaker 4>They've created these fucking clocks,</v>

4833
02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:12.850
<v Speaker 4>so energy done.</v>

4834
02:09:12.851 --> 02:09:13.720
<v Speaker 4>We'll get rid of those.</v>

4835
02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:17.380
<v Speaker 4>We'll figure out the energy will will regulate it statewide.</v>

4836
02:09:17.530 --> 02:09:19.330
<v Speaker 4>That's how we'll deal with environmental concerns.</v>

4837
02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:19.610
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

4838
02:09:19.610 --> 02:09:20.020
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4839
02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:21.850
<v Speaker 4>I like that education.</v>

4840
02:09:22.090 --> 02:09:22.871
<v Speaker 4>Let's be honest.</v>

4841
02:09:22.871 --> 02:09:23.590
<v Speaker 4>It's a mess,</v>

4842
02:09:23.590 --> 02:09:24.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4843
02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:24.340
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4844
02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:24.551
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4845
02:09:24.551 --> 02:09:24.761
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4846
02:09:24.761 --> 02:09:28.600
<v Speaker 4>the levels of educations that we're accepting for high school students is</v>

4847
02:09:28.601 --> 02:09:29.710
<v Speaker 4>absolutely ridiculous.</v>

4848
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:33.700
<v Speaker 4>I agree that college educations are insanely expensive.</v>

4849
02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:35.530
<v Speaker 4>The idea behind it is observed.</v>

4850
02:09:35.650 --> 02:09:38.140
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you can go to school for x amount of years,</v>

4851
02:09:38.141 --> 02:09:42.040
<v Speaker 4>come out and be more in debt and you're going to make it a decade of working</v>

4852
02:09:42.041 --> 02:09:42.850
<v Speaker 4>every fucking day.</v>

4853
02:09:42.850 --> 02:09:43.391
<v Speaker 4>We also,</v>

4854
02:09:43.391 --> 02:09:46.990
<v Speaker 4>we also have to let young kids off the hook for social security.</v>

4855
02:09:46.991 --> 02:09:48.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean they didn't vote for this pricing scheme.</v>

4856
02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:50.160
<v Speaker 4>It was conceived before they.</v>

4857
02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:51.460
<v Speaker 4>It is a Ponzi scheme.</v>

4858
02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:52.440
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is.</v>

4859
02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:55.060
<v Speaker 4>Like explain it to people who don't understand because I've seen your</v>

4860
02:09:55.061 --> 02:09:57.640
<v Speaker 4>explanation to the social security system and it's very enlightening because</v>

4861
02:09:57.641 --> 02:09:58.770
<v Speaker 4>it's disgusting what is.</v>

4862
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4863
02:09:58.930 --> 02:09:59.440
<v Speaker 4>they ought to.</v>

4864
02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:04.300
<v Speaker 4>They ought to build a director statue of Ponzi right into the lobby of the</v>

4865
02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:04.570
<v Speaker 4>Social Security Administration.</v>

4866
02:10:04.570 --> 02:10:05.260
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

4867
02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:08.590
<v Speaker 4>social security was conceived and sold to the American public as a complete</v>

4868
02:10:08.591 --> 02:10:09.040
<v Speaker 4>fraud.</v>

4869
02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:09.251
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4870
02:10:09.251 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 4>The idea initially,</v>

4871
02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:13.030
<v Speaker 4>and the government deliberately used this kind of language,</v>

4872
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:17.170
<v Speaker 4>was that it was like insurance because the taxes that you pay are called</v>

4873
02:10:17.171 --> 02:10:18.270
<v Speaker 4>premiums and and they're.</v>

4874
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:20.410
<v Speaker 4>And you're a beneficiary and they have a trust fund,</v>

4875
02:10:20.411 --> 02:10:20.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4876
02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:22.570
<v Speaker 4>All this is what an insurance company does,</v>

4877
02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:24.940
<v Speaker 4>but social security doesn't have a real trust fund.</v>

4878
02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:26.410
<v Speaker 4>Nothing is invested.</v>

4879
02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:26.851
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4880
02:10:26.851 --> 02:10:28.900
<v Speaker 4>it's an intergenerational Ponzi scheme.</v>

4881
02:10:29.150 --> 02:10:31.690
<v Speaker 4>What happened is people paid into social security,</v>

4882
02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:32.850
<v Speaker 4>they paid social security taxes.</v>

4883
02:10:32.851 --> 02:10:34.180
<v Speaker 4>I get on the box on the rock</v>

4884
02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:34.690
<v Speaker 2>center rock.</v>

4885
02:10:34.690 --> 02:10:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4886
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:36.103
<v Speaker 2>You're a gentleman.</v>

4887
02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:37.521
<v Speaker 2>So people paid.</v>

4888
02:10:37.521 --> 02:10:39.050
<v Speaker 2>So Jack Daniels or what's the other stuff?</v>

4889
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:39.913
<v Speaker 2>Check dams was fine.</v>

4890
02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:40.813
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4891
02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:42.370
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

4892
02:10:42.370 --> 02:10:43.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4893
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:44.600
<v Speaker 2>people paid social security taxes,</v>

4894
02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:45.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4895
02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:46.370
<v Speaker 2>And the government spent the money.</v>

4896
02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:46.950
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>

4897
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:48.030
<v Speaker 2>they didn't invest in anything.</v>

4898
02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:48.290
<v Speaker 2>They did,</v>

4899
02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:49.700
<v Speaker 2>they didn't put it aside in a trust fund.</v>

4900
02:10:49.701 --> 02:10:54.260
<v Speaker 2>They just spend the money now as the population grew and they kept raising the</v>

4901
02:10:54.261 --> 02:10:57.380
<v Speaker 2>task because originally it was just a one percent tax,</v>

4902
02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:57.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4903
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't affect self employed people.</v>

4904
02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4905
02:11:00.190 --> 02:11:01.760
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

4906
02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:04.010
<v Speaker 2>it didn't affect self employed people</v>

4907
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 2>because the government said,</v>

4908
02:11:06.771 --> 02:11:06.951
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4909
02:11:06.951 --> 02:11:08.750
<v Speaker 2>if you're smart enough to run your own business,</v>

4910
02:11:08.751 --> 02:11:10.340
<v Speaker 2>you're smart enough to save for your own retirement.</v>

4911
02:11:10.341 --> 02:11:14.660
<v Speaker 2>So the government was supposedly going after the average worker who wasn't going</v>

4912
02:11:14.661 --> 02:11:15.441
<v Speaker 2>to save any money.</v>

4913
02:11:15.441 --> 02:11:15.711
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>

4914
02:11:15.711 --> 02:11:16.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4915
02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:17.270
<v Speaker 2>we're going to save the money for you.</v>

4916
02:11:17.271 --> 02:11:18.530
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have a forced savings.</v>

4917
02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:20.180
<v Speaker 2>But of course the government didn't save anything.</v>

4918
02:11:20.181 --> 02:11:21.080
<v Speaker 2>They spend every nickel.</v>

4919
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:23.240
<v Speaker 2>But as the year,</v>

4920
02:11:23.241 --> 02:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>as the years went by,</v>

4921
02:11:24.321 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 2>they kept increasing the payroll tax and of course the population was growing</v>

4922
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:31.580
<v Speaker 2>and so what the government does is they tax young people and,</v>

4923
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:33.140
<v Speaker 2>and pay off the older people.</v>

4924
02:11:33.230 --> 02:11:35.270
<v Speaker 2>And of course the older people they vote,</v>

4925
02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:35.571
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4926
02:11:35.571 --> 02:11:37.910
<v Speaker 2>The most important thing to them is their social security check.</v>

4927
02:11:38.090 --> 02:11:40.610
<v Speaker 2>And so they vote for whoever promises more benefits.</v>

4928
02:11:40.611 --> 02:11:43.130
<v Speaker 2>And so eventually they got more goodies added on,</v>

4929
02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:43.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4930
02:11:43.551 --> 02:11:44.570
<v Speaker 2>prescription drugs,</v>

4931
02:11:44.571 --> 02:11:45.404
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

4932
02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:47.990
<v Speaker 2>But the young people now are coming in at the end.</v>

4933
02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:48.921
<v Speaker 2>The people today,</v>

4934
02:11:48.921 --> 02:11:50.180
<v Speaker 2>generation x later,</v>

4935
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4936
02:11:50.550 --> 02:11:52.160
<v Speaker 2>you are just holding the bag,</v>

4937
02:11:52.190 --> 02:11:54.650
<v Speaker 2>you are at the end of the chain letter or whatever it is.</v>

4938
02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:56.360
<v Speaker 2>And we're paying people.</v>

4939
02:11:56.361 --> 02:11:59.270
<v Speaker 2>A lot of young people now pay more in social security taxes and they pay in</v>

4940
02:11:59.271 --> 02:11:59.900
<v Speaker 2>income taxes.</v>

4941
02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:02.440
<v Speaker 2>And of course you pay your employers have the,</v>

4942
02:12:02.490 --> 02:12:05.690
<v Speaker 2>the entire 15 percent comes out of the employee's pocket,</v>

4943
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.651
<v Speaker 2>the employer,</v>

4944
02:12:06.651 --> 02:12:08.320
<v Speaker 2>just whatever money the employer,</v>

4945
02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:11.720
<v Speaker 2>your employer sends to the government is the money that he would have sent you</v>

4946
02:12:11.721 --> 02:12:12.770
<v Speaker 2>if the tax wasn't there.</v>

4947
02:12:13.050 --> 02:12:13.221
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4948
02:12:13.221 --> 02:12:13.870
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

4949
02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:15.650
<v Speaker 2>it's all part of the cost of labor,</v>

4950
02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:19.220
<v Speaker 2>but the government did it this way so that people wouldn't realize how expensive</v>

4951
02:12:19.221 --> 02:12:20.054
<v Speaker 2>the social security was,</v>

4952
02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:24.710
<v Speaker 2>but there is absolutely no way that someone in their twenties or thirties or</v>

4953
02:12:24.711 --> 02:12:27.740
<v Speaker 2>forties or even probably my age 50 is going to collect.</v>

4954
02:12:27.770 --> 02:12:29.000
<v Speaker 2>This is gonna blow up.</v>

4955
02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:30.140
<v Speaker 2>This is going to collapse.</v>

4956
02:12:30.141 --> 02:12:33.020
<v Speaker 2>So the sooner that we can level with the public to better,</v>

4957
02:12:33.021 --> 02:12:34.340
<v Speaker 2>we got to end this thing.</v>

4958
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:36.800
<v Speaker 2>We gotta we gotta stop the Social Security Tax,</v>

4959
02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:37.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4960
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Let the young people off the hook and now we have to deal with the consequences</v>

4961
02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.410
<v Speaker 2>of a failed system.</v>

4962
02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to means test it.</v>

4963
02:12:44.150 --> 02:12:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I think we've got to tell wealthier people,</v>

4964
02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:47.170
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4965
02:12:47.170 --> 02:12:47.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4966
02:12:47.710 --> 02:12:48.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4967
02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:48.861
<v Speaker 2>you basically.</v>

4968
02:12:48.861 --> 02:12:49.281
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

4969
02:12:49.281 --> 02:12:49.491
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4970
02:12:49.491 --> 02:12:50.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4971
02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:51.320
<v Speaker 2>from a animal house,</v>

4972
02:12:51.321 --> 02:12:51.441
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4973
02:12:51.441 --> 02:12:52.011
<v Speaker 2>you fucked up,</v>

4974
02:12:52.011 --> 02:12:52.880
<v Speaker 2>you trusted the government,</v>

4975
02:12:52.881 --> 02:12:53.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4976
02:12:53.061 --> 02:12:53.810
<v Speaker 2>you're screwed.</v>

4977
02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:54.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4978
02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.240
<v Speaker 2>the government made a bunch of promises that it can't keep.</v>

4979
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:59.240
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to steal from your kids in order to make you whole.</v>

4980
02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.920
<v Speaker 2>So if you're rich,</v>

4981
02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:02.570
<v Speaker 2>if you have assets or income,</v>

4982
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:03.920
<v Speaker 2>no social security check,</v>

4983
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:04.311
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4984
02:13:04.311 --> 02:13:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Because we're not going to rob from the young and the poor and give to the old</v>

4985
02:13:07.101 --> 02:13:07.580
<v Speaker 2>and the rich.</v>

4986
02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:09.500
<v Speaker 2>You were dumb enough to vote for these policies,</v>

4987
02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:14.390
<v Speaker 2>so deal with the consequences and I would have an asset test and means test and</v>

4988
02:13:14.391 --> 02:13:17.030
<v Speaker 2>then if somebody is in dire situation,</v>

4989
02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:20.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe buy him some kind of a minimal annuity or something.</v>

4990
02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:20.541
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4991
02:13:20.541 --> 02:13:23.420
<v Speaker 2>but we got to admit that social security as well as welfare,</v>

4992
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:24.051
<v Speaker 2>that's all it is.</v>

4993
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:25.460
<v Speaker 2>The money comes from the same pot.</v>

4994
02:13:25.610 --> 02:13:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Nobody paid into anything because whatever money the government collected was</v>

4995
02:13:29.121 --> 02:13:29.600
<v Speaker 2>spent.</v>

4996
02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:30.560
<v Speaker 2>It's all gone.</v>

4997
02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Now to play devil's advocate,</v>

4998
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:36.480
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of social security are that some people that made a decent ways</v>

4999
02:13:36.481 --> 02:13:37.051
<v Speaker 3>their whole life,</v>

5000
02:13:37.051 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 3>but live check to check would someday be able to stop working.</v>

5001
02:13:40.771 --> 02:13:40.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5002
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:41.743
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

5003
02:13:42.090 --> 02:13:42.690
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to.</v>

5004
02:13:42.690 --> 02:13:44.040
<v Speaker 3>What about people that are doing it right now?</v>

5005
02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

5006
02:13:44.630 --> 02:13:45.660
<v Speaker 3>There are people doing it now.</v>

5007
02:13:45.661 --> 02:13:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Just like any Ponzi scheme or rather a chain letter,</v>

5008
02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:48.810
<v Speaker 3>a pyramid.</v>

5009
02:13:48.810 --> 02:13:51.810
<v Speaker 3>There are people like the first person that collected social security,</v>

5010
02:13:51.811 --> 02:13:52.644
<v Speaker 3>her name was.</v>

5011
02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:53.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fuller,</v>

5012
02:13:53.731 --> 02:13:54.564
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

5013
02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:57.930
<v Speaker 3>and she lived to be 100 years old and she only paid in like,</v>

5014
02:13:57.931 --> 02:13:58.171
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

5015
02:13:58.171 --> 02:14:01.770
<v Speaker 3>20 bucks in taxes and she collected tens of thousands,</v>

5016
02:14:01.771 --> 02:14:02.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5017
02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:03.330
<v Speaker 3>She made out like a Banshee,</v>

5018
02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:04.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5019
02:14:04.170 --> 02:14:05.003
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

5020
02:14:05.130 --> 02:14:06.510
<v Speaker 3>it's the people that come in late,</v>

5021
02:14:06.511 --> 02:14:07.344
<v Speaker 3>he gets abandoned,</v>

5022
02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:08.101
<v Speaker 3>abandoned,</v>

5023
02:14:08.101 --> 02:14:08.521
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

5024
02:14:08.521 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 3>but she made out,</v>

5025
02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:09.541
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5026
02:14:09.541 --> 02:14:09.741
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

5027
02:14:09.741 --> 02:14:09.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5028
02:14:09.970 --> 02:14:10.920
<v Speaker 3>she but,</v>

5029
02:14:11.140 --> 02:14:12.180
<v Speaker 3>but the reason that,</v>

5030
02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:15.090
<v Speaker 3>that pyramid schemes are illegal is because they don't work,</v>

5031
02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:15.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5032
02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:17.640
<v Speaker 3>They benefit the people that get in at the beginning,</v>

5033
02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:19.860
<v Speaker 3>at the expense of people to get in at the end.</v>

5034
02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:20.963
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5035
02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:21.600
<v Speaker 3>if a,</v>

5036
02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:22.800
<v Speaker 3>if a pyramid doesn't work,</v>

5037
02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:23.580
<v Speaker 3>it we,</v>

5038
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:24.960
<v Speaker 3>the government can't make it work.</v>

5039
02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:26.100
<v Speaker 3>If the government runs it,</v>

5040
02:14:26.101 --> 02:14:28.290
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to be more successful than the private sector.</v>

5041
02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:32.670
<v Speaker 3>The only difference is when you know people in a private sector figure out it's</v>

5042
02:14:32.671 --> 02:14:33.504
<v Speaker 3>a Ponzi scheme,</v>

5043
02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:33.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5044
02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:36.120
<v Speaker 3>But why didn't Bernie madoff's Ponzi scheme fall apart?</v>

5045
02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Because when people realize what the Ponzi scheme,</v>

5046
02:14:38.161 --> 02:14:39.060
<v Speaker 3>they wanted their money back.</v>

5047
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.</v>

5048
02:14:41.101 --> 02:14:45.750
<v Speaker 3>You can't get out of the government requires you to participate at gunpoint and</v>

5049
02:14:45.751 --> 02:14:47.130
<v Speaker 3>even if you know it's a Ponzi scheme,</v>

5050
02:14:47.310 --> 02:14:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm paying social security taxes even though I know it's a Ponzi scheme.</v>

5051
02:14:50.410 --> 02:14:51.390
<v Speaker 3>If it was a free market,</v>

5052
02:14:51.391 --> 02:14:54.960
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be paying and you will have to be able to say whether or not you</v>

5053
02:14:54.961 --> 02:14:56.910
<v Speaker 3>wanted to contribute and benefit from it.</v>

5054
02:14:57.110 --> 02:14:58.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like an opt in.</v>

5055
02:14:58.540 --> 02:14:59.580
<v Speaker 3>If you have an opt in thing,</v>

5056
02:14:59.581 --> 02:15:00.540
<v Speaker 3>would you be willing?</v>

5057
02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:01.590
<v Speaker 3>I would opt right out.</v>

5058
02:15:01.591 --> 02:15:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would give up,</v>

5059
02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:03.081
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

5060
02:15:03.081 --> 02:15:03.260
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

5061
02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:03.841
<v Speaker 3>But first of all,</v>

5062
02:15:03.841 --> 02:15:05.340
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even think the government.</v>

5063
02:15:05.550 --> 02:15:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Why is the government involved in social security?</v>

5064
02:15:07.951 --> 02:15:10.470
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing in the constitution that gives the government the authority to</v>

5065
02:15:10.471 --> 02:15:11.160
<v Speaker 3>take care of this.</v>

5066
02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:11.371
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>

5067
02:15:11.371 --> 02:15:13.470
<v Speaker 3>If I want to buy insurance from my old age,</v>

5068
02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:14.910
<v Speaker 3>let me buy it in the private sector.</v>

5069
02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean know and let me save on my own money.</v>

5070
02:15:18.231 --> 02:15:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

5071
02:15:18.530 --> 02:15:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Where does most of the money go when you do,</v>

5072
02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:20.610
<v Speaker 3>but when you buy insurance?</v>

5073
02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:21.241
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5074
02:15:21.241 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 3>if you buy legitimate insurance,</v>

5075
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:26.910
<v Speaker 3>the money is invested and it grows so that when you that he could pay off</v>

5076
02:15:26.911 --> 02:15:28.410
<v Speaker 3>whether you're buying a life insurance,</v>

5077
02:15:28.411 --> 02:15:29.340
<v Speaker 3>fire insurance,</v>

5078
02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:33.020
<v Speaker 3>auto insurance companies invest the money and you know some people putting</v>

5079
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.391
<v Speaker 3>claims,</v>

5080
02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:34.200
<v Speaker 3>other people don't,</v>

5081
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:35.280
<v Speaker 3>but for retirement,</v>

5082
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:38.400
<v Speaker 3>a funded pension system are legitimate system.</v>

5083
02:15:38.970 --> 02:15:42.030
<v Speaker 3>You take money as you work and you invest it,</v>

5084
02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.720
<v Speaker 3>and over time compounding interest or the investment returns eventually you know</v>

5085
02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:51.780
<v Speaker 3>based on your contributions and the gains and the reinvestment of the interest</v>

5086
02:15:51.781 --> 02:15:52.614
<v Speaker 3>and the dividends.</v>

5087
02:15:52.650 --> 02:15:56.580
<v Speaker 3>You accumulated a portfolio of stocks and bonds or whatever real estate,</v>

5088
02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:57.414
<v Speaker 3>whatever you bought,</v>

5089
02:15:57.660 --> 02:15:58.500
<v Speaker 3>but you can live on,</v>

5090
02:15:58.501 --> 02:16:01.140
<v Speaker 3>you can live off of your income from your investments.</v>

5091
02:16:01.170 --> 02:16:01.291
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

5092
02:16:01.291 --> 02:16:03.780
<v Speaker 3>how is that different than how social security handles it?</v>

5093
02:16:03.810 --> 02:16:05.580
<v Speaker 3>So secure happens when your money goes into social,</v>

5094
02:16:05.610 --> 02:16:06.300
<v Speaker 3>they spend it,</v>

5095
02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:08.820
<v Speaker 3>the government spends it on current social security recipients.</v>

5096
02:16:08.821 --> 02:16:11.460
<v Speaker 3>They spend it on the war in Iraq or Afghanistan,</v>

5097
02:16:11.461 --> 02:16:12.270
<v Speaker 3>wherever they are.</v>

5098
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:14.700
<v Speaker 3>They spend it on the war on drugs that were on poverty.</v>

5099
02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:16.860
<v Speaker 3>So it's totally speculative because we don't get a receipt,</v>

5100
02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:17.910
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing there.</v>

5101
02:16:17.970 --> 02:16:20.520
<v Speaker 3>But there's also what you're spending on what we call it,</v>

5102
02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:21.090
<v Speaker 3>just a bunch of.</v>

5103
02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:21.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5104
02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:23.910
<v Speaker 3>But there's also no return because there's no.</v>

5105
02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:25.080
<v Speaker 3>There's no compound.</v>

5106
02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:25.280
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

5107
02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:25.481
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

5108
02:16:25.481 --> 02:16:26.550
<v Speaker 3>you don't generate anything.</v>

5109
02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:30.430
<v Speaker 3>And so the only way the government can pay you the money when you retire is if</v>

5110
02:16:30.431 --> 02:16:31.930
<v Speaker 3>they get and get it from somebody else.</v>

5111
02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:33.220
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

5112
02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:34.930
<v Speaker 3>how is the baby bust,</v>

5113
02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:35.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5114
02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Generation x going to pay for the retirement of the baby boom.</v>

5115
02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:39.820
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

5116
02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:40.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean they don't even.</v>

5117
02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:42.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean they don't have the incomes.</v>

5118
02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 3>They're loaded up with debt themselves.</v>

5119
02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:45.640
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a bunch of college debt,</v>

5120
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:46.151
<v Speaker 3>how are,</v>

5121
02:16:46.151 --> 02:16:46.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5122
02:16:46.450 --> 02:16:47.440
<v Speaker 3>not only do you have to pay that,</v>

5123
02:16:47.441 --> 02:16:50.140
<v Speaker 3>but you got to pay somebody social security and their medicare,</v>

5124
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5125
02:16:50.650 --> 02:16:51.730
<v Speaker 3>it is impossible.</v>

5126
02:16:51.731 --> 02:16:55.870
<v Speaker 3>So we've got to admit the policies have to admit all the false promises that</v>

5127
02:16:55.871 --> 02:16:57.370
<v Speaker 3>they made in order to buy votes,</v>

5128
02:16:57.430 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5129
02:16:57.730 --> 02:16:58.331
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>

5130
02:16:58.331 --> 02:17:01.290
<v Speaker 3>They promise something for nothing because that's what people vote for.</v>

5131
02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:02.710
<v Speaker 3>People are dumb enough to do that.</v>

5132
02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:04.150
<v Speaker 3>They vote for something for nothing,</v>

5133
02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:05.230
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5134
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:07.720
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing more expensive than something you get for free from the</v>

5135
02:17:07.721 --> 02:17:11.290
<v Speaker 3>government and we're going to find out just how expensive all this free stuff</v>

5136
02:17:11.291 --> 02:17:11.561
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

5137
02:17:11.561 --> 02:17:14.100
<v Speaker 3>But we got to level with people and said,</v>

5138
02:17:14.101 --> 02:17:14.291
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5139
02:17:14.291 --> 02:17:15.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5140
02:17:15.010 --> 02:17:16.240
<v Speaker 3>there is no trust fund,</v>

5141
02:17:16.241 --> 02:17:17.470
<v Speaker 3>there is no money there.</v>

5142
02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:19.690
<v Speaker 3>And so let's end the program.</v>

5143
02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:20.553
<v Speaker 3>Let's stop it,</v>

5144
02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:21.071
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

5145
02:17:21.071 --> 02:17:21.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5146
02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:24.340
<v Speaker 3>and then let's figure out how to deal with,</v>

5147
02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:24.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5148
02:17:24.650 --> 02:17:28.000
<v Speaker 3>the people who unfortunately now because of this program now depend on this</v>

5149
02:17:28.001 --> 02:17:28.391
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>

5150
02:17:28.391 --> 02:17:31.300
<v Speaker 3>but who would have been self sufficient if the government had let them plan for</v>

5151
02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:34.150
<v Speaker 3>their own retirement and also deal with the unemployment and all the people that</v>

5152
02:17:34.151 --> 02:17:35.680
<v Speaker 3>worked in the various organizations.</v>

5153
02:17:35.710 --> 02:17:35.861
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5154
02:17:35.861 --> 02:17:35.981
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5155
02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:36.160
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5156
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:36.671
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

5157
02:17:36.671 --> 02:17:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Unemployment does.</v>

5158
02:17:37.330 --> 02:17:39.000
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get jobs because.</v>

5159
02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:40.031
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

5160
02:17:40.031 --> 02:17:43.330
<v Speaker 3>because if we get rid of all these government rules and regulations,</v>

5161
02:17:43.331 --> 02:17:44.350
<v Speaker 3>there will be jobs for them.</v>

5162
02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:44.871
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5163
02:17:44.871 --> 02:17:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't want them working in government because now I have to pay their salary</v>

5164
02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:49.360
<v Speaker 3>if they work in the private sector.</v>

5165
02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:49.841
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5166
02:17:49.841 --> 02:17:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to employ all these bureaucrats,</v>

5167
02:17:51.850 --> 02:17:52.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5168
02:17:52.061 --> 02:17:55.120
<v Speaker 3>especially when the average bureaucrat is making more than the average person</v>

5169
02:17:55.121 --> 02:17:57.370
<v Speaker 3>who's paying the taxes that pay the bureaucrats,</v>

5170
02:17:57.450 --> 02:17:57.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5171
02:17:57.850 --> 02:17:59.480
<v Speaker 3>and they just gave everybody in Washington.</v>

5172
02:17:59.481 --> 02:17:59.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5173
02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:00.670
<v Speaker 3>one percent pay raise.</v>

5174
02:18:00.850 --> 02:18:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Who can afford that?</v>

5175
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean they should be given these guys pay cuts,</v>

5176
02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:05.020
<v Speaker 3>but part of the deal,</v>

5177
02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:05.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5178
02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:08.740
<v Speaker 3>to fund the government was to give everybody a raise in Washington.</v>

5179
02:18:08.850 --> 02:18:09.850
<v Speaker 3>They're already overpaid.</v>

5180
02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:10.571
<v Speaker 3>Excellent arguments.</v>

5181
02:18:10.571 --> 02:18:12.090
<v Speaker 3>So Department of energy dead,</v>

5182
02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Department of Education,</v>

5183
02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:15.130
<v Speaker 3>gone social security.</v>

5184
02:18:15.131 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

5185
02:18:16.210 --> 02:18:17.050
<v Speaker 3>What do we have left?</v>

5186
02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:17.850
<v Speaker 3>How do we deal with.</v>

5187
02:18:17.850 --> 02:18:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5188
02:18:17.940 --> 02:18:19.720
<v Speaker 3>you got to cut the fence massively.</v>

5189
02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:20.650
<v Speaker 3>That's the next question.</v>

5190
02:18:20.651 --> 02:18:20.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5191
02:18:20.711 --> 02:18:20.831
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5192
02:18:20.831 --> 02:18:24.340
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the military is it's not the department of Defense now it's</v>

5193
02:18:24.341 --> 02:18:25.360
<v Speaker 3>department of offense,</v>

5194
02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:26.463
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5195
02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:26.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5196
02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:28.930
<v Speaker 3>what we need to do is minor own business,</v>

5197
02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:29.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5198
02:18:29.470 --> 02:18:32.980
<v Speaker 3>We need to stop stirring up Hornet's nest and then being surprised when we get</v>

5199
02:18:32.981 --> 02:18:33.281
<v Speaker 3>stung.</v>

5200
02:18:33.281 --> 02:18:33.970
<v Speaker 3>So Peter Schiff,</v>

5201
02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:35.020
<v Speaker 3>freedom and free though,</v>

5202
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.880
<v Speaker 3>don't you know,</v>

5203
02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:36.730
<v Speaker 3>do you know?</v>

5204
02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:38.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that we're not vigilant.</v>

5205
02:18:38.650 --> 02:18:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I want to have a military that's strong enough that nobody's going to want to</v>

5206
02:18:41.431 --> 02:18:42.070
<v Speaker 3>screw with us,</v>

5207
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.541
<v Speaker 3>and we bought.</v>

5208
02:18:42.541 --> 02:18:43.930
<v Speaker 3>We've got that many times over.</v>

5209
02:18:43.931 --> 02:18:44.530
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

5210
02:18:44.530 --> 02:18:46.060
<v Speaker 3>all we're doing is instigating,</v>

5211
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:49.270
<v Speaker 3>if we just mind our own business and protected our own borders,</v>

5212
02:18:49.390 --> 02:18:49.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5213
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:50.720
<v Speaker 3>No one who's going to,</v>

5214
02:18:51.250 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be dumb enough to attack America?</v>

5215
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:55.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean in a real way.</v>

5216
02:18:55.031 --> 02:18:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean a terrorist.</v>

5217
02:18:56.290 --> 02:18:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

5218
02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:58.900
<v Speaker 3>but what nation is going to launch a war?</v>

5219
02:18:59.080 --> 02:18:59.591
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>

5220
02:18:59.591 --> 02:19:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean did this.</v>

5221
02:19:00.670 --> 02:19:01.540
<v Speaker 3>There is no threat.</v>

5222
02:19:01.570 --> 02:19:02.620
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous,</v>

5223
02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:07.300
<v Speaker 3>but we are creating threats that wouldn't exist if we had a more defensive</v>

5224
02:19:07.301 --> 02:19:07.930
<v Speaker 3>posture.</v>

5225
02:19:07.930 --> 02:19:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Why do we have all these bases all over Europe?</v>

5226
02:19:10.030 --> 02:19:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5227
02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:11.590
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union is gone.</v>

5228
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:12.841
<v Speaker 3>This is the problem.</v>

5229
02:19:12.841 --> 02:19:14.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like once you create a government department,</v>

5230
02:19:14.501 --> 02:19:15.370
<v Speaker 3>they never go away.</v>

5231
02:19:15.490 --> 02:19:16.860
<v Speaker 3>So we have all this,</v>

5232
02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:17.890
<v Speaker 3>this NATO.</v>

5233
02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:22.420
<v Speaker 3>We built up all this stuff in Europe because of the Soviet Union.</v>

5234
02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union is gone.</v>

5235
02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Why are all the basis still there?</v>

5236
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Where all the troops still there?</v>

5237
02:19:26.260 --> 02:19:27.093
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

5238
02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:28.310
<v Speaker 3>this was all government</v>

5239
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:30.770
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy just perpetuating itself.</v>

5240
02:19:30.771 --> 02:19:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5241
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.350
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

5242
02:19:31.350 --> 02:19:32.360
<v Speaker 2>we can't even afford it,</v>

5243
02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:32.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5244
02:19:32.721 --> 02:19:34.320
<v Speaker 2>but we got it.</v>

5245
02:19:34.450 --> 02:19:36.260
<v Speaker 2>If Europe wants our troops there,</v>

5246
02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:37.310
<v Speaker 2>then let's invoice them.</v>

5247
02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:37.671
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>

5248
02:19:37.671 --> 02:19:38.240
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

5249
02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:39.590
<v Speaker 2>We got all these troops in Germany,</v>

5250
02:19:39.710 --> 02:19:42.170
<v Speaker 2>this is what it's gonna cost you to Germany to keep these troops there if you</v>

5251
02:19:42.171 --> 02:19:42.980
<v Speaker 2>think you need them.</v>

5252
02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:45.110
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want them then we're going home and you know,</v>

5253
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:46.190
<v Speaker 2>but that's what we need to do.</v>

5254
02:19:46.191 --> 02:19:46.610
<v Speaker 2>We need that.</v>

5255
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:49.250
<v Speaker 2>We need to dramatically reduce what we're spending on the military.</v>

5256
02:19:49.251 --> 02:19:53.540
<v Speaker 2>But I think the military should be a much higher percentage of the federal</v>

5257
02:19:53.541 --> 02:19:54.620
<v Speaker 2>budget than it is today,</v>

5258
02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:55.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5259
02:19:55.011 --> 02:19:56.890
<v Speaker 2>because that's what the federal government should be doing.</v>

5260
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Protecting us from foreigners.</v>

5261
02:19:59.181 --> 02:20:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Let the state governments protect us from local criminals.</v>

5262
02:20:02.390 --> 02:20:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Let the federal government protect us from international criminals.</v>

5263
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:06.080
<v Speaker 2>But that's it.</v>

5264
02:20:06.350 --> 02:20:06.890
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5265
02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:09.530
<v Speaker 2>right now the government is doing all these things that it shouldn't do,</v>

5266
02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:12.950
<v Speaker 2>that it can't even do the things that it's supposed to do it effectively.</v>

5267
02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:17.620
<v Speaker 4>Now when you hear like the Eisenhower speech when he was leaving office and he</v>

5268
02:20:17.621 --> 02:20:19.660
<v Speaker 4>warned of the military industrial complex,</v>

5269
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:21.720
<v Speaker 4>that's essentially what he was warning us about.</v>

5270
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:26.770
<v Speaker 4>The business has arisen that profits off of war and once it becomes big like any</v>

5271
02:20:28.631 --> 02:20:30.430
<v Speaker 4>bureaucratic institution like any,</v>

5272
02:20:30.610 --> 02:20:34.240
<v Speaker 4>any gigantic corporation like anything that has too much power and influence.</v>

5273
02:20:34.690 --> 02:20:34.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5274
02:20:34.871 --> 02:20:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

5275
02:20:35.130 --> 02:20:37.450
<v Speaker 2>we were the warfare state where the welfare state,</v>

5276
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:38.620
<v Speaker 2>all of that has to end.</v>

5277
02:20:38.650 --> 02:20:39.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5278
02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the guns or the butter from government.</v>

5279
02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:41.261
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5280
02:20:41.261 --> 02:20:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I want the freedom.</v>

5281
02:20:42.250 --> 02:20:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I just want government to secure liberty.</v>

5282
02:20:44.201 --> 02:20:44.840
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's.</v>

5283
02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:47.370
<v Speaker 4>They're so large enough.</v>

5284
02:20:47.430 --> 02:20:49.330
<v Speaker 4>Percentage of money goes towards defense,</v>

5285
02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:51.460
<v Speaker 4>but less but less money.</v>

5286
02:20:51.490 --> 02:20:52.323
<v Speaker 4>A lot less.</v>

5287
02:20:52.450 --> 02:20:53.510
<v Speaker 4>How much less model?</v>

5288
02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:53.930
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5289
02:20:53.930 --> 02:20:56.470
<v Speaker 4>but I mean either we're going to run this motherfucker correctly,</v>

5290
02:20:56.471 --> 02:20:58.890
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to sit down and here's what I'd like to do right</v>

5291
02:20:59.020 --> 02:20:59.430
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

5292
02:20:59.430 --> 02:20:59.850
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

5293
02:20:59.850 --> 02:21:01.630
<v Speaker 2>at the turn of the 19th century,</v>

5294
02:21:01.631 --> 02:21:02.700
<v Speaker 2>so in 1900,</v>

5295
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:03.543
<v Speaker 2>19 slash 11,</v>

5296
02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:04.713
<v Speaker 2>the government,</v>

5297
02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:05.411
<v Speaker 2>federal government,</v>

5298
02:21:05.411 --> 02:21:06.190
<v Speaker 2>state government,</v>

5299
02:21:06.190 --> 02:21:07.023
<v Speaker 2>local government,</v>

5300
02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:11.530
<v Speaker 2>collectively all the government was five percent of our GDP right</v>

5301
02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:13.380
<v Speaker 4>now was this 1900.</v>

5302
02:21:14.180 --> 02:21:14.701
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

5303
02:21:14.701 --> 02:21:16.550
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have the Internet TV,</v>

5304
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:18.200
<v Speaker 4>the gum children.</v>

5305
02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:19.560
<v Speaker 4>That should make it gardening children.</v>

5306
02:21:19.561 --> 02:21:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5307
02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:20.490
<v Speaker 4>But let's double it.</v>

5308
02:21:20.490 --> 02:21:21.040
<v Speaker 4>Let's let it go.</v>

5309
02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Let's let the government be 10 percent of the economy.</v>

5310
02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:24.670
<v Speaker 2>So let's just start slashing it.</v>

5311
02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:25.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5312
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:26.560
<v Speaker 2>we have too much government.</v>

5313
02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

5314
02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:27.970
<v Speaker 2>the more government you have,</v>

5315
02:21:27.971 --> 02:21:28.840
<v Speaker 2>the less freedom you have.</v>

5316
02:21:29.050 --> 02:21:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is focusing on what can I get from government?</v>

5317
02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:32.830
<v Speaker 2>The government doesn't give.</v>

5318
02:21:32.831 --> 02:21:33.700
<v Speaker 2>It has to take.</v>

5319
02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:36.160
<v Speaker 2>If it gives to one person has to take from somebody else.</v>

5320
02:21:36.310 --> 02:21:39.250
<v Speaker 2>If it legislates a special privilege for one person,</v>

5321
02:21:39.370 --> 02:21:41.920
<v Speaker 2>it's imposing an obligation on somebody else to pay for it.</v>

5322
02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:43.000
<v Speaker 2>That's not freedom.</v>

5323
02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:43.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

5324
02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:45.070
<v Speaker 4>so what's next?</v>

5325
02:21:45.250 --> 02:21:45.821
<v Speaker 4>The government.</v>

5326
02:21:45.821 --> 02:21:46.220
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

5327
02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:46.371
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

5328
02:21:46.371 --> 02:21:47.350
<v Speaker 4>we set up that.</v>

5329
02:21:47.351 --> 02:21:48.610
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get rid of energy.</v>

5330
02:21:48.611 --> 02:21:50.050
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get rid of education.</v>

5331
02:21:50.051 --> 02:21:51.990
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get rid of change.</v>

5332
02:21:52.060 --> 02:21:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Alter the way we deal with defense.</v>

5333
02:21:54.250 --> 02:21:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Make it actually defense,</v>

5334
02:21:55.361 --> 02:21:56.230
<v Speaker 4>not offense.</v>

5335
02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:57.610
<v Speaker 4>We're down to how many,</v>

5336
02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:01.120
<v Speaker 4>what percentage of the economy with eliminating the government.</v>

5337
02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:02.830
<v Speaker 4>We've got to eliminate most of the federal government,</v>

5338
02:22:03.130 --> 02:22:03.880
<v Speaker 4>the federal government,</v>

5339
02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:04.421
<v Speaker 4>the benefit.</v>

5340
02:22:04.421 --> 02:22:05.200
<v Speaker 4>What do we need though?</v>

5341
02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:05.741
<v Speaker 4>What do we need?</v>

5342
02:22:05.741 --> 02:22:06.311
<v Speaker 4>What's important?</v>

5343
02:22:06.311 --> 02:22:07.091
<v Speaker 4>Not much nationals,</v>

5344
02:22:07.091 --> 02:22:07.660
<v Speaker 4>the fence,</v>

5345
02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:08.111
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

5346
02:22:08.111 --> 02:22:13.111
<v Speaker 4>Just too much run by military people kind to fight phrases like,</v>

5347
02:22:13.511 --> 02:22:13.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5348
02:22:13.810 --> 02:22:14.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5349
02:22:14.051 --> 02:22:14.980
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's some,</v>

5350
02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:16.780
<v Speaker 4>there's foreign embassies we can maintain.</v>

5351
02:22:16.781 --> 02:22:18.250
<v Speaker 4>There's certain things that we could do,</v>

5352
02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:19.511
<v Speaker 4>but if we,</v>

5353
02:22:19.511 --> 02:22:20.590
<v Speaker 4>if we do this right,</v>

5354
02:22:20.591 --> 02:22:21.424
<v Speaker 4>fixing the roads,</v>

5355
02:22:21.490 --> 02:22:22.241
<v Speaker 4>but that's local.</v>

5356
02:22:22.241 --> 02:22:23.680
<v Speaker 4>The federal government got nothing to do with the roads.</v>

5357
02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean they know is that they have to take the money</v>

5358
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.860
<v Speaker 2>out of the states and the federal aid.</v>

5359
02:22:28.890 --> 02:22:29.101
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5360
02:22:29.101 --> 02:22:32.070
<v Speaker 2>And just like trying to give yourself a blood transfusion from your right arm to</v>

5361
02:22:32.071 --> 02:22:34.260
<v Speaker 2>your left arm and you spill half the blood on the floor.</v>

5362
02:22:34.530 --> 02:22:35.640
<v Speaker 2>There's no point in doing it.</v>

5363
02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:36.570
<v Speaker 2>If we just,</v>

5364
02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:38.250
<v Speaker 2>if we could eliminate the federal government.</v>

5365
02:22:38.251 --> 02:22:39.084
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>

5366
02:22:39.210 --> 02:22:40.590
<v Speaker 2>If here people in California,</v>

5367
02:22:41.010 --> 02:22:43.590
<v Speaker 2>if no one in California had to pay federal income taxes,</v>

5368
02:22:43.650 --> 02:22:45.420
<v Speaker 2>if no one had to pay social security taxes,</v>

5369
02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:45.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5370
02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:47.220
<v Speaker 2>How much more money would be here?</v>

5371
02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5372
02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:50.970
<v Speaker 2>we can deal with problems if you didn't have to send all the money to Washington</v>

5373
02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:52.350
<v Speaker 2>and beg for it back,</v>

5374
02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:52.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5375
02:22:52.801 --> 02:22:54.660
<v Speaker 2>and it always comes back with strings attached,</v>

5376
02:22:54.990 --> 02:22:55.370
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5377
02:22:55.370 --> 02:22:57.510
<v Speaker 2>And you look at these states now like Colorado where they,</v>

5378
02:22:57.511 --> 02:22:57.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5379
02:22:57.721 --> 02:23:01.040
<v Speaker 2>they legalize marijuana but not what's just coming back to this fucking book.</v>

5380
02:23:01.710 --> 02:23:03.120
<v Speaker 2>But what's the federal government doing?</v>

5381
02:23:03.150 --> 02:23:06.960
<v Speaker 2>The federal government is making it impossible for a guy that opens up a store</v>

5382
02:23:06.961 --> 02:23:07.441
<v Speaker 2>to sell matter.</v>

5383
02:23:07.441 --> 02:23:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda,</v>

5384
02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:10.500
<v Speaker 2>he can't have a bank account because the banks are afraid of money laundering.</v>

5385
02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:11.760
<v Speaker 2>He can't rent an office.</v>

5386
02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:14.040
<v Speaker 2>You can't rent a storefront because of the forfeiture.</v>

5387
02:23:14.041 --> 02:23:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Largely if the government's to come in and seize his property.</v>

5388
02:23:16.290 --> 02:23:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean the government is federal governance trampling all over us.</v>

5389
02:23:18.901 --> 02:23:19.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5390
02:23:19.141 --> 02:23:21.930
<v Speaker 2>we fought a revolution to get away from that kind of stuff.</v>

5391
02:23:21.931 --> 02:23:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5392
02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:25.110
<v Speaker 2>and now Washington treats us much worse than,</v>

5393
02:23:25.170 --> 02:23:26.010
<v Speaker 2>than the British did.</v>

5394
02:23:26.011 --> 02:23:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean King George never could have got away with this stuff.</v>

5395
02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:29.010
<v Speaker 2>If this is the case,</v>

5396
02:23:29.011 --> 02:23:31.710
<v Speaker 2>should we actually be hoping that everything falls apart?</v>

5397
02:23:31.711 --> 02:23:32.251
<v Speaker 2>Because in fact,</v>

5398
02:23:32.251 --> 02:23:33.790
<v Speaker 2>that might be the only way that all this case,</v>

5399
02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:34.560
<v Speaker 2>ironically.</v>

5400
02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:35.251
<v Speaker 2>Ironically.</v>

5401
02:23:35.251 --> 02:23:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5402
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:36.623
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

5403
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:38.370
<v Speaker 2>the thing is it's gonna fall apart,</v>

5404
02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:39.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5405
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:39.833
<v Speaker 2>Eventually,</v>

5406
02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:41.190
<v Speaker 2>the sooner the better it gets,</v>

5407
02:23:41.191 --> 02:23:42.001
<v Speaker 2>the longer it takes,</v>

5408
02:23:42.001 --> 02:23:44.430
<v Speaker 2>the worst that's going to be because we are getting,</v>

5409
02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:45.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5410
02:23:45.570 --> 02:23:45.820
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

5411
02:23:45.820 --> 02:23:45.990
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

5412
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.221
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

5413
02:23:46.221 --> 02:23:48.450
<v Speaker 2>we're digging ourselves into a deeper hole every day,</v>

5414
02:23:48.690 --> 02:23:49.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5415
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:51.540
<v Speaker 2>The sooner that the phony economy collapses,</v>

5416
02:23:51.541 --> 02:23:55.200
<v Speaker 2>the sooner we can start replacing it and building the legitimate economy.</v>

5417
02:23:55.410 --> 02:23:56.040
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

5418
02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:56.230
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5419
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5420
02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5421
02:23:56.810 --> 02:23:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I know this huge economic crash is coming.</v>

5422
02:23:59.191 --> 02:24:00.810
<v Speaker 2>That's way worse in 2008.</v>

5423
02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:03.060
<v Speaker 2>If it happens in 2014,</v>

5424
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:07.470
<v Speaker 2>it won't be as bad as if it happens in 2015 and if it happens in 2016,</v>

5425
02:24:07.471 --> 02:24:10.470
<v Speaker 2>well that's even worse than 2015 because we're going to have that much more</v>

5426
02:24:10.471 --> 02:24:11.170
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>

5427
02:24:11.170 --> 02:24:13.050
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be that much bigger bubble.</v>

5428
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.950
<v Speaker 2>The bigger the bubble,</v>

5429
02:24:14.010 --> 02:24:14.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5430
02:24:14.281 --> 02:24:15.660
<v Speaker 2>the bigger the fallout when it burst.</v>

5431
02:24:15.661 --> 02:24:18.330
<v Speaker 2>So the sooner we can stop doing the wrong thing,</v>

5432
02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:20.040
<v Speaker 2>the sooner we can start doing the right thing.</v>

5433
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:21.750
<v Speaker 2>So explain to me how it does collapse.</v>

5434
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:23.910
<v Speaker 2>So let's say worst case scenario,</v>

5435
02:24:23.911 --> 02:24:26.310
<v Speaker 2>it goes to shit in 2016.</v>

5436
02:24:26.311 --> 02:24:29.640
<v Speaker 2>It survives in another couple of years limping along with bandaids on.</v>

5437
02:24:29.641 --> 02:24:31.320
<v Speaker 2>And then one day it implodes.</v>

5438
02:24:31.770 --> 02:24:32.311
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

5439
02:24:32.311 --> 02:24:32.401
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5440
02:24:32.401 --> 02:24:34.980
<v Speaker 2>this is my best guess for how it's going to happen,</v>

5441
02:24:34.981 --> 02:24:35.161
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5442
02:24:35.161 --> 02:24:36.040
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

5443
02:24:36.180 --> 02:24:36.450
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5444
02:24:36.450 --> 02:24:40.050
<v Speaker 2>the economic data is going to start to come out weaker than a lot of people</v>

5445
02:24:40.051 --> 02:24:40.321
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

5446
02:24:40.321 --> 02:24:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I think the jobs numbers are going to deteriorate.</v>

5447
02:24:42.301 --> 02:24:43.880
<v Speaker 2>And of course they never really improved.</v>

5448
02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Mean the reason the unemployment rate has come down,</v>

5449
02:24:46.410 --> 02:24:49.170
<v Speaker 2>it stopped because the unemployed have found jobs is because they've stopped</v>

5450
02:24:49.171 --> 02:24:49.501
<v Speaker 2>looking.</v>

5451
02:24:49.501 --> 02:24:52.860
<v Speaker 2>They've left the labor force and now they're collecting disability checks</v>

5452
02:24:52.861 --> 02:24:53.940
<v Speaker 2>instead of unemployment checks.</v>

5453
02:24:53.941 --> 02:24:54.950
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

5454
02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:55.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5455
02:24:55.250 --> 02:24:56.760
<v Speaker 2>the numbers are going to get worse.</v>

5456
02:24:57.600 --> 02:24:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Janet Yellen is going to be,</v>

5457
02:24:58.921 --> 02:24:59.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5458
02:24:59.250 --> 02:25:04.250
<v Speaker 2>the Fed chairman and she is going to prescribe more quantitative using and so</v>

5459
02:25:04.861 --> 02:25:08.640
<v Speaker 2>they're going to reverse this tapering process and they're going to do more,</v>

5460
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:09.990
<v Speaker 2>more quantitative easing.</v>

5461
02:25:10.290 --> 02:25:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Now everybody is assuming that the Fed is going to continue to,</v>

5462
02:25:14.570 --> 02:25:15.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5463
02:25:15.290 --> 02:25:19.170
<v Speaker 2>to reduce these purchases and eventually unwind their balance sheet.</v>

5464
02:25:19.171 --> 02:25:20.310
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's impossible.</v>

5465
02:25:20.311 --> 02:25:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I was saying that from the beginning that you know there was no exit strategy,</v>

5466
02:25:24.341 --> 02:25:27.670
<v Speaker 2>that it was a lie that they had checked into a monetary roach motel that you</v>

5467
02:25:27.671 --> 02:25:28.060
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

5468
02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:30.100
<v Speaker 2>once they had committed to this that it was,</v>

5469
02:25:30.270 --> 02:25:30.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5470
02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:32.700
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't stop and if you live by Qe,</v>

5471
02:25:32.701 --> 02:25:35.650
<v Speaker 2>you die by Qe and so the Fed is going to come in and they're,</v>

5472
02:25:35.651 --> 02:25:37.270
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do more quantitative easing,</v>

5473
02:25:37.271 --> 02:25:40.570
<v Speaker 2>they're going to print more money to try to bring interest rates back down to</v>

5474
02:25:40.571 --> 02:25:42.430
<v Speaker 2>try to artificially stimulate the economy.</v>

5475
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:46.450
<v Speaker 2>But the market is expecting to reverse to happen and as a result,</v>

5476
02:25:46.451 --> 02:25:47.800
<v Speaker 2>the dollar has risen a little bit.</v>

5477
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Gold price have come down,</v>

5478
02:25:49.121 --> 02:25:52.270
<v Speaker 2>markets come up because people are optimistic about a legitimate recovery.</v>

5479
02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:56.050
<v Speaker 2>When they realized that it was false optimism and that the Fed is going to do</v>

5480
02:25:56.051 --> 02:25:59.050
<v Speaker 2>even more monetary stimulus because none of the other stimulus worked.</v>

5481
02:25:59.170 --> 02:25:59.411
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5482
02:25:59.411 --> 02:26:00.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they do in Washington.</v>

5483
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:01.870
<v Speaker 2>If something doesn't work,</v>

5484
02:26:02.050 --> 02:26:03.010
<v Speaker 2>you don't reevaluate,</v>

5485
02:26:03.011 --> 02:26:06.040
<v Speaker 2>you just do more of it and just assume it will work if you do it bigger.</v>

5486
02:26:06.310 --> 02:26:07.570
<v Speaker 2>So I think when that happens,</v>

5487
02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:11.320
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see a lot of downward pressure on the dollar,</v>

5488
02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:13.810
<v Speaker 2>it's going to really start to fall out foreign exchange markets,</v>

5489
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:17.800
<v Speaker 2>and that's going to have a profound impact on consumer prices,</v>

5490
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:19.090
<v Speaker 2>price of gasoline,</v>

5491
02:26:19.091 --> 02:26:19.751
<v Speaker 2>price of food,</v>

5492
02:26:19.751 --> 02:26:20.584
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

5493
02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:23.800
<v Speaker 2>And now the Fed is going to be looking at CPI inflation,</v>

5494
02:26:23.801 --> 02:26:26.170
<v Speaker 2>which is much higher than it should tolerate,</v>

5495
02:26:26.980 --> 02:26:28.210
<v Speaker 2>but the Fed can't do anything.</v>

5496
02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:31.000
<v Speaker 2>This is the Fed raises interest rates to fight that inflation.</v>

5497
02:26:31.450 --> 02:26:32.770
<v Speaker 2>The stock market will crash,</v>

5498
02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:36.010
<v Speaker 2>the real estate market will crash and all the big banks that we bailed out are</v>

5499
02:26:36.011 --> 02:26:36.820
<v Speaker 2>going to fail again.</v>

5500
02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Only now they're going to have even more debt.</v>

5501
02:26:38.470 --> 02:26:41.260
<v Speaker 2>So we'll be at an even worse financial crisis in 2008.</v>

5502
02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:42.820
<v Speaker 2>So the Fed can't let that happen.</v>

5503
02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:44.380
<v Speaker 2>So they got to print even more money,</v>

5504
02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:46.480
<v Speaker 2>but now the dollar goes down even more.</v>

5505
02:26:46.481 --> 02:26:47.950
<v Speaker 2>And now inflation is even bigger.</v>

5506
02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And maybe for a while the government will try to convince us that inflation is</v>

5507
02:26:51.371 --> 02:26:54.460
<v Speaker 2>good for us and that we should be happy because at least we're not suffering</v>

5508
02:26:54.461 --> 02:26:55.294
<v Speaker 2>deflation.</v>

5509
02:26:55.490 --> 02:26:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5510
02:26:55.690 --> 02:27:00.250
<v Speaker 2>but at some point you're going to reach a critical point where the Fed is going</v>

5511
02:27:00.251 --> 02:27:03.880
<v Speaker 2>to have to either dramatically raise interest rates to protect the dollar and</v>

5512
02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:08.380
<v Speaker 2>stop hyperinflation and allow the markets to implode and allow a much worse</v>

5513
02:27:08.381 --> 02:27:12.490
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis in 2008 or they're going to keep printing the dollar until they</v>

5514
02:27:12.491 --> 02:27:14.590
<v Speaker 2>printed into oblivion and then it's worthless.</v>

5515
02:27:14.591 --> 02:27:14.921
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

5516
02:27:14.921 --> 02:27:15.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5517
02:27:15.130 --> 02:27:18.070
<v Speaker 2>everybody is wiped out because no matter how much money you have,</v>

5518
02:27:18.130 --> 02:27:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5519
02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:18.720
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5520
02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:19.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5521
02:27:19.201 --> 02:27:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have enough money to buy a cup of coffee because the currency has</v>

5522
02:27:22.271 --> 02:27:23.104
<v Speaker 2>been wiped out.</v>

5523
02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Now when you deal with currency,</v>

5524
02:27:24.541 --> 02:27:26.190
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets really weird with people.</v>

5525
02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't even understand what a dollar bill actually is.</v>

5526
02:27:29.371 --> 02:27:29.850
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

5527
02:27:29.850 --> 02:27:31.230
<v Speaker 1>they think somehow or another,</v>

5528
02:27:31.231 --> 02:27:33.360
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think that it's based on something.</v>

5529
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Not that there's like a pound of gold waiting somewhere for $100 bill or</v>

5530
02:27:37.411 --> 02:27:37.720
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

5531
02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:38.800
<v Speaker 1>A lot more than a pound.</v>

5532
02:27:38.970 --> 02:27:39.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5533
02:27:39.211 --> 02:27:40.350
<v Speaker 1>not more than $100 obviously,</v>

5534
02:27:40.351 --> 02:27:41.310
<v Speaker 1>but it used to be,</v>

5535
02:27:41.311 --> 02:27:41.700
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5536
02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:42.460
<v Speaker 1>If you go back back</v>

5537
02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:43.031
<v Speaker 2>to the beginning,</v>

5538
02:27:43.031 --> 02:27:43.421
<v Speaker 2>if you go,</v>

5539
02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:46.270
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the constitution and you read a article,</v>

5540
02:27:46.271 --> 02:27:47.104
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

5541
02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:48.280
<v Speaker 2>section eight and Article One,</v>

5542
02:27:48.281 --> 02:27:48.791
<v Speaker 2>section 10,</v>

5543
02:27:48.791 --> 02:27:49.350
<v Speaker 2>you read them,</v>

5544
02:27:49.350 --> 02:27:49.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5545
02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:54.640
<v Speaker 2>but it says that money is gold and silver and that's what's legal tender in the</v>

5546
02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:55.721
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

5547
02:27:55.721 --> 02:27:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And up until 1971 a,</v>

5548
02:27:59.650 --> 02:28:00.130
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

5549
02:28:00.130 --> 02:28:00.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5550
02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:01.540
<v Speaker 2>we were on a gold standard.</v>

5551
02:28:01.541 --> 02:28:01.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5552
02:28:01.721 --> 02:28:04.450
<v Speaker 2>we were on a more pure gold standard before,</v>

5553
02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:04.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5554
02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:06.700
<v Speaker 2>the Federal Reserve came in in 1913.</v>

5555
02:28:07.090 --> 02:28:07.301
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5556
02:28:07.301 --> 02:28:09.070
<v Speaker 2>but we were always on some kind of standards.</v>

5557
02:28:09.071 --> 02:28:10.030
<v Speaker 2>So the first dollars,</v>

5558
02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:10.870
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5559
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:12.460
<v Speaker 2>we're receipts for golden silver.</v>

5560
02:28:12.461 --> 02:28:16.330
<v Speaker 2>If you go back and you get an old dollar from before,</v>

5561
02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:17.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5562
02:28:17.050 --> 02:28:17.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5563
02:28:17.770 --> 02:28:19.420
<v Speaker 2>let's say you had a $10 bill,</v>

5564
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:22.550
<v Speaker 2>it would say on the bill pay to the bearer on demand.</v>

5565
02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:23.443
<v Speaker 2>$10.</v>

5566
02:28:24.110 --> 02:28:27.500
<v Speaker 2>The $10 wasn't a piece of paper that was a representation.</v>

5567
02:28:27.501 --> 02:28:28.580
<v Speaker 2>It was an Iou.</v>

5568
02:28:28.581 --> 02:28:29.390
<v Speaker 2>$10.</v>

5569
02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:30.950
<v Speaker 2>The $10 was the gold.</v>

5570
02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5571
02:28:31.370 --> 02:28:34.970
<v Speaker 2>there was $10 worth of gold on deposit and you could it in somewhere.</v>

5572
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Fort Knox,</v>

5573
02:28:35.690 --> 02:28:36.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5574
02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:36.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5575
02:28:36.201 --> 02:28:36.861
<v Speaker 2>In Fort Knox.</v>

5576
02:28:36.861 --> 02:28:41.840
<v Speaker 2>And you could take your $10 to the US treasury and you can say,</v>

5577
02:28:41.841 --> 02:28:42.740
<v Speaker 2>give me my dollars.</v>

5578
02:28:42.741 --> 02:28:43.790
<v Speaker 2>This is my receipt.</v>

5579
02:28:43.791 --> 02:28:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Because it actually was an Iou.</v>

5580
02:28:45.231 --> 02:28:46.580
<v Speaker 2>It was a federal reserve note,</v>

5581
02:28:46.581 --> 02:28:47.414
<v Speaker 2>even if it was a note,</v>

5582
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:49.820
<v Speaker 2>but it was a note payable in lawful money.</v>

5583
02:28:49.821 --> 02:28:52.850
<v Speaker 2>The lawful money was the gold or silver because there were some silver</v>

5584
02:28:52.851 --> 02:28:53.331
<v Speaker 2>certificates,</v>

5585
02:28:53.331 --> 02:28:54.440
<v Speaker 2>there were some gold certificates,</v>

5586
02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:58.100
<v Speaker 2>but there was real money backing the notes,</v>

5587
02:28:58.101 --> 02:28:58.934
<v Speaker 2>backing the currency.</v>

5588
02:28:58.970 --> 02:29:01.610
<v Speaker 2>That money varied depending upon the price of gold and silver.</v>

5589
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5590
02:29:01.791 --> 02:29:02.690
<v Speaker 2>the price of gold and silver,</v>

5591
02:29:02.691 --> 02:29:03.580
<v Speaker 2>what your return would be,</v>

5592
02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:04.220
<v Speaker 2>but you returned.</v>

5593
02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:04.690
<v Speaker 2>There was no.</v>

5594
02:29:04.690 --> 02:29:05.660
<v Speaker 2>There never changed.</v>

5595
02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:05.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5596
02:29:05.811 --> 02:29:06.890
<v Speaker 2>there was real value.</v>

5597
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:08.690
<v Speaker 2>And when we had real money,</v>

5598
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:12.440
<v Speaker 2>we had prices that went down a little bit every year because money gains value</v>

5599
02:29:12.470 --> 02:29:13.303
<v Speaker 2>when it's legitimate.</v>

5600
02:29:13.690 --> 02:29:15.260
<v Speaker 2>But our monies illegitimate.</v>

5601
02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:16.810
<v Speaker 2>How does he ever recovered?</v>

5602
02:29:16.811 --> 02:29:16.911
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5603
02:29:16.911 --> 02:29:17.870
<v Speaker 2>it's now counterfeit.</v>

5604
02:29:17.871 --> 02:29:20.600
<v Speaker 2>What happened in 1971 when we went off the gold standard,</v>

5605
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:21.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5606
02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:24.320
<v Speaker 2>The government basically repudiated it's promises.</v>

5607
02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:26.570
<v Speaker 2>So instead of the $10 bill saying,</v>

5608
02:29:26.571 --> 02:29:28.520
<v Speaker 2>we'll pay to the bearer on demand $10,</v>

5609
02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:30.170
<v Speaker 2>it just says $10.</v>

5610
02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:31.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5611
02:29:31.210 --> 02:29:31.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5612
02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:32.233
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

5613
02:29:32.270 --> 02:29:32.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5614
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.870
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5615
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:33.220
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5616
02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:33.511
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5617
02:29:33.511 --> 02:29:33.830
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5618
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:34.880
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like if I,</v>

5619
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:39.260
<v Speaker 2>if I go to a coat check and I give them my coat and they give me a little claim</v>

5620
02:29:39.261 --> 02:29:40.850
<v Speaker 2>check and says I owe you one coat.</v>

5621
02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5622
02:29:41.350 --> 02:29:41.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5623
02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:44.090
<v Speaker 2>the claim check is just a receipt for the coat.</v>

5624
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:45.650
<v Speaker 2>The coat check has.</v>

5625
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:50.090
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if you went down there and you gave him your claim check and they</v>

5626
02:29:50.091 --> 02:29:51.020
<v Speaker 2>just crossed out the,</v>

5627
02:29:51.021 --> 02:29:51.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5628
02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I owe you one coat and they just gave you back your receipt.</v>

5629
02:29:53.601 --> 02:29:54.410
<v Speaker 2>That said one coat,</v>

5630
02:29:54.410 --> 02:29:55.243
<v Speaker 2>here's your coat.</v>

5631
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:56.203
<v Speaker 2>That's not my coat.</v>

5632
02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Well it says one coat.</v>

5633
02:29:57.430 --> 02:29:58.340
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what it says.</v>

5634
02:29:58.341 --> 02:29:59.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not a coat,</v>

5635
02:29:59.170 --> 02:29:59.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5636
02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:00.470
<v Speaker 2>The $10 bill,</v>

5637
02:30:00.471 --> 02:30:02.000
<v Speaker 2>just because it says $10.</v>

5638
02:30:02.001 --> 02:30:03.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not $10.</v>

5639
02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:06.290
<v Speaker 2>It used to represent an Iou for $10.</v>

5640
02:30:06.350 --> 02:30:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Now it's just a piece of paper with writing on it,</v>

5641
02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:10.310
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't represent anything.</v>

5642
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:12.920
<v Speaker 2>But right now all we have is this Fiat money,</v>

5643
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:13.730
<v Speaker 2>which means just,</v>

5644
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:13.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5645
02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:14.661
<v Speaker 2>let it be made.</v>

5646
02:30:14.661 --> 02:30:15.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just paper money.</v>

5647
02:30:16.010 --> 02:30:19.400
<v Speaker 2>And the founding fathers when they established means let it be A.</v>

5648
02:30:19.401 --> 02:30:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5649
02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Just let him car the car company.</v>

5650
02:30:21.501 --> 02:30:22.460
<v Speaker 2>That means let it be made.</v>

5651
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5652
02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:23.181
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

5653
02:30:23.181 --> 02:30:23.781
<v Speaker 2>maybe I don't know,</v>

5654
02:30:23.781 --> 02:30:24.860
<v Speaker 2>but that's where that comes from,</v>

5655
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:25.783
<v Speaker 2>the Latin word.</v>

5656
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.823
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5657
02:30:27.170 --> 02:30:28.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like paper.</v>

5658
02:30:28.551 --> 02:30:29.384
<v Speaker 2>Money is new,</v>

5659
02:30:29.470 --> 02:30:29.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5660
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:32.570
<v Speaker 2>They had paper money before the United States existed.</v>

5661
02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:33.260
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

5662
02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:35.780
<v Speaker 2>we experimented with it in the continental congress.</v>

5663
02:30:35.781 --> 02:30:38.870
<v Speaker 2>They issued something called the continental which collapsed and they had an</v>

5664
02:30:38.871 --> 02:30:40.460
<v Speaker 2>expression not worth a continental.</v>

5665
02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:44.930
<v Speaker 2>So people like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and John Adams and</v>

5666
02:30:44.931 --> 02:30:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Franklin.</v>

5667
02:30:46.100 --> 02:30:48.140
<v Speaker 2>These guys hated paper money with a passion.</v>

5668
02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:50.870
<v Speaker 2>They knew how evil it was and how dangerous it was.</v>

5669
02:30:50.990 --> 02:30:53.150
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want any paper money in the United States.</v>

5670
02:30:53.151 --> 02:30:54.650
<v Speaker 2>They wanted us to be on a gold standard.</v>

5671
02:30:54.800 --> 02:30:56.730
<v Speaker 2>And so we had a metallic standard with gold,</v>

5672
02:30:56.731 --> 02:30:57.440
<v Speaker 2>golden silver,</v>

5673
02:30:57.440 --> 02:30:58.700
<v Speaker 2>and it's served our country very,</v>

5674
02:30:58.701 --> 02:30:59.181
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

5675
02:30:59.181 --> 02:31:02.480
<v Speaker 2>But unfortunately we did not listen to the wisdom.</v>

5676
02:31:02.481 --> 02:31:04.130
<v Speaker 2>We forgot the wisdom of the founders.</v>

5677
02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:06.160
<v Speaker 2>And now we have the exact same,</v>

5678
02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:10.010
<v Speaker 2>the exact kind of Fiat money that the founding fathers wanted to make sure we</v>

5679
02:31:10.011 --> 02:31:12.860
<v Speaker 2>never had because they knew what a disaster it would be.</v>

5680
02:31:12.861 --> 02:31:16.040
<v Speaker 2>And we are going to have a disaster because we don't have real money.</v>

5681
02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:16.761
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>

5682
02:31:16.761 --> 02:31:17.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5683
02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.640
<v Speaker 2>this phony money Fiat money and it is,</v>

5684
02:31:19.641 --> 02:31:19.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5685
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

5686
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:22.410
<v Speaker 3>root cause of a lot of our economic problems.</v>

5687
02:31:22.530 --> 02:31:23.940
<v Speaker 3>If we had honest money,</v>

5688
02:31:23.941 --> 02:31:24.900
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have these problems.</v>

5689
02:31:24.901 --> 02:31:26.280
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't have this enormous government,</v>

5690
02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:29.610
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have all this debt because it would be impossible for the government</v>

5691
02:31:29.611 --> 02:31:31.890
<v Speaker 3>to have all this debt if they had a bar of gold.</v>

5692
02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:35.430
<v Speaker 3>It is quite impressive when you look back at what the founding fathers predicted</v>

5693
02:31:35.700 --> 02:31:38.100
<v Speaker 3>and what they were trying to ward against and,</v>

5694
02:31:38.101 --> 02:31:39.390
<v Speaker 3>and protect us against.</v>

5695
02:31:39.391 --> 02:31:41.670
<v Speaker 3>And what an amazing job of predicting it.</v>

5696
02:31:41.730 --> 02:31:43.140
<v Speaker 3>They were very enlightened men.</v>

5697
02:31:43.170 --> 02:31:44.520
<v Speaker 3>They were very learned man.</v>

5698
02:31:44.521 --> 02:31:45.150
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them himself,</v>

5699
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:46.080
<v Speaker 3>self educated,</v>

5700
02:31:46.081 --> 02:31:47.070
<v Speaker 3>some went to colleges too.</v>

5701
02:31:47.071 --> 02:31:47.690
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

5702
02:31:47.690 --> 02:31:48.171
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

5703
02:31:48.171 --> 02:31:48.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5704
02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:48.641
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5705
02:31:48.641 --> 02:31:49.351
<v Speaker 3>they were very,</v>

5706
02:31:49.351 --> 02:31:49.921
<v Speaker 3>very bright man.</v>

5707
02:31:49.921 --> 02:31:52.890
<v Speaker 3>And so unfortunately with all the population we have now,</v>

5708
02:31:52.891 --> 02:31:56.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no way that Congress today can come even close.</v>

5709
02:31:56.101 --> 02:31:56.281
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5710
02:31:56.281 --> 02:31:57.540
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's a couple of guys,</v>

5711
02:31:57.720 --> 02:32:02.220
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it's nothing like it because we only had 3 million people back then</v>

5712
02:32:02.221 --> 02:32:04.380
<v Speaker 3>and we had such an intelligent,</v>

5713
02:32:04.650 --> 02:32:09.610
<v Speaker 3>a group of men in Congress compared to now we're drawing off of $250 million and</v>

5714
02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:10.740
<v Speaker 3>we have a bunch of idiots.</v>

5715
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.371
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5716
02:32:11.371 --> 02:32:12.600
<v Speaker 3>What do we do about that?</v>

5717
02:32:12.660 --> 02:32:12.890
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

5718
02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:14.190
<v Speaker 3>there's no Fort Knox anymore.</v>

5719
02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:15.610
<v Speaker 3>There's no big fat pile of gold.</v>

5720
02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5721
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:16.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5722
02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:16.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5723
02:32:16.730 --> 02:32:17.550
<v Speaker 3>we know that money go.</v>

5724
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we claim that there is a bunch of gold there,</v>

5725
02:32:20.281 --> 02:32:20.581
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5726
02:32:20.581 --> 02:32:21.960
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that Germany,</v>

5727
02:32:21.961 --> 02:32:22.460
<v Speaker 3>which you know,</v>

5728
02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:24.840
<v Speaker 3>we the United States in addition to our own goals,</v>

5729
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:25.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5730
02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:28.350
<v Speaker 3>We also store gold on behalf of a lot of other countries.</v>

5731
02:32:28.530 --> 02:32:32.610
<v Speaker 3>So Germany a year ago asked for half of their goal back,</v>

5732
02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:33.960
<v Speaker 3>they told the United States government,</v>

5733
02:32:34.030 --> 02:32:37.110
<v Speaker 3>we want half our goals and we basically told Germany,</v>

5734
02:32:37.111 --> 02:32:37.920
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

5735
02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:39.630
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to take us eight years to give it to you.</v>

5736
02:32:40.410 --> 02:32:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

5737
02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Because we've got to dig it out of the ground.</v>

5738
02:32:42.690 --> 02:32:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

5739
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

5740
02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:47.220
<v Speaker 3>it's been a year and we haven't even come close to giving them one eighth of it.</v>

5741
02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:49.171
<v Speaker 3>Fucking mouth.</v>

5742
02:32:49.171 --> 02:32:50.004
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

5743
02:32:50.130 --> 02:32:51.420
<v Speaker 3>He makes some nice cars.</v>

5744
02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Let's leave it at that.</v>

5745
02:32:52.410 --> 02:32:53.191
<v Speaker 3>Don't get crazy.</v>

5746
02:32:53.191 --> 02:32:53.911
<v Speaker 3>You guys are about that,</v>

5747
02:32:53.911 --> 02:32:54.301
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5748
02:32:54.301 --> 02:32:54.660
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5749
02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:56.610
<v Speaker 3>they want their gold back because I think they just,</v>

5750
02:32:56.611 --> 02:32:57.560
<v Speaker 3>they don't trust this.</v>

5751
02:32:57.570 --> 02:32:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Ours mine when they die because it really,</v>

5752
02:32:59.730 --> 02:33:00.091
<v Speaker 3>that's why.</v>

5753
02:33:00.091 --> 02:33:00.331
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

5754
02:33:00.331 --> 02:33:01.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5755
02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I think people know I own,</v>

5756
02:33:04.050 --> 02:33:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I own a lot of gold.</v>

5757
02:33:05.130 --> 02:33:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Are you one of those guys?</v>

5758
02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:07.650
<v Speaker 3>You're golden.</v>

5759
02:33:07.651 --> 02:33:08.484
<v Speaker 3>Dried food.</v>

5760
02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5761
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:09.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5762
02:33:09.840 --> 02:33:11.250
<v Speaker 3>I got more golden dried food,</v>

5763
02:33:11.251 --> 02:33:11.910
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5764
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:12.331
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

5765
02:33:12.331 --> 02:33:12.660
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5766
02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:13.021
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

5767
02:33:13.021 --> 02:33:13.620
<v Speaker 3>I think gold.</v>

5768
02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:14.730
<v Speaker 3>I think gold is going a lot higher.</v>

5769
02:33:14.731 --> 02:33:15.900
<v Speaker 3>That's why I have a gold company.</v>

5770
02:33:15.901 --> 02:33:16.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5771
02:33:16.081 --> 02:33:16.370
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>

5772
02:33:16.370 --> 02:33:16.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5773
02:33:16.600 --> 02:33:18.330

5774
02:33:18.331 --> 02:33:20.190
<v Speaker 3>but I recommend that people own gold.</v>

5775
02:33:20.191 --> 02:33:20.761
<v Speaker 3>I own goals.</v>

5776
02:33:20.761 --> 02:33:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I want a lot of gold mining gold.</v>

5777
02:33:22.370 --> 02:33:24.210
<v Speaker 3>You were like fat chains around the house.</v>

5778
02:33:24.211 --> 02:33:25.500
<v Speaker 3>I got a little gold in my watch.</v>

5779
02:33:25.501 --> 02:33:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not very flamboyant or anything like that.</v>

5780
02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

5781
02:33:28.460 --> 02:33:29.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a good thing to have.</v>

5782
02:33:29.701 --> 02:33:30.660
<v Speaker 3>If the shit hits the fan,</v>

5783
02:33:30.690 --> 02:33:30.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5784
02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:31.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5785
02:33:31.651 --> 02:33:31.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5786
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:32.240
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5787
02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:33.330
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely valuable.</v>

5788
02:33:33.331 --> 02:33:34.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't wear my gold.</v>

5789
02:33:34.291 --> 02:33:34.670
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

5790
02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:35.020
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

5791
02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:35.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5792
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:35.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5793
02:33:35.490 --> 02:33:36.021
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

5794
02:33:36.021 --> 02:33:36.750
<v Speaker 3>in a safe.</v>

5795
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5796
02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:39.360
<v Speaker 3>So our money is not backed in gold.</v>

5797
02:33:39.390 --> 02:33:41.130
<v Speaker 3>There is no more Fort Knox.</v>

5798
02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:42.630
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what happened to all that.</v>

5799
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5800
02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:43.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5801
02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:44.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's there.</v>

5802
02:33:44.671 --> 02:33:45.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not there.</v>

5803
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5804
02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:46.890
<v Speaker 3>you're the guy,</v>

5805
02:33:46.890 --> 02:33:50.790
<v Speaker 3>but how am I supposed to ask me some questions about martial arts?</v>

5806
02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Some definitive answers yet,</v>

5807
02:33:52.260 --> 02:33:54.180
<v Speaker 3>but I've never been down to about an economy.</v>

5808
02:33:54.181 --> 02:33:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I said no,</v>

5809
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.930
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5810
02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:55.763
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

5811
02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I've never been there.</v>

5812
02:33:57.210 --> 02:33:57.871
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5813
02:33:57.871 --> 02:33:58.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5814
02:33:58.081 --> 02:34:01.350
<v Speaker 3>there are people who have wanted an audit of Fort Knox but they haven't had one</v>

5815
02:34:01.410 --> 02:34:01.880
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>

5816
02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:03.960
<v Speaker 3>The government claims that the gold is there.</v>

5817
02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:05.190
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's there.</v>

5818
02:34:05.191 --> 02:34:05.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

5819
02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:06.151
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

5820
02:34:06.151 --> 02:34:07.290
<v Speaker 3>as a gold investor,</v>

5821
02:34:07.291 --> 02:34:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5822
02:34:07.410 --> 02:34:07.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5823
02:34:07.681 --> 02:34:10.440
<v Speaker 3>certainly if it's not there the price of gold is going to go a lot higher</v>

5824
02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:13.560
<v Speaker 3>because eventually the world is going back to a gold standard.</v>

5825
02:34:13.561 --> 02:34:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5826
02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:17.040
<v Speaker 3>there is no question in my mind that we will be back on a gold standard,</v>

5827
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 3>not because we</v>

5828
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:18.820
<v Speaker 2>want it right.</v>

5829
02:34:18.821 --> 02:34:20.230
<v Speaker 2>The politicians will never want it,</v>

5830
02:34:20.350 --> 02:34:23.230
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to be forced to adopt it because it's gonna be the only way to</v>

5831
02:34:23.231 --> 02:34:24.070
<v Speaker 2>end the chaos.</v>

5832
02:34:24.370 --> 02:34:24.761
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5833
02:34:24.761 --> 02:34:26.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like a chaperone at a,</v>

5834
02:34:26.631 --> 02:34:28.270
<v Speaker 2>at a high school prom,</v>

5835
02:34:28.330 --> 02:34:28.571
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5836
02:34:28.571 --> 02:34:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5837
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:30.400
<v Speaker 2>the kids don't want the chaperone there.</v>

5838
02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Gold is the monitor wall.</v>

5839
02:34:32.090 --> 02:34:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

5840
02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:35.230
<v Speaker 2>And the central bankers.</v>

5841
02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:36.670
<v Speaker 2>The government wants to fuck us,</v>

5842
02:34:36.850 --> 02:34:38.560
<v Speaker 2>but they can't do it on a goldsmith.</v>

5843
02:34:39.090 --> 02:34:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5844
02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:40.870
<v Speaker 2>They can't do it when we're on a gold standard.</v>

5845
02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:41.704
<v Speaker 2>That's why they don't want it.</v>

5846
02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:43.000
<v Speaker 2>That's why they want funny money.</v>

5847
02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5848
02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:44.140
<v Speaker 2>And the mean to me,</v>

5849
02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:44.800
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>

5850
02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:47.200
<v Speaker 2>your advice has nothing to do with the fact that you actually sell gold?</v>

5851
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.311
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5852
02:34:47.311 --> 02:34:47.500
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5853
02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I sell goal because I believe in it.</v>

5854
02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I believe say I believe I'm going to see.</v>

5855
02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to do the right thing for my clients.</v>

5856
02:34:54.050 --> 02:34:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Clients.</v>

5857
02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5858
02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:54.800
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

5859
02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:55.330
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

5860
02:34:55.330 --> 02:34:57.370
<v Speaker 2>if I thought that they should own something else,</v>

5861
02:34:57.371 --> 02:34:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5862
02:34:57.700 --> 02:34:58.481
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes,</v>

5863
02:34:58.481 --> 02:34:59.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5864
02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:02.650
<v Speaker 2>it's easier to sell people what they want than what you think that they need.</v>

5865
02:35:02.890 --> 02:35:03.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5866
02:35:03.101 --> 02:35:03.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5867
02:35:03.390 --> 02:35:03.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5868
02:35:03.611 --> 02:35:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I actually built my brokerage business really in the late 19 nineties when</v>

5869
02:35:08.411 --> 02:35:08.921
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

5870
02:35:08.921 --> 02:35:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I talked to one of tech stocks and I used to spend all day and all night trying</v>

5871
02:35:13.061 --> 02:35:14.710
<v Speaker 2>to talk people out of those stocks.</v>

5872
02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:15.221
<v Speaker 2>St Luke,</v>

5873
02:35:15.221 --> 02:35:16.054
<v Speaker 2>this is a bubble.</v>

5874
02:35:16.090 --> 02:35:17.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to buy this,</v>

5875
02:35:17.290 --> 02:35:18.011
<v Speaker 2>this is what you need.</v>

5876
02:35:18.011 --> 02:35:18.670
<v Speaker 2>You should buy this,</v>

5877
02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:19.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5878
02:35:19.090 --> 02:35:20.440
<v Speaker 2>this company or this dividend,</v>

5879
02:35:20.441 --> 02:35:20.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5880
02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:20.871
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

5881
02:35:20.871 --> 02:35:21.910
<v Speaker 2>and it was difficult.</v>

5882
02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.120
<v Speaker 2>A lot of my friends were making a lot more money than I was back then because</v>

5883
02:35:25.121 --> 02:35:27.400
<v Speaker 2>they were just selling their clients what they want it.</v>

5884
02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:28.100
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

5885
02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5886
02:35:28.410 --> 02:35:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I make a lot more money than they do now because I took a longterm approach.</v>

5887
02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do what was right for my clients,</v>

5888
02:35:33.971 --> 02:35:35.500
<v Speaker 2>not what made me the money in the short run.</v>

5889
02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I was concerned about my reputation and building a lasting business beyond the</v>

5890
02:35:40.331 --> 02:35:41.140
<v Speaker 2>tech bubble,</v>

5891
02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:41.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5892
02:35:41.351 --> 02:35:42.570
<v Speaker 2>and I in and you know,</v>

5893
02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:44.440
<v Speaker 2>it made it hard for me in 98,</v>

5894
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:45.690
<v Speaker 2>99 and 2000,</v>

5895
02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:46.810
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

5896
02:35:46.810 --> 02:35:47.310
<v Speaker 2>and in it,</v>

5897
02:35:47.310 --> 02:35:49.360
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm getting the same kind of thing again.</v>

5898
02:35:49.361 --> 02:35:49.541
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5899
02:35:49.541 --> 02:35:52.690
<v Speaker 2>we're now a lot of people are buying these social media stocks and you know,</v>

5900
02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:53.040
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

5901
02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:53.350
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

5902
02:35:53.350 --> 02:35:53.511
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

5903
02:35:53.511 --> 02:35:53.720
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

5904
02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:54.940
<v Speaker 2>they're succumbing to the hype.</v>

5905
02:35:54.941 --> 02:35:55.311
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

5906
02:35:55.311 --> 02:35:55.421
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5907
02:35:55.421 --> 02:35:58.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of similarities between what's going on now in the markets and</v>

5908
02:35:58.751 --> 02:36:00.460
<v Speaker 2>what was going on in the late 19 nineties.</v>

5909
02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:00.881
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5910
02:36:00.881 --> 02:36:02.050
<v Speaker 2>people forget the past.</v>

5911
02:36:02.051 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 2>They keep reliving it.</v>

5912
02:36:03.250 --> 02:36:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's recent,</v>

5913
02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5914
02:36:05.170 --> 02:36:05.920
<v Speaker 2>it shows you how,</v>

5915
02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:07.290
<v Speaker 2>how worthless our schools are.</v>

5916
02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean the history,</v>

5917
02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:09.760
<v Speaker 2>not only don't they know,</v>

5918
02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:10.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5919
02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:11.200
<v Speaker 2>history of fifth year,</v>

5920
02:36:11.201 --> 02:36:12.010
<v Speaker 2>100 years ago,</v>

5921
02:36:12.010 --> 02:36:14.200
<v Speaker 2>people don't even know history from five or 10 years ago.</v>

5922
02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:15.190
<v Speaker 2>That's how ignorant they are.</v>

5923
02:36:15.610 --> 02:36:16.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about bitcoin?</v>

5924
02:36:17.050 --> 02:36:18.520
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about cryptocurrencies?</v>

5925
02:36:18.700 --> 02:36:19.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about emerging?</v>

5926
02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:20.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5927
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.371
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

5928
02:36:21.371 --> 02:36:26.140
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people that are libertarian or some people that believe in</v>

5929
02:36:26.141 --> 02:36:26.651
<v Speaker 2>hard money.</v>

5930
02:36:26.651 --> 02:36:27.990
<v Speaker 2>There are people that believe in goal that,</v>

5931
02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:30.520
<v Speaker 2>that are in Bitcoin and you know,</v>

5932
02:36:31.450 --> 02:36:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lot of people who bought bitcoin a few years ago and you know,</v>

5933
02:36:36.250 --> 02:36:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy it and sure,</v>

5934
02:36:37.211 --> 02:36:37.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5935
02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had bought them because I would be selling them now.</v>

5936
02:36:39.911 --> 02:36:41.080
<v Speaker 2>In fact that would have already sold them.</v>

5937
02:36:41.081 --> 02:36:42.130
<v Speaker 2>So jumped in already.</v>

5938
02:36:42.250 --> 02:36:43.083
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5939
02:36:43.570 --> 02:36:44.351
<v Speaker 2>Because I think it's,</v>

5940
02:36:44.351 --> 02:36:45.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bubble.</v>

5941
02:36:45.191 --> 02:36:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I think that I think that are going to be collapsed here with Vegas casinos to</v>

5942
02:36:49.091 --> 02:36:51.160
<v Speaker 2>casinos just started accepting bitcoin.</v>

5943
02:36:51.370 --> 02:36:51.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5944
02:36:51.551 --> 02:36:52.384
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5945
02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I think merchants starting to accept bitcoins are actually going to be negative</v>

5946
02:36:56.860 --> 02:36:57.481
<v Speaker 2>for bitcoins.</v>

5947
02:36:57.481 --> 02:36:58.314
<v Speaker 2>Non Positive.</v>

5948
02:36:59.050 --> 02:36:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Well here's why.</v>

5949
02:36:59.770 --> 02:37:00.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5950
02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:03.880
<v Speaker 2>when bitcoins went up from Penny's a coin to a thousand dollars,</v>

5951
02:37:04.090 --> 02:37:04.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5952
02:37:04.390 --> 02:37:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you know you,</v>

5953
02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:07.500
<v Speaker 2>you really couldn't do much with them except Horta.</v>

5954
02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:09.100
<v Speaker 2>So before you go there,</v>

5955
02:37:09.310 --> 02:37:10.143
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

5956
02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:11.231
<v Speaker 2>sorry to interrupt you,</v>

5957
02:37:11.231 --> 02:37:13.420
<v Speaker 2>but explain to me what is it actually worth?</v>

5958
02:37:13.540 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 2>What is a bit coin is worth whatever somebody will</v>

5959
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:16.581
<v Speaker 3>give you for it.</v>

5960
02:37:16.581 --> 02:37:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean it has no actual value because you can't do anything with it.</v>

5961
02:37:19.610 --> 02:37:21.140
<v Speaker 3>All you can do is give it to somebody else.</v>

5962
02:37:21.170 --> 02:37:22.700
<v Speaker 3>So what is it in ones?</v>

5963
02:37:22.701 --> 02:37:25.010
<v Speaker 3>It means it in one bitcoin to bitcoin.</v>

5964
02:37:25.330 --> 02:37:26.450
<v Speaker 3>What is the volume?</v>

5965
02:37:26.451 --> 02:37:27.200
<v Speaker 3>What is the.</v>

5966
02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:29.200
<v Speaker 3>They usually sell them into one bitcoin,</v>

5967
02:37:29.210 --> 02:37:29.960
<v Speaker 3>but you can bake.</v>

5968
02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:33.510
<v Speaker 3>You can break a bitcoin up into like 100,000 pizza.</v>

5969
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:33.620
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

5970
02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:33.861
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5971
02:37:33.861 --> 02:37:34.340
<v Speaker 3>But give me,</v>

5972
02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:35.270
<v Speaker 3>how much is the pizza?</v>

5973
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:36.800
<v Speaker 3>How many bitcoins is a pizza?</v>

5974
02:37:36.930 --> 02:37:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5975
02:37:37.370 --> 02:37:39.290
<v Speaker 3>a fraction because right now an entire.</v>

5976
02:37:39.490 --> 02:37:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Well an entire bitcoin right now is what?</v>

5977
02:37:41.571 --> 02:37:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Nine hundred and $50.</v>

5978
02:37:42.681 --> 02:37:44.270
<v Speaker 3>So how many pizza you can get?</v>

5979
02:37:44.271 --> 02:37:45.440
<v Speaker 3>A pizza is like $9.</v>

5980
02:37:45.441 --> 02:37:45.821
<v Speaker 3>Fifty cents.</v>

5981
02:37:45.821 --> 02:37:46.800
<v Speaker 3>So you get like 100 pizza.</v>

5982
02:37:46.801 --> 02:37:48.470
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have any other thing other than a bitcoin.</v>

5983
02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:48.980
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

5984
02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:49.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just a bit coin.</v>

5985
02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5986
02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can get bitcoin.</v>

5987
02:37:51.770 --> 02:37:52.603
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can get,</v>

5988
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5989
02:37:52.881 --> 02:37:53.750
<v Speaker 3>fractional coins.</v>

5990
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:54.890
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to buy a whole coin.</v>

5991
02:37:55.010 --> 02:37:56.030
<v Speaker 3>You have to figure it out.</v>

5992
02:37:56.180 --> 02:37:57.650
<v Speaker 3>You have to have like Nicole quarter.</v>

5993
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:58.291
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5994
02:37:58.291 --> 02:37:59.170
<v Speaker 3>it's just bitcoin.</v>

5995
02:37:59.210 --> 02:38:00.980
<v Speaker 3>You could have a decade,</v>

5996
02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:02.480
<v Speaker 3>a decade coin is sent a coin,</v>

5997
02:38:02.481 --> 02:38:04.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the exact opposite of pesos,</v>

5998
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:06.490
<v Speaker 3>like a million pesos dollar,</v>

5999
02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:10.010
<v Speaker 3>but the important thing is that you can't do anything with it.</v>

6000
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6001
02:38:10.761 --> 02:38:11.840
<v Speaker 3>there's no actual value.</v>

6002
02:38:11.850 --> 02:38:13.430
<v Speaker 3>We think about drugs right now.</v>

6003
02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:15.631
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

6004
02:38:15.631 --> 02:38:15.930
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

6005
02:38:15.930 --> 02:38:18.710
<v Speaker 3>you can spend it as long as somebody is willing to take it.</v>

6006
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6007
02:38:19.250 --> 02:38:20.570
<v Speaker 3>But there's no end user.</v>

6008
02:38:20.571 --> 02:38:20.961
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>

6009
02:38:20.961 --> 02:38:23.810
<v Speaker 3>It's not a commodity like the same with our currency.</v>

6010
02:38:23.811 --> 02:38:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Currently the currency is crap.</v>

6011
02:38:25.671 --> 02:38:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean I might,</v>

6012
02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:30.170
<v Speaker 3>you know why bitcoin is crap in our currency is the difference between the crap,</v>

6013
02:38:30.171 --> 02:38:34.250
<v Speaker 3>the government issues and bitcoins is the crap the government issues for now as</v>

6014
02:38:34.251 --> 02:38:35.084
<v Speaker 3>legal tender.</v>

6015
02:38:35.210 --> 02:38:35.590
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

6016
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6017
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:36.620
<v Speaker 3>people will accept it.</v>

6018
02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I can pay my taxes in it.</v>

6019
02:38:37.911 --> 02:38:39.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have a use for it,</v>

6020
02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6021
02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:41.510
<v Speaker 3>But it's the government is saying it's legal tender.</v>

6022
02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:44.930
<v Speaker 3>The government enforcing being someone who's so antigovernment as you.</v>

6023
02:38:44.931 --> 02:38:46.460
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that that's why own gold,</v>

6024
02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:48.410
<v Speaker 3>but you would enjoy something like bitcoin.</v>

6025
02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Bitcoin has,</v>

6026
02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:50.480
<v Speaker 3>but it has no real value.</v>

6027
02:38:50.481 --> 02:38:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I recognize that it could collapse.</v>

6028
02:38:52.191 --> 02:38:52.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

6029
02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:54.170
<v Speaker 3>There's no agrees there's a value.</v>

6030
02:38:54.171 --> 02:38:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there a value just like we do tomorrow?</v>

6031
02:38:56.931 --> 02:38:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can agree.</v>

6032
02:38:57.801 --> 02:38:58.634
<v Speaker 3>There's no value.</v>

6033
02:38:58.750 --> 02:38:59.583
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

6034
02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:02.540
<v Speaker 3>gold was valuable long before it became money.</v>

6035
02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Bitcoin had no value until it became money,</v>

6036
02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:08.330
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it can withstand the test of time.</v>

6037
02:39:08.331 --> 02:39:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it represents a store of value,</v>

6038
02:39:09.951 --> 02:39:12.110
<v Speaker 3>but let me tell you why you say that though,</v>

6039
02:39:12.111 --> 02:39:13.550
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't like we don't.</v>

6040
02:39:13.551 --> 02:39:14.780
<v Speaker 3>We're not on the gold standard right now.</v>

6041
02:39:14.781 --> 02:39:17.840
<v Speaker 3>I know our dollars are essentially just like bitcoin.</v>

6042
02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:18.471
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6043
02:39:18.471 --> 02:39:19.580
<v Speaker 3>they're not just like it,</v>

6044
02:39:19.581 --> 02:39:20.460
<v Speaker 3>but not be.</v>

6045
02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

6046
02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:22.940
<v Speaker 3>The government won't accept bitcoins in payment,</v>

6047
02:39:22.941 --> 02:39:23.630
<v Speaker 3>in cash.</v>

6048
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:24.441
<v Speaker 3>The motherfuckers.</v>

6049
02:39:24.441 --> 02:39:24.711
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

6050
02:39:24.711 --> 02:39:25.370
<v Speaker 3>Then eventually,</v>

6051
02:39:25.370 --> 02:39:26.180
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you though,</v>

6052
02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:27.110
<v Speaker 3>if you go,</v>

6053
02:39:27.111 --> 02:39:30.500
<v Speaker 3>if I go to a store that accepts dollars and I pay with dollars,</v>

6054
02:39:30.501 --> 02:39:31.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6055
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:32.360
<v Speaker 3>They don't sell my dollars.</v>

6056
02:39:32.361 --> 02:39:35.600
<v Speaker 3>They use their dollars to pay their employees their wages.</v>

6057
02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:38.390
<v Speaker 3>They use their dollars to pay their landlord the rent.</v>

6058
02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:40.970
<v Speaker 3>They use their dollars to pay their salary.</v>

6059
02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:41.840
<v Speaker 3>The employer,</v>

6060
02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:43.760
<v Speaker 3>the owner of the business takes the dollars,</v>

6061
02:39:43.850 --> 02:39:44.840
<v Speaker 3>pays his mortgage.</v>

6062
02:39:45.090 --> 02:39:46.790
<v Speaker 3>He pays his tuition for A.</v>

6063
02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:47.753
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody uses it.</v>

6064
02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Here's what's going on with bitcoin.</v>

6065
02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:52.070
<v Speaker 3>So a merchant decides to accept Bitcoin,</v>

6066
02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:54.260
<v Speaker 3>they don't price their products in bitcoin.</v>

6067
02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:58.550
<v Speaker 3>What they do is they allow you to pay with bitcoins using bitpay,</v>

6068
02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:00.560
<v Speaker 3>but then what they do with those bitcoins,</v>

6069
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:01.490
<v Speaker 3>the minute they get them,</v>

6070
02:40:01.491 --> 02:40:02.324
<v Speaker 3>they sell them.</v>

6071
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:03.051
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

6072
02:40:03.051 --> 02:40:05.900
<v Speaker 3>so now the more merchants that accept bitcoins,</v>

6073
02:40:06.020 --> 02:40:07.850
<v Speaker 3>now all of these bitcoins are for sale.</v>

6074
02:40:08.060 --> 02:40:08.301
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

6075
02:40:08.301 --> 02:40:10.520
<v Speaker 3>before when very few people accepted them,</v>

6076
02:40:10.730 --> 02:40:11.980
<v Speaker 3>everybody was hoarding them,</v>

6077
02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>and so the reason the price was going up</v>

6078
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:16.950
<v Speaker 2>is because nobody was actually spending were very few people,</v>

6079
02:40:17.130 --> 02:40:19.200
<v Speaker 2>but as more and more merchants accept them,</v>

6080
02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:22.710
<v Speaker 2>now people take bit coins that they were hoarding and they go to spend them,</v>

6081
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:26.400
<v Speaker 2>but now the merchants want to get rid of them because they need dollars or euros</v>

6082
02:40:26.401 --> 02:40:27.270
<v Speaker 2>or whatever their currency is,</v>

6083
02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:28.380
<v Speaker 2>who's going to buy them.</v>

6084
02:40:28.770 --> 02:40:29.341
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

6085
02:40:29.341 --> 02:40:31.500
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Bitcoin for the past few months,</v>

6086
02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:32.880
<v Speaker 2>they haven't been going up anymore.</v>

6087
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:33.900
<v Speaker 2>They stopped going up.</v>

6088
02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a distribution top,</v>

6089
02:40:36.121 --> 02:40:36.954
<v Speaker 2>most likely.</v>

6090
02:40:37.290 --> 02:40:37.681
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6091
02:40:37.681 --> 02:40:40.260
<v Speaker 2>and I think the bottom eventually is going to drop out of the market.</v>

6092
02:40:40.261 --> 02:40:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people who own bitcoins are gonna.</v>

6093
02:40:42.890 --> 02:40:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6094
02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:44.400
<v Speaker 2>the fear is going to take over.</v>

6095
02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Not The greed right now.</v>

6096
02:40:45.421 --> 02:40:46.590
<v Speaker 2>People who have bitcoins,</v>

6097
02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:47.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6098
02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:47.211
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

6099
02:40:47.211 --> 02:40:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6100
02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:47.640
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

6101
02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:50.040
<v Speaker 2>they think they're going to become billionaires if they just hold them long</v>

6102
02:40:50.041 --> 02:40:50.850
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

6103
02:40:50.850 --> 02:40:54.030
<v Speaker 2>I think at some point they're going to be worried about losing what they have</v>

6104
02:40:54.031 --> 02:40:55.050
<v Speaker 2>rather than getting more.</v>

6105
02:40:55.230 --> 02:40:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

6106
02:40:55.610 --> 02:40:55.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6107
02:40:55.860 --> 02:40:55.941
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6108
02:40:55.941 --> 02:40:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6109
02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:56.540
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6110
02:40:56.540 --> 02:40:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to start using them.</v>

6111
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:59.460
<v Speaker 2>They're going to try to get rid of them.</v>

6112
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.881
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

6113
02:40:59.881 --> 02:41:00.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6114
02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I know now is it possible that bitcoin's go to $2,000,</v>

6115
02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:06.090
<v Speaker 2>$3,000?</v>

6116
02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:07.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6117
02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6118
02:41:07.450 --> 02:41:07.681
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

6119
02:41:07.681 --> 02:41:08.514
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>

6120
02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Is it probable viable alternative to the dollar?</v>

6121
02:41:11.340 --> 02:41:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6122
02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:12.793
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6123
02:41:12.810 --> 02:41:13.643
<v Speaker 2>because look,</v>

6124
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:14.550
<v Speaker 2>there's already,</v>

6125
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.830
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

6126
02:41:14.830 --> 02:41:19.830
<v Speaker 2>you go to this website called a coin value.com or some crypto currencies.</v>

6127
02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:25.740
<v Speaker 2>There's like 60 or 70 digital currencies that have already been created.</v>

6128
02:41:26.190 --> 02:41:27.810
<v Speaker 2>People talk about the fact that,</v>

6129
02:41:27.811 --> 02:41:28.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6130
02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:29.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6131
02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:34.740
<v Speaker 2>there's only 21 million potential bitcoins that can be mined into existence,</v>

6132
02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:40.280
<v Speaker 2>but what they don't say is there as an unlimited number of alternative digital</v>

6133
02:41:40.591 --> 02:41:42.960
<v Speaker 2>currencies that can be created that are identical,</v>

6134
02:41:42.961 --> 02:41:43.680
<v Speaker 2>the Bitcoin,</v>

6135
02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:45.360
<v Speaker 2>some might be better than bitcoin.</v>

6136
02:41:45.620 --> 02:41:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6137
02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:46.440
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6138
02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:48.930
<v Speaker 2>and so you can keep creating them.</v>

6139
02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:49.570
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6140
02:41:49.570 --> 02:41:51.480
<v Speaker 2>and so what does that mean?</v>

6141
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:52.201
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

6142
02:41:52.201 --> 02:41:52.741
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

6143
02:41:52.741 --> 02:41:53.041
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6144
02:41:53.041 --> 02:41:54.360
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin got here first,</v>

6145
02:41:54.361 --> 02:41:56.970
<v Speaker 2>therefore it's always going to be the one that everybody wants.</v>

6146
02:41:57.270 --> 02:41:57.481
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6147
02:41:57.481 --> 02:41:58.890
<v Speaker 2>does everybody use my space?</v>

6148
02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Facebook wasn't run.</v>

6149
02:42:01.370 --> 02:42:02.430
<v Speaker 2>How many cryptocurrencies?</v>

6150
02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:03.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6151
02:42:03.231 --> 02:42:04.064
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

6152
02:42:04.090 --> 02:42:06.210
<v Speaker 2>do you use aol is your Internet provider.</v>

6153
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were first,</v>

6154
02:42:08.850 --> 02:42:09.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6155
02:42:09.121 --> 02:42:10.480
<v Speaker 2>just because you're male,</v>

6156
02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean doesn't mean anything.</v>

6157
02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:13.920
<v Speaker 2>This is all a butler,</v>

6158
02:42:13.970 --> 02:42:14.160
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

6159
02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:14.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6160
02:42:14.350 --> 02:42:14.881
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

6161
02:42:14.881 --> 02:42:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of similarities in the people who are irrationally defending,</v>

6162
02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:19.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6163
02:42:19.460 --> 02:42:19.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6164
02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:23.520
<v Speaker 2>the Bitcoin to what I saw in the Dotcom bubble or the real estate bubble.</v>

6165
02:42:23.521 --> 02:42:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

6166
02:42:23.770 --> 02:42:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6167
02:42:24.170 --> 02:42:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6168
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.901
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6169
02:42:24.901 --> 02:42:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I believe in sound money.</v>

6170
02:42:26.911 --> 02:42:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I want to take power away from government.</v>

6171
02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:29.730
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

6172
02:42:29.730 --> 02:42:29.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6173
02:42:29.911 --> 02:42:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people,</v>

6174
02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:34.350
<v Speaker 2>if they get into the bitcoin market now they're going to lose a lot of money,</v>

6175
02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:36.060
<v Speaker 2>even if it goes higher first.</v>

6176
02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I think eventually it goes down.</v>

6177
02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Now I know there's a lot of people that got in early who have a vested interest</v>

6178
02:42:42.001 --> 02:42:44.730
<v Speaker 2>in expanding the market so they can sell,</v>

6179
02:42:44.731 --> 02:42:46.210
<v Speaker 2>they can cash out and,</v>

6180
02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:46.510
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6181
02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:50.250
<v Speaker 2>and actually convert their paper wealth into real things that they want to buy.</v>

6182
02:42:50.830 --> 02:42:51.663
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6183
02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:52.261
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

6184
02:42:52.261 --> 02:42:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I know it makes me unpopular with some people because they,</v>

6185
02:42:54.711 --> 02:42:54.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6186
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:55.710
<v Speaker 2>they want me out there,</v>

6187
02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:57.570
<v Speaker 2>they want everybody in the hard money community,</v>

6188
02:42:57.700 --> 02:42:58.140
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

6189
02:42:58.140 --> 02:42:58.770
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

6190
02:42:58.770 --> 02:43:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I am an equal opportunity bubble spotter.</v>

6191
02:43:01.350 --> 02:43:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not going to let my ideology get in my way,</v>

6192
02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:04.661
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

6193
02:43:04.661 --> 02:43:06.060
<v Speaker 2>So if I see a housing bubble,</v>

6194
02:43:06.090 --> 02:43:06.631
<v Speaker 2>it's a bubble,</v>

6195
02:43:06.631 --> 02:43:06.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6196
02:43:06.781 --> 02:43:09.990
<v Speaker 2>if it looks like it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck and quacks like a</v>

6197
02:43:09.991 --> 02:43:10.231
<v Speaker 2>duck,</v>

6198
02:43:10.231 --> 02:43:10.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a duck.</v>

6199
02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if I have something</v>

6200
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:16.090
<v Speaker 3>philosophically in common with people who are anti fed,</v>

6201
02:43:16.250 --> 02:43:16.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6202
02:43:16.690 --> 02:43:17.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6203
02:43:17.070 --> 02:43:17.560
<v Speaker 3>wanting to.</v>

6204
02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:20.110
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that the bitcoin now,</v>

6205
02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:23.500
<v Speaker 3>if you get a real digital currency backed by gold,</v>

6206
02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:23.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6207
02:43:23.891 --> 02:43:26.230
<v Speaker 3>I can be on board with that because if you go back,</v>

6208
02:43:26.290 --> 02:43:27.610
<v Speaker 3>the original paper money,</v>

6209
02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:30.850
<v Speaker 3>right was backed by gold and it was issued by private banks,</v>

6210
02:43:30.851 --> 02:43:31.684
<v Speaker 3>not in government.</v>

6211
02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:35.510
<v Speaker 3>It was like the original warehouse receipt from a Goldsmith and they,</v>

6212
02:43:35.690 --> 02:43:38.080
<v Speaker 3>they had your gold and they would issue an Iou and the.</v>

6213
02:43:38.081 --> 02:43:39.040
<v Speaker 3>And it would circulate.</v>

6214
02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:40.240
<v Speaker 3>It would be a substitute for my.</v>

6215
02:43:40.250 --> 02:43:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Have a stockpile of gold somewhere.</v>

6216
02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:42.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6217
02:43:42.491 --> 02:43:42.720
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>

6218
02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:43.930
<v Speaker 3>But you'd have something real,</v>

6219
02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:44.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6220
02:43:44.621 --> 02:43:45.730
<v Speaker 3>right now you don't know.</v>

6221
02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:46.381
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

6222
02:43:46.381 --> 02:43:46.601
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

6223
02:43:46.601 --> 02:43:46.810
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

6224
02:43:46.810 --> 02:43:50.200
<v Speaker 3>you can't put your savings into bitcoin or the thousand dollars.</v>

6225
02:43:50.201 --> 02:43:52.000
<v Speaker 3>There's no history of value to bitcoin.</v>

6226
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6227
02:43:52.420 --> 02:43:53.710
<v Speaker 3>how much does bitcoin worth,</v>

6228
02:43:53.711 --> 02:43:54.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6229
02:43:54.050 --> 02:43:54.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6230
02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:55.510
<v Speaker 3>they mentioned some guy you know,</v>

6231
02:43:55.511 --> 02:43:55.901
<v Speaker 3>sells,</v>

6232
02:43:55.901 --> 02:43:56.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6233
02:43:56.081 --> 02:43:58.420
<v Speaker 3>bought a house for $7,000,000 worth of bitcoins.</v>

6234
02:43:58.540 --> 02:43:58.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6235
02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:59.860
<v Speaker 3>are you going to accept,</v>

6236
02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:00.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6237
02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:02.620
<v Speaker 3>7 million bitcoins for your house?</v>

6238
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6239
02:44:03.070 --> 02:44:05.170
<v Speaker 3>how do you know what those bitcoins will be worth next year?</v>

6240
02:44:05.250 --> 02:44:05.560
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

6241
02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:05.741
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6242
02:44:05.741 --> 02:44:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I sold my house for this pile of bitcoins.</v>

6243
02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:10.810
<v Speaker 3>The only reason you'll do that is because you can dump your bitcoins on the</v>

6244
02:44:10.811 --> 02:44:12.790
<v Speaker 3>market and get something else.</v>

6245
02:44:12.791 --> 02:44:13.330
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

6246
02:44:13.330 --> 02:44:14.790
<v Speaker 3>there's no real frame of reference.</v>

6247
02:44:14.810 --> 02:44:16.510
<v Speaker 3>And this is very recent though,</v>

6248
02:44:16.511 --> 02:44:17.344
<v Speaker 3>and very new.</v>

6249
02:44:17.490 --> 02:44:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Is there just a few years old will the dollar bill is how old?</v>

6250
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Well the.</v>

6251
02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Well the ones that are not backed by nothing started in 1970.</v>

6252
02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:26.500
<v Speaker 3>That like looking at a baby and go,</v>

6253
02:44:26.501 --> 02:44:28.150
<v Speaker 3>this little motherfucker is not going to be shit.</v>

6254
02:44:28.151 --> 02:44:29.050
<v Speaker 3>He can't talk.</v>

6255
02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:30.033
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know how to change.</v>

6256
02:44:30.990 --> 02:44:32.710
<v Speaker 3>The only reason amount to anything,</v>

6257
02:44:32.711 --> 02:44:35.530
<v Speaker 3>but the only reason the dollar worked for awhile,</v>

6258
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:39.130
<v Speaker 3>not backed by gold and it hasn't worked very well is because it had a history of</v>

6259
02:44:39.131 --> 02:44:40.210
<v Speaker 3>being backed by something.</v>

6260
02:44:40.210 --> 02:44:42.070
<v Speaker 3>So the public was kind of fooled.</v>

6261
02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:44.380
<v Speaker 3>They were using currency backed by Ronnie.</v>

6262
02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:45.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not anymore.</v>

6263
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this bitcoin baby grows up.</v>

6264
02:44:48.311 --> 02:44:50.170
<v Speaker 3>He's going to realize this dollar that everybody's been.</v>

6265
02:44:50.171 --> 02:44:50.561
<v Speaker 3>Hold it over.</v>

6266
02:44:50.561 --> 02:44:52.570
<v Speaker 3>My head as being superior is just older.</v>

6267
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6268
02:44:52.841 --> 02:44:53.171
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>

6269
02:44:53.171 --> 02:44:56.890
<v Speaker 3>if you some old asshole that just happens to be a dad but doesn't know fucking</v>

6270
02:44:56.891 --> 02:44:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Jack Shit about the way the world runs and he's telling you how to live your</v>

6271
02:44:59.831 --> 02:45:00.101
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

6272
02:45:00.101 --> 02:45:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile he's a fucking mess.</v>

6273
02:45:01.450 --> 02:45:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe bitcoin's going to grow up.</v>

6274
02:45:02.801 --> 02:45:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe bitcoin's a little baby that doesn't know shit now,</v>

6275
02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:07.900
<v Speaker 3>but one day bitcoin's going to grow up and realize,</v>

6276
02:45:07.901 --> 02:45:08.470
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

6277
02:45:08.470 --> 02:45:09.303
<v Speaker 3>There's a better way.</v>

6278
02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:09.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6279
02:45:09.791 --> 02:45:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's the people buying them that,</v>

6280
02:45:11.971 --> 02:45:12.611
<v Speaker 3>that would grow up.</v>

6281
02:45:12.611 --> 02:45:12.881
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

6282
02:45:12.881 --> 02:45:13.750
<v Speaker 3>there is you,</v>

6283
02:45:13.751 --> 02:45:15.850
<v Speaker 3>you have people get used to it.</v>

6284
02:45:15.851 --> 02:45:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at the money that we have now that change,</v>

6285
02:45:18.010 --> 02:45:18.843
<v Speaker 3>you look at a quarter,</v>

6286
02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:19.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6287
02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:20.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6288
02:45:20.091 --> 02:45:20.500
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

6289
02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:21.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6290
02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:21.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6291
02:45:21.250 --> 02:45:21.731
<v Speaker 3>if you look,</v>

6292
02:45:21.731 --> 02:45:24.130
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the ridges of a quarter at the side of a quarter,</v>

6293
02:45:24.131 --> 02:45:24.891
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that it's,</v>

6294
02:45:24.891 --> 02:45:25.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6295
02:45:25.050 --> 02:45:25.690
<v Speaker 3>it's got,</v>

6296
02:45:25.690 --> 02:45:25.890
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6297
02:45:25.890 --> 02:45:26.160
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6298
02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:28.000
<v Speaker 3>it's got these ridges on the sides.</v>

6299
02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:29.161
<v Speaker 3>And people said,</v>

6300
02:45:29.161 --> 02:45:29.261
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6301
02:45:29.261 --> 02:45:29.980
<v Speaker 3>why are they there?</v>

6302
02:45:29.980 --> 02:45:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Why are there these ridges and why is a quarter even silver in color?</v>

6303
02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Because it's,</v>

6304
02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:34.670
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6305
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:35.391
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly,</v>

6306
02:45:35.391 --> 02:45:35.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6307
02:45:35.770 --> 02:45:39.580
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly made of copper and it's coated with a little bit of zinc,</v>

6308
02:45:39.730 --> 02:45:42.730
<v Speaker 3>but why does the government go through the process of,</v>

6309
02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:43.030
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

6310
02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:43.261
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

6311
02:45:43.261 --> 02:45:47.380
<v Speaker 3>of binding zinc to copper and why do they go through the expense of making all</v>

6312
02:45:47.390 --> 02:45:49.510
<v Speaker 3>these little ridges on the sides of the coin?</v>

6313
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.931
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6314
02:45:49.931 --> 02:45:54.430
<v Speaker 3>it's because the coins were originally made a silver and they read the ridges</v>

6315
02:45:54.431 --> 02:45:58.330
<v Speaker 3>were there so you couldn't shave that you couldn't flip the coin because when it</v>

6316
02:45:58.331 --> 02:46:02.020
<v Speaker 3>was valuable silver people would try to take some of the silver off the coin and</v>

6317
02:46:02.021 --> 02:46:02.854
<v Speaker 3>then spend it.</v>

6318
02:46:03.070 --> 02:46:03.820
<v Speaker 3>But when.</v>

6319
02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:04.840
<v Speaker 3>But when the government,</v>

6320
02:46:04.841 --> 02:46:08.590
<v Speaker 3>nobody is going to clip the cops on why those old coins are always fucked up and</v>

6321
02:46:08.591 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 3>they never like totally circular.</v>

6322
02:46:10.450 --> 02:46:11.780
<v Speaker 4>See like old Roman poet.</v>

6323
02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:12.633
<v Speaker 4>So they'll just worn out,</v>

6324
02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:13.903
<v Speaker 4>worn out</v>

6325
02:46:15.090 --> 02:46:15.440
<v Speaker 2>slightly.</v>

6326
02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:16.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a Roman coin.</v>

6327
02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:17.390
<v Speaker 2>It's worn out,</v>

6328
02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:18.493
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

6329
02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:22.160
<v Speaker 2>but when the government originally made a quarters,</v>

6330
02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:23.540
<v Speaker 2>when they took the silver out,</v>

6331
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:25.760
<v Speaker 2>they made it look like the old silver coins,</v>

6332
02:46:25.761 --> 02:46:27.230
<v Speaker 2>even though there was no silver in there.</v>

6333
02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:29.540
<v Speaker 2>It was like people were used to silver coins.</v>

6334
02:46:29.541 --> 02:46:30.980
<v Speaker 2>And so when the government debase them,</v>

6335
02:46:30.981 --> 02:46:31.460
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

6336
02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:34.880
<v Speaker 2>that's where the word the comes from the roads or Roman is when the Romans,</v>

6337
02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:35.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6338
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:39.200
<v Speaker 2>debase their currency by putting base metal into the currency instead of gold.</v>

6339
02:46:39.340 --> 02:46:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6340
02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:40.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

6341
02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:41.090
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

6342
02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:42.950
<v Speaker 2>they dumb you down over time.</v>

6343
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:44.750
<v Speaker 2>But now our money is just tokens.</v>

6344
02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:45.950
<v Speaker 2>So we don't have any real money.</v>

6345
02:46:46.010 --> 02:46:46.850
<v Speaker 2>And we have Fiat,</v>

6346
02:46:46.851 --> 02:46:47.960
<v Speaker 2>we have counterfeit paper,</v>

6347
02:46:47.961 --> 02:46:49.310
<v Speaker 2>we have tokens for coins,</v>

6348
02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:49.800
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

6349
02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:50.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6350
02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:54.860
<v Speaker 2>we have this monetary system that is the root cause of all the problems that we</v>

6351
02:46:54.861 --> 02:46:55.101
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

6352
02:46:55.101 --> 02:46:56.510
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's all coming to a head.</v>

6353
02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.871
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

6354
02:46:56.871 --> 02:46:57.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6355
02:46:57.290 --> 02:47:00.600
<v Speaker 2>we're at the end of the game now and it's about to blow up and you know,</v>

6356
02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:04.100
<v Speaker 2>the 2008 financial crisis.</v>

6357
02:47:04.130 --> 02:47:05.540
<v Speaker 2>That was the beginning of the end.</v>

6358
02:47:05.541 --> 02:47:07.370
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the end of it right there.</v>

6359
02:47:07.371 --> 02:47:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Real,</v>

6360
02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:08.930
<v Speaker 2>real crash is coming.</v>

6361
02:47:08.931 --> 02:47:09.261
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

6362
02:47:09.261 --> 02:47:09.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6363
02:47:09.411 --> 02:47:10.670
<v Speaker 2>if you go and look at my book,</v>

6364
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:11.810
<v Speaker 2>the book that I wrote,</v>

6365
02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:14.000
<v Speaker 2>crash proof that came out in February.</v>

6366
02:47:14.001 --> 02:47:14.834
<v Speaker 2>Oh seven.</v>

6367
02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:18.710
<v Speaker 2>The crash that I was writing about isn't the one that happened in 2008.</v>

6368
02:47:18.740 --> 02:47:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Even though I predicted that crash,</v>

6369
02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:23.090
<v Speaker 2>the crash that I was worried about was the one that's coming,</v>

6370
02:47:23.330 --> 02:47:26.450
<v Speaker 2>the one that was going to be a consequence of what I knew the government was</v>

6371
02:47:26.451 --> 02:47:31.130
<v Speaker 2>going to do to artificially stimulate the economy after the 2008 financial</v>

6372
02:47:31.131 --> 02:47:31.964
<v Speaker 2>crisis I was,</v>

6373
02:47:32.090 --> 02:47:35.890
<v Speaker 2>I was against the government bailouts and the stimulus before the government</v>

6374
02:47:35.891 --> 02:47:38.810
<v Speaker 2>even knew they were going to do it because I knew exactly what they were going</v>

6375
02:47:38.811 --> 02:47:41.600
<v Speaker 2>to do and unfortunately I was right about that.</v>

6376
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:42.111
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

6377
02:47:42.111 --> 02:47:43.310
<v Speaker 2>you know my book that's out now,</v>

6378
02:47:43.311 --> 02:47:44.360

02:48:05.260 --> 02:48:05.830
<v Speaker 4>So we've,</v>

6397
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:06.910
<v Speaker 4>we've figured out a lot of things.</v>

6398
02:48:06.911 --> 02:48:08.500
<v Speaker 4>We figured out Fuck Lake Michigan.</v>

6399
02:48:08.810 --> 02:48:09.643
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6400
02:48:10.530 --> 02:48:13.710
<v Speaker 4>that scenario until off lake.</v>

6401
02:48:14.170 --> 02:48:15.160
<v Speaker 4>I Love Lake Michigan,</v>

6402
02:48:15.161 --> 02:48:15.830
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong.</v>

6403
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:16.360
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6404
02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:16.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6405
02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:20.740
<v Speaker 4>for the Department of Public Education or Department of Education,</v>

6406
02:48:20.980 --> 02:48:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Department of Energy,</v>

6407
02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:24.190
<v Speaker 4>the government itself needs to shrink down.</v>

6408
02:48:24.970 --> 02:48:26.860
<v Speaker 4>We need to have a gold based economy.</v>

6409
02:48:26.861 --> 02:48:28.810
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible based monetary system,</v>

6410
02:48:28.811 --> 02:48:30.010
<v Speaker 4>but gold based,</v>

6411
02:48:30.090 --> 02:48:30.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6412
02:48:30.301 --> 02:48:31.920
<v Speaker 2>We've got to follow the founding fathers,</v>

6413
02:48:32.010 --> 02:48:33.720
<v Speaker 2>not the guys in Congress now.</v>

6414
02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:35.280
<v Speaker 2>What do you don't know what they're talking about?</v>

6415
02:48:35.290 --> 02:48:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6416
02:48:35.390 --> 02:48:37.870
<v Speaker 4>the thing about a resource based finances,</v>

6417
02:48:37.871 --> 02:48:38.370
<v Speaker 4>what it is,</v>

6418
02:48:38.370 --> 02:48:42.400
<v Speaker 4>is it possible to have other resources and have our economy base or finances</v>

6419
02:48:42.401 --> 02:48:43.600
<v Speaker 4>based on other resources.</v>

6420
02:48:44.010 --> 02:48:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean not,</v>

6421
02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:45.141
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

6422
02:48:45.141 --> 02:48:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think the reason that gold became money,</v>

6423
02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:50.300
<v Speaker 2>and remember government didn't make gold money.</v>

6424
02:48:50.410 --> 02:48:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people made gold money and,</v>

6425
02:48:52.451 --> 02:48:57.451
<v Speaker 2>and governments just recognize that fact is because gold was a better suited,</v>

6426
02:48:59.000 --> 02:48:59.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6427
02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:03.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a better commodity to serve as money than any other commodity originally.</v>

6428
02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:05.960
<v Speaker 4>Get people to give up things for gold though.</v>

6429
02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:07.920
<v Speaker 4>But people donkeys worth a lot</v>

6430
02:49:08.290 --> 02:49:09.270
<v Speaker 1>of things with your donkey.</v>

6431
02:49:09.550 --> 02:49:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Had someone give you stupid piece of metal,</v>

6432
02:49:11.570 --> 02:49:12.403
<v Speaker 1>but people only.</v>

6433
02:49:12.890 --> 02:49:15.200
<v Speaker 2>We'll always valued gold all around the world.</v>

6434
02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because it's pretty because it's,</v>

6435
02:49:17.451 --> 02:49:17.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6436
02:49:17.601 --> 02:49:17.771
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

6437
02:49:17.771 --> 02:49:18.321
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

6438
02:49:18.321 --> 02:49:20.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a very good metal because it's very good,</v>

6439
02:49:20.031 --> 02:49:20.841
<v Speaker 2>it's malleable,</v>

6440
02:49:20.841 --> 02:49:21.800
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't tarnish,</v>

6441
02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:22.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6442
02:49:22.191 --> 02:49:22.460
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>

6443
02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:22.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6444
02:49:22.730 --> 02:49:24.500
<v Speaker 2>if there's a Spanish ship that sinks,</v>

6445
02:49:24.700 --> 02:49:25.121

<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

6447
02:49:25.370 --> 02:49:25.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6448
02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:28.580
<v Speaker 2>500 years ago if you could find the gold,</v>

6449
02:49:28.820 --> 02:49:31.550
<v Speaker 2>it's in perfect condition and they have fairly rare,</v>

6450
02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:32.271
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>

6451
02:49:32.271 --> 02:49:33.620
<v Speaker 2>you can take goal then you can,</v>

6452

<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

6453
02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:36.710
<v Speaker 2>you can make things out of it because it's very easy.</v>

6454
02:49:36.711 --> 02:49:37.100
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

6455
02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:39.320
<v Speaker 2>you can smash it down into a very thin strip.</v>

6456
02:49:39.321 --> 02:49:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Very fine pieces.</v>

6457
02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:42.740
<v Speaker 2>So it's good for jewelry is good for,</v>

6458
02:49:42.741 --> 02:49:43.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6459
02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:43.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6460
02:49:43.940 --> 02:49:44.800
<v Speaker 2>you can make dishes.</v>

6461
02:49:44.810 --> 02:49:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6462
02:49:44.980 --> 02:49:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of things that it's useful for.</v>

6463
02:49:46.791 --> 02:49:48.410
<v Speaker 2>But even before we had electronics,</v>

6464
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:50.030
<v Speaker 2>it was a symbol of wealth,</v>

6465
02:49:50.060 --> 02:49:50.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6466

02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:51.650
<v Speaker 2>if you were wealthy,</v>

6468
02:49:51.651 --> 02:49:52.281
<v Speaker 2>you had gold,</v>

6469
02:49:52.281 --> 02:49:55.100
<v Speaker 2>either you wore gold or you had it in your house,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you had gold vases or you had gold,</v>

6471
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:58.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6472
02:49:58.480 --> 02:49:58.990
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

6473
02:49:58.990 --> 02:49:59.180
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

6474
02:49:59.180 --> 02:49:59.500
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

6475
02:49:59.500 --> 02:49:59.730
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

6476
02:49:59.730 --> 02:49:59.981
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

6477
02:49:59.981 --> 02:50:00.180
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

6478
02:50:00.180 --> 02:50:00.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6479
02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:01.280
<v Speaker 2>gilded wood.</v>

6480
02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:01.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6481
02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:02.391
<v Speaker 2>golden was just,</v>

6482
02:50:02.391 --> 02:50:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6483
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:04.890
<v Speaker 2>people valued it everywhere and,</v>

6484
02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:05.101
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6485
02:50:05.101 --> 02:50:08.480
<v Speaker 2>and you can trade it and then it became money because people realized that,</v>

6486
02:50:08.481 --> 02:50:09.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6487
02:50:09.290 --> 02:50:09.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever you,</v>

6488
02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:11.930
<v Speaker 2>whatever you needed you can pay for it with gold.</v>

6489
02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Even if you didn't need the gold,</v>

6490
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6491
02:50:13.281 --> 02:50:14.490
<v Speaker 2>you can give it to somebody else who,</v>

6492
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:15.343
<v Speaker 2>who valued it.</v>

6493
02:50:15.530 --> 02:50:16.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's scarce.</v>

6494
02:50:16.371 --> 02:50:17.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's gold everywhere,</v>

6495
02:50:17.721 --> 02:50:18.980
<v Speaker 2>you can't just trip over it.</v>

6496
02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:20.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's rare.</v>

6497
02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:20.981
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6498
02:50:20.981 --> 02:50:21.840
<v Speaker 2>and people like it</v>

6499
02:50:22.130 --> 02:50:24.110
<v Speaker 1>find a new pocket of gold though and it's worth.</v>

6500
02:50:24.111 --> 02:50:24.860
<v Speaker 1>But they have,</v>

6501
02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:25.790
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to,</v>

6502
02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:26.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6503
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:27.330
<v Speaker 1>like they found this under water,</v>

6504
02:50:27.331 --> 02:50:27.770
<v Speaker 1>fresh water,</v>

6505
02:50:27.770 --> 02:50:29.720
<v Speaker 1>water lake in Antarctica under the glaciers.</v>

6506
02:50:29.810 --> 02:50:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Gigantic freshwater lake and the size of an ocean.</v>

6507
02:50:32.390 --> 02:50:33.330
<v Speaker 1>What if they dig in,</v>

6508
02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:34.730
<v Speaker 1>they find some gold somewhere and like,</v>

6509
02:50:34.731 --> 02:50:34.911
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

02:50:35.690 --> 02:50:36.800
<v Speaker 1>gold is like aluminum.</v>

6512
02:50:36.801 --> 02:50:37.280
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere,</v>

6513
02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't,</v>

6514
02:50:38.020 --> 02:50:39.050
<v Speaker 1>they haven't done it yet.</v>

6515
02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:39.920
<v Speaker 1>They're not know there.</v>

6516

<v Speaker 1>devil's advocate kind of guy.</v>

6519
02:50:41.961 --> 02:50:42.794
<v Speaker 1>Peter Schiff,</v>

6520
02:50:42.860 --> 02:50:43.420

02:50:44.561 --> 02:50:46.280
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's gold in outer space.</v>

6524
02:50:46.281 --> 02:50:46.401
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6525
02:50:46.401 --> 02:50:47.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe those golden astronauts.</v>

6526
02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6527
02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6528
02:50:48.310 --> 02:50:49.750
<v Speaker 2>how expensive is that going to be to get?</v>

6529
02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:50.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6530
02:50:50.041 --> 02:50:50.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6531
02:50:50.281 --> 02:50:50.850
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

6532
02:50:50.850 --> 02:50:51.371
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

6533
02:50:51.371 --> 02:50:51.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6534
02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:54.660
<v Speaker 1>the fringe conspiracy theory of why we like gold in the first place.</v>

6535
02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:56.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's to do with the Annunaki.</v>

6536
02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the whole story of Zechariah Section?</v>

6537
02:50:58.940 --> 02:50:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who that guy is?</v>

6538
02:51:00.090 --> 02:51:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

6539
02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:01.000
<v Speaker 1>VIVICA's,</v>

6540
02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:01.650
<v Speaker 1>he shouldn't,</v>

6541
02:51:01.650 --> 02:51:02.483
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even tell you,</v>

6542
02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:02.971
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

6543
02:51:02.971 --> 02:51:03.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6544
02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:03.620
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

6545
02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:05.220
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a bunch of series of books,</v>

6546
02:51:05.430 --> 02:51:08.400
<v Speaker 1>deciphering the Sumerian text,</v>

6547
02:51:08.570 --> 02:51:08.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6548
02:51:08.821 --> 02:51:10.530
<v Speaker 1>the oldest written language that we're aware of.</v>

6549
02:51:10.531 --> 02:51:14.340
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he believes the Sumerian texts depicts is that the</v>

6550
02:51:14.341 --> 02:51:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Annunaki or this race of beings that created human beings and they live on a</v>

6551
02:51:18.151 --> 02:51:21.690
<v Speaker 1>planet that's an elliptical orbit that comes around near Earth every 3000,</v>

6552
02:51:21.691 --> 02:51:22.560
<v Speaker 1>600 years.</v>

6553
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:25.320
<v Speaker 1>And they need goal to sustain their atmosphere.</v>

6554
02:51:25.530 --> 02:51:29.370
<v Speaker 1>They suspend particles reflective because they've ruined our atmosphere</v>

6555
02:51:29.570 --> 02:51:30.130
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere,</v>

6556
02:51:30.130 --> 02:51:31.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the way we've ruined ours,</v>

6557
02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:33.270
<v Speaker 1>like suede China's fucking up.</v>

6558
02:51:33.410 --> 02:51:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6559
02:51:33.660 --> 02:51:36.390
<v Speaker 1>they created a bunch of computers over there and they fucked up their atmosphere</v>

6560
02:51:36.391 --> 02:51:36.840
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

6561
02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:38.940
<v Speaker 1>So they have to come over to the RF,</v>

6562
02:51:39.330 --> 02:51:39.930
<v Speaker 1>take gold.</v>

6563
02:51:39.930 --> 02:51:41.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we've always used it as current,</v>

6564
02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:41.831
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

6565
02:51:41.831 --> 02:51:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I look like,</v>

6566
02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but I would,</v>

6567
02:51:43.050 --> 02:51:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I would surmise this creative,</v>

6568
02:51:44.870 --> 02:51:45.890
<v Speaker 2>my guess would be,</v>

6569
02:51:45.950 --> 02:51:48.710
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure there's intelligent life on other planets.</v>

6570
02:51:48.711 --> 02:51:51.230
<v Speaker 2>We're not the only planet to evolve the way we did,</v>

6571
02:51:51.470 --> 02:51:52.700
<v Speaker 2>but I bet that you know,</v>

6572
02:51:52.850 --> 02:51:54.830
<v Speaker 2>if there's intelligent life on other planets,</v>

6573
02:51:54.860 --> 02:51:56.030
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to value gold.</v>

6574
02:51:56.031 --> 02:51:57.710
<v Speaker 2>If you can somehow go to another planet,</v>

6575
02:51:57.711 --> 02:51:58.760
<v Speaker 2>if you can bring gold,</v>

6576
02:51:58.940 --> 02:52:00.110
<v Speaker 2>you can probably buy something.</v>

6577
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:01.550
<v Speaker 2>If you brought a bunch of paper,</v>

6578
02:52:01.551 --> 02:52:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Federal Reserve notes,</v>

6579
02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:04.130
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to give you anything for them.</v>

6580
02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's intelligent life on other planets?</v>

6581
02:52:06.250 --> 02:52:07.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a million years ahead of us.</v>

6582
02:52:07.451 --> 02:52:09.760
<v Speaker 2>They have currency and it's based on gold.</v>

6583
02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:10.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6584
02:52:10.941 --> 02:52:11.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean ahead of us.</v>

6585
02:52:11.601 --> 02:52:12.250
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>

6586
02:52:12.250 --> 02:52:13.190
<v Speaker 2>That everything,</v>

6587
02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:14.510
<v Speaker 2>they've been alive longer.</v>

6588
02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:15.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6589
02:52:15.051 --> 02:52:15.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6590
02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:18.140
<v Speaker 2>but just because they've been around longer doesn't mean that they've advanced</v>

6591
02:52:18.141 --> 02:52:18.381
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

6592
02:52:18.381 --> 02:52:20.600
<v Speaker 2>But if they have advanced more,</v>

6593
02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:23.090
<v Speaker 2>chances are they do have sound money.</v>

6594
02:52:23.420 --> 02:52:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Because I do think that if you have free markets and sound money,</v>

6595
02:52:26.241 --> 02:52:27.350
<v Speaker 2>you're going to achieve a lot more.</v>

6596
02:52:27.890 --> 02:52:31.790
<v Speaker 2>And I can only imagine how much more we would have achieved in America had we</v>

6597
02:52:31.791 --> 02:52:32.540
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

6598
02:52:32.540 --> 02:52:34.550
<v Speaker 2>we had more freedom and sound money,</v>

6599
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:35.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6600
02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:36.680
<v Speaker 2>for the past several decades.</v>

6601
02:52:36.681 --> 02:52:36.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6602
02:52:36.891 --> 02:52:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be night and day where we would be assigned from aliens to free</v>

6603
02:52:41.661 --> 02:52:42.140
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

6604
02:52:42.140 --> 02:52:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Peter Shift says aliens equal free market if they're advanced.</v>

6605
02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what you would do with bigfoot.</v>

6606
02:52:47.061 --> 02:52:47.151
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6607
02:52:47.151 --> 02:52:47.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6608
02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:48.133
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

6609
02:52:48.470 --> 02:52:49.520
<v Speaker 2>that's if they're advanced.</v>

6610
02:52:49.521 --> 02:52:49.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6611
02:52:49.701 --> 02:52:49.871
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

6612
02:52:49.871 --> 02:52:52.250
<v Speaker 2>there could be a aliens that are living in the stone age,</v>

6613
02:52:52.251 --> 02:52:52.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6614
02:52:52.401 --> 02:52:52.570
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

6615
02:52:52.570 --> 02:52:52.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6616
02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:53.573
<v Speaker 2>there might not be,</v>

6617
02:52:53.900 --> 02:52:54.291
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6618
02:52:54.291 --> 02:52:54.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6619
02:52:54.531 --> 02:52:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

6620
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:55.610
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

6621
02:52:55.610 --> 02:52:57.320
<v Speaker 2>nobody is advanced enough to get here,</v>

6622
02:52:57.350 --> 02:52:57.531
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6623
02:52:57.531 --> 02:52:57.800
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>

6624
02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:00.890
<v Speaker 2>no one's visiting us or at least I guess if they are that advanced,</v>

6625
02:53:00.891 --> 02:53:02.840
<v Speaker 2>they're advanced enough to not let us know that they're here.</v>

6626
02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:03.400
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

6627
02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:03.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6628
02:53:03.610 --> 02:53:05.890
<v Speaker 1>so all these people that are talking about Ufos are liars.</v>

6629
02:53:05.891 --> 02:53:06.431
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying,</v>

6630
02:53:06.431 --> 02:53:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Peter Schiff?</v>

6631
02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:07.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6632
02:53:07.081 --> 02:53:08.820
<v Speaker 2>they might have a vivid imagination.</v>

6633
02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:09.673
<v Speaker 2>Most likely.</v>

6634
02:53:09.850 --> 02:53:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Likely.</v>

6635
02:53:10.380 --> 02:53:10.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

6636
02:53:10.860 --> 02:53:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6637
02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:11.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6638
02:53:11.650 --> 02:53:12.440
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

6639
02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:14.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's not impossible.</v>

6640
02:53:14.101 --> 02:53:14.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6641
02:53:14.391 --> 02:53:14.461
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6642
02:53:14.461 --> 02:53:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be naive to think that out of all of the,</v>

6643
02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:19.401
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6644
02:53:19.401 --> 02:53:19.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6645
02:53:19.950 --> 02:53:24.120
<v Speaker 2>billions of stars and the billions of planets that may be orbiting those stars,</v>

6646
02:53:24.240 --> 02:53:27.210
<v Speaker 2>that we are the only one that evolved intelligent life.</v>

6647
02:53:27.211 --> 02:53:28.860
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably not the case,</v>

6648
02:53:28.861 --> 02:53:29.830
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

6649
02:53:29.870 --> 02:53:30.760
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly the vet,</v>

6650
02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:34.350
<v Speaker 2>the universe is vast and the distances that you're talking about are vast and</v>

6651
02:53:34.351 --> 02:53:36.180
<v Speaker 2>whether we'll will ever be able to,</v>

6652
02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:36.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6653
02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:37.890
<v Speaker 2>navigate them as you know.</v>

6654
02:53:37.891 --> 02:53:37.961
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6655
02:53:37.961 --> 02:53:38.794
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6656
02:53:38.810 --> 02:53:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6657
02:53:38.970 --> 02:53:43.560
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about the successful cultures that haven't relied on resource</v>

6658
02:53:43.561 --> 02:53:46.290
<v Speaker 1>based economies or haven't relied rather on?</v>

6659
02:53:46.291 --> 02:53:47.510
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by resource base?</v>

6660
02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean by explain like obviously we're dealing with primitive tribes and people</v>

6661
02:53:52.591 --> 02:53:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that live in indigenous culture.</v>

6662
02:53:54.261 --> 02:53:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying the rain forest or what have you.</v>

6663
02:53:55.870 --> 02:53:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Then their,</v>

6664
02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:58.380
<v Speaker 1>their economies not really based on money.</v>

6665
02:53:58.381 --> 02:53:59.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not based on gold.</v>

6666
02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:01.980
<v Speaker 1>It's based on what they can get from their environment.</v>

6667
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Their lifestyle rather is based on what they can get from their environment.</v>

6668
02:54:05.011 --> 02:54:07.890
<v Speaker 1>How they stay alive in their happiness is,</v>

6669
02:54:08.260 --> 02:54:10.860
<v Speaker 1>is based entirely on what they can get out of their,</v>

6670
02:54:11.070 --> 02:54:11.521
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

6671
02:54:11.521 --> 02:54:11.881
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

6672
02:54:11.881 --> 02:54:12.960
<v Speaker 1>their atmosphere.</v>

6673
02:54:12.961 --> 02:54:15.750
<v Speaker 1>What are the world that they live in the jungle or what have you.</v>

6674
02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6675
02:54:16.380 --> 02:54:20.160
<v Speaker 1>isn't that like a more efficient and more natural way to live and the way we're</v>

6676
02:54:20.161 --> 02:54:22.540
<v Speaker 1>living now with these propped up ridiculous economies,</v>

6677
02:54:22.541 --> 02:54:22.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6678
02:54:22.740 --> 02:54:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6679
02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:24.530
<v Speaker 2>the way we're living now,</v>

6680
02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:25.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6681
02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:28.260
<v Speaker 2>the way we're living now is not natural because we have all this government that</v>

6682
02:54:28.261 --> 02:54:28.801
<v Speaker 2>we don't need,</v>

6683
02:54:28.801 --> 02:54:30.600
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about a primitive society.</v>

6684
02:54:30.601 --> 02:54:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean the only way and that's why he just how an economy grows and white</v>

6685
02:54:33.350 --> 02:54:33.990
<v Speaker 2>crashes.</v>

6686
02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I start this book off three guys living on an island and they've got nothing.</v>

6687
02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:39.310
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I was asking.</v>

6688
02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:41.480
<v Speaker 2>And so this is where it starts because you know,</v>

6689
02:54:41.481 --> 02:54:41.610
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

6690
02:54:41.610 --> 02:54:44.080
<v Speaker 2>they're fishing by hand and the way they,</v>

6691
02:54:44.210 --> 02:54:44.380
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

6692
02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:46.710
<v Speaker 2>The first improvement is somebody in Benson net,</v>

6693
02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:47.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6694
02:54:47.161 --> 02:54:50.340
<v Speaker 2>and somebody comes up with a net that can catch more than one fish a day,</v>

6695
02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:54.840
<v Speaker 2>but the way humans advance is they come up with capital.</v>

6696
02:54:54.841 --> 02:54:58.890
<v Speaker 2>They come up with equipment that can increase their productivity so that they</v>

6697
02:54:58.891 --> 02:55:00.810
<v Speaker 2>can produce more stuff with less effort.</v>

6698
02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:05.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way that we can improve our standard of living is to find ways</v>

6699
02:55:06.051 --> 02:55:06.650
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

6700
02:55:06.650 --> 02:55:06.941
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6701
02:55:06.941 --> 02:55:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6702
02:55:07.230 --> 02:55:08.270
<v Speaker 2>to create tools.</v>

6703
02:55:08.270 --> 02:55:08.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6704
02:55:08.570 --> 02:55:08.920
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

6705
02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:13.610
<v Speaker 2>if humans never had any tools but we would still be living like chimpanzees or</v>

6706
02:55:13.611 --> 02:55:15.140
<v Speaker 2>even chimpanzees have tools,</v>

6707
02:55:15.470 --> 02:55:16.040
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

6708
02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:16.860
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

6709
02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:19.460
<v Speaker 2>not a lot but they never had the rights,</v>

6710
02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:21.640
<v Speaker 2>but at least they got something they got to stick,</v>

6711
02:55:22.250 --> 02:55:22.670
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

6712
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:23.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6713
02:55:23.090 --> 02:55:24.800
<v Speaker 2>but the reason that we have,</v>

6714
02:55:24.850 --> 02:55:25.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6715
02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:30.050
<v Speaker 2>an advanced societies because we have tools because we were able to improve upon</v>

6716
02:55:30.051 --> 02:55:34.640
<v Speaker 2>our hand if all we had as humans was what we can do with our bare hands.</v>

6717
02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:35.870
<v Speaker 2>If that's all we could do.</v>

6718
02:55:35.871 --> 02:55:36.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6719
02:55:36.111 --> 02:55:36.891
<v Speaker 2>we can only eat well,</v>

6720
02:55:36.891 --> 02:55:38.420
<v Speaker 2>we can kill with their bare hands and we can,</v>

6721
02:55:38.820 --> 02:55:39.150
<v Speaker 2>we would,</v>

6722
02:55:39.150 --> 02:55:39.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6723
02:55:39.401 --> 02:55:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6724
02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:40.473
<v Speaker 2>what could we.</v>

6725
02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:40.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6726
02:55:40.671 --> 02:55:42.990
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting example because a lot of indigenous cultures have tools.</v>

6727
02:55:42.991 --> 02:55:45.150
<v Speaker 1>They've actually created a team other how to create those tools.</v>

6728
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:46.503
<v Speaker 2>That's how they.</v>

6729
02:55:47.070 --> 02:55:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6730
02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:48.620
<v Speaker 2>money was an invention.</v>

6731
02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Am I asking this question?</v>

6732
02:55:51.171 --> 02:55:53.600
<v Speaker 1>The purpose was if you were going to go to a culture,</v>

6733
02:55:53.601 --> 02:55:57.170
<v Speaker 1>say like the native Americans when the Europeans arrived and say you weren't an</v>

6734
02:55:57.171 --> 02:55:57.591
<v Speaker 1>asshole,</v>

6735
02:55:57.591 --> 02:56:01.070
<v Speaker 1>he didn't give him polio and diseases and you didn't kill them all.</v>

6736
02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:04.940
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to try to create an economy from scratch based on people who</v>

6737
02:56:04.941 --> 02:56:06.140
<v Speaker 1>are essentially living off the land,</v>

6738
02:56:06.350 --> 02:56:07.340
<v Speaker 1>how would you go about doing that?</v>

6739
02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:07.521
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6740
02:56:07.521 --> 02:56:07.890
<v Speaker 2>the first one,</v>

6741
02:56:07.890 --> 02:56:09.320
<v Speaker 2>remember the native Americans,</v>

6742
02:56:09.650 --> 02:56:10.550
<v Speaker 2>they had money.</v>

6743
02:56:10.551 --> 02:56:11.384
<v Speaker 2>They had wampum.</v>

6744
02:56:11.470 --> 02:56:12.380
<v Speaker 2>What was wampum?</v>

6745
02:56:12.770 --> 02:56:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Shells.</v>

6746
02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Shells.</v>

6747
02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6748
02:56:14.330 --> 02:56:14.840
<v Speaker 1>So they hadn't,</v>

6749
02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:15.590
<v Speaker 1>they had money.</v>

6750
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:17.120
<v Speaker 1>They had essentially bullshit,</v>

6751
02:56:17.310 --> 02:56:18.143
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

6752
02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:19.280
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>

6753
02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:19.941
<v Speaker 2>they value them.</v>

6754
02:56:19.941 --> 02:56:20.541
<v Speaker 2>They were pretty,</v>

6755
02:56:20.541 --> 02:56:20.871
<v Speaker 2>they were gay.</v>

6756
02:56:20.871 --> 02:56:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Could make necklaces out of them.</v>

6757
02:56:22.131 --> 02:56:22.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6758
02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:22.891
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

6759
02:56:22.891 --> 02:56:23.180
<v Speaker 2>but was,</v>

6760
02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:23.870
<v Speaker 2>did wampum,</v>

6761
02:56:23.870 --> 02:56:25.160
<v Speaker 2>was there like a pile of shit?</v>

6762
02:56:25.161 --> 02:56:25.940
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

6763
02:56:25.940 --> 02:56:26.773
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6764
02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:27.830
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

6765
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Money is a great invention because without money it's all barter.</v>

6766
02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Barter is an inefficient way to organize an economy because too much times based</v>

6767
02:56:38.481 --> 02:56:39.920
<v Speaker 2>on doing that and not enough gets done.</v>

6768
02:56:40.190 --> 02:56:40.401
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6769
02:56:40.401 --> 02:56:40.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6770
02:56:40.641 --> 02:56:40.851
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

6771
02:56:40.851 --> 02:56:41.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'll look,</v>

6772
02:56:41.501 --> 02:56:41.710
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

6773
02:56:41.710 --> 02:56:43.070
<v Speaker 2>you've got your podcast,</v>

6774
02:56:43.100 --> 02:56:43.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6775
02:56:43.371 --> 02:56:44.210
<v Speaker 2>And let's say you've got,</v>

6776
02:56:44.211 --> 02:56:44.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6777
02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:44.671
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6778
02:56:44.671 --> 02:56:44.901
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6779
02:56:44.901 --> 02:56:46.100
<v Speaker 2>and podcasts as me,</v>

6780
02:56:46.370 --> 02:56:46.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6781
02:56:46.611 --> 02:56:47.031
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

6782
02:56:47.031 --> 02:56:48.560
<v Speaker 2>you say you have sponsors,</v>

6783
02:56:48.610 --> 02:56:48.861
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

6784
02:56:48.861 --> 02:56:49.321
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

6785
02:56:49.321 --> 02:56:49.661
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

6786
02:56:49.661 --> 02:56:50.690
<v Speaker 2>they pay you money,</v>

6787
02:56:51.010 --> 02:56:51.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6788
02:56:51.250 --> 02:56:53.240
<v Speaker 2>and then whatever they pay you.</v>

6789
02:56:53.241 --> 02:56:54.380
<v Speaker 2>But if you had a barter,</v>

6790
02:56:55.370 --> 02:56:58.850
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to find a sponsor that actually had the actual thing that you wanted</v>

6791
02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:00.770
<v Speaker 2>coconut water instead of free,</v>

6792
02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:01.281
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6793
02:57:01.281 --> 02:57:02.150
<v Speaker 2>But instead of money,</v>

6794
02:57:02.151 --> 02:57:07.010
<v Speaker 2>money makes transactions a lot more efficient and money allows for loans because</v>

6795
02:57:07.011 --> 02:57:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I can loan you money,</v>

6796
02:57:07.911 --> 02:57:10.340
<v Speaker 2>you can pay me back so we can have capital investments.</v>

6797
02:57:10.340 --> 02:57:10.511
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

6798
02:57:10.511 --> 02:57:11.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6799
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:15.110
<v Speaker 2>economies of function much more efficiently with money than through barter.</v>

6800
02:57:15.140 --> 02:57:17.120
<v Speaker 2>So money was an improvement.</v>

6801
02:57:17.121 --> 02:57:18.050
<v Speaker 2>It was an advancement,</v>

6802
02:57:18.051 --> 02:57:18.531
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

6803
02:57:18.531 --> 02:57:19.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6804
02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:19.581
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

6805
02:57:19.581 --> 02:57:20.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6806
02:57:20.210 --> 02:57:23.390
<v Speaker 2>plumbing was an advancement or electricity was an advancement or you know,</v>

6807
02:57:23.391 --> 02:57:24.710
<v Speaker 2>the wheel was a great investment.</v>

6808
02:57:24.711 --> 02:57:25.370
<v Speaker 2>All these things,</v>

6809
02:57:25.370 --> 02:57:29.120
<v Speaker 2>money was a great invention of mankind that allowed for a more efficient</v>

6810
02:57:29.150 --> 02:57:31.550
<v Speaker 2>allocation of resources a better,</v>

6811
02:57:31.551 --> 02:57:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6812
02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:32.690
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

6816
02:57:34.750 --> 02:57:35.690
<v Speaker 2>So if you say,</v>

6817
02:57:35.691 --> 02:57:37.370
<v Speaker 2>if you take money away from a society,</v>

6818
02:57:37.371 --> 02:57:40.070
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna make that society less efficient and less productive.</v>

6819
02:57:40.220 --> 02:57:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And so that people are going to have a lower standard of living.</v>

6820
02:57:42.230 --> 02:57:42.711
<v Speaker 1>Peter Schiff,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're a bad motherfucker,</v>

6822
02:57:43.581 --> 02:57:44.360
<v Speaker 1>but we're at a time.</v>

6823
02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:45.950
<v Speaker 1>You didn't do this for about a thousand hours,</v>

6824
02:57:45.951 --> 02:57:46.281
<v Speaker 1>couldn't you?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can keep going.</v>

6826
02:57:47.090 --> 02:57:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I can do this with you.</v>

6827
02:57:48.460 --> 02:57:52.940
<v Speaker 1>You got plenty of Scotch there so we could get liquored up and might eventually</v>

6828
02:57:52.941 --> 02:57:54.050
<v Speaker 1>have to take a bathroom break.</v>

6829
02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It would be something that would have to happen.</v>

6830
02:57:55.791 --> 02:57:56.600
<v Speaker 1>But listen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6835
02:58:03.450 --> 02:58:04.680

6836
02:58:04.681 --> 02:58:07.740
<v Speaker 1>this is a fascinating episode for a lot of people because a lot of people like</v>

6837
02:58:07.741 --> 02:58:10.230
<v Speaker 1>me are very uneducated when it comes to finances,</v>

6838
02:58:10.231 --> 02:58:13.200
<v Speaker 1>don't really understand it and never really have the opportunity to sit down</v>

6839
02:58:13.201 --> 02:58:15.060
<v Speaker 1>with a guy who knows as much as you do.</v>

6840
02:58:15.061 --> 02:58:16.590
<v Speaker 1>So I really thank you very much for that.</v>

6841
02:58:16.591 --> 02:58:17.424
