<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>a couple of commercials and then we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>cracking because the commercials were on</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the commercials start,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you just go ahead.</v>

5
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.710

<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what I do these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that so solidly.</v>

13
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like something I would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

14
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just apologize and you </v>

15
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 1>don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just went on autopilot.</v>

16
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Auto Fart on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pilot the podcast brought to you by the </v>

17
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our main number one sponsor.</v>

18
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Our first sponsor ever of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Back in the day when we were just on</v>

19
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>a laptop with Ustream snowflakes in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

20
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>When they were black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a flashlight.</v>

21
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>That's when the date before the Avatar </v>
<v Speaker 1>or that not alien movie one.</v>

22
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>They were just black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started when there was black and </v>

23
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>white television stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fleshlight stopped blind prion.</v>

24
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no black and white </v>

25
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.070
<v Speaker 1>televisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

26
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like back in the day there was black and</v>

27
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:09.321
<v Speaker 1>white TV and when we started with just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we started winning was only black </v>

28
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>black and white flashlights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible joke.</v>

30
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

31
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make me go back even </v>
<v Speaker 1>further and go.</v>

32
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>We started the podcast with talkies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

33
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was silent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when we were doing.</v>

34
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>You're lying to these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know you only been doing it for two</v>

35
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows.</v>

36
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

37
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flashlight like black and white.</v>

38
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just a flashlight joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not supposed to be really thought</v>

39
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>about too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it true?</v>

40
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>There was more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of different colors,</v>

41
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

42
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>when we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just black and white </v>

43
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>unless they had the alien one before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

44
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they have like zombies and shit?</v>

45
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened on late recently.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so that's what your joke was.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tolerated.</v>

97
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Especially I'm barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like one of the Abbott brothers </v>

98
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.730
<v Speaker 1>brothers in a music video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take off my shoe and sock </v>

99
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>will be really gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take off your shoes and socks.</v>

100

<v Speaker 1>wrong shoes too many days in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slept with my shoes.</v>

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might be right.</v>

103
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I heard you slept in your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that correct?</v>

104
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I passed out in my car for a little </v>

105
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.430
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You driving then passed out.</v>

106
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.080
<v Speaker 1>We just remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just walked.</v>

107
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.670
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so illegal.</v>

108
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 2>You should never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should just get a hotel somewhere </v>

109
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.460
<v Speaker 2>because if you're asleep in your car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

110
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:40.461
<v Speaker 2>even if you have no intention of driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk and have a cop knocks on your </v>

111
00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:40.461
<v Speaker 2>door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to jail.</v>

112
00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:41.610
<v Speaker 2>But what if you're in the backseat </v>
<v Speaker 2>garnered gel?</v>

113
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Really kind of sleeping a canton?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

114
00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

115
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>What about all these comics that always </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you that?</v>

116
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Like I was sleeping in my car the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

117
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.210
<v Speaker 1>they got lucky.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

166
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 4>It's only useful to lazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean,</v>

167
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 4>because I give up really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the guy.</v>

168
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.700
<v Speaker 4>I just need a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be a fat person staying there </v>

172
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.440

<v Speaker 4>Because if I'm by myself,</v>

173
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 4>a very low threshold for any type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>activity really.</v>

174
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 4>But you make yourself go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't want to be.</v>

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 4>I fight against that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be a fatty.</v>

178
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will You keep it together?</v>

179
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always on the brink,</v>

180
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

181
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 4>it's tough to be disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

182
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 4>It's tough to force yourself to do shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not pleasant,</v>

183
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 4>but you're very good at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you enjoy it.</v>

184
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like</v>

185
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

186
00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way I function when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't work out.</v>

187
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the,</v>

188
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

189
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.190
<v Speaker 2>my threshold threshold for getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>annoyed at things gets too high.</v>

190
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm two tents,</v>

191
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I think physically the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically feel it affects the way you </v>

192
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 2>interacted with people and I think you </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost have a duty,</v>

193
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to keep your shit in line at </v>

194
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.050
<v Speaker 2>least enough so that it's not fucking up</v>
<v Speaker 2>on you,</v>

195
00:07:58.051 --> 00:08:00.990
<v Speaker 2>so you're annoyed all the time when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're around people because that's what</v>

196
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.590
<v Speaker 2>a lot of like really cranky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitchy people.</v>

197
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.700
<v Speaker 2>You know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

198
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.510
<v Speaker 2>that's a person with a really unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 2>body that's an unhappy</v>

199
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm of the opinion that if you let </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself go too much,</v>

200
00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:17.881
<v Speaker 4>you do become a burden on others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all right if you get my kids get </v>

201
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 4>cancer or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in the more fat it's more </v>

202
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.941
<v Speaker 4>comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's some dudes where you see a </v>

203
00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:24.160
<v Speaker 4>model in and</v>

<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know someone's got to pull you aside</v>

205

<v Speaker 2>like you got this has got to stop.</v>

<v Speaker 4>couldn't have talked some sense into you</v>

207

<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

208
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.090
<v Speaker 4>I guess the pool is just too strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

209
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.740
<v Speaker 4>Now my mother is a huge woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How big a at a peak would have been over</v>

210

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.920
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look them in and some of those,</v>

236
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.260
<v Speaker 4>but also those big marble ones that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like you've just had a huge </v>

237
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.961
<v Speaker 4>marble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never understood the pipe white </v>

238
00:10:01.961 --> 00:10:04.151
<v Speaker 4>market I've probably had in my life my </v>
<v Speaker 4>ab 10 pipe away.</v>

239
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had a bit where I like,</v>

240
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.070
<v Speaker 4>my paper has been so out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just shut windows.</v>

241
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.140
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm a window shutter.</v>

242
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:20.141
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see that as an easier fix than just </v>

243
00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:21.360
<v Speaker 4>paper blowing everywhere or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And plus there's so many outside,</v>

244
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:26.361
<v Speaker 4>like in your yard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really needed something to wait </v>

245
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 4>one polk one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if anything's one,</v>

246
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.500
<v Speaker 4>these people who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who made just think that it's an actual </v>

247
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.851
<v Speaker 4>invention that will like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll build an actual blast object with </v>

248
00:10:36.851 --> 00:10:38.780
<v Speaker 4>a spindly thing in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

249
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.030
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody else was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

250
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 2>we got to get involved with that market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

251
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.140
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to jump on that.</v>

252
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Global wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it's patented or patent.</v>

253
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Usually patented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we painted.</v>

254
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Is that how you would say it?</v>

255
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.920
<v Speaker 4>That's how I would say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I still think that's the wrong way </v>

256
00:10:59.920 --> 00:10:59.920
<v Speaker 4>to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In my exit,</v>

257
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.520
<v Speaker 4>it was me speaking like a todd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was.</v>

258
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>being Australian.</v>

259
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.220
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre</v>

260
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.250
<v Speaker 2>how similar Australians are two </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

261
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.110
<v Speaker 2>even though like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

262
00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:14.060
<v Speaker 2>you guys have a different accent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:17.030
<v Speaker 2>the accents a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little odd for us.</v>

264
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I think we're seeing more similar to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>British person you are as well.</v>

265
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.880
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how you go there,</v>

266
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.800
<v Speaker 2>what I'm going by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

267
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean and it's like you just could fit </v>

268
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.141
<v Speaker 2>right in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the accent notes after a day and that's </v>

269
00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:33.200
<v Speaker 2>just what people sound like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like you're in America.</v>

270
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't notice the American accent now </v>

271
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.561
<v Speaker 4>on anybody at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the only one I have to do an </v>

272
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:43.141
<v Speaker 4>audition and they make me do the </v>
<v Speaker 4>American accent that I'd get a bit </v>

273
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:43.141
<v Speaker 4>shitty with the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

274
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:47.821
<v Speaker 4>do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That you would make you change your </v>

275
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:47.821
<v Speaker 4>voice for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

276
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:51.090
<v Speaker 4>I fucked that one audition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a couple of callbacks and then I </v>

277
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:51.090
<v Speaker 4>said the word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

278
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said I went to the zoo and I saw her </v>

279
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 4>zebra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still said,</v>

280
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

281
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just said that.</v>

282
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:01.650
<v Speaker 4>I still said it in an American accent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with British phrasing and they </v>

283
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.921
<v Speaker 4>freaked the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to hear more of this American </v>

284
00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:04.921
<v Speaker 4>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a creepy voice.</v>

285
00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:04.921
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

286
00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:08.821
<v Speaker 4>Why is that so creepy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are we going to do that is creepy </v>

287
00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 4>as fuck you talking with an American </v>
<v Speaker 4>voice.</v>

288
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.890
<v Speaker 4>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I say,</v>

289
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm sort of anonymous advice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't a lot on stage.</v>

290
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 4>People always want me to say like when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>photos and it talking American right now</v>

291
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 4>in my accent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I say it's,</v>

292
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.860
<v Speaker 4>it sounds great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even when I say count as an </v>

293
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:28.860
<v Speaker 4>American,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've go,</v>

294
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's a bit harsh dude.</v>

295
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:36.121
<v Speaker 4>You sound like a totally different human</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at that fucking kid over </v>

296
00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

297
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 4>Never think that's Jim Jefferies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>

298
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:40.910
<v Speaker 4>I would think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

299
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing is called me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would freak me the fuck out.</v>

300
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>

301
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Just sound guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

302
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:53.550
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to speak to you very </v>

303
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.550
<v Speaker 4>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a few problems here right now.</v>

304
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 4>It sounds vaguely fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you.</v>

305
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't sound right.</v>

306
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:04.260
<v Speaker 4>It sounds really good though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so close to like a real person.</v>

307
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something affected about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Saint Joe.</v>

308
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.820
<v Speaker 4>I want to hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that kind of like a fight.</v>

309
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.780
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

310
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 4>shall we say we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>

311
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 4>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do more English like mine.</v>

312
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Mine's 50 slash 50 because I lived in </v>
<v Speaker 4>England for 10 years,</v>

313
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:30.100
<v Speaker 4>but we don't say the word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't say the word shrimp.</v>

314
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Like Americans go pro and stripped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We call them prawns,</v>

315
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Hogan does that fucking commercial </v>

316
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.910
<v Speaker 4>where he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

317
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.520
<v Speaker 4>I'll throw another shrimp on the Barbie </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you like that.</v>

318
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:44.521
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now that's synonymous with a </v>

319
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:44.521
<v Speaker 4>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When that's not even a word,</v>

320
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 4>we say I'm probably yelled at out at </v>
<v Speaker 4>American gigs,</v>

321
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 4>but when I'm on stage going through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shrimp thing,</v>

322
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:50.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck off man?</v>

323
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.520
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it weird how many like crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>personalities have come out of </v>

324
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:55.520
<v Speaker 4>Australia?</v>

325
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.600
<v Speaker 4>Like the crocodile hunter about Hogan </v>
<v Speaker 4>Crocodile Dundee.</v>

326
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Diana?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

327
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.260
<v Speaker 4>and he lives around here somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it?</v>

328
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.080
<v Speaker 4>Kangaroo Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They only did a couple of those </v>

329
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.080
<v Speaker 4>crocodile dundee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then they were done.</v>

330
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 4>I would have thought that could have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been like some Indiana Jones type.</v>

331
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:15.610
<v Speaker 4>None.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None.</v>

332
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:18.940
<v Speaker 4>I did the third.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The third one is appalling.</v>

333
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.440
<v Speaker 4>Third One's always straight to DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

334
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.010
<v Speaker 4>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like.</v>

335
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 4>Because the whole idea was a crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dundee went from Australia in the </v>

336
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 4>outback of Australia to New York and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

337
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:35.521
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck's he going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is such a different place so you </v>

338
00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:35.521
<v Speaker 4>can survive out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he can't survive here.</v>

339
00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:37.480
<v Speaker 4>It's not for the first two films.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then for the third film,</v>

340
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 4>you think let's send him to another </v>
<v Speaker 4>country like Britain or somewhere else.</v>

341
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.830
<v Speaker 4>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Crocodile Dundee in La.</v>

342
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>

343
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.270
<v Speaker 4>he's been living since the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>crocodile dundee film.</v>

344
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:54.271
<v Speaker 4>He's been living in New York for over a </v>
<v Speaker 4>decade and then he gets to la and he </v>

345
00:14:54.271 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 4>doesn't know what's going on when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets too alarming for him.</v>

346
00:14:57.351 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 4>Like where all these people wearing </v>
<v Speaker 4>sunglasses full.</v>

347
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:01.460
<v Speaker 4>This is weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's.</v>

348
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:06.461
<v Speaker 4>These women's breasts are too big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's not a great film and in the </v>

349
00:15:06.461 --> 00:15:11.231
<v Speaker 4>end he becomes an animal trainer for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>movies and he foils a robbery and </v>

350
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.030
<v Speaker 4>actually now I look back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great field.</v>

351
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.860
<v Speaker 4>I didn't give it uninhibited chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was just the sheer ridiculousness.</v>

352
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Still with Lynda Kozlowski who he </v>
<v Speaker 4>married from the.</v>

353
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 4>From the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is a Paul Hogan was married to</v>

354
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 4>a real fat woman called Napoleon Hogan </v>
<v Speaker 4>who was just this big fat woman.</v>

355
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he had five kids with her and then </v>

356
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:40.390
<v Speaker 4>he does the CROC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which he had before.</v>

357
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.571
<v Speaker 4>He was famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he did Crocodile Dundee and he </v>

358
00:15:43.571 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 4>started dating Lynda Kozlowski and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australian public.</v>

359
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:45.290
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

360
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:50.291
<v Speaker 4>what's he done to his wife?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now he's been with that bird for 25 </v>

361
00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:53.021
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can't really get into him as </v>

362
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:53.021
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start dating and a bird.</v>

363
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:55.720
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

365
00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.720

366
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 4>Blackbird is about Rosa parks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

367
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.690
<v Speaker 4>Because Paul Mccartney was going good </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that black bird,</v>

368
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:06.930
<v Speaker 4>did they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty cool.</v>

369
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.840
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

370
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 4>So for birds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a person or a girl?</v>

371
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I go just to go and a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

372
00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Like normally if you say this is my bird</v>
<v Speaker 4>or those birds look nice.</v>

373
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't normally about an </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive woman.</v>

374
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 4>Big called a bird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

375
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Would you ever fuck a real bird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like an eagle.</v>

376
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll answer the question.</v>

377
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.800
<v Speaker 4>I was going to fuck a Birdie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you had to flick burden?</v>

378
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.680
<v Speaker 4>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be something with long legs.</v>

379
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have to squat or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

380
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.750
<v Speaker 4>The peacock or then you could just hold </v>
<v Speaker 4>the burden.</v>

381
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.760
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm thinking like an amiable or an </v>

382
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.221
<v Speaker 4>ostrich or Flamingo Flamingo pink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'd be pretty comfortable with </v>

383
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:48.900
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Flamingo</v>

384
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.310
<v Speaker 1>mango smell like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you walk past the Flamingo thing,</v>

385
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you would totally lose your bone or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can balance on one leg,</v>

386
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 1>neck to choke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they live in the,</v>

387
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the La Zoo.</v>

388
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:06.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a shit pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a pool of bird shit on generally </v>

389
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.670
<v Speaker 1>have a zoo in San Diego and La didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really the difference between a bird </v>

390
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 1>burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mammals.</v>

391
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I would feel bad if I fucked a mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I fucked a dog and be like,</v>

392
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry dude,</v>

393
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd feel bad because I like animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a dog's got a memo,</v>

394
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.880
<v Speaker 1>isn't sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

395
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mammals,</v>

396
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 1>a warm blooded furry creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get mixed up.</v>

397
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:37.450
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while I was on fish right there </v>

398
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:37.450
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still like,</v>

399
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fish.</v>

400
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Whales are actually mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haley blow.</v>

401
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

402
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

403
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:43.270
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

404
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.270
<v Speaker 1>They'd be there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also have a bottle.</v>

405
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Funny that nothing that breeze water is </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart and that kind of cool water.</v>

406
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except for like octopus geniuses.</v>

407
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 1>They reckon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

408
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're kind of smart,</v>

409
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.610
<v Speaker 1>which is why when you eat like a baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>octopus salad or something,</v>

410
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.890
<v Speaker 1>that's why people don't want eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins because they're geniuses,</v>

411
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:09.891
<v Speaker 1>but now eating new fetus size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty dangerous place to go </v>

412
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.740
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

413
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty dangerous to lock up </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins and killer whales.</v>

414
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:21.111
<v Speaker 1>That's even more dangerous because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that we know that </v>

415
00:18:21.111 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 1>talking to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know they have a complex language.</v>

416
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:26.181
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a confined space for the </v>

417
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

418
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a thrill and killing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's look,</v>

419
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.210
<v Speaker 1>people get a charge out of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter gatherer,</v>

420
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 1>like people that go hunting.</v>

421
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.510
<v Speaker 1>When you go fishing and catch a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a primal like release that </v>

422
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.560
<v Speaker 1>you get from that and that's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's natural.</v>

423
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like a part of like the reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

424
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:48.150
<v Speaker 1>The nature's put in place to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>you carry on,</v>

425
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.720
<v Speaker 1>so they have all these raging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raging hormones inside of them and all </v>

426
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>these killer instincts to take things </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

427
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be killing shit left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and right.</v>

428
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.540
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whales that these gigantic monster is </v>

429
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.460
<v Speaker 1>animals and they don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dolphins on into killing.</v>

430
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Just little fish dolphins killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

431
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.120
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed little dolphins.</v>

432
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>They kill baby dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dolphins murder each other.</v>

433
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.620
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to grab onto the thin though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the touch,</v>

434
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.980
<v Speaker 1>romanticize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

435
00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the world underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool as fuck.</v>

436
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:26.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killer whales eat dolphins and dolphins </v>

437
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.820
<v Speaker 1>regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babies to kill baby dolphins thing,</v>

438
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but know that they would help baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

439
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:32.280
<v Speaker 1>which is funny.</v>

440
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.950
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what a killer whale.</v>

441
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.830
<v Speaker 1>He just murdered babies all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only,</v>

442
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 1>the only wells that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>documented,</v>

443
00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:43.530
<v Speaker 1>there's been rumors about people now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way as Wales that have been </v>

444
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 1>documented as killing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are in captivity,</v>

445
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.160
<v Speaker 1>they actually help people never killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wild.</v>

446
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the same thing.</v>

447
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Sting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

448
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 1>How many sting rays at paypal before </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Steve Owen came involved.</v>

449
00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's like four or five direct </v>

450
00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.530

451
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

452
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:04.970
<v Speaker 1>that's why they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

453
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.980
<v Speaker 1>we'll never released the footage out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect because they know he wasn't </v>

454
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 1>patting it going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't this a lovely thing?</v>

455
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we're gonna kill Ya.</v>

457
00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And he pointing it up to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you did,</v>

458
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.690
<v Speaker 1>if that's really what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that they would own the </v>

459
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.690
<v Speaker 1>American public or the public?</v>

460
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.950
<v Speaker 1>The worldwide public rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would owe them that just for.</v>

461
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Just to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To know that,</v>

462
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.540
<v Speaker 1>to say don't ever do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do this.</v>

463
00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.320
<v Speaker 1>These little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

464
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.430
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even his show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was for his daughters show for like </v>

465
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.531
<v Speaker 1>the Disney channel or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his daughter was on the boat and </v>

466
00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:40.400
<v Speaker 1>then just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reckon he would have lived it.</v>

467
00:20:40.401 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pull it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have flunked everything in it.</v>

468
00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>They left it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would have lived in town,</v>

469
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.930
<v Speaker 1>but he pulled it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

470
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went swimming with,</v>

471
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Speaker 1>with sting rays about a month later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hundreds and hundreds of them.</v>

472
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Dan In antigo let fucking idiots like me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water,</v>

473
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:58.130
<v Speaker 1>so they're obviously pretty plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>dental.</v>

474
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're all the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

475
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of sting rays to.</v>

476
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think know what he was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

477
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the thing is some of them are only </v>

478
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.140
<v Speaker 1>like very few of them are poisonous </v>
<v Speaker 1>stingers,</v>

479
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.200
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that.</v>

480
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It was pointed as it went through his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hot,</v>

481
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody it was.</v>

482
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:19.140
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird guy because like everybody really </v>

483
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.140
<v Speaker 1>loved that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

484
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a super nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loved him.</v>

485
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.610
<v Speaker 1>He put all these money back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation and stuff.</v>

486
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Like he was very charitable man so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there were people that looked at </v>

487
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.781
<v Speaker 1>some of the shit he did and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>laureus like when he was holding his </v>

488
00:21:33.781 --> 00:21:36.400
<v Speaker 1>child while feeding a crocodile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was good.</v>

489
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.520
<v Speaker 1>That was the most ridiculous shit I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I've ever seen a person and they </v>

490
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.190
<v Speaker 1>had a little baby running away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind liked that though.</v>

491
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculously cocky.</v>

492
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Just because that thing is never jacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>you before,</v>

493
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.460
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean it can't right now.</v>

494
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.830
<v Speaker 1>If it's just decides it needs more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that chicken.</v>

495
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Are you really confident in what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking die been for the last couple of </v>

496
00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.560
<v Speaker 1>weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baby is the size of a big chicken.</v>

497
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.130
<v Speaker 1>They would be happy to eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of kayakers that we're</v>

498
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:08.190
<v Speaker 1>going through some fucking river and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them got taken out by a </v>

499
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:12.931
<v Speaker 1>crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So real recent things and like was it a </v>

500
00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:12.931
<v Speaker 1>New York Times article or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

501
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 1>But from the perspective of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>two guys that were kayaking in a fucking</v>

502
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:22.591
<v Speaker 1>crocodile came and checked them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine you're in the position that </v>

503
00:22:24.061 --> 00:22:24.600
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

504
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.720
<v Speaker 1>what it would feel like to be on a kayak</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just get taken out by a giant </v>

505
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.661
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just something that was alive $100 </v>

506
00:22:33.661 --> 00:22:36.971
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked exactly the same because I </v>

507
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:37.180
<v Speaker 1>reckon the big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles and alligators,</v>

508
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:42.670
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles search for food and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alligators sit and white really know </v>

509
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:42.670
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

510
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I gotta do is sit in a swamp in Miami </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just until,</v>

511
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 1>until something stupidly looked like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock until something extreme is by where</v>

512
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:50.440
<v Speaker 1>a crocodile just wakes up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

513
00:22:50.441 --> 00:22:55.441
<v Speaker 1>Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking catch something so </v>

514
00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:55.441
<v Speaker 1>you can't fuck with them as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White label line,</v>

515
00:22:55.441 --> 00:23:00.360
<v Speaker 1>they're very aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a park in Florida where they </v>

516
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>raise crocodiles and alligators together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they're designing,</v>

517
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 1>the crocodiles left when you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the crop,</v>

518
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.260
<v Speaker 1>when they were feeding them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crocodiles running over the heads of</v>

519
00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:13.400
<v Speaker 1>the alligators to get the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

520
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.500
<v Speaker 1>it was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just looked at it,</v>

521
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that thing is,</v>

522
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.020
<v Speaker 1>fuck that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alligator is uh,</v>

523
00:23:20.021 --> 00:23:23.640
<v Speaker 1>the fags of the crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly.</v>

524
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Florida.</v>

525
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I was around alligators all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid.</v>

526
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I lived there for a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as long as it,</v>

527
00:23:32.581 --> 00:23:34.060
<v Speaker 1>it bothered me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lake Alice,</v>

528
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.070
<v Speaker 1>but they would snatch dogs every now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

529
00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:41.071
<v Speaker 1>Some of them would fuck up and walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>their dog too close to the shore and </v>

530
00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:42.010
<v Speaker 1>they would snatch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's scary shit.</v>

531
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>When you hear about some little old lady</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her fucking dog gets</v>

532
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.610
<v Speaker 2>yanked away from her man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagined what that is for her,</v>

533
00:23:48.611 --> 00:23:51.670
<v Speaker 2>her little buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know she's walking in the hills.</v>

534
00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:53.990
<v Speaker 2>You probably get it around here as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people are telling us not to have a</v>

535
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:58.991
<v Speaker 2>dog because fucking mountain lions will </v>
<v Speaker 2>come and eat your dog just in the </v>

536
00:23:58.991 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen.</v>

537
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 2>It's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen.</v>

538
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more likely if you have a small </v>

539
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:06.640
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coyotes.</v>

540
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll snatch dogs for people too.</v>

541
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.100
<v Speaker 2>They've done that many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

542
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.410
<v Speaker 2>They're tricky Fox and they also will </v>
<v Speaker 2>gang up on people or on a.</v>

543
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't people.</v>

544
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.190
<v Speaker 2>A girl died last year in Toronto or </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of Toronto.</v>

545
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Some artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was A.</v>

546
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it's trying to some somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

547
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.090
<v Speaker 2>so I thought it was Toronto might not </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been,</v>

548
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:29.000
<v Speaker 2>but it was somewhere in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going for a nature walk.</v>

549
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:30.650
<v Speaker 2>She was 19 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is singer.</v>

550
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like a really good singer and a </v>

551
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:35.900
<v Speaker 2>music contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got jacked by a bunch of.</v>

552
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Was she good looking guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Killed by dogs,</v>

553
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:41.060
<v Speaker 2>basically big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild,</v>

554
00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:46.061
<v Speaker 2>crazy dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My girlfriend is gave me a look when I </v>

555
00:24:46.061 --> 00:24:46.061
<v Speaker 2>might check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't like that Jay.</v>

556
00:24:46.061 --> 00:24:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the implication was the ugly </v>

557
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 2>people should be allowed to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not pleasant.</v>

558
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.860
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not.</v>

559
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:59.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying they should die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that if you're going to </v>

560
00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.160
<v Speaker 4>save one out of the to save the pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

561
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

562
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to do that before you get on </v>

563
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 4>planes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Before I got on a plane,</v>

564
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.290
<v Speaker 4>I sit there and I try to work out who I </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to live and who I want to die.</v>

565
00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:08.670
<v Speaker 4>When it crashes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

566
00:25:08.671 --> 00:25:09.620
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going,</v>

567
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:14.630
<v Speaker 4>whose company?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When one was comfortable with in this </v>

568
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.630
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As always,</v>

569
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.771
<v Speaker 4>the pretty ones they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's just the person with a </v>

570
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:18.771
<v Speaker 4>warm sort of look to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

571
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.790
<v Speaker 4>I always think of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to just decide like some grand </v>

572
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:23.790
<v Speaker 4>just like Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just sit there.</v>

573
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.010
<v Speaker 4>They're going live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>live,</v>

574
00:25:26.011 --> 00:25:26.730
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>

575
00:25:26.731 --> 00:25:27.240
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>

576
00:25:27.241 --> 00:25:28.080
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alive.</v>

577
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.320
<v Speaker 4>I go wipe out whole families because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't even mourning or crying.</v>

578
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.420
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if one of your family goes,</v>

579
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.510
<v Speaker 4>your fucking go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means every time you want one of </v>

580
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.181
<v Speaker 4>the hot daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to get the whole family then </v>

581
00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:41.181
<v Speaker 4>right now then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

582
00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:41.520
<v Speaker 4>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

583
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.850
<v Speaker 4>keep on going on because she'll need </v>
<v Speaker 4>comforting.</v>

584
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:49.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm always pitching me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always going to be like on a snow </v>

585
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.161
<v Speaker 4>crest inhale or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I only really fly domestically </v>

586
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:52.161
<v Speaker 4>across America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to be that bad.</v>

587
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that Liam Neeson movie where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the.</v>

588
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I've heard it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen it,</v>

589
00:25:55.591 --> 00:25:57.210
<v Speaker 4>but I had to chase him down the gray.</v>

590
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snow bad man.</v>

591
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:03.220
<v Speaker 2>It's unrealistic because the wolves </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really behave like that.</v>

592
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.840
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

593
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.860
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty interesting when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear about people that actually have</v>

594
00:26:08.861 --> 00:26:13.861
<v Speaker 2>been killed by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more than I thought it was </v>

595
00:26:13.861 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 2>ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Made some chicken killed last year in </v>

596
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Alaska by wolves and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

597
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.911
<v Speaker 2>that's probably really rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that's only happened like once in </v>

598
00:26:20.911 --> 00:26:20.911
<v Speaker 2>100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

599
00:26:20.911 --> 00:26:21.610
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened a lot.</v>

600
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.910
<v Speaker 2>It used to happen a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People used to get killed by wolves.</v>

601
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
<v Speaker 2>It was like a total normal part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all these documented cases of </v>

602
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.691
<v Speaker 2>people killed by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why Peter and the wolf was such </v>

603
00:26:33.691 --> 00:26:33.691
<v Speaker 2>an entertaining program back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

604
00:26:33.691 --> 00:26:34.660
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big bad wolf.</v>

605
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.680
<v Speaker 2>What is the big bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

606
00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:40.681
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The know goes to grandma's house and </v>

607
00:26:40.681 --> 00:26:43.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a big bad wolf waiting because </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves were fucking real band.</v>

608
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Like if people lived,</v>

609
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 1>especially in parts of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Russia,</v>

610
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 1>like they got wolf problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man Moves are scary.</v>

611
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Speaker 1>They scared the shit out of any animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

612
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Any animal for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wolves,</v>

613
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I get scared of bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man sometimes are just disgusting.</v>

614
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had scabies once.</v>

615
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 1>That's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll.</v>

616
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.810
<v Speaker 1>That'll do your heading scabies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

617
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I read about a dude from 1920 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the fuck it was.</v>

618
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:15.501
<v Speaker 1>He was up in Canada trapping and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed for wolves by shooting them and </v>

619
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:21.441
<v Speaker 1>then like eight more by clubbing them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death with his rifle before rifle,</v>

620
00:27:21.511 --> 00:27:24.810
<v Speaker 1>but broke and then they killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

621
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Scary.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>

626
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.400

<v Speaker 4>a ring tone for color.</v>

627
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 1>You just made $50,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that much.</v>

628
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I Bet I make 20 bucks dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

630
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.420
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible that I.</v>

631
00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.440
<v Speaker 1>I create a whatever time I was ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rules are scary.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

638
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been around for years or is this </v>

639
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.620
<v Speaker 1>the one American site?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying it for years and a bird</v>

640
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.650
<v Speaker 1>crusher says it and Duncan trussell </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

641
00:28:26.651 --> 00:28:31.651
<v Speaker 1>it already says that there's a poster </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there that says we know what it </v>

642
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:37.131
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend laughed pretty strong against </v>

643
00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:38.670
<v Speaker 1>it from my friend Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry used to Sadie.</v>

644
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would say powerful and he would do a </v>

645
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:43.700
<v Speaker 1>head slap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

646
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:45.920
<v Speaker 4>Was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that Larry from the three?</v>

648
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

649
00:28:47.111 --> 00:28:50.320
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all this.</v>

650
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.170
<v Speaker 4>Too much information is coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I auditioned the three stages.</v>

651
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.230
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you real fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why the stupidest the guy went in before</v>

652
00:28:57.231 --> 00:29:02.231
<v Speaker 4>me was the guy who got it like a but to </v>
<v Speaker 4>play mo and everyone else was in the </v>

653
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:07.910
<v Speaker 4>waiting room in outfits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really putting effort in and I </v>

654
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.711
<v Speaker 4>hadn't put a lot of effort in and I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like you had to do what I </v>

655
00:29:11.711 --> 00:29:11.711
<v Speaker 4>slapping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

656
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.810
<v Speaker 4>Probably saying yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

657
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.260
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All by yourself.</v>

658
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no one there to slap.</v>

659
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.810
<v Speaker 4>And it was one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>

660
00:29:20.811 --> 00:29:21.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they,</v>

661
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.900
<v Speaker 4>they never tell you that you've done </v>
<v Speaker 4>badly,</v>

662
00:29:23.901 --> 00:29:26.090
<v Speaker 4>but they also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did I tell you,</v>

663
00:29:26.091 --> 00:29:27.110
<v Speaker 4>your agent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

664
00:29:27.111 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was okay,</v>

665
00:29:27.981 --> 00:29:32.981
<v Speaker 4>but we're going a different way because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to have that </v>

666
00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:32.981
<v Speaker 4>conversation with the needy agent either</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so.</v>

667
00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:35.780
<v Speaker 4>But they told my agent I was woeful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was really,</v>

668
00:29:35.781 --> 00:29:37.700
<v Speaker 4>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will blow fly.</v>

669
00:29:37.701 --> 00:29:39.830
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't ever use the word willful.</v>

670
00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I might have been phrasing there,</v>

671
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:44.170
<v Speaker 4>but I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was pretty bad.</v>

672
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have anyone to slap though </v>
<v Speaker 4>it does it look like you're just shooing</v>

673
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:49.540
<v Speaker 4>butterflies or something a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

674
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Well you act like you're slapping it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

675
00:29:51.271 --> 00:29:56.271
<v Speaker 4>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then like during the poking things </v>

676
00:29:56.271 --> 00:30:00.000
<v Speaker 4>without doing the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one with me and just watched like two</v>

677
00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 4>students films that afternoon just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get me in the mood.</v>

678
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:09.390
<v Speaker 4>I was only meant to watch one but I kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of enjoyed it so I watched another one </v>

679
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:13.230
<v Speaker 4>you don't use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't to come on in the audition </v>

680
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.391
<v Speaker 4>wearing a complete green suit when it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>green screen suits and the little balls </v>

681
00:30:15.391 --> 00:30:15.391
<v Speaker 4>all over.</v>

682
00:30:15.391 --> 00:30:19.530
<v Speaker 4>You expect you to do that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>improvisation or no person there with </v>

683
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:26.461
<v Speaker 4>the guy who got it was the same guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>played Robin Williams in a bio TV show </v>

684
00:30:26.461 --> 00:30:29.650
<v Speaker 4>about him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a NBC midday movie.</v>

685
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.610
<v Speaker 4>Good impression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He must be a good impression,</v>

686
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 4>but he had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had the wig and everything and he was</v>

687
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:38.740
<v Speaker 4>wrong in the waiting room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was already for it.</v>

688
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.790
<v Speaker 4>Where does it bring it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back to three stooges,</v>

689
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:47.791
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's officially out of ideas and they </v>

690
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:49.501
<v Speaker 4>bring my Abbott and Costello who </v>
<v Speaker 4>snookie's in the previous Abbott Abbott </v>

691
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:52.930
<v Speaker 4>and Costello Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

692
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.690
<v Speaker 4>How could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those were two actual people.</v>

693
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to start with the three </v>
<v Speaker 4>stooges,</v>

694
00:30:57.941 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 4>except they kept on replacing Mo with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other one,</v>

695
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:05.371
<v Speaker 4>sham or sharp or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I always felt like they were </v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

702
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:20.090

<v Speaker 4>because he's a big stooges guy.</v>

713

<v Speaker 4>That was a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Shield.</v>

714
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.540
<v Speaker 4>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of my favorite cop shows,</v>

715
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:50.430
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

716
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.470
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was probably the most realistic cop </v>

717
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.470
<v Speaker 4>show ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw this.</v>

718
00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:00.301
<v Speaker 4>How realistic was I saw the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember the guy that had like the real </v>

719
00:32:00.301 --> 00:32:00.301
<v Speaker 4>sort of weird bye guys.</v>

720
00:32:00.301 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 4>It was when he killed his wife and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid at the end,</v>

721
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.430
<v Speaker 4>I'll use the main characters especially </v>
<v Speaker 4>to kept fucking up and fuck it up,</v>

722
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.550
<v Speaker 4>but he's a bit of a psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would just kill people.</v>

723
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:14.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw him at whole foods like four days </v>

724
00:32:14.551 --> 00:32:14.770
<v Speaker 4>ago and I got a little bit little chill </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm at home.</v>

725
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:18.220
<v Speaker 4>I've actually had that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

726
00:32:18.221 --> 00:32:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what he's going to kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>

727
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't suck.</v>

<v Speaker 4>To me.</v>

729
00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:26.140
<v Speaker 4>He looked like that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dangerous,</v>

733
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:40.040

<v Speaker 4>that you see on TV is in real</v>

734
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.040

<v Speaker 1>Who was the lead out of it.</v>

747
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.840

<v Speaker 1>I would show it to people.</v>

767
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It was just like one web show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big toe to the next one.</v>

768
00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Just on one foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rock it out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the webbed feet about?</v>

<v Speaker 1>bit didn't,</v>

775
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.280
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

776
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.710
<v Speaker 1>What's the percentage of the small toe </v>
<v Speaker 1>being retarded?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.730
<v Speaker 1>my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my pinkies are pretty much retarded.</v>

779
00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something wrong with it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>my little toe,</v>

780
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's a little crooked and it looks</v>

781
00:34:49.221 --> 00:34:54.221
<v Speaker 1>like a pig tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like the toe nail doesn't </v>

782
00:34:54.221 --> 00:34:54.221
<v Speaker 1>really grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you,</v>

783
00:34:54.221 --> 00:34:54.480
<v Speaker 1>let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

784
00:34:54.481 --> 00:34:57.530
<v Speaker 1>you told me that you slept in those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna say no,</v>

785
00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you can target me.</v>

786
00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:06.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always find it weird when you see the </v>

787
00:35:06.161 --> 00:35:06.520
<v Speaker 1>girls who get it because I keep my </v>
<v Speaker 1>toenails clipped.</v>

788
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I imagine I do a fair job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing remarkable and goal.</v>

789
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It's clipped denial so much that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>just does that like little toenail.</v>

790
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's just slid up the and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made us what?</v>

791
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.540
<v Speaker 1>And then the ghost steel ball is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>paint it that little bit.</v>

792
00:35:22.881 --> 00:35:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Just over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you see that girl put red</v>

793
00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:28.520
<v Speaker 1>lipstick on and she smears it a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

794
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 1>That is kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That little phantom last toenail.</v>

795
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.400
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have the nail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to slither.</v>

796
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I have this sliver sometimes it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even grow.</v>

797
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Everything is just taking it off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

798
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.420
<v Speaker 4>being done with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

799
00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.630
<v Speaker 4>Use of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comes up with these nails,</v>

800
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:43.980
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the weird thing.</v>

801
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 4>Things that grow a useless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

802
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're useful.</v>

803
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
<v Speaker 4>The good for clogging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're so weak you just don't know </v>

804
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.651
<v Speaker 4>how to use them yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your toenails useless fuckers and </v>

805
00:35:57.651 --> 00:36:00.311
<v Speaker 4>they was stronger than the hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think that caveman had like </v>

806
00:36:00.311 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 4>much stronger fingernails from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were Jack and things with your </v>

807
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:03.480
<v Speaker 4>nails all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would they get thicker wood?</v>

808
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.910
<v Speaker 4>They grow long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get real sick in the back of it and</v>

809
00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.320
<v Speaker 4>look at a Guinness Book of records stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of them.</v>

810
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Because if once I said as long as joins </v>
<v Speaker 4>that blood flow and she did not curling </v>

811

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they get there and I start curling </v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

817
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.940
<v Speaker 4>I reckon these people have to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>special surgery because I kind of just </v>

818
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:29.940
<v Speaker 4>caught them at the base.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

819
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.210
<v Speaker 4>That's become an extension of you more </v>
<v Speaker 4>than just fucking Christ.</v>

820
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:38.211
<v Speaker 4>You're a tree God damn nail tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's supposed to turn into your </v>

821
00:36:38.491 --> 00:36:39.630
<v Speaker 4>trends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what would,</v>

822
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 4>if that was supposed to do that for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>

823
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:47.121
<v Speaker 4>like you were supposed to grow up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that big and it's turned into like a </v>

824
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 4>time machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's always the theory of evolution.</v>

825
00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:50.610
<v Speaker 4>It's like whenever something new is on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the human body,</v>

826
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 4>we cut it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We go and we don't know what this is.</v>

827
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:57.591
<v Speaker 4>We're cutting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if these persons is the most </v>

829
00:36:57.591 --> 00:36:58.710
<v Speaker 4>like an Ipod is growing out of their arm</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>

830
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 2>What if you cut his nails off and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>he has like the phantom nail itch.</v>

831
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 2>We feel some touching things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not there anymore.</v>

832
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.010
<v Speaker 2>It feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

833
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.420
<v Speaker 2>amputated his hand.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the guy in the Guinness Book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

835
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.930
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole lot of them that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>into it.</v>

836
00:37:16.931 --> 00:37:18.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

<v Speaker 4>weird place.</v>

839
00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.650
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

840
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.780
<v Speaker 4>So anytime you get a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a billion people think I have</v>

841
00:37:28.781 --> 00:37:30.960
<v Speaker 4>any weird people in America with 330 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Go it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>India got a billion.</v>

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.290
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot more weirdness that can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can carry on.</v>

844
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>

845
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's what I always thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that America gets a bad rep because </v>

846
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Australians and British are always going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on about how idiotic Americans </v>

847
00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 4>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that you get to publicize yos </v>

848
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:48.340
<v Speaker 4>more Americans aren't any more stupid </v>
<v Speaker 4>than the British or Australian.</v>

849
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

850
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.350
<v Speaker 2>well they're stupid people all over.</v>

851
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:52.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the world.</v>

852
00:37:52.611 --> 00:37:55.180
<v Speaker 4>But you have more of them because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just per capita,</v>

853
00:37:55.181 --> 00:37:56.900
<v Speaker 4>you'd have more of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be that,</v>

854
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but it also might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a this.</v>

855
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:03.110
<v Speaker 2>This is a country that's lived in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperity for so long.</v>

856
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of soft minded folks who </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't had.</v>

857
00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.220
<v Speaker 2>They haven't had the question the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are really running.</v>

858
00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:15.221
<v Speaker 2>They haven't had to investigate things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sort of sat back and let let </v>

859
00:38:15.221 --> 00:38:16.580
<v Speaker 2>everything sort of happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't until recently.</v>

860
00:38:16.581 --> 00:38:21.581
<v Speaker 2>I think that people are finally starting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to realize that you really can't do </v>

861
00:38:21.581 --> 00:38:26.051
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just trust the government </v>

862
00:38:26.051 --> 00:38:26.180
<v Speaker 2>because they can't be trusted that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>run a muck.</v>

863
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people though that </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't done that yet.</v>

864
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they recognize me.</v>

865
00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Forty percent of all Americans have </v>
<v Speaker 4>passports,</v>

866
00:38:32.301 --> 00:38:34.270
<v Speaker 4>so that's the one that I always find </v>
<v Speaker 4>upsetting.</v>

867
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.200
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>

868
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It would be at least 90 percent of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>passports because it's isolated country,</v>

869
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bit of you that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

870
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:47.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's because in America you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to Disneyland.</v>

871
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.590
<v Speaker 1>It's already there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

872
00:38:48.591 --> 00:38:51.760
<v Speaker 1>like we're all coming on holidays over </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to see your shit.</v>

873
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 1>You've already got all your shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very nice.</v>

874
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

875
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.340

<v Speaker 1>ma'am.</v>

876
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.240
<v Speaker 1>They're all strange.</v>

<v Speaker 1>powerful man in the world and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveled.</v>

882
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Just traveled under different names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating dude.</v>

883
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I would love to drink with George Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just find out what the fuck he </v>

884
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 1>really thinks about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

<v Speaker 1>fairly famous actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just want to know if these ticklers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's George W is,</v>

895
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:05.100
<v Speaker 1>what do you think actually happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him when he had that black guy and he </v>

896
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:05.440
<v Speaker 1>said he ate a pretzel and choked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blacked out and fell down.</v>

897
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

898
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:11.431
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see him eating a pretzel and </v>

899
00:40:11.431 --> 00:40:13.440
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what happened as well </v>

900
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:13.440
<v Speaker 1>because you'd make up unless idiotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

901
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.050
<v Speaker 1>His Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad put up a fucking leather glove </v>

902
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.100
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slapped him,</v>

903
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.070
<v Speaker 1>beat his ass while he was eating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretzel.</v>

904
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you start talking some shit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>who's the president now is Emilio used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm on my second fucker.</v>

910
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Just put on leather glove tickled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Herbert Walker.</v>

911
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.570
<v Speaker 1>George senior was the head of the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude was no joke.</v>

912
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:49.130
<v Speaker 1>He'd probably interrogated them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to say fell off both of them.</v>

913
00:40:50.801 --> 00:40:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Would you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you like the good guys in your mind?</v>

914
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not based on anything they ever did with</v>

915
00:40:57.191 --> 00:41:00.130
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know them personally.</v>

916
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I think drugs would be a cool guy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out with.</v>

917
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Just seems like a bit of a laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he.</v>

918
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you could really pick that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's brain if you know,</v>

919
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.300
<v Speaker 1>if you were given access to this memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>banks,</v>

920
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I bet it would be quite fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I bet that's a guy who's just a </v>

921
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:20.590
<v Speaker 1>puppet just to fucking happy guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a guy who was part of a big,</v>

923
00:41:22.931 --> 00:41:27.931
<v Speaker 1>influential family and I think they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>told him what to say and he went out and</v>

924
00:41:29.081 --> 00:41:30.300
<v Speaker 1>said it looks like.</v>

925
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:37.930
<v Speaker 1>What's he doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You some time Clintons always doing </v>

926
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.591
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George hasn't done nothing since he's </v>

927
00:41:41.591 --> 00:41:43.451
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably watching this on this </v>

928
00:41:43.451 --> 00:41:43.451
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got a new heart,</v>

929
00:41:43.451 --> 00:41:43.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just gave him a new heart.</v>

930
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.140
<v Speaker 1>The Tin Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>

931
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:50.750
<v Speaker 1>they got a heart transplant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently before that he had a machine </v>

932
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.740
<v Speaker 1>hooked up like some sort of a pump in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

933
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.370
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

934
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.150
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it did,</v>

935
00:41:56.151 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 1>it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a pulse anymore.</v>

936
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:02.771
<v Speaker 1>This thing sort of helped him pump the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and like if you try to do as </v>

937
00:42:02.771 --> 00:42:07.511
<v Speaker 1>pulse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would have no pulse but he was </v>

938
00:42:07.511 --> 00:42:07.511
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

939
00:42:07.511 --> 00:42:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why wouldn't you still have a </v>

940
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:10.990
<v Speaker 1>potent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

941
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 1>apparently not because it wasn't pumping</v>
<v Speaker 1>into pulsing way.</v>

942
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 1>He was just pumping in a stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

943
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:19.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying by that it </v>

944
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.750
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just flowing.</v>

945
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the.</v>

946
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:24.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being an idiot and know nothing </v>

947
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.790
<v Speaker 1>about medical science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to think of.</v>

948
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:26.390
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that I use that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fireplace.</v>

949
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:31.391
<v Speaker 1>They put a bellows fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was one of those things that </v>

950
00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:33.250
<v Speaker 1>you saw from petrol with gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

951
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess that the pump though is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual heart muscle working.</v>

952
00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.480
<v Speaker 1>You know the pump is the actual heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle pushing it out.</v>

953
00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the heart muscle is not working and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pump is doing so.</v>

954
00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Is it an artificial heart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

955
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a pulse because of this </v>

956
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.170
<v Speaker 1>thing and then they opened them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hurts are weird.</v>

957
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to become synonymous </v>

958
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Speaker 1>with luxury is fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

959
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason for it and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>they recently discovered,</v>

960
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:09.550
<v Speaker 1>and this is just I think within the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years that there's at least as</v>

961
00:43:09.681 --> 00:43:14.681
<v Speaker 1>many neurons in the heart as there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the brain theory about where someone </v>

962
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 1>gets a heart transplant.</v>

963
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I've heard these stories where someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a heart transplant and then all of </v>

964
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:24.520
<v Speaker 1>a sudden I can speak French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

965
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 1>that we give too much credit to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and other organs can do shit.</v>

966
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Well that's you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's real or not.</v>

967
00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:33.851
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anybody's ever come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an organ transplant and given a </v>

968
00:43:33.851 --> 00:43:38.471
<v Speaker 1>depiction of the person's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were going to do it from any </v>

969
00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:38.471
<v Speaker 1>organ transplant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the heart,</v>

970
00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:41.370
<v Speaker 1>a bad candidate because of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurons in see,</v>

971
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 1>they don't know where the fuck your </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory comes from.</v>

972
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Memories a mystery because every cell in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body is replaced every seven years.</v>

973
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Your cells all get replaced like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new device,</v>

974
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's stored or you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the issue.</v>

975
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It go those cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those brain cells to regenerate.</v>

976
00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.100
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

977
00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Every one doesn't though is neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neurons apparently you keep for life </v>

978
00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:08.580
<v Speaker 1>kind of brain hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you heard part of the brain,</v>

979
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:13.660
<v Speaker 1>they know where memory is stored based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on people getting injuries to specific </v>

980
00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.900
<v Speaker 1>locations of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how their brain,</v>

981
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:15.750
<v Speaker 1>you know how they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

982
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.560
<v Speaker 1>like they know like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fun frontal lobe academies.</v>

983
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.120
<v Speaker 1>They figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew where they could do them to </v>

984
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.471
<v Speaker 1>Zombie you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found the right spot where the </v>

985
00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:26.471
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

986
00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:29.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the fucking Nobel prize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who made lobotomies won a Nobel </v>

987
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.410
<v Speaker 1>prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought he was awesome.</v>

988
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I do way to go hit Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom's man and you silence these retards.</v>

989
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.680
<v Speaker 1>You fucking drill a hole in their head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and scoop out their brains.</v>

990
00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shock therapy.</v>

991
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever say that?</v>

992
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I had a close relative go through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when?</v>

993
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.720
<v Speaker 1>When they were younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

994
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right down on the drive down the </v>

995
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.110
<v Speaker 1>rabbit stake and if I can see we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fucking mic.</v>

996
00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Like this whole idea that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the psycho out of you with </v>

997
00:44:59.320 --> 00:44:59.320
<v Speaker 1>electric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like oh,</v>

998
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.040
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was happening right up until the </v>

999
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:04.040
<v Speaker 1>eighties in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shock therapy.</v>

1000
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like so close to when they like </v>

1001
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 1>bleeding and using leeches in medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to go,</v>

1002
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just electrocute people.</v>

1003
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Well it's electricity seemed so cool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so powerful.</v>

1004
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:21.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's just hook them up to that </v>

1005
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.770
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if it fixes it.</v>

1006
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 1>This kind of schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This'll help.</v>

1007
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine what that must fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like.</v>

1008
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting it because you're already a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit mental and then the nurse is holding</v>

1009
00:45:29.251 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about doing this,</v>

1010
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:37.341
<v Speaker 1>how did it start off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they do it on mice first and then </v>

1011
00:45:37.341 --> 00:45:37.341
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1012
00:45:37.341 --> 00:45:37.341
<v Speaker 1>that mouse is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they shocked.</v>

1013
00:45:37.341 --> 00:45:37.380
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1014
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not moving around.</v>

1015
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 1>She blinded me with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

1016
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did they figure that out?</v>

1017
00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Some crazy ass hole started on humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't seem right.</v>

1018
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:55.210
<v Speaker 1>The same Nobel prize winning asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scrambling people's.</v>

1019
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.860
<v Speaker 1>We look back like cause bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be the most stupid of them.</v>

1020
00:45:58.861 --> 00:46:00.210
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're really sick.</v>

1021
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cut all your blood out and dripped </v>

1022
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.071
<v Speaker 1>it into balls because they thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting when you needed more </v>

1023
00:46:07.071 --> 00:46:07.071
<v Speaker 1>than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:46:07.071 --> 00:46:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to in 50 years go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to give these kids that </v>

1025
00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:16.790
<v Speaker 1>couldn't breathe these little puffers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made it worse and gave them,</v>

1026
00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be things from now that</v>

1027
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.950
<v Speaker 1>we're going to look back at and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fucking man.</v>

1028
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:24.510
<v Speaker 1>It's well chemotherapy saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1029
00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll seem like madness,</v>

1030
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.880
<v Speaker 1>prescription drug abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they find out how many different </v>

1031
00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.460
<v Speaker 1>people are hooked on all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different pain killers.</v>

1032
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Some real American thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1033
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where I'm taking most of my drugs.</v>

1034
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:38.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never met anyone that wanted to.</v>

1035
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I never knew what an Oxycontin was there</v>
<v Speaker 1>until a couple of years ago.</v>

1036
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Government is better at filtering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and doesn't have socialized </v>

1037
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:46.750
<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1038
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not as easy to get.</v>

1039

<v Speaker 1>There's a disconnect between this guy in</v>

1153
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:08.120
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's funny Sorta,</v>

1154
00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:10.940
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talking about like the ultimate,</v>

1155
00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 1>the joke's on you picking on a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1156
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.440
<v Speaker 1>but one thing it might be that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than that argument is that the</v>

1157
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:22.180
<v Speaker 1>crazy people all want to be comics or </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors so they know what they're doing.</v>

1158
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 1>What we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done Ip and Anthony together a </v>

1159
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.580
<v Speaker 1>fair bit and every time I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the RSA re todd's one of the </v>

1160
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:36.490
<v Speaker 1>crazies that are on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I go home feeling a little bit</v>

1161
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 1>down about it and then I remember that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>love it.</v>

1162
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 1>That's their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got a level of fame.</v>

1163
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.680
<v Speaker 1>They go to these conventions or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1164
00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:47.840
<v Speaker 1>When I'd be anti do things on the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get big.</v>

1165
00:52:47.841 --> 00:52:52.841
<v Speaker 1>Round of applause isn't very exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is just picking on a mental.</v>

1166
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:57.870
<v Speaker 1>You'll perse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a way to do it in a way </v>

1167
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.870
<v Speaker 1>not to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawn does it,</v>

1168
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the guys is schizophrenia,</v>

1169
00:52:59.541 --> 00:53:02.330
<v Speaker 1>surfer guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do open mics with this guy and</v>

1170
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:07.500
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got schizophrenia and he's really </v>

1171
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.641
<v Speaker 1>hardcore schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he would do like an act and then </v>

1172
00:53:09.641 --> 00:53:12.821
<v Speaker 1>like afterwards I would always try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to him but he would like look past </v>

1173
00:53:12.821 --> 00:53:12.821
<v Speaker 1>me and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was weird.</v>

1174
00:53:12.821 --> 00:53:17.250
<v Speaker 1>But what is schizophrenia entail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else was wrong with to </v>

1175
00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1176
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just really,</v>

1177
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:24.730
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's not bipolar is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to personally bought Paul is Paul </v>

1178
00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.180
<v Speaker 1>depression that's up as being dead.</v>

1179
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.320
<v Speaker 4>Schizophrenia is you start believing </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1180
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:34.340
<v Speaker 4>someone else going in and out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different personalities sometimes you </v>

1181
00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:38.631
<v Speaker 4>can talk to other times you just looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>past here and plus the fact that he </v>

1182
00:53:38.631 --> 00:53:38.631
<v Speaker 4>smokes weed on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like really weird.</v>

1183
00:53:38.631 --> 00:53:40.320
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a real nice guy,</v>

1184
00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:44.040
<v Speaker 4>but as an example that I used to do open</v>
<v Speaker 4>open minds with him and now he's fucking</v>

1185
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:45.330
<v Speaker 4>love and doing the Dingdong show.</v>

1186
00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1187
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:47.040
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1188
00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 2>it makes it difficult to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between real and unreal </v>

1189
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think logically,</v>

1190
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:55.990
<v Speaker 2>have normal emotional responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behave normally in social situations.</v>

1191
00:53:55.991 --> 00:53:57.180
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1192
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:58.870
<v Speaker 2>So what's the jewel personality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One?</v>

1193
00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.750
<v Speaker 2>A will you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1194
00:54:01.751 --> 00:54:06.751
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that don't believe in </v>

1195
00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:08.360
<v Speaker 2>multiple personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it's horse shit.</v>

1196
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:09.790
<v Speaker 2>There are people that think it's horse </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1197
00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want attention.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:16.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anybody that was threatened</v>

1200
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 4>friend and he's a good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have a friend of mine who uh,</v>

1201
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.940
<v Speaker 4>who says that he had a split </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>

1202
00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 4>but it was just whenever he acted like </v>
<v Speaker 4>an asshole that was,</v>

1203
00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.750
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like her pants or something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just fucking killed her.</v>

1267
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:25.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No ransom money for Dave.</v>

<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1270
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:32.910
<v Speaker 2>one story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other story is that he had or </v>

<v Speaker 2>so he had her killed,</v>

1273
00:57:33.001 --> 00:57:34.590
<v Speaker 2>which is even fucking crazy.</v>

1274
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:35.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to get out.</v>

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Get out now.</v>

1279
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other ways for her to die,</v>

1280
00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.440
<v Speaker 4>but you can see Lions and tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty exciting.</v>

1281
00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:50.870
<v Speaker 4>What a fucked up thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1282

1283
00:57:53.401 --> 00:57:57.430
<v Speaker 4>That when you said there's news stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>and tap into a semi Thompson,</v>

1284
00:57:57.431 --> 00:58:02.431
<v Speaker 4>which news stories where some moms like </v>
<v Speaker 4>tromping along these black men rip </v>

00:58:03.201 --> 00:58:07.940
<v Speaker 4>tattoos just opened the door and stole </v>
<v Speaker 4>my car with my child and it and then you</v>

<v Speaker 4>swamp and you put them in the seat belt </v>

1287
00:58:12.941 --> 00:58:13.310
<v Speaker 4>and this is going to be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1288
00:58:13.311 --> 00:58:16.100
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now it makes you suspicious of every</v>

1289
00:58:16.101 --> 00:58:19.610
<v Speaker 4>person who ever cries and TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You always watched them going yet you're</v>

1290
00:58:19.611 --> 00:58:21.500
<v Speaker 4>a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always go straight through.</v>

1291
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you find out that they are,</v>

1292
00:58:23.381 --> 00:58:25.120
<v Speaker 2>it is the weirdest feeling in the world,</v>

1293
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:26.670
<v Speaker 4>especially if you've been supporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1294
00:58:26.671 --> 00:58:28.470
<v Speaker 4>If you need going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that poor lady that pull out.</v>

1295
00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:30.400
<v Speaker 4>If you feel cheated as the public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1296
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:31.440
<v Speaker 4>how many times have women?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Then busted doing that where they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that they were guilty and then they</v>

1298
00:58:34.741 --> 00:58:35.220
<v Speaker 2>caught them</v>

1299
00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:38.440
<v Speaker 4>in America at Capa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there is a,</v>

1300
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:44.190
<v Speaker 4>there is a case in the UK which has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on for fucking ever.</v>

1301
00:58:45.791 --> 00:58:46.620
<v Speaker 4>And what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1302
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.340
<v Speaker 4>maddie anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1303
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.760
<v Speaker 4>very famous clients in the UK where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>

1304
00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:56.650
<v Speaker 4>This couple went on holiday in Portugal </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I were in a resort type thing.</v>

1305
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.130
<v Speaker 4>They left the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1306
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>madeline mccain was named the logo.</v>

1307
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:04.240
<v Speaker 4>And so I left Maryland Mccain in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

1308
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.240
<v Speaker 4>They went off and had dinner like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>meters away.</v>

1309
00:59:06.241 --> 00:59:07.920
<v Speaker 4>She was five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ladies left.</v>

1310
00:59:07.921 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 4>Are they sleeping when they got back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was gone right now.</v>

1311
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:13.690
<v Speaker 4>The case has never been opened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people are still of the opinion that</v>

1312
00:59:13.691 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 4>maybe they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they'd been,</v>

1313
00:59:17.351 --> 00:59:22.351
<v Speaker 4>no one can prove.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then like maybe some pedophile did </v>

1314
00:59:22.351 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe some whatever did it.</v>

1315
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:24.890
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1316
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:25.420
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1317
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 4>it's a real big case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the extended last time we talked </v>

1318
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:33.131
<v Speaker 4>back to Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had pictures of a five years on </v>

1319
00:59:33.131 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 4>computer generated what she'd look like </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1320
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:38.471
<v Speaker 4>So to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep looking for like the parents are </v>

1321
00:59:38.471 --> 00:59:39.370
<v Speaker 4>still like putting an assistant creepy </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they do that fake person.</v>

1322
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to do a joke.</v>

1323
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.950
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long are we going to keep this going</v>

1324
00:59:42.951 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 4>for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1325
00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:47.660
<v Speaker 4>I got I hope another six years so we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that whole picture of when she's 16.</v>

1326
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They start making her like have like </v>

1327
00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:54.920
<v Speaker 4>phones on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should look now.</v>

1328
00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.280
<v Speaker 4>Most likely with a collar on her neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty fucked up.</v>

1329
01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Why don't I just put a realistic picture</v>
<v Speaker 4>of just some bones covered with come.</v>

1330
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:19.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh no fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun reading on.</v>

1331
01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:21.620
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

1332
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can never do that in any other job </v>

1333
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>and be like sat back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were like wow,</v>

1334
01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's pretty fucking funny.</v>

1335
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1336
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.640
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get in trouble if you were in </v>

1337
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:36.640
<v Speaker 1>upper management somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1338
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And he said that at a board meeting he </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly passed the milk and you hold up</v>

1339
01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:46.911
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't this was this a fucking real </v>

1340
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:49.161
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you shouldn't just be a pile of </v>

1341
01:00:49.161 --> 01:00:49.161
<v Speaker 1>bones and come and everybody just.</v>

1342
01:00:49.161 --> 01:00:49.161
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

1343
01:00:49.161 --> 01:00:53.510
<v Speaker 4>Here an advertising guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The poster that my father is quite a </v>

1344
01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:56.560
<v Speaker 4>successful business type guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1345
01:00:56.561 --> 01:01:00.820
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't tell you quite what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was entertaining clients on a,</v>

1346
01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:01.890
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a boat.</v>

1347
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:04.040
<v Speaker 4>Trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1348
01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.680
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very similar.</v>

1349
01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.850
<v Speaker 4>So he was at a dining clients that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the people,</v>

1350
01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:13.851
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to get money out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You developed shopping centers and </v>

1351
01:01:13.851 --> 01:01:13.851
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1352
01:01:13.851 --> 01:01:17.030
<v Speaker 4>So he had this boat and this was years </v>
<v Speaker 4>early on in my career and I had like a </v>

1353
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:20.871
<v Speaker 4>CD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first CD and my brother just had it </v>

1354
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:20.871
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1355
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 4>everyone wasn't really getting along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I thought I'd put your cd on and see </v>

1356
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:25.920
<v Speaker 4>if we could pick the mood up or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

1357
01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:27.630
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you started with a,</v>

1358
01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:32.660
<v Speaker 4>with a dance syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jake the fucking guys kid had dancing </v>

1359
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:36.861
<v Speaker 4>drive and we're stuck in Sydney harbor </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we couldn't go back and he was </v>

1360
01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:40.761
<v Speaker 4>yelling at me like a fuck these deal up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to put my cd on.</v>

1361
01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:43.950
<v Speaker 4>No one option to put it on that much of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a story.</v>

1362
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>It's what we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we got and we got to work with it.</v>

1363
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:52.790
<v Speaker 1>So I guess this is actually kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disputed,</v>

1364
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>this multiple personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think it's bullshit,</v>

1365
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people think it's legit,</v>

1366
01:01:57.930 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the one person doing that.</v>

1367
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're all typing in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of the different personalities.</v>

1368
01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:06.730
<v Speaker 4>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>

1369
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>I think Hershel Walker thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma induced from the years of </v>

1370
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is totally crazy.</v>

1371
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Now he's fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1372
01:02:13.471 --> 01:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1373
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:19.280
<v Speaker 1>look what you're saying that he'd punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk and that's not necessarily punch </v>

1374
01:02:19.941 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>

1375
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1376
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks fine.</v>

1377
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:28.370
<v Speaker 2>He seems to think fine too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of people believe </v>

1378
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:32.630
<v Speaker 2>that you could get a lot of things wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your brain from repeated trauma and</v>

1379
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:37.080
<v Speaker 2>the kind of trouble they haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Football is like,</v>

1380
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are running at each other and</v>

1381
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:42.330
<v Speaker 2>clashing heads and shit and had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking knees.</v>

1382
01:02:42.331 --> 01:02:47.331
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some serious impact that these </v>

1383
01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:48.840
<v Speaker 2>guys are withstanding and a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>get fucked up because of it.</v>

1384
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that's what he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying was that it was a trauma related,</v>

1385
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple personality disorder.</v>

1386
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:58.600
<v Speaker 4>That's just la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people still go,</v>

1387
01:02:58.601 --> 01:02:59.800
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not sure.</v>

1388
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:00.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sure that.</v>

1389
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:02.140
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if they're not sure,</v>

1390
01:03:02.141 --> 01:03:04.000
<v Speaker 4>they're silly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same as Richard.</v>

1391
01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Pryor and Dudley Moore both took</v>

1392
01:03:06.731 --> 01:03:10.420
<v Speaker 4>a lot of cocaine in their days and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had the same,</v>

1393
01:03:10.421 --> 01:03:12.880
<v Speaker 4>this extraordinarily rare nerve </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder.</v>

1394
01:03:12.881 --> 01:03:15.910
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just Parkinson's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a ribbed strain of it,</v>

1395
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.440
<v Speaker 4>and then people still go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1396
01:03:17.441 --> 01:03:19.690
<v Speaker 4>we don't quite know how this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

1397
01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.920
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I know.</v>

1398
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know another person who did the exact </v>

1399
01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:26.170
<v Speaker 2>same thing and it has the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1400
01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that.</v>

1401
01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:28.790
<v Speaker 2>It's super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super common.</v>

1402
01:03:28.791 --> 01:03:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Mad.</v>

1403
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely more kept,</v>

1404
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:35.230
<v Speaker 4>kept sacred for years and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they thought he was just a </v>

1405
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:35.230
<v Speaker 4>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

1406
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.680
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was then given up acting and thing.</v>

1407
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:40.550
<v Speaker 4>He used to go out of the concert pianist</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was a really good pianist and</v>

1408
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:41.350
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1409
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.640

<v Speaker 4>through a song and then just sort of the</v>

1410
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:50.360
<v Speaker 4>other microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was drunk again.</v>

1411
01:03:50.361 --> 01:03:52.640
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just fucking heavily diseased.</v>

1412
01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:57.940
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last three or four years of his </v>

1413
01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:57.940
<v Speaker 4>group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one knew.</v>

1414
01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.510
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

1415

<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Good show.</v>

1417
01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:08.500
<v Speaker 4>Was it back in the day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you buy a DVD?</v>

1418
01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:11.400
<v Speaker 4>Would probably be awesome if it came out</v>
<v Speaker 4>at best buy if you want to best buy.</v>

1419
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:13.700
<v Speaker 4>And so that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>DVD Collection.</v>

1420
01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.760
<v Speaker 4>It depends on what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would buy it just to see what a time </v>

1421
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.420
<v Speaker 4>traveling device it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought the greatest American hero and</v>

1422
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.460
<v Speaker 4>I got the greatest American hero and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Netflix the other day because I just </v>

1423
01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.840
<v Speaker 4>liked it so much as a kid and I now I </v>
<v Speaker 4>watched it.</v>

1424
01:04:26.841 --> 01:04:28.810
<v Speaker 4>I just liked the theme song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>

1425
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.410
<v Speaker 4>Is it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I remember as a kid,</v>

1426
01:04:30.411 --> 01:04:31.340
<v Speaker 4>I really loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1427
01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:36.350
<v Speaker 4>So the flying is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That noise is so stupid that I can't </v>

1428
01:04:39.561 --> 01:04:41.580
<v Speaker 4>believe I was ever fooled or ever made</v>

1429
01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.200
<v Speaker 2>time travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go back and see what amused you </v>

1430
01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:47.630
<v Speaker 2>when you were a little and be baffled.</v>

1431
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:53.320
<v Speaker 4>Well this is the whole theory on why </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids should not should see gentle porn </v>

1432
01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.370
<v Speaker 4>because gentle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1433
01:04:55.371 --> 01:05:00.371
<v Speaker 4>Because I grew up with like finding a </v>
<v Speaker 4>playboy magazine and then just batting </v>

1434
01:05:00.371 --> 01:05:02.120
<v Speaker 4>off to it until I found another magazine</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

1435
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:07.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids today are going straight to the </v>

1436
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.150
<v Speaker 4>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be fun.</v>

1437
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:08.500
<v Speaker 2>You guys find their magazines in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woods?</v>

1438
01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1439
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:12.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the bush.</v>

1440
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:17.870
<v Speaker 4>That incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always used to think that some </v>

1441
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 4>adults hidden it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I looked back at it.</v>

1442
01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Now there's some other kid hit it there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the board of the simulation program,</v>

1443
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.640
<v Speaker 4>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like he grew there.</v>

1444
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I it to that environment.</v>

1445
01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 4>I remember mentioning show you young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was about seven years old,</v>

1446
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:34.360
<v Speaker 4>seven and I found these pitching when my</v>
<v Speaker 4>mother was the only woman in the house.</v>

1447
01:05:34.361 --> 01:05:39.361
<v Speaker 4>I went through one of her magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we didn't have underwear catalog </v>

1448
01:05:39.361 --> 01:05:42.331
<v Speaker 4>sitting around like a Victoria secret </v>
<v Speaker 4>catalog or something like that would </v>

1449
01:05:42.331 --> 01:05:44.641
<v Speaker 4>have been good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we're a family picture in my mum's </v>

1450
01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 4>Women's magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a naked.</v>

1451
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:48.670
<v Speaker 4>And these magazine never had a naked </v>
<v Speaker 4>titone it before.</v>

1452
01:05:48.671 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I cut this picture.</v>

1453
01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.660
<v Speaker 4>This picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I masturbated to these picture from </v>

1454
01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.660
<v Speaker 4>about seven till 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one test is one tip.</v>

1455
01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I found out at 10 because I was </v>

1456
01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.341
<v Speaker 4>watching the news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a picture of a woman having a </v>

1457
01:06:05.341 --> 01:06:05.341
<v Speaker 4>mammogram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1458
01:06:05.341 --> 01:06:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't know as a kid and I used to</v>

1459
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:09.880
<v Speaker 4>think because the other tick was in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine being squeezed out.</v>

1460
01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:10.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1461
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:13.090
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that must be some sex machine.</v>

1462
01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept your interest for so long.</v>

1463
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I still do the laundry or anything at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sears catalog for my friends,</v>

1464
01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.630
<v Speaker 1>my mom's sears catalog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I used to keep it and put it in mind</v>

1465
01:06:25.631 --> 01:06:30.631
<v Speaker 1>like books and like hide it in a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they pull it out and look at it and </v>

1466
01:06:30.631 --> 01:06:33.330
<v Speaker 1>masturbate and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being with the laundry in the</v>

1467
01:06:33.331 --> 01:06:34.460
<v Speaker 1>catalogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old catalogs.</v>

1468
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.550
<v Speaker 1>We used to have catalogs.</v>

1469
01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I remember there being a youtube video </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when I went to university and I</v>

1470
01:06:39.991 --> 01:06:43.560
<v Speaker 4>was like 22 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1471
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:48.980
<v Speaker 4>they used to keep on sending me the </v>
<v Speaker 4>catalogs because I bought a couple of </v>

1472
01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.410
<v Speaker 4>videos years ago and I used to keep them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were this,</v>

1473
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:54.720
<v Speaker 4>they were just like pictures of scenes </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the movie they were trying.</v>

1474
01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.750
<v Speaker 4>I never bought anything but the catalogs</v>
<v Speaker 4>once a month.</v>

1475
01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:01.280
<v Speaker 4>That was a big day free and I was broke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1476
01:07:01.281 --> 01:07:06.281
<v Speaker 4>I was fucking happy that I always used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep my roommate one catalog behind </v>

1477
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:09.570
<v Speaker 4>so he would get the new months one after</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got my new man.</v>

1478
01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that what you would want then</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see naked girls to look at naked </v>

1479
01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people would deny that if you,</v>

1480
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>they say you're not ready for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1481
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about protecting kids.</v>

1482
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>But clearly you have these sexual urges </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's just in denial about it.</v>

1483
01:07:26.031 --> 01:07:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only 16.</v>

1484
01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't buy a playboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't even buy a playboy when </v>

1485
01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:36.341
<v Speaker 1>you're 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even just let me see a little </v>

1486
01:07:36.341 --> 01:07:36.341
<v Speaker 1>titty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even need to see a vagina.</v>

1487
01:07:36.341 --> 01:07:36.341
<v Speaker 1>Can I just see a lag?</v>

1488
01:07:36.341 --> 01:07:41.100
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put it in movie movies when you're </v>

1489
01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:41.100
<v Speaker 4>16 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to commend Britain.</v>

1490
01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm on page three of the units,</v>

1491
01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:44.680
<v Speaker 1>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a topless go.</v>

1492
01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's normal.</v>

1493
01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:50.450
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What 16 year olds can't go to the movies</v>

1494

01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:05.460
<v Speaker 4>out of my bed and she put them in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bin because that's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>drawer was empty.</v>

1544
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:20.750
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I worked in a news agency so I used </v>

<v Speaker 4>to collect them from the bins out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>back of the news agencies.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I look under the bench and there's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>my porn magazines,</v>

1551
01:10:30.361 --> 01:10:35.361

<v Speaker 4>like lettuce leaf on them and stuff </v>

1552

<v Speaker 4>the driveway on a Wednesday.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the light and try to find happiness and </v>

1630
01:14:00.841 --> 01:14:03.990
<v Speaker 2>these nonsense sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you reach pure awareness,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you'll have no problems.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to hear more craziness</v>

1634
01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>is a really funny moment on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he got,</v>

1635
01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:15.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1636
01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.540
<v Speaker 1>some guy who's writing a physics book </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Stephen Hawkings,</v>

1637
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.210
<v Speaker 1>like it was correcting things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying the guy was like,</v>

1638
01:14:23.211 --> 01:14:23.560
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1639
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:28.561
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying like you're saying things </v>

1640
01:14:28.561 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 1>that don't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correcting Stephen Hawkings?</v>

1641
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1642
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:29.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1643
01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:34.490
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who was writing a book with </v>

1644
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Deepak Chopra was trying to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to him like quantum distant </v>

1645
01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.190
<v Speaker 1>quantum that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the guy goes,</v>

1646
01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what all those words mean,</v>

1647
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:46.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not quite sure what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying because he's not really saying </v>

1648
01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:46.740
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just fucking minded,</v>

1649
01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 1>didn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The infinite.</v>

1650
01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:53.580
<v Speaker 1>The impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consciousness of the quantum </v>

1651
01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:53.580
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

1652
01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:57.690
<v Speaker 1>he could just say things like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just leave it up to what was gassing</v>

1653
01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.400
<v Speaker 1>up some sort of a broad sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might've made a sentence there.</v>

1654
01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.430
<v Speaker 1>There might be some point that he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can't quite grasp,</v>

1655
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.080
<v Speaker 1>but much more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's word salad that's designed to sound</v>

1656
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:10.330
<v Speaker 1>spiritual with salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it is,</v>

1657
01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 1>he threw a bunch of cool words together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy called them on it.</v>

1658
01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.440
<v Speaker 1>This guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so brilliant the way the guy </v>

1659
01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:19.440
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1660
01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.291
<v Speaker 1>I know what all those words mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making that up the way that guy </v>

1661
01:15:22.291 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 1>talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys don't know who he is,</v>

1662
01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:28.370
<v Speaker 1>who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know he was killed by a Tupac or </v>

1663
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Biggie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biggie.</v>

<v Speaker 4>to this day that's the biggest can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever seen.</v>

1723
01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:01.430
<v Speaker 4>And I've only seen about five sentences </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>

1724
01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:04.490
<v Speaker 4>I felt like grabbing that guy can just </v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of this leave,</v>

1725
01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.710
<v Speaker 4>Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need this woman anymore.</v>

1726
01:18:06.711 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 4>She's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst you've ever seen.</v>

1727
01:18:09.141 --> 01:18:10.130
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was that bad.</v>

1728
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:15.390
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just in just a short amount of time </v>

1729
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.390
<v Speaker 4>where I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person's just evil,</v>

1730
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000
<v Speaker 4>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people don't ever realize how tall </v>

1731
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:21.000
<v Speaker 4>building,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would think that after shows,</v>

1732
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:21.610
<v Speaker 4>you see a lot of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>to like headlock you or something?</v>

1737
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:31.050

<v Speaker 4>guys are always asking to choke me </v>

1740
01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:38.950
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of Jujitsu guys shows </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>But I don't trust anybody.</v>

1804
01:21:02.601 --> 01:21:04.911
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was raped when I was a kid and just </v>

1805
01:21:04.911 --> 01:21:04.911
<v Speaker 1>started going off on like a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1806
01:21:04.911 --> 01:21:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Now you're hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So three days out of Rehab,</v>

1807
01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:10.170
<v Speaker 1>she's already drunk again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She and your favorites yet?</v>

1808
01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1809
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I hid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1810
01:21:12.241 --> 01:21:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I have to go to the bathroom and I ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the green room.</v>

1811
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Main Room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still creeped out by as American </v>

1812
01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:20.160
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking I was like,</v>

1813
01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:21.770
<v Speaker 1>this store is not going to have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch line.</v>

1814
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.850
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to pay this off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not going to rape you.</v>

1815
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:24.730
<v Speaker 1>She didn't rape you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1816
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Some rape you at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1817
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:29.580
<v Speaker 1>She tried to impose you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did was give you a kiss?</v>

1818
01:21:29.690 --> 01:21:30.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1819
01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:31.680
<v Speaker 1>The whole time she was like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1820
01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:32.130
<v Speaker 1>grab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1821
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.020
<v Speaker 1>it's sexy isn't ripe is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

1822
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than kissing.</v>

1823
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:38.790
<v Speaker 1>She's not trying to throw me on my grind</v>
<v Speaker 1>raving,</v>

1824
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:43.180
<v Speaker 1>but there's definitely a difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between rape so easily.</v>

1825
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying real rape diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1826
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's way creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to do grabs a girl's ass.</v>

1827
01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It's physical.</v>

1828
01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And you can't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I wanted to rape you,</v>

1829
01:21:55.081 --> 01:21:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I probably could get away with it if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nobody around.</v>

1830
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what a guy saying when he grabs a</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a mind,</v>

1831
01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:04.900
<v Speaker 1>if I've ever like pinched to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I haven't known quite wells asked </v>

1832
01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.430
<v Speaker 1>as they walked by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're a person and you're,</v>

1833
01:22:06.650 --> 01:22:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1834
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know this other person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just reach over and grab a girl </v>

1835
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.540
<v Speaker 1>and squeeze it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big violation.</v>

1836
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:17.650
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big violation of space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile behind her is her fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

1847
01:22:39.571 --> 01:22:42.180
<v Speaker 1>when somebody just reaches over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabs you when you don't know them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't have a daughter right now that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of high.</v>

1849
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 1>If I imagined my sister or my daughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>being really hot,</v>

1850
01:22:47.191 --> 01:22:52.191
<v Speaker 1>some guy just grabbing it.</v>

1869
01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's always,</v>

1870
01:23:53.331 --> 01:23:54.680
<v Speaker 4>when you meet that girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1871
01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:56.290

1874
01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:05.690
<v Speaker 2>a buddy who found these marks on a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had dated her for awhile and then he </v>

<v Speaker 2>like saw one of her arms was like sliced</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and he goes,</v>

1876
01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:11.010
<v Speaker 2>it was a window into madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1877
01:24:11.011 --> 01:24:14.790
<v Speaker 2>all the sudden I just went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is?</v>

1878
01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:17.340
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I realized what the fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1881
01:24:19.201 --> 01:24:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I hadn't noticed him </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1882
01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden I was like,</v>

1883
01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1884
01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I went out with go long sleeves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long sleeves,</v>

1885
01:24:25.211 --> 01:24:30.211
<v Speaker 4>long sleeves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then after a few weeks and then I </v>

1886
01:24:30.211 --> 01:24:30.900
<v Speaker 4>saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because every time you got you got,</v>

1887
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:34.920
<v Speaker 4>you had to be in the light light and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was just these little,</v>

1888
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.760
<v Speaker 4>like thousands of these little white </v>
<v Speaker 4>marks.</v>

1889
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:40.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Lohan allegedly have do that.</v>

1890
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend</v>

1891
01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:46.010
<v Speaker 4>who did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who she told me about.</v>

1892
01:24:46.011 --> 01:24:48.810
<v Speaker 4>It was quite a successful lady now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1893
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:52.910
<v Speaker 4>and she explained it to me as you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1894
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.920
<v Speaker 4>you're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you blame yourself and everyone is </v>

1895
01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:57.920
<v Speaker 4>telling you that you shouldn't blame </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1896
01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:58.830
<v Speaker 4>You just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you,</v>

1897
01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:02.670
<v Speaker 4>why do you hate yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can never answer that question.</v>

1898
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:04.620
<v Speaker 4>But if you cut yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1899
01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.660
<v Speaker 4>that's why I hate myself because my fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1900
01:25:06.661 --> 01:25:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Who would do that to themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1901
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I should hate myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just cut myself.</v>

1902
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives them the excuse to,</v>

1903
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:18.760
<v Speaker 2>it's so amazing to me that we spend so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much time worrying about shit that's </v>

1904
01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.441
<v Speaker 2>going on overseas and these other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and so little time worrying </v>

1905
01:25:23.441 --> 01:25:28.271
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people are just getting raised </v>

1906
01:25:28.271 --> 01:25:31.370
<v Speaker 2>in some crazy fucked up way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people are,</v>

1907
01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unqualified to be having </v>

1908
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.401
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Children are suffering under the </v>

1909
01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 2>guidance and parental leadership or </v>
<v Speaker 2>these fuckheads like someone should </v>

1910
01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:47.500
<v Speaker 2>invest some something or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has got.</v>

1911
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.510
<v Speaker 2>It's probably got to be done by </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody all at once together.</v>

1912
01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.310
<v Speaker 2>There's no way like the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

1913
01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.260
<v Speaker 2>could fix the problem of stupidity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziness and abuse in this country.</v>

1914
01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.770
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

1915
01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.690
<v Speaker 2>but it at least make some sort of effort</v>
<v Speaker 2>to slow it down.</v>

1916
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will dump children.</v>

1917
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.800
<v Speaker 2>It's almost always something fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to children and then they start </v>

1918
01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.491
<v Speaker 2>doing shit like cutting themselves or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of other disturbing shit.</v>

1919
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.850
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is related to the sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse.</v>

1920
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:22.220
<v Speaker 2>The guy from horter said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever she gets involved,</v>

1921
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:27.610
<v Speaker 2>if he goes to a house and people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>storing their shit or or shitting and </v>

1922
01:26:27.610 --> 01:26:30.080
<v Speaker 2>diapers and leaving them piled up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always sexual abuse.</v>

1923
01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Fuck</v>

1924

<v Speaker 2>crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gotta fix that.</v>

1925
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:37.560
<v Speaker 2>This has got to be a way to fix the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

1926
01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Just fix the</v>

1927
01:26:39.190 --> 01:26:41.230
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck kids is really the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>way in it.</v>

1928
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:46.800
<v Speaker 4>The best way is you've got kids ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bad haircuts and horrible.</v>

1929
01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:55.660
<v Speaker 2>We've got to figure out a way to filter </v>
<v Speaker 2>every human being through some sort of </v>

1930
01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:59.451
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that lets you know how fucked </v>

1931
01:26:59.451 --> 01:26:59.451
<v Speaker 2>up they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

1932
01:26:59.451 --> 01:27:03.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could ever measure with like a </v>

1933
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:04.440
<v Speaker 2>machine psychological fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1934
01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.140
<v Speaker 2>if there's a machine you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could talk all the shit you want,</v>

1935
01:27:07.141 --> 01:27:09.480
<v Speaker 2>but I'm gonna send you through a machine</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the machine comes out like,</v>

1936
01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.170
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1937
01:27:10.171 --> 01:27:10.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1938
01:27:10.501 --> 01:27:12.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's fucking crazy.</v>

1939
01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:14.730
<v Speaker 2>That would be bad because in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government would use that machine.</v>

1940
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.290
<v Speaker 2>And so even though this talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>radically logically and normally we know</v>

1941
01:27:19.291 --> 01:27:21.280
<v Speaker 2>in the back of his head that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a suicide.</v>

1942
01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:26.380
<v Speaker 4>They would cheat with a machine that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would cheat just like the voting </v>

1943
01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:27.910
<v Speaker 4>machines to Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1944
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:33.410
<v Speaker 4>I've just bought a boat and going </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the mortgage process I found to </v>

1945
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:37.651
<v Speaker 4>be very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why I mentioned this </v>

1946
01:27:37.651 --> 01:27:38.230
<v Speaker 4>because of the terrorist thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they asked to see.</v>

1947
01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:42.100
<v Speaker 4>They sent me down because I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a citizen.</v>

1948
01:27:43.090 --> 01:27:45.640
<v Speaker 4>So they asked to see what all my checks </v>
<v Speaker 4>were deposited,</v>

1949
01:27:45.641 --> 01:27:50.641
<v Speaker 4>my big money checks that are gone in a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were they and why did I get the </v>

1950
01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:50.641
<v Speaker 4>checks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1951
01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:54.290
<v Speaker 4>The CFI was a terrorist or at first I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be an idiot to,</v>

1952
01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:59.580
<v Speaker 4>but they were all like the chuckle hot </v>
<v Speaker 4>bananas like comedy related and I was </v>

1953
01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.480
<v Speaker 4>getting that one's comedy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one's also comedy.</v>

1954
01:28:04.630 --> 01:28:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

1955
01:28:05.471 --> 01:28:07.450
<v Speaker 4>That one's comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's caroline?</v>

1956
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:10.720
<v Speaker 4>She's comedy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Hilarious,</v>

1957
01:28:10.721 --> 01:28:11.650
<v Speaker 4>but I just didn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1958
01:28:11.651 --> 01:28:13.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if Americans have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1959
01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:17.920
<v Speaker 4>but I was asked whether it was from to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fund terrorist for.</v>

1961
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:21.670

<v Speaker 4>What's the point?</v>

1962
01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:26.700
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to be the biggest fucking idiot</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorists in the world to go go comedy </v>

1963
01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:27.610

<v Speaker 4>That one's a bad one.</v>

1965
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Like it's all comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes.</v>

1966
01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Training in the mountains of Turkey.</v>

1968
01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:43.490
<v Speaker 2>dudes are running with like fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rifles over their heads.</v>

1969
01:28:43.491 --> 01:28:47.960
<v Speaker 2>They have like the traditional afghany </v>
<v Speaker 2>outfits on really fascinating.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

1971
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:54.030
<v Speaker 2>those training footages of character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist training footages like you </v>

<v Speaker 2>What kind of fucking.</v>

1974
01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.960
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1975
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:59.210
<v Speaker 4>It is like a little league team trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to play the Yankees.</v>

1976
01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1977
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:05.760
<v Speaker 4>We have got your bats now look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're homemade ball bat.</v>

1978
01:29:05.770 --> 01:29:09.130
<v Speaker 4>We did not have a vote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we have got the rubber bands and what</v>

1979
01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:12.780
<v Speaker 4>tape and we have got the tape over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and it's commented in some Yuck.</v>

1980
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:17.200
<v Speaker 2>One of the big UFC fighters got popped </v>
<v Speaker 2>for steroids this week.</v>

1981
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Not Steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1982
01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.420
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>test Alistair Overeem,</v>

1983
01:29:22.630 --> 01:29:27.400
<v Speaker 2>tested his testosterone to estrogen was </v>
<v Speaker 2>14 to one.</v>

1984
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:29:29.170 --> 01:29:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Which is normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A normal person is one to one and they </v>

1986
01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:38.731
<v Speaker 2>allow four to one in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow six to one because that used to be</v>

1987
01:29:39.461 --> 01:29:40.820
<v Speaker 2>the standard up until recently.</v>

1988
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:43.640
<v Speaker 4>I should add all of these hair falling </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

1989
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:48.530
<v Speaker 2>but he looks like a Goddamn Superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like a superhero in a movie.</v>

1990
01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Alistair Overeem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not gay or I'm not getting anything but </v>

1991
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:53.610
<v Speaker 2>the best.</v>

1992
01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:58.510
<v Speaker 4>So you're not talking about a man.</v>

1993
01:29:58.790 --> 01:30:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Anything right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing sexual but what I'm </v>

1994
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:05.561
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's absolutely the most </v>

1995
01:30:05.561 --> 01:30:06.110
<v Speaker 2>unrealistically built human I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

1996
01:30:06.170 --> 01:30:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see her for ignite type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pr,</v>

1997
01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:11.360
<v Speaker 2>but the perfect size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the guy,</v>

1998
01:30:11.361 --> 01:30:14.270
<v Speaker 2>like he's smaller than like Lou </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferrigno,</v>

1999
01:30:14.271 --> 01:30:15.850
<v Speaker 2>but ridiculously bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see him,</v>

2000
01:30:15.851 --> 01:30:16.430
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2001
01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:19.670
<v Speaker 2>They call them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber like ridiculous built,</v>

2002
01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.140
<v Speaker 2>but he used to fight at two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2003
01:30:21.141 --> 01:30:22.400
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to be a much smaller,</v>

2004
01:30:22.401 --> 01:30:27.401
<v Speaker 2>much skinnier guy and he packed all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight and so they don't know what </v>

2005
01:30:27.401 --> 01:30:31.361
<v Speaker 2>caused this guy to test so high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's most likely that he was a </v>

2006
01:30:31.361 --> 01:30:33.590
<v Speaker 2>supplementing his body's natural.</v>

2007
01:30:33.850 --> 01:30:37.330
<v Speaker 4>I thought most of them were probably on </v>
<v Speaker 4>some type of injection.</v>

2008
01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I would wonder what the real numbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2009
01:30:39.731 --> 01:30:40.690
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't wonder,</v>

2010
01:30:40.691 --> 01:30:45.691
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing things like this now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to find out they're </v>

2011
01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:48.910
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna catch a lot of people </v>

2012
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.910
<v Speaker 2>because what they're doing is they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it randomly,</v>

2013
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:49.420
<v Speaker 2>like they show up for a press </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>

2014
01:30:49.421 --> 01:30:51.790
<v Speaker 2>No one told them they were going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug tested and then boom,</v>

2015
01:30:51.970 --> 01:30:56.970
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden the Nevada state </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletic commission is taking samples </v>

2016
01:30:56.970 --> 01:30:57.250
<v Speaker 2>from them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

2017
01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.830
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't have a chance to prepare </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it in the past.</v>

2018
01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:02.800
<v Speaker 2>What they would do is they would try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle off of it,</v>

2019
01:31:02.801 --> 01:31:07.801
<v Speaker 2>but some people didn't and the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't fucked it up for everybody </v>

2020
01:31:07.801 --> 01:31:11.611
<v Speaker 2>else because then people start testing </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive and then people started like </v>

2021
01:31:11.611 --> 01:31:15.420
<v Speaker 2>the assert overturning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few fights have been overturned </v>

2022
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:15.420
<v Speaker 2>because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be a reality show.</v>

2023
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Danish would make that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2024
01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:17.860
<v Speaker 2>were they jumping in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2025
01:31:17.861 --> 01:31:20.830
<v Speaker 2>we're going to test you now and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible idea.</v>

2026
01:31:21.670 --> 01:31:23.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see that.</v>

2027
01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to have to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out how many people are actually doing </v>

2028
01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:28.560
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2029
01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I know for sure people have been caught </v>
<v Speaker 2>so for sure people are doing it,</v>

2030
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:37.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's the estimations vary from </v>

2031
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:40.080
<v Speaker 2>some people say half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people say almost all are doing </v>

2032
01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:40.780
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people say it's a small percentage,</v>

2033
01:31:40.781 --> 01:31:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have to go fight camp to fight</v>

2034
01:31:43.241 --> 01:31:48.241
<v Speaker 2>camp and get guys on some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>anonymous poll where they were honest </v>

2035
01:31:48.241 --> 01:31:52.321
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but knew that they weren't going to get </v>

2036
01:31:52.321 --> 01:31:52.321
<v Speaker 2>in trouble for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even then,</v>

2037
01:31:52.321 --> 01:31:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people would be smart to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth.</v>

2038
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:53.770
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2039
01:31:53.771 --> 01:31:54.940
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2040
01:31:55.510 --> 01:32:00.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a long standing tradition in </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every sport where people take </v>

2041
01:32:01.511 --> 01:32:04.720
<v Speaker 2>things that make them better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact.</v>

2042
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:09.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's because they want to get better</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that sport and their body just can't </v>

2043
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:10.970
<v Speaker 2>keep up the work pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't keep up the workload.</v>

2044
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:13.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can a guy get as big as mark mcgwire</v>

2045
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:14.860
<v Speaker 2>got without steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2046
01:32:14.861 --> 01:32:19.861
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that motherfucker better beaten ham </v>

2047
01:32:19.861 --> 01:32:21.310
<v Speaker 2>sandwiches over 15 minutes and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>squats and dead lifts and,</v>

2048
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:23.440
<v Speaker 2>and he's got not gonna have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time for baseball,</v>

2049
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a goddamn power lifter physique.</v>

2050
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:31.350
<v Speaker 2>And he got it by just just slamming that</v>
<v Speaker 2>needle in and pumping in that fucking </v>

2051
01:32:31.991 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Superman Jewson and that's the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get good at baseball.</v>

2052
01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.650
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that felt like nothing to him.</v>

2053
01:32:38.651 --> 01:32:41.950
<v Speaker 2>He got up and I was fucking massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he was the home run king,</v>

2054
01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:45.400
<v Speaker 2>when it was him and Sammy Sosa were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing back and forth,</v>

2055
01:32:45.401 --> 01:32:47.600
<v Speaker 2>both of us looked like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>superheroes,</v>

2056
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:48.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2057
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Just giant muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would go up and,</v>

2058
01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:56.560
<v Speaker 2>and these fucking balls would go flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the air into parking lots and </v>

2059
01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.790
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody loved it,</v>

2060
01:32:57.791 --> 01:33:02.791
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't love how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's crazy that Mark Mcguire is the </v>

2061
01:33:02.791 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 2>only one who really kinda got off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hook about it.</v>

2062
01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:03.790
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2063
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:07.630
<v Speaker 2>he admitted it to get a coaching job </v>
<v Speaker 2>like after he retired,</v>

2064
01:33:07.631 --> 01:33:10.300
<v Speaker 2>but he had shrunk down to a normal sized</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2065
01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:15.440
<v Speaker 2>This is a very bongs now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like at the beginning of his </v>

2066
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:15.440
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2067
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He slimmed down.</v>

2068
01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2069
01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:22.801
<v Speaker 2>he was probably doing a lot of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit in order to get better as he got </v>

2070
01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:22.801
<v Speaker 2>older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2071
01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:27.730
<v Speaker 2>that's when you're in your forties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just smashing balls are like </v>

2072
01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Roger Clemens was just throwing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2073
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got better.</v>

2074
01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird how you can dip like you're </v>

2075
01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:35.280
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

2076
01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.570
<v Speaker 2>It starts to show the signs of age and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you just charge right back up.</v>

2077
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:39.250
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's terrible.</v>

2078
01:33:39.251 --> 01:33:40.630
<v Speaker 2>He's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm like,</v>

2079
01:33:40.631 --> 01:33:42.270
<v Speaker 2>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked easy.</v>

2080
01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:47.700
<v Speaker 2>It is though that there's something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take that makes you better at </v>

2081
01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.250
<v Speaker 2>sports and isn't like being better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>

2082
01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.980
<v Speaker 2>isn't being more athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't being more vibrant,</v>

2083
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.640
<v Speaker 2>a sign of being healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so shouldn't only be looking at this guy</v>

2084
01:33:54.641 --> 01:33:57.790
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it amazing that modern science has</v>

2085
01:33:57.791 --> 01:34:02.791
<v Speaker 2>allowed barry bonds to actually get </v>
<v Speaker 2>better as he gets older and maybe I'll </v>

2086
01:34:02.791 --> 01:34:06.520
<v Speaker 2>allow him to take a little bit of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a little bit of that as long as he's</v>

2087
01:34:06.521 --> 01:34:09.100
<v Speaker 2>not getting too crazy because look </v>
<v Speaker 2>without that,</v>

2088
01:34:09.101 --> 01:34:10.960
<v Speaker 2>he was a very good baseball player </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

2089
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:14.170
<v Speaker 2>But with that Jesus fucking Christ had </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2090
01:34:14.171 --> 01:34:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Get Fun at the Ballpark at Barry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems fine,</v>

2091
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2092
01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:23.530
<v Speaker 2>no one's stepping in to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2093
01:34:23.531 --> 01:34:25.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ralphie may from eating too much.</v>

2094
01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:28.040
<v Speaker 2>There's no one from the government that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepping in and the same,</v>

2095
01:34:28.050 --> 01:34:30.310
<v Speaker 2>the name of comedy and stopping him from</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating too much.</v>

2096
01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Is Steroids comedy though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a personal writer ages real.</v>

2097
01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.760
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My analogy was a terrible analogy.</v>

2098
01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make sense.</v>

2099
01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:48.330
<v Speaker 2>But what I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was trying to say was that I </v>

2100
01:34:48.330 --> 01:34:48.330
<v Speaker 2>guess it does make him way better at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport,</v>

2101
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:53.260
<v Speaker 2>but I mean why wouldn't something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you better at a sport be legal?</v>

2102
01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't it be like used properly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that there's a lot of </v>

2103
01:34:58.290 --> 01:34:58.290
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as they</v>

2104
01:34:58.290 --> 01:35:00.830
<v Speaker 4>get older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their arguments that it gives you cancer</v>

2105
01:35:00.831 --> 01:35:01.930
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everything.</v>

2106
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:07.310
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck doesn't give you cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can say anything gives you cancer </v>

2107
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.310
<v Speaker 2>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2108
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people think cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>phones,</v>

2109
01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:10.070
<v Speaker 2>but there's no cases of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anybody's,</v>

2110
01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:12.720
<v Speaker 2>a brain tumor from a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard that?</v>

2111
01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.270
<v Speaker 4>Rather?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

2112
01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:19.420
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is people who've gotten brain </v>

2113
01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:22.181
<v Speaker 4>tumors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not doctors who were saying </v>

2114
01:35:22.181 --> 01:35:22.181
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gone on.</v>

2115
01:35:22.181 --> 01:35:22.181
<v Speaker 4>I think it's because</v>

2116
01:35:22.181 --> 01:35:24.860
<v Speaker 2>there's so much toxic shit in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a person's environment,</v>

2117
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:28.240
<v Speaker 2>it's so possible if you're not careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your diet and careful with your,</v>

2118
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.480
<v Speaker 2>your health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2119
01:35:29.530 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 2>if you could be in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would live someplace where you don't</v>

2120
01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:36.851
<v Speaker 2>even realize it and the whole town is </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting poisoned by some chemical leak </v>

2121
01:35:36.851 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 2>or some shit that's happened a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

2122
01:35:37.641 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 2>It's real common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult out there.</v>

2123
01:35:41.721 --> 01:35:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Jim Jefferies.</v>

2124
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:46.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a change in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult.</v>

2125
01:35:46.051 --> 01:35:51.051
<v Speaker 4>More chemicals in the food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it you find that a food taste </v>

2126
01:35:51.051 --> 01:35:51.051
<v Speaker 4>different here than in Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2127
01:35:51.051 --> 01:35:55.851
<v Speaker 4>I find I find it harder in this country </v>
<v Speaker 4>you did to keep my weight off because </v>

2128
01:35:55.851 --> 01:35:58.450
<v Speaker 4>the chemicals on it and sort of the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount I find.</v>

2129
01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.710
<v Speaker 4>What is it different?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what kind of shit the most?</v>

2130
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:04.710
<v Speaker 4>I think my beef in Australia is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just grasp it.</v>

2131
01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:07.140
<v Speaker 4>That isn't just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know best for you.</v>

2132
01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That isn't just an option.</v>

2133
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:14.050
<v Speaker 4>I think that's just what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if is in his strength and things </v>

2134
01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:16.671

<v Speaker 4>every trans fats illegal.</v>

2135
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:20.080
<v Speaker 4>It's so ridiculous that that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>legal drink.</v>

2136
01:36:20.210 --> 01:36:24.390
<v Speaker 4>Guess what boys associate cigarettes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're both smokers yet mean cigarettes.</v>

2137
01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:30.480
<v Speaker 4>If neither one of you could be hooked on</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes would thing about Msg is </v>

2138
01:36:31.081 --> 01:36:34.110
<v Speaker 4>different is I actually have a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>reaction.</v>

2139
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:36.330
<v Speaker 4>I get damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel a bit twitchy from eating it.</v>

2140
01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:41.660
<v Speaker 4>I know I've been in it so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I go into a Chinese restaurant now </v>

2141

<v Speaker 4>Do you have msg?</v>

2142
01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:45.180
<v Speaker 4>And they sometimes don't lie to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2143
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:47.960
<v Speaker 4>And how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you just feel a little bit on age?</v>

2144
01:36:47.970 --> 01:36:49.920
<v Speaker 4>Just afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my nerves are a bit,</v>

2145
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:51.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>to?</v>

2147
01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.850
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>

2148
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:58.160
<v Speaker 4>it's a very sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2149
01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:03.200
<v Speaker 4>you get that like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a tingly feeling in your jaw like </v>

2150
01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:03.200
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

2151
01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.940
<v Speaker 4>That happens to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2152
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:11.220
<v Speaker 4>but low sodium glutamate is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>tenderizer or whatever.</v>

2153
01:37:11.221 --> 01:37:13.140
<v Speaker 4>It's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a flavor enhancer.</v>

2154
01:37:13.890 --> 01:37:18.060
<v Speaker 4>Mike's mate softer and my vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 4>green.</v>

2155
01:37:18.061 --> 01:37:20.490
<v Speaker 4>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2156
01:37:20.491 --> 01:37:23.050
<v Speaker 4>It gives it color and mates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

2157
01:37:23.051 --> 01:37:28.051
<v Speaker 4>it's illegal and was about trans fats </v>
<v Speaker 4>are illegal in the rest of these are </v>

2158
01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:28.440
<v Speaker 4>things you just don't fucking need.</v>

2159
01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a real problem in this country </v>

2160
01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.930
<v Speaker 2>where the giant corporations have </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially completely bypassed the </v>

2161
01:37:36.381 --> 01:37:39.350
<v Speaker 2>whole system of government and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>control politicians.</v>

2162
01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just essentially just buying</v>
<v Speaker 2>people out.</v>

2163
01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's been done in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country for the last few debt problem.</v>

2164
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:46.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

2165
01:37:46.131 --> 01:37:48.680
<v Speaker 2>The argument is forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is right now,</v>

2166
01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:53.681
<v Speaker 2>the way things stand today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of shit that's bad for </v>

2178
01:38:20.290 --> 01:38:22.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big believer in healthcare and </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare will do it.</v>

2179
01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe is essential in a,</v>

2180
01:38:26.921 --> 01:38:28.570
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a modern society.</v>

2181
01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I can't listen to anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've lived in Britain whether health is </v>

2182
01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:33.910
<v Speaker 4>good and everything in Australia with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the healthcare is great.</v>

2183
01:38:34.930 --> 01:38:39.250
<v Speaker 4>And the arguments that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>republican and on top like right,</v>

2184
01:38:39.251 --> 01:38:44.251
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they go I won't have as good </v>

2185
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.081
<v Speaker 4>healthcare and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what about my great healthcare I </v>

2186
01:38:46.081 --> 01:38:46.081
<v Speaker 4>have now and then I'll have you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

2187
01:38:46.081 --> 01:38:47.380
<v Speaker 4>you can still get private healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 4>cover.</v>

2188
01:38:47.381 --> 01:38:50.290
<v Speaker 4>This is what people don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can still get the good private stuff</v>

2189
01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:56.040
<v Speaker 4>but you have an ailment and not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will never know the price of one of </v>

2190
01:38:56.561 --> 01:38:57.550
<v Speaker 4>your ailments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2191
01:38:57.710 --> 01:38:59.120
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2192
01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:01.510
<v Speaker 4>so at the moment I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of moles,</v>

2193

<v Speaker 4>I went back because I had some cancerous</v>
<v Speaker 4>moles in my back cut out right there.</v>

2194
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:08.260
<v Speaker 4>The doctor has with the terminologies is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's $4,800</v>

2195
01:39:08.370 --> 01:39:13.370
<v Speaker 4>to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking that can't fucking be </v>

2196
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.370
<v Speaker 4>$4,100</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>

2197
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:16.641
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went and checked with another </v>

2199
01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:21.600

<v Speaker 4>but your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're just using public health k you</v>

2202
01:39:27.671 --> 01:39:30.370
<v Speaker 4>put on a waiting list so they might look</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

2229
01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.890
<v Speaker 2>He's probably crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're famous,</v>

2230
01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.960
<v Speaker 2>you must be completely out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking mind.</v>

2231
01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:39.230
<v Speaker 2>How do you be Tom Cruise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go anywhere in the world that </v>

2232
01:40:39.230 --> 01:40:42.591
<v Speaker 2>someone known who he is and yet he's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a crazy cult organization and yet </v>

2233
01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:45.730
<v Speaker 2>there's rumors of him being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2234
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:49.530
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about like a dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle of secrets.</v>

2235
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:53.790
<v Speaker 2>If Tom Cruise really is gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the ultimate reality show.</v>

2236
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2237
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.740
<v Speaker 1>a room of people just never shut up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>

2238
01:40:56.770 --> 01:40:59.950
<v Speaker 1>And I will say even people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

2239
01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

2240
01:41:00.881 --> 01:41:05.881
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it from so many people that </v>

2241
01:41:05.881 --> 01:41:06.890
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people say that they thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was him and Travolta and.</v>

2242
01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2243
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Especially Travolta Travolta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they caught him with a photo </v>

2244
01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:15.340
<v Speaker 1>kissing that guy getting on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Who was the nanny and come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2246
01:41:18.431 --> 01:41:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe this is just weird like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2247
01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:25.320
<v Speaker 1>He could just be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people that say </v>

2248
01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 1>they've had sex with him and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2249
01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:28.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the guy be gay who gives a shit.</v>

2250
01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't give a shit.</v>

2251
01:41:29.710 --> 01:41:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I would be happier for the guy if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just come out.</v>

2252
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:33.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody cares.</v>

2253
01:41:33.581 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>This goddamn John Travolta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love him.</v>

2254
01:41:35.351 --> 01:41:38.560
<v Speaker 1>They love him from Saturday night fever </v>
<v Speaker 1>from pulp fiction.</v>

2255
01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:40.480
<v Speaker 1>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We personally know.</v>

2256
01:41:40.730 --> 01:41:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Of course we not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2257
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:46.950
<v Speaker 1>we personally know comedians who are gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>who keep it under wraps as sad as shit </v>

2258
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:49.060
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always think comics,</v>

2259
01:41:49.061 --> 01:41:51.790
<v Speaker 1>especially women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the most honest of them all.</v>

2260
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2261
01:41:52.841 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not playing characters.</v>

2262
01:41:54.611 --> 01:41:56.590
<v Speaker 1>We're playing ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>

2263
01:41:56.850 --> 01:42:01.850
<v Speaker 1>And then some of them were like MDF.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2264
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you.</v>

2265
01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me if you agree.</v>

2266
01:42:07.210 --> 01:42:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I find that the ones that keep it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>closet,</v>

2267
01:42:09.401 --> 01:42:11.230
<v Speaker 1>they always have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

2268
01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.630
<v Speaker 1>They always have a problem with coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with new material because uh,</v>

2269
01:42:14.631 --> 01:42:19.631
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not really alive in their own </v>

2270
01:42:19.631 --> 01:42:21.460
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like free and open and unrestricted,</v>

2271
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:26.550
<v Speaker 1>so it's more difficult for them to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with material and especially because </v>

2272
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.980
<v Speaker 1>they can't draw in real life </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

2273
01:42:26.981 --> 01:42:28.000
<v Speaker 1>the gay stuff.</v>

2274
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:31.720
<v Speaker 1>So they're like really like in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird pocket of bullshit where they,</v>

2275
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:35.350
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that a guy that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even allowed to say it to them.</v>

2276
01:42:35.351 --> 01:42:37.360
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the ones with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy community,</v>

2277
01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:39.300
<v Speaker 1>we can all say the president's game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2278
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.850
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2279
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2280
01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:46.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a fairly famous older black </v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman who he gets angry if you.</v>

2281
01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll get very mad.</v>

2282
01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:50.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2283
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:53.490
<v Speaker 1>He's old school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll fight you fight you.</v>

2284
01:42:53.610 --> 01:42:55.190
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2285
01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:57.460
<v Speaker 1>there's more than one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2286
01:42:57.660 --> 01:42:58.890
<v Speaker 1>there's more than one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

2287
01:42:58.891 --> 01:43:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I could have been talking about either </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>

2288
01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be harder in the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>community and that might be very </v>

2289
01:43:07.890 --> 01:43:10.471
<v Speaker 1>ignorant to me to sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be harder in the black </v>

2290
01:43:10.471 --> 01:43:10.471
<v Speaker 1>community of that generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be willing to guess.</v>

2291
01:43:10.471 --> 01:43:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know or yeah,</v>

2292
01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think if I had a time machine,</v>

2293
01:43:14.921 --> 01:43:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'd go back in time to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>black community,</v>

2294
01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:22.370
<v Speaker 1>that general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember an episode of Good Times where </v>

2295
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:24.931
<v Speaker 1>they were gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buried like Diana mileage.</v>

2296
01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.990
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2297
01:43:28.991 --> 01:43:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would suck though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dom irrera so fucking funny.</v>

2298
01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:37.260
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was gay just so I could come </v>

2299
01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:39.301
<v Speaker 1>out and he's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really is that guy.</v>

2300
01:43:39.431 --> 01:43:43.360
<v Speaker 1>He does not give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not pretending to knock.</v>

2301
01:43:43.361 --> 01:43:45.340
<v Speaker 1>He really doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he says something,</v>

2302
01:43:45.341 --> 01:43:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was gay just so I could come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2303
01:43:48.230 --> 01:43:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like extra funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is like an extra little treat they </v>

2304
01:43:53.230 --> 01:43:53.990
<v Speaker 1>get in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The color coming out.</v>

2305
01:43:53.991 --> 01:43:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And have everybody embrace you.</v>

2306
01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:57.310
<v Speaker 1>We love you for your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't care.</v>

2307
01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to have people ring me up one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and go,</v>

2308
01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I still love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just there's no reason.</v>

2309
01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:08.070
<v Speaker 1>People who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who haven't said they loved me </v>

2310
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.070
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to say they still love me once.</v>

2311
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:09.200
<v Speaker 1>That would be fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I think in the people that you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

2313
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 1>If you're a gay guy and he came out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the closet,</v>

2314
01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.550
<v Speaker 1>do you really want that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2315
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you get the double and so you lose </v>

2316
01:44:19.570 --> 01:44:19.570
<v Speaker 1>a Granddad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then a few years later he's like,</v>

2317
01:44:19.570 --> 01:44:24.551
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be back in your life </v>

2318
01:44:24.551 --> 01:44:27.221
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get another little present </v>

2319
01:44:27.221 --> 01:44:29.770
<v Speaker 1>on top if your Granddad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then what if he just talks about it </v>

2320
01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:32.590
<v Speaker 1>while you're fishing last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell your grandpa fucking freak.</v>

2321
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:35.540
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be with a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really that bad?</v>

2322
01:44:35.541 --> 01:44:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Girls are pretty and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck on a boat when he angry.</v>

2323
01:44:38.661 --> 01:44:43.640
<v Speaker 1>GRANDPA has a remarkable like truth that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girls are very pretty.</v>

2324
01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:46.190
<v Speaker 1>He is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know a lot of them are.</v>

2325
01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the confusing thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality.</v>

2326
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:50.840
<v Speaker 1>What are they thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2327
01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:55.841
<v Speaker 1>the confused aren't heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will fight for their right to think </v>

2328
01:44:55.841 --> 01:44:55.841
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll never understand it.</v>

2329
01:44:55.841 --> 01:44:59.010
<v Speaker 1>You can feel about heterosexuality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck the girl seeing us.</v>

2330
01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why anyone's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>men on either side.</v>

2331
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:06.550
<v Speaker 1>No one should be fucking men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2332
01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:11.560
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like fun to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you get into weird shit </v>

2333
01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:11.960
<v Speaker 1>that you'll never understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like girls will want to be choked.</v>

2334
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Like can you even relate to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a contortionist last night on the </v>

2335
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:19.670
<v Speaker 1>night show and she can put her leg up </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and she likes to be choked.</v>

2336
01:45:19.671 --> 01:45:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Well fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2337
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.420
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Selects a trailer.</v>

2338
01:45:23.421 --> 01:45:25.970
<v Speaker 1>So triangle or puts her leg over her </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>

2339
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Does she lock it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2340
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:30.050
<v Speaker 1>She triangles herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

2341
01:45:30.051 --> 01:45:35.051
<v Speaker 1>Because then because you chose to go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get that bit where their eyes </v>

2342
01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:36.530
<v Speaker 1>just rolled back a bit and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2343
01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to think if I could triangle </v>

2344
01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:41.900
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to see it.</v>

2345
01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2346
01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty flexible in her legs up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it behind her back.</v>

2347
01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think your legs are long enough,</v>

2348
01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:53.770
<v Speaker 1>is longer than a miles like </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionate.</v>

2349
01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also the body's thinner so you </v>

2350
01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.801
<v Speaker 1>can compress it more and when you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>body mass it's makes it more difficult </v>

2351
01:46:01.801 --> 01:46:02.050
<v Speaker 1>to flatten out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2352
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:04.310
<v Speaker 1>But you'd have to be in some serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>flexible.</v>

2353
01:46:04.311 --> 01:46:06.140
<v Speaker 1>So she chokes herself and then what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens?</v>

2354
01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:11.420
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just showing us like what were </v>

2355
01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:11.420
<v Speaker 1>her favorite things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While she's getting fucked,</v>

2356
01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:11.420
<v Speaker 1>she was telling you that,</v>

<v Speaker 4>my tongue,</v>

2379

<v Speaker 5>out of people.</v>

01:53:16.431 --> 01:53:18.560
<v Speaker 5>you let them have that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say you'd be a bigger,</v>

2523
01:53:18.650 --> 01:53:19.520
<v Speaker 5>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>better man.</v>

2524
01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:22.220
<v Speaker 5>It has the word squad in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't her show.</v>

2525
01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:27.830
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't really want to talk about this,</v>

2526
01:53:27.831 --> 01:53:30.770
<v Speaker 5>but let's talk about this real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go to somebody and be like,</v>

2527
01:53:30.771 --> 01:53:32.980
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to do a show on my podcast.</v>

2528
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:37.040
<v Speaker 5>It's a sex based podcasts and I'm ready </v>
<v Speaker 5>to call it sex to cast.</v>

2529
01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:40.610
<v Speaker 5>And then Jaden coil goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't you just call it sex squad?</v>

2530
01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:41.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2531
01:53:41.991 --> 01:53:42.590
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>

2532
01:53:42.591 --> 01:53:43.400
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2533
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:48.430
<v Speaker 5>do you want to come on the show and </v>
<v Speaker 5>empty when it come on the show somebody </v>

2534
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:51.011
<v Speaker 5>else and somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they just kind of stopped </v>

2535
01:53:51.011 --> 01:53:51.011
<v Speaker 5>talking to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2536
01:53:51.011 --> 01:53:51.011
<v Speaker 5>we're doing this show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

2537
01:53:51.011 --> 01:53:55.451
<v Speaker 5>I completely agree with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should have said something to you </v>

2538
01:53:55.821 --> 01:53:58.980
<v Speaker 5>and that's not cool for them to leave </v>
<v Speaker 5>and take name.</v>

2539
01:53:59.130 --> 01:54:02.960
<v Speaker 5>But all I'm saying is let them know what</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you care?</v>

2540
01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:05.390
<v Speaker 5>You can have another name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could take another name.</v>

2541
01:54:06.290 --> 01:54:07.970
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I created a show.</v>

2542
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.950
<v Speaker 5>I was co hosted the show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I paid for the show.</v>

2543
01:54:09.951 --> 01:54:13.850
<v Speaker 5>I did the show and it was not their show</v>
<v Speaker 5>to begin with.</v>

2544
01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:18.880
<v Speaker 5>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were people on the show and I </v>

2545
01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 5>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they wanted to do it on the road.</v>

2546
01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:22.780
<v Speaker 5>So you should have changed the name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why wouldn't you just give a this?</v>

2547
01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2548
01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:25.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2549
01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:27.250

<v Speaker 5>It was supposed to not be with them 100 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent.</v>

2558
01:54:41.751 --> 01:54:43.640
<v Speaker 5>It was supposed to be other people on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the show.</v>

2559
01:54:43.670 --> 01:54:48.670
<v Speaker 5>It was them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they kind of plotted on the </v>

2560
01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:48.670
<v Speaker 5>ship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you only do it with them?</v>

2561
01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:53.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Ryan Keeley and a couple other </v>

2562
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:53.500
<v Speaker 5>people were.</v>

<v Speaker 5>points of time,</v>

2564
01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:57.020
<v Speaker 5>but they kind of talked me out of it </v>
<v Speaker 5>type stuff.</v>

2565
01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:57.920
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they.</v>

2566
01:54:57.921 --> 01:55:00.770
<v Speaker 5>So they did talk you out of it though </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the episodes they did.</v>

01:55:00.771 --> 01:55:03.600
<v Speaker 5>Where would just them no one time they </v>
<v Speaker 5>had already should fear,</v>

2568
01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:06.140

<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2569
01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm the one that was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>What's up?</v>

2572
01:55:10.341 --> 01:55:12.350
<v Speaker 5>Jaded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in all fairness,</v>

2573
01:55:12.351 --> 01:55:17.351
<v Speaker 5>in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm on your side for this because </v>

2574
01:55:17.351 --> 01:55:17.870
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't just take a guy's show if he's</v>

2575
01:55:17.871 --> 01:55:20.900
<v Speaker 5>the host of it and you don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you tell them and run somewhere else.</v>

2576
01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:26.020
<v Speaker 5>But didn't that Jayden Coal Guy didn't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She actually just told you exactly what </v>

2577
01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said I wanted to do a podcast.</v>

2578
01:55:28.251 --> 01:55:33.251
<v Speaker 5>It was called sex and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should call it sex squad because </v>

2579
01:55:33.251 --> 01:55:34.850
<v Speaker 5>it's on the death squad podcasts.</v>

2580
01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:36.640
<v Speaker 5>Now I heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but didn't.</v>

2581
01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:38.720
<v Speaker 5>That's her name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then she invented it.</v>

2582
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:43.750
<v Speaker 5>She could do whatever she wants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the one that fucking used it and </v>

2583
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.750
<v Speaker 5>made paid for it and made a podcast with</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2584
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:46.600
<v Speaker 5>Getting crazy again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So without a debt,</v>

2585
01:55:46.610 --> 01:55:48.960
<v Speaker 5>without me creating death or mi using </v>
<v Speaker 5>desk squad,</v>

2586
01:55:48.970 --> 01:55:53.970

<v Speaker 5>would she have ever used the word quad </v>

<v Speaker 5>squad?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

2588
01:55:53.970 --> 01:55:58.401
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she did is she took the half of 50 </v>

2589
01:55:58.401 --> 01:55:58.800
<v Speaker 5>percent of it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But isn't there other sex squads online?</v>

<v Speaker 5>but all I'm saying is,</v>

2598
01:56:15.210 --> 01:56:17.070

<v Speaker 5>about 50 text messages that I got from </v>

2602

01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:25.950
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's wait.</v>

2604
01:56:25.951 --> 01:56:26.670
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could do that,</v>

2605
01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:28.740
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what she did?</v>

2606
01:56:28.770 --> 01:56:32.010
<v Speaker 5>She went on her website and blogs a bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking posted shit about.</v>

2607
01:56:32.130 --> 01:56:36.510
<v Speaker 5>I could say show the shit that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you of feel bad that that's her.</v>

2608
01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:38.150
<v Speaker 5>That's what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you kind of feel bad.</v>

2609
01:56:38.230 --> 01:56:40.290
<v Speaker 5>I feel bad about this whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel bad.</v>

2610
01:56:40.291 --> 01:56:45.291
<v Speaker 5>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not using the sex squad name </v>

2611
01:56:45.291 --> 01:56:45.291
<v Speaker 5>they had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They started the first Tuesday.</v>

2612
01:56:45.291 --> 01:56:46.310
<v Speaker 5>Show that they're calling it something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like sex squid or it's just spell it.</v>

2613
01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:49.680
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's let them do whatever the fuck they</v>

2614
01:56:49.681 --> 01:56:51.420
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit what I said.</v>

2615
01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:56.421
<v Speaker 5>It's why don't you please not use the </v>
<v Speaker 5>word squad because it confuses a show </v>

2616
01:56:56.421 --> 01:57:00.090
<v Speaker 5>that we already started with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me just clarify one thing.</v>

2617
01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:05.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't ever like to get as worked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>about a stupid name as you just did.</v>

2618
01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:06.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like to get bashed on somebody.</v>

2619
01:57:09.070 --> 01:57:14.070
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not getting bashed by a balanced </v>

2620
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.070
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I certainly would,</v>

2621
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:18.830
<v Speaker 5>but you could have avoided this conflict</v>
<v Speaker 5>with her if she wants to do things and </v>

2622
01:57:18.991 --> 01:57:20.610
<v Speaker 5>take that elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You tell him no,</v>

2623
01:57:20.611 --> 01:57:23.460
<v Speaker 5>but I thought jd is a good friend of </v>
<v Speaker 5>mine.</v>

2624
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:26.350
<v Speaker 5>She didn't fucking say one word to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't make one call.</v>

2625
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:28.710
<v Speaker 5>They said that they get returned phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>calls and stuff.</v>

2626
01:57:28.711 --> 01:57:31.530
<v Speaker 5>They made shit up about me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can fucking eat it depths.</v>

2627
01:57:31.531 --> 01:57:36.531
<v Speaker 5>Unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's called fucking slander and I </v>

2628
01:57:36.531 --> 01:57:37.410
<v Speaker 5>didn't even fucking do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these fucking making shit up mouth.</v>

2629
01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:39.870
<v Speaker 5>Don't have that kind of power over you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2630
01:57:39.871 --> 01:57:42.240
<v Speaker 5>Just cut them loose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cut them loose in life.</v>

2631
