<v Speaker 1>Store just lip singing songs and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>played drums.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would play really good.</v>

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>You'd pull the chairs up and jumps two </v>
<v Speaker 1>drumsticks and start playing to chairs </v>

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.020
<v Speaker 1>and it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music is really good and it would just </v>

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>go on as long as there was one person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience,</v>

6
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>they will keep going so it lasts for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

7
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's 2:00</v>

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.560

<v Speaker 1>I got to go and then I'd stay there for </v>

9
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>another hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that place is like one of the weirdest </v>

14
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.711
<v Speaker 1>spots ever for like cool development of </v>

<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As dark as it is.</v>

16
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>There is that element of creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement there.</v>

17
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird sort of a community and </v>

18
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>a commodity like Tammy Presca Deli </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted something on twitter today,</v>

<v Speaker 1>printer.</v>

00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:03.951

<v Speaker 1>as he was coming up to me when comedies </v>

24
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>to a motherfucker and like knuckles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have that,</v>

25
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:12.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many good comics that have </v>

26
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>come out of there and they have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease history to that,</v>

27
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>like being a marine or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>There's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's undeniable miserable and we love </v>

29
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>They just need to clean that place up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of ever going back,</v>

31
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>get rid of some shitty baggage in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

32
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>The spot itself is fantastic.</v>

33
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most historical spots in</v>

34
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the world of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

35
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:38.121
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you thought you stopped to think </v>

36
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.551
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the most historically important </v>

37
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>stop in the world of standup comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's still around?</v>

38
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd say it's the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the comedy store to </v>

39
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>prior film live that sunset strip there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything in New York that </v>

40
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>really counts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything's left.</v>

41
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that.</v>

42
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>When did he film it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was of the roxy.</v>

43
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.350
<v Speaker 1>The Roxy was Kennison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>

44
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that he filmed live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them at least he filmed at the </v>

45
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>comedy store in the main room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the background?</v>

46
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

47
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm pretty sure that was it and </v>

48
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.811
<v Speaker 1>that was prior when he was just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest stand up to ever walk the face </v>

49
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>of the planet.</v>

50
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>He was the number one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in my eyes what I have to rank </v>

51
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>like the all time guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always number one prior.</v>

52
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like priors,</v>

53
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

54
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:27.201
<v Speaker 1>I think Kennison in 86 was as funny as </v>
<v Speaker 1>any living human being ever has been or </v>

55
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>ever will be and it always makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>

56
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never like,</v>

57
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>oh good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh very clever.</v>

58
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like he was the best for like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

59
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>but then coke just took its toll coke </v>
<v Speaker 1>and booze and just fucking drinking </v>

60
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.771
<v Speaker 1>bottles of vodka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had Aaron on the show and Marion </v>

61
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:48.561
<v Speaker 1>was telling us this story of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard some of them out with </v>

62
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Kennison after doing coke for like three</v>
<v Speaker 1>days in a row with no sleep and how it </v>

63
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>like for years fucked with his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he said for a whole year,</v>

64
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>like he heard voices in his head like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>

65
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:59.310
<v Speaker 1>You can you imagine</v>

66
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 2>having that kind of memory of Kennison </v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling your name at you.</v>

67
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And they were always locking each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the house and fucking with</v>

68
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Saki about psychosis words in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was having,</v>

69
00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:13.460
<v Speaker 1>like people were talking to him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't really there like he was.</v>

70
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.540
<v Speaker 1>He was hearing things because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that he just red line his brain </v>

71
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.880
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with kids for like x amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

72
00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:23.360
<v Speaker 1>And he's a young guy to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get out of town.</v>

73
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It drove kinison drove him out of town.</v>

74
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Well his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fucking story about hanging out with</v>

75
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:33.761
<v Speaker 1>Kinison is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest all time Hollywood </v>

76
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:33.761
<v Speaker 1>party stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way merit tells it.</v>

77
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:38.551
<v Speaker 1>It was from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't remember what number of </v>

78
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:38.551
<v Speaker 1>podcast it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God damn it was good.</v>

79
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good story and such a.</v>

80
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.390
<v Speaker 1>When you stop and think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the history of standup comedy,</v>

81
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:49.391
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most epic things was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store explosion with Kennison and</v>

82
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:54.731
<v Speaker 1>the in the late eighties because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became like everybody recognized that </v>

83
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:58.691
<v Speaker 1>there was this one spot we're kennison </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed in Hollywood and this is the </v>

84
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>same spot where prior came out of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>David Letterman came out of it.</v>

85
00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>All these other people came out of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it put the spot,</v>

86
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>like it became like an even bigger spot </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mind of like standup comedy.</v>

87
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't really hear that about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The improv was always a great club.</v>

88
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Still a great club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that places a nuthouse yeah.</v>

89
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Comedy store is always has been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuthouse.</v>

90
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I heard Schubert telling some story </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how he took kinison offstage on a </v>

92
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.631
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fucking awesome is that and I don't </v>

93
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:33.841
<v Speaker 2>know how that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he told the fucking store and we </v>

94
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 2>went through that back hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that was so hilarious and like can </v>

95
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I think kinison told them to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you said kinison seemed pretty </v>

96
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 2>scared when they were doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

97
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that's a shitty way to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>your leg twice a risk because you can </v>

98
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 2>see out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 2>If you fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could ruin a good set.</v>

100
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that there's a,</v>

101
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>there's no spots like that left in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

102
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a new spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:01.351
<v Speaker 1>the comedy cellar is like the new spots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's carolines which was always </v>

104
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 1>like a big headliner club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like a development club,</v>

105
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>like the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really nothing left.</v>

106
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.030
<v Speaker 2>There's something in Queens called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creek and the cave,</v>

107
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 2>which isn't quite the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's comedy there every nights </v>

108
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>and people can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is there's no real </v>

109
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.971
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's like three or four shows a </v>

110
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:19.340
<v Speaker 2>night and you can just hang out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fuck around on stage,</v>

111
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 2>but how long has it been around?</v>

112
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Long at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm saying.</v>

113
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:27.361
<v Speaker 1>It's like these weird things like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>store is one of the weirdest places </v>

114
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:29.440
<v Speaker 1>because it's a place that's still around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and still in the same form.</v>

115
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Like the way the shows are set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started eight artists goes on at </v>

116
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>8:30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the show goes on throughout the</v>

117
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody tag teams,</v>

118
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>it's an 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM to 2:00</v>

119
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>AM show every night and that's just what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

120
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no other places that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocking it like that.</v>

121
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many places are left that are </v>

122
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.110
<v Speaker 1>running it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the only one.</v>

123
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's very few other ones.</v>

124
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some organized shows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a main room shows that coincide </v>

125
00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:59.131
<v Speaker 1>with the or shows that are organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day that that's a </v>

126
00:05:59.131 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>weird club because it exists back like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the clubs used to exist in the hay day.</v>

127
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still running the same way and even</v>

128
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>running more free than any of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubs ever ran like that.</v>

129
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the tag team thing.</v>

130
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tag Teams.</v>

131
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Is there another club in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>country that's known for only having tag</v>

132
00:06:15.061 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>teams?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody that's known for it.</v>

133
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I've only ever seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy magic does it.</v>

134
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>They'll do it occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not their thing.</v>

135
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll also have an MC with comedy.</v>

136
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Magic is the weirdest one ever because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they always have a magician on the show.</v>

137
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the fan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Definitely don't like following it.</v>

139
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:34.860
<v Speaker 1>That's for fucking sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will.</v>

140
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Does it feel like you have to restart </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd when you follow it?</v>

141
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I feel like all they want is magic after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

142
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>learned one trick just for situations </v>

190
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:31.481
<v Speaker 1>completely different kind of tone than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you setting up a joke and being </v>

191
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:34.811
<v Speaker 1>conversational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to draw them into the way you're </v>

192
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:34.811
<v Speaker 1>thinking about things.</v>

193
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:38.080
<v Speaker 1>What's up with Ikea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know men and women are different.</v>

194
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

195
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I opened a show for Brandon Flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the killers,</v>

196
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:46.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this band,</v>

197
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 1>the killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the band before,</v>

198
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:53.350
<v Speaker 1>he had a solo tour and they had me open </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show at the troubadour and that was </v>

199
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the worst experiences in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was just opening.</v>

200
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>But at a music show they don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce you.</v>

201
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up there and introduce yourself,</v>

202
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I've only opened up for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bands.</v>

204
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I opened up for Bon Jovi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

205
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

206
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrible.</v>

207
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I deserved whatever I deserved them to </v>

208
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.140
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was funny.</v>

209
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't very good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was uh,</v>

210
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Speaker 1>was also so strange because it was in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater in a round.</v>

211
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It was the kid I was on stage with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>their equipment,</v>

212
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.620
<v Speaker 1>so I had to like move around these drums</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to tell a standup and I was not </v>

213
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:31.490
<v Speaker 1>really used to doing standup and places </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other than a comedy club.</v>

214
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd only been doing it like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years when this had happened.</v>

215
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way I should have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>like opening up for a big band.</v>

216
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

217
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:38.480
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

218
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 1>that's a tall order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

219
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:45.141
<v Speaker 1>I had some weird deal with MTV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they offered it to me and like a </v>

220
00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>greedy little bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know his place.</v>

221
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

223
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And so there was people behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either walk around someplace in.</v>

224
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It was either Brooklyn or Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>

225
00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York bands use of e-cigarettes and </v>

226
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

227
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty three day eight.</v>

228
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer allowed to blow out </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake smoke.</v>

229
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 1>And that is ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ignorant of what that is.</v>

230
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 1>That's really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just vapor.</v>

231
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>It's water vapor mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

232
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't smell bad.</v>

233
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

234
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it exists though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe that's a good point.</v>

235
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you make a vaporizer that </v>

236
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make smoke like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can.</v>

237
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 1>That's all part of the fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

238
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Probably smokers want to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably most likely otherwise,</v>

239
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 1>if you can't smell it and he can't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

240
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>then what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude?</v>

241
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:41.781
<v Speaker 1>I went to a restaurant the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a restaurant the other night </v>

242
00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 1>and there was this lady on the patio </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was smoking and uh,</v>

243
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that she was smoking outside.</v>

244
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:49.161
<v Speaker 1>She has every right to smoke outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a restaurant if they have an ash tray </v>

245
00:10:49.161 --> 00:10:49.161
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's legal in the town,</v>

246
00:10:49.161 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 1>it's that she was putting out our </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes in this plant and you know,</v>

247
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.000
<v Speaker 1>we went out there afterwards and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking with my wife saying,</v>

248
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>do you think that she got rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes?</v>

249
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

250
00:10:58.591 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be right there.</v>

251
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 1>And we walked right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure enough,</v>

252
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 1>four cigarettes in writing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

253
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice place to stick it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant.</v>

254
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>She just decided right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it is.</v>

255
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you wouldn't take your soda can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>crunch it up,</v>

256
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.440
<v Speaker 1>leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for cigarettes,</v>

257
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird disconnect with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarette smokers.</v>

258
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know they're doing something toxic </v>

259
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.410
<v Speaker 1>to their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't care,</v>

260
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 1>so when they're done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're done.</v>

261
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.050
<v Speaker 1>They'll throw it on the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any respect for their </v>

262
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.301
<v Speaker 1>own body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any respect for the </v>

263
00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:29.301
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they always say it's biodegradable,</v>

264
00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:33.141
<v Speaker 1>but how can that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it is so what it's going to </v>

265
00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:34.940
<v Speaker 1>exist for 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll look like that for 100 years ago.</v>

266
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Tracy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

267
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a little foam thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how long it's going to take for</v>

268
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.470
<v Speaker 1>that to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't rain here stupid.</v>

269
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Even if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it degrades,</v>

270
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.150
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to go into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

271
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 1>You know it's going to become a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dirt.</v>

272
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.080
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's toxic.</v>

273
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.930
<v Speaker 1>That's shitty things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to put it in a bag and </v>

274
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.931
<v Speaker 1>then some supposed to pick it up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they put in a landfill somewhere until </v>

275
00:11:56.931 --> 00:11:56.931
<v Speaker 1>somebody figures out how to make it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel,</v>

276
00:11:56.931 --> 00:12:01.730
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But until then we got piles of places </v>

277
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.730
<v Speaker 1>where we stick shit like this</v>

278
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.080
<v Speaker 2>because we don't want it just laying </v>
<v Speaker 2>around on the ground.</v>

279
00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:06.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not biodegradable fuckhead no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

280
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Even if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

281
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Know even if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they all say the same thing.</v>

282
00:12:11.911 --> 00:12:13.590
<v Speaker 2>They've all been given the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>pamphlet,</v>

283
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.120
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what you say,</v>

284
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 2>this is why it's okay to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all believed that early.</v>

285
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Say That</v>

286
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.380
<v Speaker 1>when Duncan and I were filming the Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan questions,</v>

287
00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:24.330
<v Speaker 1>everything show on Scifi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to Utah.</v>

288
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.400
<v Speaker 1>We went to this one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was supposed to show us </v>

289
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.091
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the dude was nutty and he's </v>

290
00:12:32.091 --> 00:12:32.091
<v Speaker 1>making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty obvious,</v>

291
00:12:32.091 --> 00:12:36.351
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that was weird was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was smoking cigarettes and I saw</v>

292
00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:37.320
<v Speaker 1>him smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

293
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.420
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was supposed to be like this expert </v>

294
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:42.420
<v Speaker 1>that knows this terrain and knows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

295
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I see him smoking a cigarette and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden he's not smoking anymore</v>

296
00:12:44.641 --> 00:12:47.490
<v Speaker 1>and he doesn't have it in his hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're nowhere near garbage.</v>

297
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.240
<v Speaker 1>So I look at him and I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you do with your cigarette?</v>

298
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.530
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

299
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you do with your cigarette?</v>

300
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

301
00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 1>just throw it on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

302
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

303
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you throw it on the ground?</v>

304
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the wilderness like,</v>

305
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.850
<v Speaker 1>like we're out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be like the stewards </v>

306
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.191
<v Speaker 1>of the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is public wildlife land and you're </v>

307
00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 1>taking cigarettes out and thrown on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground in front of everybody.</v>

308
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 1>You have a pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a cigarette waste.</v>

309
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:19.231
<v Speaker 1>Fifty pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't carry it back and you'll die </v>

310
00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:19.231
<v Speaker 1>up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it in your fucking pocket man.</v>

311
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Like this is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for him it was instant.</v>

312
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do.</v>

313
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.200
<v Speaker 1>You're done with your cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You throw it on the ground,</v>

314
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 1>you step on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk on.</v>

315
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.840
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't think twice about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're talking about beautiful </v>

316
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.480
<v Speaker 1>land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous landscape,</v>

317
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.700
<v Speaker 1>crazy rock formations and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't think twice about throwing a </v>

318
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 1>cigarette onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just leaving it there.</v>

319
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't do with anything else.</v>

320
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:44.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing that people do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

321
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird,</v>

322
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:46.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

323
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

324
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.220
<v Speaker 2>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it took Bill Hicks.</v>

325
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the worst part.</v>

326
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Most honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely.</v>

327
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was something else,</v>

328
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

329
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:02.941
<v Speaker 2>but I still smoked a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dean del Ray the other day and he rides </v>

330
00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:04.300
<v Speaker 2>a motorcycle and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

331
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.780
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing is when people flick </v>
<v Speaker 2>their cigarettes out of the car and in a</v>

332
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 2>year and a motorcycle and it goes right </v>
<v Speaker 2>into your like suit,</v>

333
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.660
<v Speaker 2>like driving and you're trying to get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of.</v>

334
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one anyways though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's the whole new level and</v>

335
00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:21.100
<v Speaker 2>you see that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

336
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:23.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to throw out of this car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what happens to it.</v>

337
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 2>It's only California where everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dry as fuck.</v>

338
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 2>It happens every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole fucking mountain side goes up.</v>

339
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.690
<v Speaker 2>All retards,</v>

340
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:36.690
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just got to get better at educating </v>

341
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.950
<v Speaker 1>people from the jump better at educating</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>

342
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what we gotta do to take babies </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from retards.</v>

343
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Giving that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fuck them up.</v>

344
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be a cigarette tosser do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch?</v>

345
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know the controversy.</v>

346
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:55.021
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted some from the borrower report </v>

347
00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:55.021
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

348
00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I guess a lot of people thought that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was real.</v>

350
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was real when I first read </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

351
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.990
<v Speaker 1>like when I first read the title and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I saw it was the bar,</v>

352
00:15:00.991 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>what's report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was that Vince and Scalia defends</v>

353
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.580
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

354
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull up the tweet.</v>

355
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:12.881
<v Speaker 1>So I say someone tweeted me and said not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about duck dynasty and I know no</v>

356
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>idea what they were talking about.</v>

357
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.310
<v Speaker 1>This is why I'll tell you why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

358
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

359
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.240
<v Speaker 1>the thing I tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the New Yorker and someone </v>

360
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 1>tweeted me or sent me the headline and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at it and I was like,</v>

361
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.940
<v Speaker 1>what is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized it was the borrow </v>

362
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:30.940
<v Speaker 1>it's report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

363
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 1>he's a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

364
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:36.701
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said Vincent Scalia Calls Duck Dynasty </v>

365
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:37.670
<v Speaker 1>decision unconstitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I saw was the New Yorker Dot com,</v>

366
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:42.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I thought it was some sort of a news </v>

367
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:42.940
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

368
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I posted it and so many people got </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

369
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.760
<v Speaker 1>There was so much anger he'll fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>supreme court to say with a lot of </v>

370
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.220
<v Speaker 1>people who agree with and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

371
00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

372
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of Jesus tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people talking to me about sin </v>

373
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.720
<v Speaker 1>and the sins of the flesh and Jesus says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

374
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 1>there was a slew of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came my way,</v>

375
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

376
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 1>And then so I had the tweet after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey folks,</v>

377
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 1>not familiar with the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which report,</v>

378
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:13.150
<v Speaker 1>he's a comedy writer and when I post it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was satire.</v>

379
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Everybody take it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just being funny.</v>

380
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Speaker 1>But why is everybody getting mad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the duck guy getting removed from tv for</v>

381
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:25.001
<v Speaker 1>saying that he doesn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone choosing a man's anus over a </v>

382
00:16:25.001 --> 00:16:26.550
<v Speaker 1>woman's vagina?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

383
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:33.130
<v Speaker 1>let's compare that to a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are allowed to say and not </v>

384
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:33.890
<v Speaker 1>get kicked off TV for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

385
00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

386
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that really a big deal that he's </v>

387
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.461
<v Speaker 1>saying that I don't understand why </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody would choose a man's anus over a</v>

388
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:43.670
<v Speaker 1>girl's vagina either?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>

389
00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that,</v>

390
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:50.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that people should be </v>

391
00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:51.500
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that it's not that way for me.</v>

392
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't understand when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the opera,</v>

393
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I know people love the opera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been to the opera and I don't </v>

394
00:16:59.620 --> 00:16:59.620
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

395
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.210
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like men's boutiques don't work </v>

396
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:04.430
<v Speaker 1>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do work with some.</v>

397
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 1>What'd you pick a man's anus over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opera.</v>

398
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a toss up because I could,</v>

399
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking got correctly.</v>

400
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:14.590
<v Speaker 1>You're done in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Operas take three hours,</v>

401
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:19.780
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take hours in their fucking mental </v>

402
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>torture to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously not to you,</v>

403
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the duck dynasty where he fucked up</v>

404
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:25.730
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

405
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't just saying that he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand people making that choice.</v>

406
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.550
<v Speaker 1>He's also talking about sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

407
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>and people start talking about people </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing in hell for being gay.</v>

408
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And the network has to show a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of,</v>

409
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say,</v>

410
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say guidance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to set a certain amount of</v>

411
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:50.831
<v Speaker 1>an example if they are the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are ultimately responsible for putting </v>

412
00:17:50.831 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>something on television and a guy says </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is kind of homophobic and</v>

413
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even kind of homophobic.</v>

414
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 1>What was his actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

419
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to a guy who wrote a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his whole thing is about,</v>

420
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:15.160
<v Speaker 1>his shtick is about being controversial </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

421
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.210
<v Speaker 1>being a wild man with this wacky beard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and him and his sons and they all hold </v>

422
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>hands and pray at the end of every </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

425
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.560

<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the redneck on TV?</v>

427

<v Speaker 1>Do you know what he looks like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>think it's funny.</v>

433
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 4>It seems like to me a vagina as a man </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be more desirable than a man's </v>

434
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.260
<v Speaker 4>anus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just me.</v>

435
00:18:53.261 --> 00:18:55.540
<v Speaker 4>He adds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more there.</v>

436
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.100
<v Speaker 4>She's got more to offer.</v>

<v Speaker 4>come on dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hey sin.</v>

<v Speaker 4>my man.</v>

439
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's not that bad to me.</v>

440
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 1>He didn't guy that sounds like a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's trying to do some comedy and </v>

441
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.850
<v Speaker 1>trying to be funny and he's not good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

442
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to be interesting or what?</v>

443
00:19:14.211 --> 00:19:19.211
<v Speaker 1>Then he can take his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's grown up being a duck call </v>

444
00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:20.810
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer and then over the next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:26.350
<v Speaker 1>x amount of years he becomes one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most popular people on television and </v>

446
00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:28.700
<v Speaker 1>people think he's funny on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he gets into that sort of vibe.</v>

449
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's who he is in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

450
00:19:35.331 --> 00:19:39.590
<v Speaker 1>The guy's not going to invent this </v>
<v Speaker 1>character at 65 years of age or whatever</v>

451

<v Speaker 4>It's not right.</v>

456
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.180
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't watch any of that crap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they show a lot of church scenes in </v>

460
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:03.901
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't they?</v>

461
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:06.970
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember seeing at least one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very religious show.</v>

462
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.620
<v Speaker 4>You don't fuck with God's America.</v>

463
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.460
<v Speaker 1>He released a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this.</v>

464
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.340
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I myself am a product of the sixties.</v>

465
00:20:15.341 --> 00:20:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I centered my life around sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

466
00:20:17.111 --> 00:20:20.920
<v Speaker 1>and rock and roll until I hit rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and accepted Jesus as my savior.</v>

467
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.280
<v Speaker 1>My mission today is to go forth and tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>people about why I follow Christ and </v>

468
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.421
<v Speaker 1>also what the Bible teaches as a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that teaching is that women and men are </v>

469
00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:32.860
<v Speaker 1>meant to be together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

470
00:20:32.861 --> 00:20:37.861
<v Speaker 1>I would never treat anyone with </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespect just because they're are </v>

471
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:37.861
<v Speaker 1>different from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all,</v>

472
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:40.000
<v Speaker 1>we are all created by the Almighty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like him.</v>

473
00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:45.001
<v Speaker 1>I love all of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would all be better off if we love </v>

474
00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:46.660
<v Speaker 1>God and love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his quote.</v>

475
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 1>What Dick?</v>

476
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>TMZ has a thing up right now.</v>

477
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:58.291
<v Speaker 1>It says Phil Robertson publicly bashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>gaze for years and he knew all about it.</v>

478
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I love how they have and he knew all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and caps.</v>

479
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of those dudes out there.</v>

481
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.810
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those weird dudes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>care if guys are gay and then they do it</v>

482
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 1>because they think that Jesus doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it and they get angry about it.</v>

483
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone's ever read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible.</v>

484
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 1>A few people that read it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

485
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I tried one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat in so many hotel rooms.</v>

486
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:27.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so many people talk about this </v>

<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

490
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.570
<v Speaker 1>The Bible really doesn't hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why does it have power?</v>

<v Speaker 1>they might as well be silent movies,</v>

510
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

511
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Might as well be the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first minute and a half with him </v>

512
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:31.860
<v Speaker 1>just getting his golf bag together and </v>

<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

514
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately men watching TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it on actual television with </v>

515
00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:41.710
<v Speaker 1>commercials might as well be silent </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

516
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like it's gotten to the point where </v>

517
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.861
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you sit down and watch what </v>

518
00:22:49.861 --> 00:22:49.861
<v Speaker 1>someone else's programmed for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

519
00:22:49.861 --> 00:22:54.181
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to watch what I'm trying to </v>

520
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:54.181
<v Speaker 1>sitting down and watching it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials.</v>

521
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like if you don't have a dvr </v>

522
00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 1>or if like I tried to watch the walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead the other day I tried to,</v>

523
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I taped it on the dvr but I also had </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an itunes subscription for it so I </v>

524
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:08.260
<v Speaker 1>could watch on ipad and I mostly watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on Itunes,</v>

525
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 1>on my tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I decided to try to watch it live.</v>

526
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Like actually watch it with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials on because it was on phone.</v>

527
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's watch it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

528
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.720
<v Speaker 1>this is like a 15 fucking minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six commercial breaks and they </v>

529
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:21.720
<v Speaker 1>played the same commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not only that,</v>

530
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:26.830
<v Speaker 1>there was one time where it was like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they showed like five minutes of the </v>

531
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.830
<v Speaker 1>show and then it went to commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

532
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.440
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't make any sense.</v>

533
00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck can you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't concentrate on the action.</v>

534
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:34.360
<v Speaker 1>You're not really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get lost in this,</v>

535
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.470
<v Speaker 1>this breakup by all this shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to see and then you got to </v>

536
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.481
<v Speaker 1>get sucked back into the action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a couple minutes and then next </v>

537
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:42.481
<v Speaker 1>thing that was another fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>

538
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how unbelievably like </v>
<v Speaker 1>disjointed.</v>

539
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Watching a show is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trying to watch a show like that </v>

540
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.970
<v Speaker 1>because I haven't done it so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did it the other night and it's </v>

541
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:54.970
<v Speaker 1>fucking terrible.</v>

542
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't enjoy it at all.</v>

543
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the TA.</v>

544
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:04.690
<v Speaker 1>They're having commercials on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of a show is the shittiest </v>

545
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:08.651
<v Speaker 1>fucking way to break up a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's one thing if you have like a </v>

546
00:24:08.651 --> 00:24:13.091
<v Speaker 1>two hour show and you have an hour break</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pee in the middle or something like </v>

547
00:24:13.091 --> 00:24:14.780
<v Speaker 1>that and everybody knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come back in,</v>

548
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 1>look at the opera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

549
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.080
<v Speaker 1>like a five minute commercial break that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody enjoys and that this and that,</v>

550
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes a contest of who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the most creative commercials that </v>

551
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.390
<v Speaker 1>make people actually want to stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and watch them and then they have</v>

552
00:24:26.391 --> 00:24:27.980
<v Speaker 1>this five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

553
00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:30.590
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck minutes of commercials</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next shell plays.</v>

554
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 1>That's how they should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just mixed the products in the shows.</v>

555
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you can't trust the show.</v>

556
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 1>You're like thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why is he have a coke there?</v>

557
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Because they paid them down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.680
<v Speaker 1>as the Zombie of a sprite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They already do that.</v>

559
00:24:43.681 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 1>If they already do that on television </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

560
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go to my house,</v>

561
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see a coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see a sprite.</v>

562
00:24:48.021 --> 00:24:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Why make it some fake one that's even </v>
<v Speaker 1>throws you out of your,</v>

563
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real wisdom to begin with.</v>

564
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.280
<v Speaker 1>You know like if you have like a pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>soda,</v>

565
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one has pop sodas.</v>

566
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is fake because they don't pay </v>

567
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Speaker 1>you unless you prominently feature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't pay you if you just use it.</v>

568
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Like they give you free shit to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when we were on news radio,</v>

569
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 1>they had like fake coax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like the had like a sticker.</v>

570
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 1>They would put over a real coke but the </v>
<v Speaker 1>logo was approved.</v>

571
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 1>It was approved to use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they want to pay you,</v>

572
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:21.250
<v Speaker 1>then you got to do a coke commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have the coke right </v>

573
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:21.250
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this.</v>

574
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.480
<v Speaker 1>They're just giving you coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they wanted to pay you,</v>

575
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then then things would get different </v>

576
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:28.500
<v Speaker 1>than you would have to actually say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

577
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.990
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just have a coke and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smile and shut your pie hole.</v>

578
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And then it would be like written into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that you have to say coke every day.</v>

579
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>like product placement and then like a </v>

580
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.071
<v Speaker 1>real commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the kind of monies that you get </v>

581
00:25:42.071 --> 00:25:44.591
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing a commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get a lot of money when they're </v>

582
00:25:44.591 --> 00:25:46.370
<v Speaker 1>doing like think about like how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were watching walking dead,</v>

583
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.400
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like $16 million a show or something </v>

584
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:51.400
<v Speaker 1>crazy like that.</v>

585
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the number is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something huge,</v>

586
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 1>something huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

587
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So just thinking about how many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are watching those commercials </v>

588
00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:57.470
<v Speaker 1>and how much those commercials are worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the network.</v>

589
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Big money sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big money because if you're getting past</v>

590
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:03.500
<v Speaker 1>a million views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2 million,</v>

591
00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>then you become a phenomenon like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking dead.</v>

592
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.270
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get some cash for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ads,</v>

593
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.900
<v Speaker 1>those ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worth something and then those </v>

594
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.520
<v Speaker 1>ads are fucking up the whole show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to figure out how to bumper it,</v>

595
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 1>put them in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them on the end,</v>

596
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.390
<v Speaker 1>let the whole thing play out so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get drawn into it.</v>

597
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Just need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wait for the season to be over </v>

598
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:25.770
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Downloaded it all.</v>

599
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't have to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can download it as it's,</v>

600
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.680
<v Speaker 1>as it's airing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

601
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.970
<v Speaker 1>That's where we get it from itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

602
00:26:28.971 --> 00:26:30.920
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it comes out the day of,</v>

603
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I think the day after or something along</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

604
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I looked for at once when it</v>

605
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:40.841
<v Speaker 1>was only on the Dvr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I had to go with that </v>

606
00:26:40.841 --> 00:26:42.410
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that happened,</v>

607
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:47.411
<v Speaker 1>which isn't half as bad but still </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying as shit is the whole fucking </v>

608
00:26:47.411 --> 00:26:49.820
<v Speaker 1>advertisement right on the show.</v>

688
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.430
<v Speaker 1>But other than that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's on.</v>

689
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea.</v>

690
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Just changing channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he constantly changing channels,</v>

691
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.900
<v Speaker 1>watching some stupid piece of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>

692
00:30:06.901 --> 00:30:09.070
<v Speaker 1>handle watching that stupid piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit changed.</v>

693
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Very unsatisfying experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost every single thing you get stuck </v>

694
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.641
<v Speaker 1>on his hbo and Public Access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local public access or if I like a </v>

695
00:30:17.641 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Speaker 1>really good show comes on that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't expect or really good movie,</v>

696
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a nice thing because it's a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of 10.</v>

697
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like hunting and you get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction of winning the lottery.</v>

698
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.370
<v Speaker 1>But it's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

699
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:30.040
<v Speaker 1>gambling is a tough game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It usually leaves you unsatisfied.</v>

700
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

701
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:37.171
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you want to get movies from </v>

702
00:30:37.171 --> 00:30:39.571
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those movie things where you press </v>

703
00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:40.590
<v Speaker 1>menu and oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pays $17.</v>

704
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Ninety nine to watch some terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking moving.</v>

705
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what's really funny is when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>self,</v>

706
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:49.770
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to the movies now and you </v>

707
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:49.770
<v Speaker 1>see something really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

708
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you're reaching for the remote control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to see that again.</v>

709
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

710
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you're a you have </v>

711
00:30:59.010 --> 00:30:59.010
<v Speaker 1>access to shit like we have on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

712
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.060
<v Speaker 1>we're getting super spoiled to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of immediacy,</v>

713
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.330
<v Speaker 1>just being able to get things whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want it and being able to like if </v>

714
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you want to watch an ad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch an ad.</v>

715
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:11.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like when I go to a youtube page and </v>

716
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:11.340
<v Speaker 1>it starts playing an ad and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

717
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 1>skip this ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

718
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:15.760
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it's something I'm interested in,</v>

719
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch a little bit if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I'm interested in but I </v>

720
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:21.260
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have to.</v>

721
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.110
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome that they know that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get away with showing them a </v>

722
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 1>minute add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes they're really long.</v>

723
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes like four or five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can skip them though,</v>

724
00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:27.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

725
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.540
<v Speaker 1>They sometimes they're like little shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

726
00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:32.770
<v Speaker 1>you're forced to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen some interesting ones.</v>

727
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some cool ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some luxury extended trailers and some </v>

728
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:38.130
<v Speaker 1>interesting ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've really upped their game.</v>

729
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.620
<v Speaker 1>When you consider like in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like folgers coffee.</v>

730
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy this drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you rarely see though if you watch</v>

731
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:50.491
<v Speaker 1>a youtube video is you rarely see </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials in the beginning and then </v>

732
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:53.851
<v Speaker 1>they pause in the middle and then have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more commercials and then they pause </v>

733
00:31:53.851 --> 00:31:53.851
<v Speaker 1>again and again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that.</v>

734
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.840
<v Speaker 1>You get to see the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

735
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Probably the vast majority of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're downloading from youtube,</v>

736
00:31:59.231 --> 00:32:01.060
<v Speaker 1>it's probably short clips for most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

737
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but there's some pretty long shit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there too.</v>

738
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch TV on.</v>

739
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Watch our podcasts on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All three hours of them.</v>

740
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some,</v>

741
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 1>there's some long shit that's on there </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

742
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 1>so I don't buy the idea that like it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be done that way,</v>

743
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.360
<v Speaker 1>that it has to be every 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that's </v>

744
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:18.360
<v Speaker 1>going to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

745
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.960
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna cripple the business that </v>

746
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.420
<v Speaker 1>people are going to get annoyed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that this is what the experience is</v>

747
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:24.700
<v Speaker 1>limited to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once people start putting money</v>

748
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:29.701
<v Speaker 1>into like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hulu plus doing original </v>

749
00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:29.701
<v Speaker 1>programming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>original programming,</v>

750
00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix,</v>

751
00:32:30.401 --> 00:32:31.850
<v Speaker 1>doing house of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

752
00:32:31.851 --> 00:32:36.851
<v Speaker 1>what was the other show they were doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A black is the orange is the new black </v>

753
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 1>is a good one and that is the prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison prison show.</v>

754
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:46.070
<v Speaker 1>So when guys like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they started doing new shows and </v>

755
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:50.201
<v Speaker 1>creating their own content and putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it online and making it available </v>

756
00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:50.201
<v Speaker 1>through devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

757
00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get my netflix through my DVD player,</v>

758
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:56.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get your netflix through </v>

759
00:32:56.981 --> 00:32:56.981
<v Speaker 1>appletv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can lose a lot of different ways.</v>

760
00:32:56.981 --> 00:32:57.860
<v Speaker 1>You get it and you get it instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

761
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.040
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to be real hard to </v>

762
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:03.040
<v Speaker 1>compete with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make me watch commercials,</v>

763
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like I would rather pay seven </v>

764
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 1>bucks a month and not watch commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's seven bucks.</v>

765
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.250
<v Speaker 1>That's not that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

766
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.730
<v Speaker 1>How much is apple TV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you download the show is $600</v>

767
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.610
<v Speaker 1>for the whole season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:21.730
<v Speaker 1>hours and hours and hours and hours of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment and you don't watch a </v>

769
00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 1>single commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking take totally worth it.</v>

770
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.720
<v Speaker 1>It's worth more than that probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really stopped and thought about </v>

771
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.111
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's probably worth like 100 bucks </v>

772
00:33:32.111 --> 00:33:32.210
<v Speaker 1>to watch a full season of a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

773
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.710
<v Speaker 1>You take a decent amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay hundreds for like 20 years ago.</v>

774
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To have that kind of access to a TV </v>

775
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.901
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think they're going to do that with </v>

776
00:33:43.901 --> 00:33:43.901
<v Speaker 1>movies ever will.</v>

777
00:33:43.901 --> 00:33:47.050
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have the option where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could download it to your home and </v>

778
00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay 50 bucks.</v>

779
00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the movies and you're going</v>

780
00:33:48.921 --> 00:33:49.790
<v Speaker 1>into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

781
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.180
<v Speaker 1>like an Imax and you're gonna see some </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking new,</v>

782
00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saifai thriller or some new fill in the </v>

783
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.831
<v Speaker 1>blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is you're going to probably </v>

784
00:34:02.831 --> 00:34:03.170
<v Speaker 1>spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is it?</v>

<v Speaker 1>nowadays?</v>

786
00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

787

<v Speaker 1>at least avatar.</v>

788
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.560
<v Speaker 1>The 10 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 bucks.</v>

789
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the 20 [inaudible].</v>

790
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend we're in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

791
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 1>You to see Avatar and you got to pay 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks a ticket.</v>

792
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Would you pay 50 to watch it at home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably want some people.</v>

793
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Definitely was somebody who is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

794
00:34:21.081 --> 00:34:26.081
<v Speaker 1>so maybe he's already doing that now at </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater movies on itunes or movies that </v>

795
00:34:26.081 --> 00:34:30.101
<v Speaker 1>actually came out in theaters in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're giving you the option to watch </v>

796
00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really know these movies good.</v>

797
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Or they usually independent movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually like the independent or smaller,</v>

798
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 1>smaller budget ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's been a few,</v>

799
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually I've been pretty big size </v>

800
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:41.960
<v Speaker 1>but then then again there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool about going to the movie.</v>

801
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I really like going to the movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>lately.</v>

802
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I find that's one of the only things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can get me out of my head lately.</v>

803
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Liquor don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more pot.</v>

804
00:34:49.721 --> 00:34:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that occur?</v>

805
00:34:50.981 --> 00:34:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Don't work on the full job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

806
00:34:52.211 --> 00:34:52.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

807
00:34:52.691 --> 00:34:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm immune to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

808
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been to a movie in over a </v>

809
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.550
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You build up a tolerance.</v>

810
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Movies are great because you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to check your phone.</v>

811
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people still do it.</v>

812
00:35:03.911 --> 00:35:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I follow the rules and I'm in there.</v>

813
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

814
00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get out of my head and it's all </v>

815
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:12.660
<v Speaker 2>full up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the movies.</v>

816
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.150
<v Speaker 1>The ladies behind us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to see the desolation of smog.</v>

817
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't stop talking to each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the movie</v>

818
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.010
<v Speaker 2>in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

819
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't loud enough where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>really say anything.</v>

820
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kills you.</v>

821
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.100
<v Speaker 2>It kills you because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I say something?</v>

822
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:31.080
<v Speaker 2>And then if you say something you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

823
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:32.880
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

824
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.880
<v Speaker 1>wasn't loud enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is it shouldn't be God </v>

825
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 1>damn talking to the entire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they kept it throughout</v>

826
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.960
<v Speaker 5>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you'd be an asset.</v>

827
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 5>It was like at the level where you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 5>an asshole if you brought it up.</v>

828
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.290
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

829
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.280
<v Speaker 5>it's awful because the movie's so loud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how can you even hear?</v>

830
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 5>But you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fucking can.</v>

831
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:53.241
<v Speaker 5>You know it's there and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes away from the experience a </v>

832
00:35:53.241 --> 00:35:53.241
<v Speaker 5>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not.</v>

833
00:35:53.241 --> 00:35:57.441
<v Speaker 5>It's wrapped up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a level of purgatory that's worse </v>

834
00:35:57.441 --> 00:35:58.350
<v Speaker 5>than hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smog is good though,</v>

873
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.370

<v Speaker 6>down.</v>

874
00:37:32.371 --> 00:37:35.160
<v Speaker 6>Do you think you deserve any of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>royalties from that movie being made?</v>

875
00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:36.000
<v Speaker 6>Coming up for Jordan?</v>

876
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.700
<v Speaker 7>I get inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wrote my book called a meditation from</v>

877
00:37:42.371 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 7>the Jordan and Jordan asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

878
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.410
<v Speaker 7>I'd write everyday and what are you </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing?</v>

879
00:37:47.411 --> 00:37:50.080
<v Speaker 7>I told him so he said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did he,</v>

880
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:55.090
<v Speaker 7>he's so used to reading his book and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they wrote a few pages and he showed me </v>

881
00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:59.750
<v Speaker 7>and then I kind of insulted him because </v>
<v Speaker 7>I told him you haven't written anything </v>

882
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.750
<v Speaker 7>and he got really mad because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>genius.</v>

883
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:07.250
<v Speaker 7>So he ended up rewriting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I told them how to do it right from the </v>

884
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.730
<v Speaker 7>heart rate of but what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

885
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.220
<v Speaker 7>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's got a best seller movie.</v>

886
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.900
<v Speaker 7>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You should get a crazy.</v>

887
00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.550
<v Speaker 7>I just seeing him do good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Actually,</v>

888
00:38:18.551 --> 00:38:22.300
<v Speaker 7>my biggest thrill is watching him make </v>
<v Speaker 7>money,</v>

889
00:38:22.301 --> 00:38:24.700
<v Speaker 7>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because he was such a genius,</v>

890
00:38:24.701 --> 00:38:26.190
<v Speaker 7>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

891
00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.970
<v Speaker 7>he was like all thieves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

892
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.080
<v Speaker 7>they had twisted.</v>

893
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.080
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's much different than the headline </v>

894
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.770
<v Speaker 5>is different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just going to say that that's </v>

895
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:37.660
<v Speaker 5>really irresponsible headline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what got us to listen.</v>

896
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 5>If it was like Tommy Chong salutes a so </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so for the success.</v>

897
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all he said is that he helped the guy.</v>

898
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:47.060
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

899
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:52.140
<v Speaker 5>now I didn't know that the guy who wrote</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a guy who was selling to Tommy </v>

900
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 5>Chong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know he was in jail.</v>

901
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.500
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wild.</v>

902
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

903
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:57.700
<v Speaker 5>Is that supposed to be good wolf of Wall</v>
<v Speaker 5>Street?</v>

904
00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:02.870
<v Speaker 5>It looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Looks Pretty dynamic that Leonardo </v>

905
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 5>Dicaprio flies under the radar with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of people,</v>

906
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:05.830
<v Speaker 5>but he might be the baddest mother </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucker of them all.</v>

907
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.860
<v Speaker 5>I think he's fantastic and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Miss Garcia Square says he put us </v>

908
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:10.860
<v Speaker 5>something every Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is great dude.</v>

909
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.890
<v Speaker 5>That quintin Tarantino movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Django moving when he makes the turn</v>

910
00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 5>from being a good guy to bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

911
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.940
<v Speaker 5>I think he's great.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Did he really say that?</v>

915
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:33.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it sounds like something they </v>
<v Speaker 5>would say they suspended.</v>

916
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:38.911
<v Speaker 5>The dude pulled them off and for that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like the headlines are way worse </v>

917
00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 5>than the quotes on these things.</v>

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 1>not like an Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1036
00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:52.761
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe outside of Austin I'd like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a ranch where have a trusted </v>

1037
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:58.161
<v Speaker 1>assistant guards the perimeter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps a wolf dog by my side.</v>

1038
00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.590
<v Speaker 1>You got to get guns and you got to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>

1039
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A thing that they discovered in Bolivia.</v>

1040
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Brion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull this up.</v>

1041
00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:09.921
<v Speaker 1>It's on my twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred foot wall in Bolivia has </v>

1042
00:45:09.921 --> 00:45:09.921
<v Speaker 1>over 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur footprints.</v>

1043
00:45:09.921 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1044
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:13.880
<v Speaker 1>The earth has moved so much since then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is like,</v>

1045
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:17.280
<v Speaker 1>it's now like a straight wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a flat cliff.</v>

1046
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1047
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.160
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth's topography changes and this </v>

1048
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:30.290
<v Speaker 1>where these things are walking at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time it was probably like a </v>

1049
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.290
<v Speaker 1>creek bed or something like that.</v>

1050
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.440
<v Speaker 1>But now now it's vertical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That muddy water or that muddy ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were walking on,</v>

1052
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found a shit of a shitload of them,</v>

1053
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.610
<v Speaker 1>but it says the title of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1054
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:48.030
<v Speaker 1>feed is a twisted sifter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted sifter.</v>

1055
00:45:48.031 --> 00:45:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's an archeologist website or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1056
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:55.750
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to look for this 300 foot wall in</v>

1057
00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia has over 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur footprints.</v>

1058
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:08.500
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that it's a wall now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at one point in time they were </v>

1059
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 1>walking on it and then the earth fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>radically shifted.</v>

1060
00:46:09.781 --> 00:46:14.781
<v Speaker 1>So much so that it's like a wall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these muddy footprints are up the side </v>

1061
00:46:14.781 --> 00:46:16.470
<v Speaker 1>of the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1062
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 1>So I wish someone was here that knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was going on.</v>

1063
00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 1>So they explained this to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1064
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.550
<v Speaker 1>because I'm just assuming it tends to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1065
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you guys know a lot about </v>

1066
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.450
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they really those bright colors?</v>

1067
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as much as anybody.</v>

1068
00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 1>No Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1069
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:33.360
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaur Gel speculative.</v>

1070
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.600
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some recent speculation that </v>

1071
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.931
<v Speaker 1>because of the way t rex was built that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he might not have been a Predator at </v>

1072
00:46:41.931 --> 00:46:45.651
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he might've been a scavenger and </v>

1073
00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:45.651
<v Speaker 1>that he might've been very vulture like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1074
00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:49.731
<v Speaker 1>Instead of looking at this green </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer that we see in Jurassic Park </v>

1075
00:46:49.731 --> 00:46:50.670
<v Speaker 1>that he would have like these really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bright red skin.</v>

1076
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I called out to see if you could find </v>
<v Speaker 1>those images brion,</v>

1077
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:57.570
<v Speaker 1>pull up a t rex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulture scavenger,</v>

1078
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.600
<v Speaker 1>t rex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's interesting because you </v>

1079
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:02.600
<v Speaker 1>realize when you see something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1080
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just guessing type in bad rap to</v>

1081
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Brian just understood dinosaur Tbx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulture x's.</v>

1082
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.360
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1083
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:16.630
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1084
00:47:16.631 --> 00:47:19.630
<v Speaker 1>You can find there's some right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1085
00:47:19.631 --> 00:47:20.890
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go down to other,</v>

1086
00:47:20.891 --> 00:47:22.270
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one here,</v>

1087
00:47:22.271 --> 00:47:25.390
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1088
00:47:25.391 --> 00:47:30.391
<v Speaker 1>they drew him with a very bright red </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and a black skin behind it,</v>

1089
00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 1>much like our door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

1090
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

1091
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:39.451
<v Speaker 1>one of the speculations was that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't able to run fast enough because </v>

1092
00:47:39.451 --> 00:47:43.331
<v Speaker 1>of the way he's built that it really </v>
<v Speaker 1>just wood lumber onto dead things and </v>

1093
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:46.381
<v Speaker 1>fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also some evidence that </v>

1094
00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:48.391
<v Speaker 1>something's got away from him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty interesting when you </v>

1095
00:47:48.391 --> 00:47:50.410
<v Speaker 1>consider how fucking big they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did anything ever get away from that</v>

1096
00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:55.730
<v Speaker 1>with that mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was bite marks on things that </v>

1097
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:58.381
<v Speaker 1>actually had had survived for x amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years or x amount of months or </v>

1098
00:47:58.381 --> 00:48:00.340
<v Speaker 1>whatever after been attacked by one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking things.</v>

1099
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.300
<v Speaker 1>You think we got a lot of big animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>still that aren't that fast.</v>

1100
00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:05.860
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker,</v>

1101
00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:12.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about the time of the </v>

1102
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.711
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs is also that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere was different than the </v>

1103
00:48:13.711 --> 00:48:14.590
<v Speaker 1>atmospheric pressure was different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of oxygen,</v>

1104
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 1>the air was different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperature was different,</v>

1105
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.840
<v Speaker 1>and if it was a really super oxygen rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaseous environment like I think has </v>

1106
00:48:22.141 --> 00:48:27.141
<v Speaker 1>been speculated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been easier for a big thing </v>

1107
00:48:27.141 --> 00:48:29.011
<v Speaker 1>like that to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might've made sense why there </v>

1108
00:48:29.011 --> 00:48:32.321
<v Speaker 1>are so many big dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs were fucking dwarfing </v>

1109
00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 1>elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were huge.</v>

1110
00:48:34.331 --> 00:48:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1111
00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:37.750
<v Speaker 1>If you look at like Brontosaurus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 1>look at all those really giant plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating dinosaurs.</v>

1113
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:45.550
<v Speaker 1>They were fucking enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the Natural Museum of history</v>

1114
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:50.610
<v Speaker 1>in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all those bones of the </v>

1115
00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you stand next to one of those </v>

1116
00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go,</v>

1117
00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

1118
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.380
<v Speaker 1>you really get it in your head like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1119
00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Why did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it that big?</v>

1120
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Why did it grow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was everything.</v>

1121
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you look around and everything's</v>

1122
00:49:03.001 --> 00:49:04.680
<v Speaker 1>small horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that vague,</v>

1123
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1124
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:07.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's little ass dudes are running </v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>

1125
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Giraffe is like a baby compared to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur.</v>

1126
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the biggest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got crazy long neck asked a</v>

1127
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:20.270
<v Speaker 4>you're received.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if a t rex it looked like if it was </v>

1128
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.270
<v Speaker 4>furry because I always thought what if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had for.</v>

1129
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.630
<v Speaker 4>They look kind of like crows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like look at this.</v>

1130
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't even know if they were </v>

1131
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 1>offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1132
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

1133
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.520
<v Speaker 1>They know that a lot of dinosaurs did </v>
<v Speaker 1>have feathers.</v>

1134
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the direct descendants.</v>

1135
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:36.180
<v Speaker 4>What if a t rex to us it looks scary </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it'd be like taking a bird and </v>

1136
00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:36.640
<v Speaker 4>taking all its feathers off and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1137
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:38.620
<v Speaker 4>it looks scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks creepy as fuck.</v>

1138
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:40.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look scary,</v>

1139
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:46.890
<v Speaker 1>but it was cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a bird that has a head that </v>

1140
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:47.060
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably even scarier.</v>

1141
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:49.690
<v Speaker 1>A bird with teeth like that and a head </v>
<v Speaker 1>is big as a t rex,</v>

1142
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.520
<v Speaker 1>be fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evil.</v>

1143
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Just an eagle can fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1144
00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1145
00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you should google maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google terror birds t e R,</v>

1146
00:49:59.961 --> 00:50:04.961
<v Speaker 1>r o r birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were these gigantic six foot tall </v>

1147
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:07.130
<v Speaker 1>birds that they might've been even </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

1148
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.640
<v Speaker 1>They um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't fly.</v>

1149
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:14.360
<v Speaker 1>They just fuck people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just fucked things up.</v>

1150
00:50:14.361 --> 00:50:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two point five meters.</v>

1151
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were a six and a half feet tall or </v>

1152
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How tall?</v>

1153
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Two and one and a half is a meter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1154
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Three meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three telling me an American.</v>

1155
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>So they were a seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A half feet tall.</v>

1156
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Seven and a half feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says eight foot.</v>

1157
00:50:30.831 --> 00:50:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Two inches.</v>

1158
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you just say that?</v>

1159
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Why you making me do math meters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three is a meter.</v>

1160
00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Three feet or the yard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three feet.</v>

1161
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:44.110
<v Speaker 1>A yard is three feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's a meter is close to three to </v>

1162
00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:44.110
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exact.</v>

1163
00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

1164
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:50.020
<v Speaker 1>eight foot two inches tall and weighed </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately 330 pounds and it was a </v>

1165
00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:51.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking bird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's just the birds.</v>

1168
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Seven and a half feet tall and eats </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

1169
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:04.700

<v Speaker 1>face and it wasn't that long ago,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

1171

<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

1172
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did not become extinct until 15,000</v>

1174
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking terrifying.</v>

1175
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1176
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 1>The Romans could have had a fight that </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1177
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:30.551
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not true because there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's some controversy </v>

1178
00:51:30.551 --> 00:51:33.581
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it has been suggested that species </v>

1179

<v Speaker 1>did not become extinct till 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1180
00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:38.651
<v Speaker 1>but more precise dating by a Dr.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That seems like something out of Haiti's</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's walking forth amongst the earth </v>

1233
00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.190

<v Speaker 5>Is that still alive?</v>

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:23.680
<v Speaker 5>But that bird is just extra freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like he could fly with those </v>

1254
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 5>wings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can they fly?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Animal man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very large stork like bird derives its </v>

1258
00:55:38.121 --> 00:55:42.900
<v Speaker 5>name from the massive shoe shaped bill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although at some like somewhat stork,</v>

1259
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:44.370
<v Speaker 5>like overall form</v>

1260
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.900
<v Speaker 5>and has been previously classified,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

1261
00:55:49.901 --> 00:55:50.340
<v Speaker 5>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

1262
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:55.341
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The true affiliations with other living </v>

1263
00:55:55.341 --> 00:55:55.341
<v Speaker 5>birds are ambiguous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

1264
00:55:55.341 --> 00:55:57.360
<v Speaker 5>So it might not have any affiliation </v>
<v Speaker 5>with other living birds.</v>

1265
00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:02.390
<v Speaker 5>Some authorities now reclassify it with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Peli and formed the adult is mainly </v>

1266
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:09.831
<v Speaker 5>gray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While the juveniles are brown or lives </v>

1267
00:56:09.831 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 5>in tropical east Africa and large swamps</v>
<v Speaker 5>from Sudan to Zambia,</v>

1268
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:17.330
<v Speaker 5>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're amongst the trippiest fucking </v>

1269
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:17.330
<v Speaker 5>things that are alive on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 5>their trip like we're freaking out about</v>

1272
00:56:26.641 --> 00:56:29.490
<v Speaker 5>pissed at this bird because he did one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of those snakes and ranch.</v>

1273
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:35.880
<v Speaker 5>How big are these fucking things?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't say how tall they are.</v>

1274

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1277
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated by the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>used to be dinosaurs essentially.</v>

1278
00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen those gigantic eagles</v>
<v Speaker 5>that live in the forest of South America</v>

1279
00:56:52.271 --> 00:56:54.250
<v Speaker 5>and they eat monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monkeys.</v>

1283
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.430

1285
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:03.910
<v Speaker 5>To what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bird was a Pelican,</v>

1286
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 5>a Pelican and says like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey.</v>

1287
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>The other ducks are kind of cool with it</v>

1291
00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:18.530
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not that scary.</v>

1292
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:20.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what the fuck happened.</v>

1293
00:57:20.261 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>

1294
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.520
<v Speaker 5>They probably never thought there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to happen.</v>

1295
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Speaker 5>Someone's going to come along and </v>
<v Speaker 5>swallow them.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I think the biggest ego in the earth.</v>

1314
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:19.801
<v Speaker 5>than the Harpy Eagles.</v>
