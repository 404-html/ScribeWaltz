00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:03.991
<v Speaker 2>now what about,</v>

3
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:04.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 2>other kinds of therapy,</v>

5
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 2>like a cold therapy,</v>

6
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 2>ice bass,</v>

7
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 2>cryotherapy,</v>

8
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.800
<v Speaker 2>things on those events.</v>

9
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Prolotherapy,</v>

10
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.310
<v Speaker 2>stem cell,</v>

11
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 2>platelet injections.</v>

12
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.673
<v Speaker 2>If you could think of.</v>

13
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>

14
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.293
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even get in.</v>

15
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't want your cat and your readers to hear everything I've done because they</v>

16
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 2>would probably have me locked in.</v>

17
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Like what have you done that would have you locked up?</v>

18
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I've used our stint and strict nine injections.</v>

19
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.223
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

20
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Strychnine strychnine or arsenic and strychnine try.</v>

21
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Why would they inject you with poison?</v>

22
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Because it raises your red blood cell count.</v>

23
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.690
<v Speaker 2>I've used nitric cushion cream,</v>

24
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 2>natural glycerin cream because you know,</v>

25
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 2>in a stimulate blood flow and me and start your heart up and I use it because I</v>

26
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 2>broke my back and I didn't want to admit I broke my back a second time.</v>

27
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.561
<v Speaker 2>So I use it.</v>

28
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I told my friend who was a professor at Iowa state and says,</v>

29
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 2>don't go nowhere to see what his dust.</v>

30
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was raised to beat for three hours.</v>

31
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I felt like you were hitting me in the head every,</v>

32
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.321
<v Speaker 2>every heartbeat.</v>

33
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Just hit me in a temple and uh,</v>

34
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:00.871
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

35
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 2>but I've done it all.</v>

36
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing I haven't tried.</v>

37
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I did lectric statement was,</v>

38
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 2>it's called a microwave in linkedin up the muscles.</v>

39
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm Tom did it for what,</v>

40
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.244
<v Speaker 2>15 seconds?</v>

41
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I did it for 96 minutes.</v>

42
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 2>What does it do?</v>

43
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 2>It lengthens out the muscles.</v>

44
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Leary straighten out your leg right off the ground.</v>

45
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Electrocuting you and uh,</v>

46
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 2>for six minute segments.</v>

47
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And I did 96 minutes.</v>

48
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 2>So it's electrical muscular stimulation pads lengthens it.</v>

49
00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

50
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 2>and I should never done it because I think I've got too many injuries,</v>

51
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

52
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

53
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 2>it basically tore.</v>

54
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.491
<v Speaker 2>It popped my,</v>

55
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 2>my hips and my children's out of socket</v>

57
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.930
<v Speaker 2>pop my hip bone right here.</v>

58
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 2>My hipbone you're crazy.</v>

59
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Your whole body is like a walking medical encyclopedia,</v>

60
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.881
<v Speaker 2>you got to try it.</v>

62
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

63
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's me basically geeking out on the decks.</v>

64
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.493
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

66
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>and then Tony Trim,</v>

67
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>which is a Dj that travels with him was like,</v>

68
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:00.321
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>

69
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>you can just get this and you can just buy this stuff.</v>

70
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's what really got me to do it was girl one up,</v>

71
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>let's look at that white guy dance move.</v>

72
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.571
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that move.</v>

73
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>You're doing there.</v>

74
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>You're doing this.</v>

75
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

78
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.543
<v Speaker 1>Just listening to you.</v>

79
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>What really geeked me out.</v>

80
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 1>But the name Dj Dad math came because he was becoming a father at the time and I</v>

81
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:27.421
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

82
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>you're like way lane bro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Me a dad.</v>

84
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 1>And then it kind of morphed into Dj data are.</v>

85
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>But taking it onto morning news was</v>

86
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

87
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>That was so fun.</v>

88
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>And I was like all the time,</v>

91
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>did you have a plan or did you just not really.</v>

92
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.163
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

93
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>the fun thing was to go was because I,</v>

117
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.693

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

126
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>because it was fun to have fun and be like,</v>

127
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.863
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

131
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.323
<v Speaker 1>I mean for a minute,</v>

132
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't even really care about it.</v>

133
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.043
<v Speaker 1>The funny bone.</v>

134
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the funny bone sitting right there off camera.</v>

135
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.123
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

136
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

137
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Like the best part is when he sets up like the really cheesy anchors to ask him</v>

138
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>stupid questions.</v>

141
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.580

142
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>if you ever add sometimes when you go,</v>

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.160
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

150
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>they know not to.</v>

151
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

152
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.541
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

153
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>they check themselves on asking something provocative or that's not 100 percent</v>

154
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:03.814
<v Speaker 1>pg,</v>

155
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't know how it would go,</v>

156
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>but I go,</v>

157
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

158
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.091

160
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.423
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

161
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>and then so we just are in the middle of this interview</v>

162
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>and she goes,</v>

163
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.591
<v Speaker 1>White Bird,</v>

164
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>so fat.</v>

165
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>And I was asked a good question and I'm like,</v>

166
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I just rolled with it,</v>

167
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>and then it grew.</v>

169
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>And then a hot dog eating champion,</v>

170
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.430
<v Speaker 1>a guy that was in Scotland,</v>

171
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>she placed tinny place.</v>

172
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

173
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.534

174
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>he was like a super competitive eater,</v>

175
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>like a Kobiashi dude.</v>

176
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>This guy was assigned to the audio on this.</v>

177
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible</v>

178
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 3>life changing stuff.</v>

179
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

180
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I've dropped about 100 pounds in eight months.</v>

181
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 3>He dropped 100 pounds my cheat day for the year,</v>

182
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 3>but prepping just this amazing water which to giant inspirations first.</v>

183
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 3>My wife second anniversary today.</v>

184
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 3>So I want to say hi to her.</v>

185
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.823
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

186
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 3>there's a comedian I love,</v>

187
00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 3>he's a big,</v>

188
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 3>giant fat guy just like me,</v>

189
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.324
<v Speaker 3>Bert Chrysler,</v>

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.850
<v Speaker 4>he's still way bigger than I am.</v>

191
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I can inspire him.</v>

192
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about this woman,</v>

193
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 4>we didn't talk about too much,</v>

194
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:12.684
<v Speaker 4>but we should.</v>

195
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.720
<v Speaker 4>This woman who was the woman that Hillary Clinton brought up during the trump</v>

196
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:23.901
<v Speaker 4>debate because she was saying that Donald Trump humiliated this woman because he</v>

197
00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:28.050
<v Speaker 4>shamed her and humiliated her because she gained weight while she was a missile.</v>

198
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:28.884
<v Speaker 4>Olympia.</v>

199
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.421
<v Speaker 4>I miss this.</v>

200
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:32.100
<v Speaker 4>I was in the bathroom and you guys had this.</v>

201
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.810
<v Speaker 4>She got up to 170 pounds according to trump.</v>

202
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 4>She went up from like 1:22,</v>

203
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.111
<v Speaker 4>one slash 70.</v>

204
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:40.944
<v Speaker 4>According to him,</v>

205
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 4>probably not right.</v>

206
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 4>Probably gained like 30 pounds.</v>

207
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.990
<v Speaker 4>But apparently she really did gain a fuckload of way.</v>

208
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.273
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

209
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.610
<v Speaker 4>and Hillary Clinton made this big deal about like how awful it was.</v>

210
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 4>He did that to her and then they had these commercials already planned for the</v>

211
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 4>next day.</v>

212
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 4>So they launched these commercials the next day.</v>

213
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.440
<v Speaker 4>And in the commercials they show this woman,</v>

214
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 4>she's speaking in Spanish.</v>

215
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about Donald trump is terrible.</v>

216
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 4>What he do to me.</v>

217
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 4>He made me feel bad.</v>

218
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 4>He made me.</v>

219
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 4>He was scared.</v>

220
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 4>So then after that comes out,</v>

221
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 4>people start researching her,</v>

222
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 4>they find out that she drove a getaway car in a murder,</v>

223
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 4>that she threatened to judge because the judge who is going after her boyfriend</v>

224
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 4>at the time that she drove the getaway car,</v>

225
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 4>she threatened the judge,</v>

226
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 4>said that she was going to kill the judge.</v>

227
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 4>She had an elite,</v>

228
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 4>a illegitimate baby with a Mexican kingpin drug dealer.</v>

229
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.600
<v Speaker 4>All of the Mexican drug cartel kingpins came to the baby's Christening.</v>

230
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 4>Then she went on,</v>

231
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 4>big brother,</v>

232
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 4>big brother.</v>

233
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 4>She was engaged in some baseball player,</v>

234
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 4>went on big brother and fuck some other guy on the show while the cameras were</v>

235
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 4>on her and she was yelling out in Spanish that he has a magnificent coffee.</v>

236
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

237
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.250
<v Speaker 2>The same lady that I used in our commercial.</v>

238
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.820
<v Speaker 2>So then they have her on CNN.</v>

239
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.210
<v Speaker 2>My.</v>

240
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

241
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.280
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Cooper interviews on CNN and Anderson Cooper says some people are</v>

242
00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:12.030
<v Speaker 4>saying that you threatened to judge and that you drove a getaway car.</v>

243
00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

244
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.033
<v Speaker 4>is this yours?</v>

245
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Everybody having pass.</v>

246
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

247
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not angel.</v>

248
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a bad person.</v>

249
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.690
<v Speaker 2>But they're trying to take away from what he did.</v>

250
00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:22.830
<v Speaker 2>What he did was wrong.</v>

251
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

252
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.190
<v Speaker 2>What I did was 20 years ago,</v>

253
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 2>what he did was 20 years ago to all he did was coming,</v>

254
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 4>but in his defense she probably was.</v>

255
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.483
<v Speaker 4>She got fat,</v>

256
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 4>so there's pictures of her.</v>

257
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 4>She definitely got fat,</v>

258
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

259
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 4>ordinarily that's a very rude thing to do,</v>

260
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.990
<v Speaker 4>but when your job is to be a professional hot chick,</v>

261
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you just decide,</v>

262
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 4>say like if you're a model for like a shaving cream,</v>

263
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.931
<v Speaker 4>like have you like your,</v>

264
00:07:51.931 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 4>your whole thing is about your legs and you're showing your legs.</v>

265
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 4>I touched the mic,</v>

266
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.703
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

267
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 4>but your thing is about your sleek,</v>

268
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 4>smooth legs and you're like,</v>

269
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

270
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm letting these bitches grow.</v>

271
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.851
<v Speaker 4>And everyone's like,</v>

272
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:05.620
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

273
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 4>you can't do your job is to have sleek,</v>

274
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 4>smooth legs.</v>

275
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:09.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

276
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not that you're known for your nice flakes.</v>

277
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

278
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 4>She's known for being a professional,</v>

279
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 4>attractive woman.</v>

280
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Any holiday he shouldn't objectify women.</v>

281
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 4>That is the whole point of being Muslim.</v>

282
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 2>So Hillary paid her to obviously if she's in an anti trump commercial than that</v>

283
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:28.810
<v Speaker 2>means hillary paid her right.</v>

284
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

285
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.790
<v Speaker 2>might not be</v>

286
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:31.600
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

287
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.470
<v Speaker 4>It might just be attention because it gave her the opportunity to get back in</v>

288
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:38.070
<v Speaker 4>the limelight and apparently she's a giant attention whore.</v>

289
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>
