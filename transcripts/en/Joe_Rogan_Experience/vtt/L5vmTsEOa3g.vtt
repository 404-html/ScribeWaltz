1
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You're doing something right now with this whole,</v>

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>don't be a do nothing bitch thing.</v>

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

5
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware of like how big this movement in?</v>

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I probably tweeted about it the other day that I was out,</v>

7
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I forget where I was,</v>

8
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>but these two girls were arguing about the merits,</v>

9
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>pros and cons of being a do nothing bitch.</v>

10
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And it was completely,</v>

11
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>it was all after your fight and it was completely brought on by you.</v>

12
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Like some girls were like,</v>

13
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.214
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>

14
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>you know like I don't like to fucking work.</v>

15
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:31.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

17
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know what's wrong with being a do nothing bitch.</v>

18
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>And the other girl was like,</v>

19
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:35.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

20
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>she's fucking right.</v>

21
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>like too many girls are out there and do contribute nothing to society like you</v>

23
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

24
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>All you do is consume.</v>

25
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>If you are a do nothing bitch,</v>

26
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>all you do is spend somebody else's money and try to look pretty.</v>

27
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Like that's all you do is you use stuff up,</v>

28
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you use up resources and you give nothing.</v>

29
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And so you're a pretty much a drain on society.</v>

30
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think they,</v>

31
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>they don't think it that way.</v>

32
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>They think what they are is something that all of these men want to fuck low.</v>

33
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

34
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>in working really hard to attain this,</v>

35
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>this appearance and all these men want to fuck that.</v>

36
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.821
<v Speaker 1>what they are,</v>

38
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.051
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

39
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>they've created capital.</v>

40
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 1>They've created like a need for this brought up to think that it wasn't your</v>

41
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>mission in life to be happy.</v>

42
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>It was your mission in life to leave the world better than how you found it.</v>

43
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And by being a comeback at,</v>

44
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.064
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do that.</v>

45
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not your mission in life.</v>

46
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.753
<v Speaker 1>That I love that.</v>

47
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.643
<v Speaker 1>Like introducing</v>

48
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

49
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

50
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.851
<v Speaker 1>I invented that.</v>

51
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:35.971
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

52
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

53
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating thing to say that it's not your mission in life to be</v>

54
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:40.524
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

55
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.981
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

56
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>but what's the point in leaving the world better if no one's happy,</v>

57
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>if everybody follows that same principle,</v>

58
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>the world just keeps getting better and better and everybody's miserable as</v>

59
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:49.794
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

60
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't seem to make sense here.</v>

61
00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Your happiness is supposed to be a byproduct of actually living a fulfilling</v>

62
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:56.814
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

63
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:58.710
<v Speaker 1>instead of just trying to,</v>

65
00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>if I tried to get drunk and party every day and get as happy as I possibly could</v>

67
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:03.024
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>

68
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live at a really unfulfilling life and die unhappy.</v>

70
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>This isn't,</v>

71
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>this is not like a micro aggression.</v>

72
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>This is human curiosity had something that's abnormal.</v>

73
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing that it's abnormal.</v>

75
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not that there's a gender issue that you wish you were a woman,</v>

76
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.081
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

77
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>are you wish you were a man or you're born a woman.</v>

78
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing.</v>

79
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

80
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

81
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>There is a difference though.</v>

82
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 1>And I think that we,</v>

83
00:02:26.741 --> 00:02:31.741
<v Speaker 1>what we're experiencing now with the transgender movement and even to an extent,</v>

84
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:36.310
<v Speaker 1>the gay movement is the pendulum swinging all the way in one direction.</v>

85
00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

86
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a reaction to the fact that,</v>

87
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 1>and this is just a fact,</v>

88
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.030
<v Speaker 1>when you were a man or a woman and you felt overwhelmingly like you are a</v>

89
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 1>different sex and you took measures to correct your current sex or you just</v>

90
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>dressed up in a way that made you feel more yourself.</v>

91
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:55.060
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a man and you're dressed in drag or whatever,</v>

92
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>as a woman or for that matter,</v>

93
00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:01.730
<v Speaker 1>if you were gay and started having feelings when you include the,</v>

94
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>the problem was that in most of our history,</v>

95
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.510
<v Speaker 1>you got the fucking shit kicked out of you,</v>

96
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>killed your job,</v>

97
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>got ostracized and that anger and that,</v>

98
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>that injustice doesn't,</v>

99
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>doesn't go away.</v>

100
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>And so you have a lot of people that have that,</v>

101
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that memory is very fresh.</v>

102
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.630
<v Speaker 1>That wound is very real.</v>

103
00:03:23.631 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So let's have some fake pronouns the way that,</v>

104
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.531
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

105
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the way that is.</v>

106
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Then the,</v>

107
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

108
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>try to,</v>

110
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>control the majority of the population's behavior.</v>

112
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.830
<v Speaker 1>What about I don't hear z h I like that they have those z.</v>

113
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:41.734
<v Speaker 1>It's one of them.</v>

114
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.221
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

115
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I was in,</v>

116
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.031
<v Speaker 1>I listened.</v>

117
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I went to high school in Massachusetts.</v>

118
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I knew when I had to,</v>

119
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>when I had to say,</v>

120
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't say freshmen,</v>

121
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I had to say fresh person.</v>

122
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I dated a girl who graduated from Wellesley college with a degree in women's</v>

123
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.464
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

124
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>women's studies.</v>

125
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.643
<v Speaker 1>It's all about women.</v>

126
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

127
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.754
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

128
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.013
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful.</v>

129
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I should shave her legs.</v>

130
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>There was a white girl I suffered.</v>

131
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I dated a white girl and she didn't share her legs.</v>

132
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.893
<v Speaker 1>It's very European.</v>

134
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.481
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

135
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty hippie bro.</v>

136
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

137
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to do with European me.</v>

138
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.121
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

139
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>But her,</v>

140
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>her roommate was Greek.</v>

141
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I got in trouble.</v>

142
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

143
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Her feet looked like Bilbo Baggins women are hot though.</v>

144
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.231
<v Speaker 1>Hairy feet,</v>

145
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:20.471
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

146
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:20.741

148
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>This was the girl you were with?</v>

149
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

150
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.951
<v Speaker 1>The other girl,</v>

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

152
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.963
<v Speaker 1>her roommate.</v>

153
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>When you're a younger man,</v>

154
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:27.034
<v Speaker 1>you'll fuck a bear.</v>

155
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.873
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

156
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

157
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm a go.</v>

158
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>She was beautiful,</v>

159
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but she was blonde like,</v>

160
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

161
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>she's a pretty girl.</v>

162
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.923
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

163
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.021
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

164
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

165
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>the roommate there was a girl I dated who was liberal white girl.</v>

166
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

167
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>that's not real.</v>

168
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 1>There was this white girl and she majored in African studies in college.</v>

169
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>And I went and all I did was this.</v>

170
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

171
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.333
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

172
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Because I knew the answer was she was a liberal white girl and just wanted other</v>

173
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>black people.</v>

174
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.260
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>

175
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>you're my favorite white.</v>

176
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>You're my favorite white.</v>

177
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And you understand us and your town with our,</v>

178
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.404
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>

179
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I know it wasn't because she was interested in African studies and then I said,</v>

180
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>because I said,</v>

181
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.931
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

182
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

183
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.891
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

184
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:06.401
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

185
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>why did you choose to study African studies?</v>

186
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Not that there's anything wrong with it and not say what you come from,</v>

187
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>like European history.</v>

188
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Why would you care what she's telling you?</v>

189
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to know the answer.</v>

190
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.071
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>And what was her answer?</v>

192
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>She said her answer was,</v>

193
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I wish she wasn't even in the black guys.</v>

194
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.401
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

195
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

196
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I find that question offensive.</v>

197
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.603
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

198
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.211
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

199
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>that's what I thought you'd say.</v>

200
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>It was really man,</v>

201
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.911
<v Speaker 2>really funny.</v>

202
00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:34.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like you always see gangsters on TV,</v>

203
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.720
<v Speaker 2>but when you are confronted by true psychopaths,</v>

204
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.970
<v Speaker 2>it is unbelievable.</v>

205
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.841
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

206
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:42.111

<v Speaker 2>I can look it up.</v>

327
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 2>She's an hour in golf carts and my boy in this golf cart,</v>

328
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.730
<v Speaker 2>we drive out to about the 12th hole and we get to the 12th hole and there are</v>

329
00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:09.731
<v Speaker 2>these kind of 50 60 year old prostitutes topless with leopard skin print,</v>

330
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 2>mini skirts,</v>

331
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 2>handing out drinks.</v>

332
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 2>It was like the craziest day of my life.</v>

333
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 2>But this guy was like a true psycho criminal.</v>

334
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

335
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:21.730
<v Speaker 2>just one of those guys like a scene from Goodfellas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It just kill it.</v>

337
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:22.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

338
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I always loved movies where somebody threatened someone and they go,</v>

339
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to kill me by,</v>

340
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 2>because I know you're not the kind of guy.</v>

341
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

342
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.331
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

343
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:30.164
<v Speaker 2>They will kill you.</v>

344
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.093
<v Speaker 2>They will kill you.</v>

345
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>And they've just really made me laugh.</v>

346
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Is that guy still alive?</v>

347
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

349
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.020

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.943
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

351
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:37.550

<v Speaker 2>this is a while ago.</v>

353
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 2>He's probably dead by now because he was an old guy then.</v>

354
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

355
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.290

356
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to make it.</v>

357
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>

358
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.511
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you his name.</v>

359
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.460
