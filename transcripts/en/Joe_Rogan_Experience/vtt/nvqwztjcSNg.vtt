148
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:02.471
<v Speaker 2>about the Internet,</v>

150
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:02.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 2>designing for the Internet.</v>

152
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 2>And I took the first class of the first year,</v>

153
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 2>it was like so stupid.</v>

154
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 2>They had no idea.</v>

155
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 2>The teachers didn't know how to do anything.</v>

156
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:10.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

157
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:10.961
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

158
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:11.210
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

159
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 2>we just learned about this to this internet stuff.</v>

160
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Teachers who've been teaching for 20 years possibly teach you about the</v>

161
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>

162
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 2>They pretty much just like,</v>

163
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:18.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

164
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 2>there's this thing called flash.</v>

165
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

166
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.040
<v Speaker 2>it's from Macromedia and uh,</v>

167
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 2>it's on version one.</v>

168
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 2>We should probably look into that.</v>

169
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 2>And so you must be able to really appreciate something like Squarespace.</v>

170
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they make it so easy,</v>

171
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 2>everything's easy now.</v>

172
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I wish,</v>

173
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I wish I enjoy it because I actually hate doing websites now.</v>

174
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just because like for other people it's the worst thing ever to do because</v>

175
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 2>like you'll design this whole website and they're like,</v>

176
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.271
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

177
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:43.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the purple.</v>

179
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 2>And then so that means you have to like change every single little table and</v>

180
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

181
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 2>So the cool thing about like Squarespace is that you could just put a template,</v>

182
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.811
<v Speaker 2>like if you just have you,</v>

183
00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 2>if you want a website that's just like,</v>

184
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:55.391
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

185
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

186
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 2>a store that I want to advertise,</v>

188
00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 2>a small company,</v>

189
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>you could just pretty much get a template,</v>

190
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 2>put it all the information down so you'll at least have some presence on the</v>

191
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:04.481
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

192
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:05.314
<v Speaker 2>So it makes it easy.</v>

193
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Here's one of the cool things about Squarespace.</v>

194
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:08.391
<v Speaker 1>If you go there,</v>

195
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.224
<v Speaker 1>you sign up.</v>

196
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to enter in a credit card.</v>

197
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.500
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is just try it out,</v>

198
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.030
<v Speaker 1>start building a website.</v>

199
00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:14.930
<v Speaker 1>And then if you decide,</v>

200
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:15.171
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

201
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:15.741
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>

202
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:16.790
<v Speaker 1>this could be my website,</v>

203
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

204
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.960
<v Speaker 1>this is a good product.</v>

205
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Then you decided to purchase Squarespace,</v>

206
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.223

<v Speaker 1>excellent.</v>

232
00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:58.320
<v Speaker 1>If you are looking to design your own website and it's satisfying to do so,</v>

233
00:05:58.321 --> 00:05:58.831
<v Speaker 1>go check it out.</v>

234
00:05:58.831 --> 00:06:02.820
<v Speaker 1>You Dirty Fox were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,</v>

235
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:03.510
<v Speaker 1>n n,</v>

236
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.081
<v Speaker 1>I t.</v>

237
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And if you use the code name of Rogan,</v>

238
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you will save 10% off any of the supplements.</v>

239
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

240
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.460
<v Speaker 1>people who have heard this podcast before.</v>

241
00:06:11.461 --> 00:06:12.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what on it is?</v>

242
00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:13.110
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

243
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.950
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially a company that sells all things that make your body better,</v>

244
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>whether it's uh,</v>

245
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.230
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>

246
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.820
<v Speaker 1>We sell a hemp force,</v>

247
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>which is a incredibly nutritious protein powder.</v>

248
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>It made out of hemp with Maca and cocoa in it and Dan Carlin's on the podcast.</v>

249
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So we can go into the history of why this hemp is illegal to grow in America,</v>

250
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but yet legal to purchase.</v>

251
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.130
<v Speaker 1>It's non psychoactive.</v>

252
00:06:35.131 --> 00:06:35.851
<v Speaker 1>If you have questions,</v>

253
00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:38.970
<v Speaker 1>it won't make you a test positive on a drug test.</v>

254
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:39.781
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

255
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:41.010
<v Speaker 1>it's just the plant material.</v>

256
00:06:41.011 --> 00:06:41.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

257
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

258
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.950
<v Speaker 1>no drug but excellent for your body.</v>

259
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Super Easy to digest.</v>

260
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>It also has raw cocoa and Maca in it.</v>

261
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.881
<v Speaker 1>And A,</v>

262
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:50.640
<v Speaker 1>we sell a lot of cool shit like that on it.</v>

263
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.900
<v Speaker 1>We sell coconut oil,</v>

264
00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:53.790

265
00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:56.280
<v Speaker 1>we sell buffalo jerky bars.</v>

266
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.290
<v Speaker 1>It's all Himalayan sea salt.</v>

267
00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's really supposed to be good for you.</v>

268
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

269
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.883
<v Speaker 1>It sounds bad ass.</v>

270
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like killer be hunting again.</v>

271
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Probably not that much better than regular honey,</v>

272
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>but sounds bad ass.</v>

273
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.023
<v Speaker 1>So we have it.</v>

274
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.800
<v Speaker 1>we also have things for kids.</v>

276
00:07:10.801 --> 00:07:11.634
<v Speaker 1>We have um,</v>

277
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.390

<v Speaker 1>You filet of fish without that white stuff.</v>

287
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:32.790
<v Speaker 1>That tartar sauce is just dog shit.</v>

288
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just not good at all.</v>

303
00:07:55.771 --> 00:07:56.880
<v Speaker 1>We're going to learn some shit.</v>

304
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.960
<v Speaker 1>We're going to find out what the fuck really happened and how we move forward.</v>

305
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.210
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

306
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] we went old school with the music folks because</v>

307
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin's here of hardcore history in DC.</v>

308
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:13.881
<v Speaker 1>Common Sense.</v>

309
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>You have two podcasts.</v>

310
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

311
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.311
<v Speaker 1>And I'm telling you,</v>

312
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:16.491
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

313
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>this is a very few people that have been requested as many times as you buy the</v>

314
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>

315
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I owe you for having me here.</v>

316
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.021
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>

317
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>We had much crossover on the audience apparently quite a bit because people</v>

318
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:27.761
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

319
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 1>my message board or super pumped about this,</v>

320
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 1>people online is super pumped about this.</v>

321
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I think now more than ever in this country there's a uh,</v>

322
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>learning a yearning rather to understand how the,</v>

323
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 1>how we got here.</v>

324
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:42.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

325
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the financial crisis and you look at our ridiculous actions</v>

326
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:47.520
<v Speaker 1>overseas and you looked at it like,</v>

327
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:47.841
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

328
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

329
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of kids that are growing up right now that are in their twenties</v>

330
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 1>and thirties and they,</v>

331
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.900
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

332
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 1>they look at this mess that we're in as a society,</v>

333
00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:58.501
<v Speaker 1>as a culture,</v>

334
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:58.681
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

335
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>as a race really is that the whole human race and how the hell did this all</v>

336
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:02.604
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

337
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

338
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more of an interest in history today than at any time.</v>

339
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I remember like young people being like really interested in history and uh,</v>

340
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger.</v>

341
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like there's like a more of a clamoring for this knowledge now than</v>

342
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I've ever heard before.</v>

343
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 4>Hi helps when the history channel's doing monster quest and ice road truckers</v>

344
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.970
<v Speaker 4>kind of leaves a vacuum for some of us to sort of just shoot through to drive</v>

345
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 4>you crazy when you watching the history channel or it's,</v>

346
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it does.</v>

347
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Part of me starts to think that yeah,</v>

348
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.301
<v Speaker 4>it opens up.</v>

349
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

350
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:36.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

351
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 4>we were doing some work a while back with some of these production companies in</v>

352
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 4>La and New York and stuff that had to,</v>

353
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:41.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

354
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:41.870
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

355
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 4>we'll get this guy from the history podcast and we'll develop a show around him.</v>

356
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 4>And I'm in these meetings with these guys and it's like every question just</v>

357
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:48.661
<v Speaker 4>kept,</v>

358
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:49.141
<v Speaker 4>can we,</v>

359
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 4>can we make this a little more broad?</v>

360
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.104
<v Speaker 4>Can we make this?</v>

361
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:52.771
<v Speaker 4>And eventually,</v>

362
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:52.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

363
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have Dan Carlin searching for monsters is what they were looking</v>

364
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 4>for I think after,</v>

365
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 4>so we're sticking with the podcast.</v>

366
00:09:58.741 --> 00:09:58.951
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

367
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they think there's an audience for history and yet I think that</v>

368
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 4>gives us an audience for history.</v>

369
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 4>There's no place else for those people to go.</v>

370
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 4>They're stuck with me.</v>

371
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.271
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

372
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.350
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of interesting what people think that people</v>

373
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I want to and don't want to see because there's obviously the Internet where you</v>

374
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:14.750
<v Speaker 1>know your podcast is very popular.</v>

375
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:18.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of very popular podcasts where it's just people talking and you're</v>

376
00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:22.550
<v Speaker 1>getting hundreds of thousands of people to download these things with just</v>

377
00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:26.510
<v Speaker 1>people talking and you look at the amount of people that are tuning into your</v>

378
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:30.050
<v Speaker 1>average television show on a cable network and it's pretty commensurate.</v>

379
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that shocking?</v>

380
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:31.731
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

381
00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much that we're all doing so good.</v>

382
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:36.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the television is really doing so bad.</v>

383
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:36.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

384
00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:39.440
<v Speaker 1>in trying to paint that broad thing,</v>

385
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.860
<v Speaker 1>they've lost any semblance of being exceptional.</v>

386
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.671
<v Speaker 1>There's just nothing.</v>

387
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to,</v>

388
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a great way to put it.</v>

389
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:45.591
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

390
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm loving this fungus free coffee that we blend.</v>

391
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Speaker 1>We blended up with a grass fed butter.</v>

392
00:10:51.981 --> 00:10:53.600
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to find that grass fed butter.</v>

393
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I've actually started ordering it online.</v>

394
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I would miss the fungus,</v>

395
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:58.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'm finding I'm getting everything I want.</v>

396
00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.293
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

397
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.240
<v Speaker 1>The fungus has just given you a headache apparently according to there's a guy</v>

398
00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:03.140
<v Speaker 1>named Dave Asprey.</v>

399
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:05.060
<v Speaker 1>He runs bulletproof exec.com.</v>

400
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:05.901
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

401
00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:09.920
<v Speaker 1>he wrote the bulletproof executive and his idea about bulletproof not being</v>

402
00:11:09.921 --> 00:11:10.640
<v Speaker 1>actual bulletproof,</v>

403
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.391
<v Speaker 1>just being that,</v>

404
00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:11.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:13.790
<v Speaker 1>it's rock solid nutrition,</v>

406
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:14.810
<v Speaker 1>rock solid,</v>

407
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

408
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.400
<v Speaker 1>management of your body,</v>

409
00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:16.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:17.211
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>

411
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he found out was,</v>

412
00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:19.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

413
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.181
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

414
00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:20.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

415
00:11:20.421 --> 00:11:23.260
<v Speaker 1>the mycotoxin and coffee issue that so many people weren't aware of.</v>

416
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.350
<v Speaker 1>You're going to work and you just,</v>

417
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:24.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:27.050
<v Speaker 1>drinking that coffee from the coffee machine,</v>

419
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.100
<v Speaker 1>the coffee maker that,</v>

420
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

421
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.001
<v Speaker 1>Bob May,</v>

422
00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:29.421
<v Speaker 1>hey Bob,</v>

423
00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:31.010
<v Speaker 1>when's the Howells his coffee 20 minutes ago.</v>

424
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.160
<v Speaker 1>No one's really thinking about what the fuck is in that actual coffee.</v>

425
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.430
<v Speaker 1>But apparently there's quite a bit of coffee that has fungus on it and unhealthy</v>

426
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>mold and that's shit can apparently be very poisoned.</v>

427
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.071
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

428
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:44.360
<v Speaker 1>our industry functions on this.</v>

429
00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:44.901
<v Speaker 1>So without this,</v>

430
00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:45.890
<v Speaker 1>we're just dead in the water.</v>

431
00:11:45.891 --> 00:11:46.171
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

432
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.510
<v Speaker 1>but I mean comedy writing,</v>

433
00:11:47.511 --> 00:11:51.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many different people that create things.</v>

434
00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:52.094
<v Speaker 1>He was coughing,</v>

435
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>he was doing a show on like the history</v>

436
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.990
<v Speaker 5>of stimulants or whatever,</v>

437
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 5>and it was going to be like a nine part series because there's so much,</v>

438
00:11:58.931 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean that like you said,</v>

439
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 5>the whole creative side of so many industries without the coffee and other</v>

440
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:03.750
<v Speaker 5>stimulants,</v>

441
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

442
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 5>where do you go Saturday night live is not around,</v>

443
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:06.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

444
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 5>without exists or something like that.</v>

445
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.200
<v Speaker 5>Along those lines we'd,</v>

446
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

447
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.330
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

448
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.920
<v Speaker 5>it's funny when you think about the fact that the Boston tea parties is</v>

449
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:15.341
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>

450
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 5>is that really what started people off drinking coffee in this country when</v>

451
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

452
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

453
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:22.330
<v Speaker 5>I think that's one of those kind of myths sort of things.</v>

454
00:12:22.331 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 5>I think first of all,</v>

455
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 5>if you're addicted to tea,</v>

456
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.681
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>

457
00:12:24.681 --> 00:12:26.100
<v Speaker 5>you're going to just switch because you know,</v>

458
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.970
<v Speaker 5>somebody put a little tax on it.</v>

459
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:29.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean we can see how that works.</v>

460
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:30.304
<v Speaker 5>A little tax on something,</v>

461
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.810
<v Speaker 5>you just find a way around it.</v>

462
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 5>But how hard was it to get tea back then?</v>

463
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.181
<v Speaker 5>Was it,</v>

464
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:34.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

465
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:34.841
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

466
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 5>it was a hell of a commodity,</v>

467
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think it was that hard to get it.</v>

468
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:38.501
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

469
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:39.131
<v Speaker 5>smugglers,</v>

470
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 5>how hard is it to get something you're not supposed to have today?</v>

471
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.980
<v Speaker 5>So Ti was like a big commodity.</v>

472
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 5>Go to a big t dealer and behind the scenes,</v>

473
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:45.971
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

474
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 5>and just have some guy,</v>

475
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:47.111
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

476
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 5>they can get the t on the side smuggled in from French Canada or something.</v>

477
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:51.611
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that bizarre?</v>

478
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 5>When you hear about like salt used to be worth a lot of money still is in the</v>

479
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:55.900
<v Speaker 5>right places.</v>

480
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.000
<v Speaker 5>You take away the salt and you watch the price go up,</v>

481
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.510
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

482
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:58.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

483
00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

484
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 5>But I mean the idea that people would go to war for it.</v>

485
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 5>Like could you imagine we're headed to Africa right now to go get salt?</v>

486
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Like that was a,</v>

487
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.090
<v Speaker 5>that was the reality at one point.</v>

488
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 5>I read a whole thing about how Afghanistan might be all about lithium deposits</v>

489
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:13.180
<v Speaker 5>and stuff and you're going,</v>

490
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.421
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

491
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:15.730
<v Speaker 5>50 years ago nobody wanted lithium for anything.</v>

492
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean now it's just one of those things where it,</v>

493
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:17.621
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

494
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Speaker 5>we've got to get ahold of Afghanistan and those lithium things will dry right up</v>

495
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.011
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan.</v>

496
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:22.650
<v Speaker 5>So rich with other things as well.</v>

497
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 5>Natural gas,</v>

498
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.680
<v Speaker 5>not just the minerals natural Tyler or ways to mind though.</v>

499
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 5>It's like mining out in a patchy country.</v>

500
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.040
<v Speaker 5>There's inherent risks.</v>

501
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:30.551
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>

502
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 5>that's a lot of folks who don't understand,</v>

503
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:33.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

504
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan like tougher conversations with people about it.</v>

505
00:13:36.251 --> 00:13:40.570
<v Speaker 5>You can't really compare it to any other country because it's not really a</v>

506
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:41.404
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

507
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.410
<v Speaker 5>It's like a series of warlords and they control various areas and it's through</v>

508
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 5>the whole country and there's only like a little bit of city life.</v>

509
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.711
<v Speaker 5>There's like,</v>

510
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:51.544
<v Speaker 5>what are is?</v>

511
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 5>What's Kabul?</v>

512
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 5>Is that the big setting?</v>

513
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 5>Kandahar,</v>

514
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.121
<v Speaker 5>places like that.</v>

515
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 5>But they are all these are all tribal PDX and so it's like I'm Indian country.</v>

516
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's no other way to describe it.</v>

517
00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 5>You get in there and you can't make,</v>

518
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 5>there's no one to make deals with the two controls Logan and you have to deal</v>

519
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 5>with this chief and all of a sudden you don't have to deal with the other</v>

520
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.111
<v Speaker 5>teacher.</v>

521
00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 5>He have to like the first guy and 10 miles away,</v>

522
00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:12.220
<v Speaker 5>you're out of your district and they're all playing a little game.</v>

523
00:14:12.221 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 5>Hammad Karzai's winking to us in one hand and tell him the domestic audience</v>

524
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:19.360
<v Speaker 5>something on the other hand and it's like double blind rear end,</v>

525
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:19.571
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

526
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean we just don't play those games as well as the people in Afghanistan.</v>

527
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:22.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

528
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 5>well that's a strange culture.</v>

529
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.661
<v Speaker 5>I remember,</v>

530
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:25.901
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

531
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 5>when McCain was running for president and Obama was talking about going into</v>

532
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.101
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan,</v>

533
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:32.770
<v Speaker 5>it was one of the few times that I really,</v>

534
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

535
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 5>I really respected and Mccain for the way he did it,</v>

536
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 5>he would say like,</v>

537
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 5>do you understand Afghanistan?</v>

538
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't even being condescending.</v>

539
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:41.741
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

540
00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:43.800
<v Speaker 5>this is like run by this.</v>

541
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.870
<v Speaker 5>It's basically where the same way it was when Alexander the Great was a lot.</v>

542
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.950
<v Speaker 5>And look at the terrain.</v>

543
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:48.784
<v Speaker 5>If you're a military guy,</v>

544
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 5>just look,</v>

545
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.370
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

546
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

547
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:50.531
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

548
00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 5>it's like Sonora over</v>

549
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

550
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.611
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

551
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:52.821
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

552
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:53.511
<v Speaker 4>but worse.</v>

553
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:54.051
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

554
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 4>it's one thing to decide.</v>

555
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:58.250
<v Speaker 4>You want to fight a war in some flat desert place where all of our air power is</v>

556
00:14:58.251 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 4>gonna make a huge difference.</v>

557
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.730
<v Speaker 4>The terrain is like beyond the Martian,</v>

558
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>

559
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 4>crazy terrain.</v>

560
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 4>And so you look around and you just go,</v>

561
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:05.181
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

562
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 4>the Russians in the 1970s and eighties,</v>

563
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 4>they might not have had the infrared stuff like we do,</v>

564
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 4>but they were pretty Dang sophisticated and willing to kill a hell of a lot more</v>

565
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 4>people and they couldn't manage it.</v>

566
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:19.211
<v Speaker 4>So it's really scary now that they've turned in so many parts of the world to</v>

567
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 4>drones for these difficult missions.</v>

568
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.111
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

569
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:24.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

570
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.861
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

571
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 4>the implications of using drones on people,</v>

572
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:28.761
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>

573
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 4>it's a very strange</v>

574
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:35.670
<v Speaker 1>sort of a conversation to start having because it's step one on a multistep</v>

575
00:15:35.891 --> 00:15:39.160
<v Speaker 1>process where eventually these drones are going to be intelligent things that</v>

576
00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 1>are controlling themselves and they're going to be searching out crime and,</v>

577
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.840
<v Speaker 1>and shooting people from the mountains.</v>

578
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you stop that though.</v>

579
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like saying I don't want to have tanks because look where tanks are</v>

580
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:48.921
<v Speaker 4>going to go.</v>

581
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:49.711
<v Speaker 4>The problem is,</v>

582
00:15:49.711 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 4>is that we treat them differently than life people.</v>

583
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 4>It's like if,</v>

584
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:53.781
<v Speaker 4>if you said to yourself,</v>

585
00:15:53.781 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 4>well if he wouldn't go in there with a human pilot and bomb the place,</v>

586
00:15:57.051 --> 00:16:00.890
<v Speaker 4>cause it'll look like Nixon bombing Cambodia when you shouldn't then don't do it</v>

587
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:01.500
<v Speaker 4>with drones.</v>

588
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

589
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.000
<v Speaker 4>But if you're going to use him for occasion and if we're at war with somebody,</v>

590
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 4>you're going to want the drones.</v>

591
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.180
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to use everybody.</v>

592
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:07.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

593
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 4>but you're not going to want it if you say,</v>

594
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 4>well we couldn't bomb Yemen's a tribal territories with a,</v>

595
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 4>with a bomber and a human being,</v>

596
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:14.331
<v Speaker 4>that would look bad.</v>

597
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 4>But we can do it with a machine cause well there's no Americans there.</v>

598
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

599
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>

600
00:16:18.781 --> 00:16:22.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it becomes a strange sort of a conversation to have and it's</v>

601
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.400
<v Speaker 1>going on in Pakistan,</v>

602
00:16:23.401 --> 00:16:24.810
<v Speaker 1>but we're not really at war with</v>

603
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:25.331
<v Speaker 4>no worries.</v>

604
00:16:25.331 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 4>You're going to start using them in Africa now.</v>

605
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.531
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

606
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 4>They're flying them in African now.</v>

607
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Speaker 4>They were going to use them on dormer.</v>

608
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.970
<v Speaker 4>They were gonna.</v>

609
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.960
<v Speaker 4>They were gonna use,</v>

610
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 4>he was going to be the first target of a,</v>

611
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:37.490
<v Speaker 4>of a drone and on American soil.</v>

612
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Speaker 4>That killer that is still to be w did they,</v>

613
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:42.800
<v Speaker 4>did they confirm that,</v>

614
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 4>that they were going to use a drone to go after that guy believe so.</v>

615
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.591
<v Speaker 4>I should,</v>

616
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:46.350
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't.</v>

617
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely wild if they really are.</v>

618
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.311
<v Speaker 4>How do you spell his name?</v>

619
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 4>Dormer DOR.</v>

620
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Mer.</v>

621
00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.350
<v Speaker 4>Was that going to be a decision and what level do they make that decision?</v>

622
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

623
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:55.251
<v Speaker 4>is that the,</v>

624
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:58.610
<v Speaker 4>the La Sheriff's office decides that or you got to call the president?</v>

625
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine the White House would let that happen even if the sheriff's</v>

626
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:03.771
<v Speaker 4>department wanted to,</v>

627
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:06.350
<v Speaker 4>because then all of a sudden you have to answer all those questions.</v>

628
00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:09.740
<v Speaker 4>They're not answering now about is it okay to kill Americans with a drone on</v>

629
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:10.521
<v Speaker 4>American soil?</v>

630
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 4>Well then all of a sudden that becomes a moot point,</v>

631
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:13.424
<v Speaker 4>doesn't it?</v>

632
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:14.801
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

634
00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:14.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

635
00:17:14.891 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 1>this is on Gizmodo,</v>

636
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

637
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.600
<v Speaker 1>ex cop Christopher dormer now at target for drones to Riverside Police,</v>

638
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

639
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 1>chief Sergio Diaz,</v>

640
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>joint leader of the Task Force,</v>

641
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

642
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 1>signed with finding dormer has confirmed and is quoted as saying,</v>

643
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 1>we're using all the tools at our disposal and a third vague conference.</v>

644
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean he's using drones.</v>

645
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.051
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

646
00:17:35.051 --> 00:17:35.884
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

647
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.930
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what that makes me feel like,</v>

648
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:38.770
<v Speaker 4>and this is perverse,</v>

649
00:17:38.771 --> 00:17:40.450
<v Speaker 4>I have a little bit of a perverse sense of humor,</v>

650
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.700
<v Speaker 4>but if the guy was going to die anyway like he did,</v>

651
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.970
<v Speaker 4>I almost wished that they'd done it with the drones at the local level so that</v>

652
00:17:45.971 --> 00:17:48.970
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing explodes into a national conversation.</v>

653
00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:49.771
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it would,</v>

654
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:50.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

655
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I think people don't know except that he was,</v>

656
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.890
<v Speaker 1>he was obviously an evil Doraemon.</v>

657
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.860
<v Speaker 4>So what is the Burger?</v>

658
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.370
<v Speaker 4>The position it puts Obama and all of a sudden this whole thing,</v>

659
00:17:58.371 --> 00:18:01.490
<v Speaker 4>you're ducking now you can't duck it anymore and you're not using it against</v>

660
00:18:01.491 --> 00:18:02.210
<v Speaker 4>terrorists.</v>

661
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

662
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.370
<v Speaker 4>it depends on your definition of a terrorist,</v>

663
00:18:04.371 --> 00:18:05.061
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

664
00:18:05.061 --> 00:18:05.301
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

665
00:18:05.301 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 4>any old murderer fleeing the scene of a murder now is open to,</v>

666
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:09.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

667
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:09.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

668
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:10.251
<v Speaker 4>no judge,</v>

669
00:18:10.251 --> 00:18:11.084
<v Speaker 4>no jury,</v>

670
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.500
<v Speaker 4>no due process.</v>

671
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

672
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.001
<v Speaker 4>we knew you killed him.</v>

673
00:18:14.001 --> 00:18:14.870
<v Speaker 4>So I mean that's a,</v>

674
00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.520
<v Speaker 4>that that's going to happen to you.</v>

675
00:18:16.521 --> 00:18:16.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

676
00:18:16.671 --> 00:18:18.190
<v Speaker 4>we're going to hit that fine line at some point.</v>

677
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:18.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

678
00:18:18.441 --> 00:18:22.070
<v Speaker 1>they've already started assassinating American citizens that are in other</v>

679
00:18:22.071 --> 00:18:24.170
<v Speaker 1>countries that they believe in doing things illegal.</v>

680
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.730
<v Speaker 1>The government won't confirm it,</v>

681
00:18:25.731 --> 00:18:26.211
<v Speaker 1>but everybody,</v>

682
00:18:26.211 --> 00:18:27.044
<v Speaker 1>it's an open secret.</v>

683
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.273
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

684
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:33.430
<v Speaker 1>it gets real tricky when someone does denies the rights of,</v>

685
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.800
<v Speaker 1>of citizens than someone who's empowered.</v>

686
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Denies their rights because w what are you then,</v>

687
00:18:38.901 --> 00:18:40.970
<v Speaker 1>if you're in power and you're denying their rights,</v>

688
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.810
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you step in and deny people do processed,</v>

689
00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:46.760
<v Speaker 1>deny people lawyers to die people,</v>

690
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.440
<v Speaker 1>why would you ever want to do that?</v>

691
00:18:48.441 --> 00:18:49.221
<v Speaker 1>It's a real question.</v>

692
00:18:49.221 --> 00:18:51.440
<v Speaker 1>So when things get passed,</v>

693
00:18:51.441 --> 00:18:56.060
<v Speaker 1>like the National Defense Authorization Act allows the government to</v>

694
00:18:56.061 --> 00:18:59.600
<v Speaker 1>indefinitely detained American civilians and they don't have to do anything.</v>

695
00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:01.340
<v Speaker 1>They're not required to notify your family.</v>

696
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.590
<v Speaker 1>They're not required to arrest you.</v>

697
00:19:03.591 --> 00:19:04.790
<v Speaker 1>They're not required to.</v>

698
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

699
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:05.920
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

700
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to get a lawyer.</v>

701
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.130
<v Speaker 1>They can just lock you up when you see shit like that.</v>

702
00:19:10.131 --> 00:19:10.964
<v Speaker 1>Does that drive you crazy?</v>

703
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:11.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

704
00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:12.410
<v Speaker 4>And people always say to me,</v>

705
00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:12.681
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>

706
00:19:12.681 --> 00:19:13.280
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

707
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:13.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

708
00:19:13.461 --> 00:19:15.320
<v Speaker 4>why are you defending the terrorists?</v>

709
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.350
<v Speaker 4>What you try to explain to people is without the due process,</v>

710
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.510
<v Speaker 4>there's no confirmation that this is a terrorist.</v>

711
00:19:20.511 --> 00:19:25.280
<v Speaker 4>The only way you know it's a terrorist is when some court somewhere determines</v>

712
00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:28.040
<v Speaker 4>upon looking at the evidence that this person is a terrorist.</v>

713
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Once you can kill somebody on the suspicion of being a terrorist,</v>

714
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.671
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

715
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:35.030
<v Speaker 4>we're all under suspicion of being a terrorist under certain conditions that</v>

716
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.790
<v Speaker 4>someone wants to deem a mistaken identity situation.</v>

717
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

718
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.760
<v Speaker 4>or mean how many guys are named Omar or Mohammad or you know,</v>

719
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

720
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

721
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.190
<v Speaker 1>how about in this dorm or case the,</v>

722
00:19:45.191 --> 00:19:47.590
<v Speaker 1>the cop shot up two different cars that were the wrong color.</v>

723
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

724
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.131
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

725
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

726
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.690
<v Speaker 1>You the,</v>

727
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.700
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the government should have special powers that regular human</v>

728
00:19:56.501 --> 00:19:57.334
<v Speaker 1>beings don't.</v>

729
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.300
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

730
00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:58.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

731
00:19:58.481 --> 00:19:59.350
<v Speaker 1>they have that now.</v>

732
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think they already do because your government to take it to the next</v>

733
00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:06.110
<v Speaker 1>level and decide that you're going to deny the rights of people that you feel</v>

734
00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:06.551
<v Speaker 1>are guilty.</v>

735
00:20:06.551 --> 00:20:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

736
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.840
<v Speaker 1>who are you and how do I know that you're infallible and how do I know that this</v>

737
00:20:10.841 --> 00:20:11.710
<v Speaker 1>isn't corruption?</v>

738
00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.870
<v Speaker 1>How do I know this isn't a personal grudge?</v>

739
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're dealing with an organization that has a spotless record</v>

740
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.691
<v Speaker 1>over the past,</v>

741
00:20:19.691 --> 00:20:19.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:20:19.961 --> 00:20:24.760
<v Speaker 1>200 years where they're the most ethical human beings to ever exist and people</v>

743
00:20:24.761 --> 00:20:26.040
<v Speaker 1>from other countries come to them for,</v>

744
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.231
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

745
00:20:26.231 --> 00:20:27.310
<v Speaker 1>we've caught them a lie,</v>

746
00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.130
<v Speaker 1>but $1 million.</v>

747
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.221
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

748
00:20:28.221 --> 00:20:28.650
<v Speaker 4>you had could.</v>

749
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.690
<v Speaker 4>We had a committee hearings,</v>

750
00:20:29.691 --> 00:20:31.490
<v Speaker 4>which you cannot even imagine today,</v>

751
00:20:31.491 --> 00:20:32.960
<v Speaker 4>which shows you how much things have changed.</v>

752
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.140
<v Speaker 4>In the 1970s we had the church committee hearings in the Pike Committee hearings</v>

753
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.180
<v Speaker 4>where the government actually on television exposed everything the CIA had been</v>

754
00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:42.920
<v Speaker 4>doing since the end of the Second World War.</v>

755
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.110
<v Speaker 4>The assassinations and all this kind of stuff.</v>

756
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.420
<v Speaker 4>The crown jewels are what the used to call those secrets that were exposed on</v>

757
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 4>television by congressional and senatorial committees.</v>

758
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.400
<v Speaker 4>It just shows you what happens when there's no oversight and if stuff is too</v>

759
00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 4>secret to have oversight over,</v>

760
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 4>you're asking for trouble.</v>

761
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:05.731
<v Speaker 4>There's too many ways human beings can justify going beyond the rules and</v>

762
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 4>there's always a good reason and you hear it today.</v>

763
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:09.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean the waterboarding thing,</v>

764
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 4>as a perfect example,</v>

765
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:15.330
<v Speaker 4>we prosecuted people at Nuremberg for having an attitude that we have now,</v>

766
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:16.120
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

767
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.451
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

768
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:19.780
<v Speaker 4>if they're terrorists and you can save lives by torturing people.</v>

769
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.780
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that an ethical dilemma where it's worth torturing some guy,</v>

770
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:23.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

771
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Speaker 4>is bad anyway in order to save lives.</v>

772
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:25.961
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

773
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:29.410
<v Speaker 4>if you could have prevented the two towers from falling down by waterboarding,</v>

774
00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 4>a couple of bad guys,</v>

775
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 4>isn't that worth it?</v>

776
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.530
<v Speaker 4>And that those ethical dilemmas lead you off into the weeds really quickly in</v>

777
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 4>history shows that over and over again.</v>

778
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:37.980
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

779
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 6>it's very doubtful that it's helping either.</v>

780
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 6>It's very doubtful that you're really getting that kind of key information from</v>

781
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 6>people by throwing water down their mouth.</v>

782
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.561
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

783
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:47.880
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

784
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.251
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

785
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:48.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

786
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if if torturing people get them to tell the truth</v>

787
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.720
<v Speaker 4>gets him to tell you anything you want.</v>

788
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.400
<v Speaker 4>What about would you,</v>

789
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.060
<v Speaker 4>and I wish I could quote it at length.</v>

790
00:21:57.061 --> 00:21:59.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a wonderful line going back hundreds of years where somebody says,</v>

791
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 4>would you abrogate the laws in order to get the devil?</v>

792
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:04.060
<v Speaker 4>And the other guy says,</v>

793
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:04.481
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

794
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:05.080
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

795
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.630
<v Speaker 4>I would stick to the laws because if,</v>

796
00:22:06.631 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Speaker 4>if you abrogate the laws to get to the devil,</v>

797
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 4>you take away the only thing that protects yourself eventually.</v>

798
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 4>And that's what this is.</v>

799
00:22:13.421 --> 00:22:13.811
<v Speaker 4>People say,</v>

800
00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:13.961
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

801
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:15.760
<v Speaker 4>it's okay to go after this to get to terrorists.</v>

802
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.540
<v Speaker 4>What makes you think one that it'll stay with terrorists and to that what a</v>

803
00:22:19.541 --> 00:22:20.680
<v Speaker 4>terrorists is,</v>

804
00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:22.120
<v Speaker 4>that definition won't change.</v>

805
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.360
<v Speaker 4>The Bush administration was calling these people that would light,</v>

806
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:25.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

807
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:28.700
<v Speaker 4>car dealerships on fire in the middle of the night when there was no one there.</v>

808
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Ecoterrorists you're going to drone those people,</v>

809
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:31.710
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

810
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:32.970
<v Speaker 6>What are you going to do exactly?</v>

811
00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:36.090
<v Speaker 6>Where does the line get drawn and who gets to decide anti fungal coffee</v>

812
00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:38.270
<v Speaker 6>proponents that might get a little hyped up,</v>

813
00:22:38.271 --> 00:22:40.530
<v Speaker 6>but those motherfuckers grown those people.</v>

814
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.011
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

815
00:22:41.011 --> 00:22:41.844
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>

816
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.090
<v Speaker 6>It's a strange time because the amount of uh,</v>

817
00:22:46.091 --> 00:22:47.700
<v Speaker 6>ability to the,</v>

818
00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:52.620
<v Speaker 6>to spy on people and to extract information from your email and your cell phone</v>

819
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:53.160
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

820
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.850
<v Speaker 6>they know your,</v>

821
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.860
<v Speaker 6>your di gps at any point in time,</v>

822
00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.900
<v Speaker 6>but yet we're still just human beings and human beings have to be protected from</v>

823
00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:01.681
<v Speaker 6>their own instincts.</v>

824
00:23:01.681 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 6>We have to set up a system of government that has fail.</v>

825
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:11.250
<v Speaker 6>Proof stops where you can't get past certain levels through,</v>

826
00:23:11.251 --> 00:23:11.790
<v Speaker 6>can't,</v>

827
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.470
<v Speaker 6>you can't do certain things.</v>

828
00:23:13.471 --> 00:23:14.910
<v Speaker 6>You can't act with impunity.</v>

829
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:15.930
<v Speaker 6>He can't be a king.</v>

830
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

831
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.000
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

832
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.200
<v Speaker 6>there has to be a due process.</v>

833
00:23:19.201 --> 00:23:21.420
<v Speaker 6>There has to be representation.</v>

834
00:23:21.421 --> 00:23:22.710
<v Speaker 6>You have to be able to get a lawyer.</v>

835
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.130
<v Speaker 6>You have to have some,</v>

836
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:24.721
<v Speaker 6>you have to,</v>

837
00:23:24.721 --> 00:23:26.580
<v Speaker 6>as an American citizen be able to state your case.</v>

838
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:26.881
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

839
00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:28.140
<v Speaker 4>here's the fly in the ointment though,</v>

840
00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:28.471
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

841
00:23:28.471 --> 00:23:31.410
<v Speaker 4>this is almost like the founding fathers tragic flaw in the system.</v>

842
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.480
<v Speaker 4>In war time,</v>

843
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.460
<v Speaker 4>the rules are thrown out the window,</v>

844
00:23:35.461 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

845
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.480
<v Speaker 4>In wartime,</v>

846
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.130
<v Speaker 4>the government is allowed to give the,</v>

847
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

848
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.250
<v Speaker 4>the congress is supposed to decide when you go to war.</v>

849
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.900
<v Speaker 4>Then once the war's going on,</v>

850
00:23:42.901 --> 00:23:43.734
<v Speaker 4>the president has,</v>

851
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:44.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

852
00:23:44.071 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 4>they say extreme constitutional authority as commander in chief to,</v>

853
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 4>to run the war anyway they want.</v>

854
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 4>But this is all predicated on the idea that the war has an end,</v>

855
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:53.181
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

856
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 4>This is a temporary suspension of normality.</v>

857
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.790
<v Speaker 4>What do you do in a war?</v>

858
00:23:57.791 --> 00:23:58.551
<v Speaker 4>Like in a war?</v>

859
00:23:58.551 --> 00:23:59.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm using air quotes.</v>

860
00:23:59.551 --> 00:24:01.700
<v Speaker 4>So what do you do in a war that has no end?</v>

861
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to sign a peace treaty with us on some battleship to end this war on</v>

862
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 4>terror?</v>

863
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.850
<v Speaker 4>This is like saying you don't remember the Bush administration for Awhile was</v>

864
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:08.870
<v Speaker 4>toying with the idea.</v>

865
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 4>They thought the war on terror had gotten sort of a bad name.</v>

866
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 4>So they were going to do a little marketing move and change the name and for</v>

867
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:18.080
<v Speaker 4>like five minutes they were calling it the war on violent extremism,</v>

868
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.080
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was a great line because that really showed how ridiculous it</v>

869
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:21.710
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

870
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Speaker 4>When's violent extremism over who's going to sign the the end of the war treaty</v>

871
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 4>and surrender to us and the violent extremism or so we can return to a normal</v>

872
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:33.590
<v Speaker 4>American system with checks and balances and where the president didn't have,</v>

873
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:33.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

874
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:34.880
<v Speaker 4>extreme authority.</v>

875
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem is that we're in a situation where it's war time and it's</v>

876
00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:44.330
<v Speaker 4>going to be war time forever unless somebody declares it over and if they</v>

877
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:45.170
<v Speaker 4>declared it over,</v>

878
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.220
<v Speaker 4>what stops the next guy after one bombing in some part of the world to start it</v>

879
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 4>up again?</v>

880
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:50.151
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

881
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 4>Essentially we've been at war in some functions since the 1940s but</v>

882
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 4>realistically when,</v>

883
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

884
00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.110
<v Speaker 4>we were in the 90s at least we didn't feel like we were at war.</v>

885
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 4>We didn't feel like it until 2001 they didn't invoke the extreme authority</v>

886
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:04.731
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

887
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:04.921
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

888
00:25:04.921 --> 00:25:05.080
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

889
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

890
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 4>they didn't do that in Vietnam.</v>

891
00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:07.011
<v Speaker 4>Even they didn't,</v>

892
00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:08.120
<v Speaker 4>the government didn't say,</v>

893
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:08.781
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

894
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:08.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

895
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 4>we're going to lock up every one of Vietnamese descent in a,</v>

896
00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 4>in a cage for awhile in case they're spies.</v>

897
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.361
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

898
00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

899
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.750
<v Speaker 4>like when Truman did the Korean War thing and he got around having to declare</v>

900
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:19.010
<v Speaker 4>war by saying it's not a war,</v>

901
00:25:19.011 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 4>it's a police action.</v>

902
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 4>That was a marketing tool.</v>

903
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 4>But by doing that,</v>

904
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:27.620
<v Speaker 4>he also essentially swore he didn't officially because kind of swore off that</v>

905
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.830
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to have extreme constitutional authority.</v>

906
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 4>He didn't take that up.</v>

907
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.610
<v Speaker 4>It's when Bush did this war on terror thing and basically the neo-con folks</v>

908
00:25:35.611 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

909
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.831
<v Speaker 4>remember John,</v>

910
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 4>you the advisor to the president,</v>

911
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:41.570
<v Speaker 4>the office of Legal Counsel said that if the president wanted to,</v>

912
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 4>he could torture a son to get the father to talk.</v>

913
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.980
<v Speaker 4>There are no limits in war time.</v>

914
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 4>No one had really invoked that since the Second World War.</v>

915
00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 4>So if you want to have total power,</v>

916
00:25:52.641 --> 00:25:53.510
<v Speaker 4>just start war,</v>

917
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:54.651
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

918
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 4>that's an age old thing.</v>

919
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:57.920
<v Speaker 4>You can go back to the Romans and the Greeks and they were all in.</v>

920
00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 4>They understood that dynamic real well.</v>

921
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 4>And so did the founding fathers of our country who were classically trained.</v>

922
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

923
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.800
<v Speaker 4>the reason we're not a democracy in one respect is that they were fully aware of</v>

924
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.010
<v Speaker 4>how that could go and they were fully aware of what happened to Rome.</v>

925
00:26:10.011 --> 00:26:12.440
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the checks and balances in our constitution,</v>

926
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.370
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that stuff is to design,</v>

927
00:26:14.371 --> 00:26:16.610
<v Speaker 4>to keep the same thing from happening to us.</v>

928
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.300
<v Speaker 4>I think they understood that those things break down over time though.</v>

929
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 4>And that in essentially you might have a lifespan to what they were creating.</v>

930
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:25.371
<v Speaker 4>And that sense,</v>

931
00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:26.480
<v Speaker 4>it's very fascinating,</v>

932
00:26:26.481 --> 00:26:28.600
<v Speaker 4>the idea of a representative democracy and the,</v>

933
00:26:28.601 --> 00:26:31.640
<v Speaker 4>the idea that there's an electoral college and the idea that there's,</v>

934
00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 4>there's a few steps beyond actual democracy.</v>

935
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:36.381
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

936
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of,</v>

937
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.180
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of,</v>

938
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.013
<v Speaker 4>you get a vote,</v>

939
00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.180
<v Speaker 4>but you get to vote for a representative.</v>

940
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to completely vote like</v>

941
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.761
<v Speaker 6>one person,</v>

942
00:26:44.761 --> 00:26:45.594
<v Speaker 6>one vote.</v>

943
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

944
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

945
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 6>the idea behind it initially was sorta to protect people from their own</v>

946
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:50.941
<v Speaker 6>silliness,</v>

947
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

948
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:51.781
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

949
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 4>they didn't,</v>

950
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 4>the founding fathers didn't necessarily like the idea of average people running</v>

951
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 4>the show.</v>

952
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 4>If you looked at the state laws,</v>

953
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 4>most states wouldn't let average joes vote.</v>

954
00:27:00.631 --> 00:27:00.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

955
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:04.140
<v Speaker 4>if you were working for a tinker in Virginia,</v>

956
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:05.520
<v Speaker 4>you probably weren't allowed to vote.</v>

957
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 4>You used to have to be a landowner and most of these states,</v>

958
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:10.920
<v Speaker 4>and what that was designed to do was to limit the vote to stakeholders,</v>

959
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.491
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

960
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 4>They figured if you could run a farm without going out of business,</v>

961
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 4>you probably knew enough about what was going on to be an educated voter.</v>

962
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.830
<v Speaker 4>Plus they didn't like the idea.</v>

963
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

964
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.271
<v Speaker 4>you'll probably know this,</v>

965
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:23.670
<v Speaker 4>that after the revolution wasn't that long afterwards,</v>

966
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 4>we had things like the whiskey rebellion and the Shay's rebellion.</v>

967
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.110
<v Speaker 4>These are new revolutions and their revolutions coming from the lower classes</v>

968
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 4>and our brand new,</v>

969
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:32.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

970
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:36.150
<v Speaker 4>radical founding fathers shut those things down like nobody's business.</v>

971
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.261
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

972
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:37.670
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

973
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 4>it's weird</v>

974
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.760
<v Speaker 6>when you think like that.</v>

975
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.750
<v Speaker 6>You think that the founding fathers didn't necessarily want everybody to vote</v>

976
00:27:43.751 --> 00:27:44.051
<v Speaker 6>and be like,</v>

977
00:27:44.051 --> 00:27:44.371
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

978
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:44.831
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>

979
00:27:44.831 --> 00:27:45.664
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

980
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.300
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

981
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.010
<v Speaker 6>but the romantic version of it is that they were these beautiful people that had</v>

982
00:27:51.011 --> 00:27:54.790
<v Speaker 6>this idea of treating people the way they deserve to be treated in govern with</v>

983
00:27:54.791 --> 00:27:56.310
<v Speaker 6>respect and honesty and</v>

984
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.061
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

985
00:27:57.061 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 4>but also look at the times.</v>

986
00:27:58.381 --> 00:27:58.591
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

987
00:27:58.591 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

988
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you realize that when they had the revolution,</v>

989
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 4>we became the first major country in the world that had anything like that.</v>

990
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.080
<v Speaker 4>Then you start to realize,</v>

991
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:07.411
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

992
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:12.150
<v Speaker 4>we're looking back at our standards now and not realizing how radical those guys</v>

993
00:28:12.151 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 4>were for their day.</v>

994
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:15.990
<v Speaker 4>And it's worth pointing out that only a few years after our revolution,</v>

995
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.430
<v Speaker 4>the French had theirs,</v>

996
00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 4>which got wickedly out of hand very quickly.</v>

997
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.310
<v Speaker 4>And our founding fathers were looking at what happened in France and the French</v>

998
00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:24.960
<v Speaker 4>were saying that a lot of what they were doing was,</v>

999
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:25.951
<v Speaker 4>was was as,</v>

1000
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:26.460
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

1001
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.000
<v Speaker 4>sort of a respecting kind of thing from what you know,</v>

1002
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 4>reflection of ours.</v>

1003
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 4>And they were going,</v>

1004
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.980
<v Speaker 4>don't blame that on us.</v>

1005
00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 4>We never would have gone that far.</v>

1006
00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 4>We wouldn't kill noblemen we would.</v>

1007
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 4>So I think it was radical for the times.</v>

1008
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:40.500
<v Speaker 4>It looks very conservative and a little little fascist.</v>

1009
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:41.700
<v Speaker 4>Now when we look back on it,</v>

1010
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.330
<v Speaker 6>the one thing that concerns me now,</v>

1011
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:44.840
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1012
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.020
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1013
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.090
<v Speaker 6>I think this country is,</v>

1014
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.810
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

1015
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.420
<v Speaker 6>we sort of feel that we're immune to a revolution.</v>

1016
00:28:50.421 --> 00:28:52.310
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that anybody has any,</v>

1017
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.800
<v Speaker 6>I think the average person,</v>

1018
00:28:54.801 --> 00:28:58.160
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't say they don't think that anyone's going to overthrow the</v>

1019
00:28:58.161 --> 00:28:58.700
<v Speaker 6>government.</v>

1020
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.820
<v Speaker 6>It's not really anything that anybody really believes or thinks of.</v>

1021
00:29:01.821 --> 00:29:02.390
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1022
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.961
<v Speaker 6>Oh God,</v>

1023
00:29:02.961 --> 00:29:03.111
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1024
00:29:03.111 --> 00:29:04.880
<v Speaker 6>the United States government is way too big for that.</v>

1025
00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:09.140
<v Speaker 6>But there's a lot of people in this country that don't think that there's a lot</v>

1026
00:29:09.141 --> 00:29:11.150
<v Speaker 6>of people in this country that are stockpiling guns.</v>

1027
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.330
<v Speaker 6>And there's a lot of people in this country that think that the government's ban</v>

1028
00:29:14.331 --> 00:29:18.110
<v Speaker 6>on assault weapons and all these different magazine restrictions is just</v>

1029
00:29:18.111 --> 00:29:20.300
<v Speaker 6>designed to squash the,</v>

1030
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.960
<v Speaker 6>the oppression or the rather resistance to their oppression.</v>

1031
00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.220
<v Speaker 6>And that when,</v>

1032
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.360
<v Speaker 6>when the time comes,</v>

1033
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1034
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.150
<v Speaker 6>they're not going to give up their guns because they know what's going to</v>

1035
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:29.510
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>

1036
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.550
<v Speaker 6>That the government's going to come and get,</v>

1037
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:30.710
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1038
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.570
<v Speaker 6>I've never heard this before in my life,</v>

1039
00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:33.440
<v Speaker 6>this kind of thinking,</v>

1040
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember it in high school.</v>

1041
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:36.530
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember in college,</v>

1042
00:29:36.531 --> 00:29:37.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember.</v>

1043
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.110
<v Speaker 6>But now I read about it on the Internet,</v>

1044
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.730
<v Speaker 6>like on a fairly regular basis.</v>

1045
00:29:40.731 --> 00:29:42.700
<v Speaker 6>I read about people that are saying,</v>

1046
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 6>I've read,</v>

1047
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1048
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:44.021
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1049
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:44.600
<v Speaker 6>there was,</v>

1050
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:44.970
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1051
00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:45.470
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1052
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.810
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

1053
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.810
<v Speaker 6>what it was the task force where a police chief was developing a task force to</v>

1054
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 6>protect them in case they're a invaded by the United States government.</v>

1055
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:56.050
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1056
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 6>that was in Texas.</v>

1057
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.670
<v Speaker 6>In Texas.</v>

1058
00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 6>One of those wacky places.</v>

1059
00:29:58.961 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was Oklahoma,</v>

1060
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 6>but it was one of those places where you're like,</v>

1061
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:01.781
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

1062
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:02.321
<v Speaker 6>settle down.</v>

1063
00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:02.560
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

1064
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.191
<v Speaker 6>but hold on,</v>

1065
00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:04.024
<v Speaker 6>keep talking.</v>

1066
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck are you thinking?</v>

1067
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.011
<v Speaker 6>Like what do you,</v>

1068
00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:07.150
<v Speaker 6>what do you think is going on?</v>

1069
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.150
<v Speaker 6>You think the is going to come and take all the guns and they're,</v>

1070
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:15.151
<v Speaker 6>they're ready to put together a task force to like band together to protect the</v>

1071
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 6>citizens and their guns from the oppressive government.</v>

1072
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.180
<v Speaker 6>I've never heard talk like that from an elected official in recent memory.</v>

1073
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.430
<v Speaker 4>You got two different things going on here and they're both really important.</v>

1074
00:30:25.431 --> 00:30:27.860
<v Speaker 4>The first one was when you talked about the revolution thing,</v>

1075
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm of a different mind.</v>

1076
00:30:29.421 --> 00:30:33.590
<v Speaker 4>I try to look at what's the likelihood of a staying the way we are.</v>

1077
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

1078
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1079
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:36.780
<v Speaker 4>could could a revolution happened?</v>

1080
00:30:36.781 --> 00:30:37.101
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>

1081
00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:42.101
<v Speaker 4>but could we go the other way too where there's just a cracking down on things</v>

1082
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:43.670
<v Speaker 4>to an even more extent.</v>

1083
00:30:43.671 --> 00:30:44.360
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

1084
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.910
<v Speaker 4>the government gets overthrown on one side of the spectrum.</v>

1085
00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.040
<v Speaker 4>The government cracks down and says,</v>

1086
00:30:49.041 --> 00:30:49.401
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1087
00:30:49.401 --> 00:30:50.900
<v Speaker 4>all this constitutional stuff we've,</v>

1088
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.890
<v Speaker 4>we've paid attention to.</v>

1089
00:30:51.891 --> 00:30:52.640
<v Speaker 4>We can't do that.</v>

1090
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:52.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1091
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.590
<v Speaker 4>if two more buildings fall down,</v>

1092
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I think all,</v>

1093
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:56.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1094
00:30:56.731 --> 00:30:58.460
<v Speaker 4>ever been just going to throw everything out the window.</v>

1095
00:30:58.461 --> 00:31:01.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at how far we've come since the nine 11 attacks.</v>

1096
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Now magnify that.</v>

1097
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.720
<v Speaker 4>If it happened again from where we are now.</v>

1098
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:10.160
<v Speaker 4>So I think the real question is can we really see things staying in this middle</v>

1099
00:31:10.161 --> 00:31:13.550
<v Speaker 4>ground where we are for another 10 or 20 or 30 years?</v>

1100
00:31:13.551 --> 00:31:15.410
<v Speaker 4>I could see it going to either extreme.</v>

1101
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.430
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for me to imagine us actually staying in this sort of status that</v>

1102
00:31:19.431 --> 00:31:20.264
<v Speaker 4>we're in right now.</v>

1103
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.410
<v Speaker 6>They certainly think we're in a period of change.</v>

1104
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.413
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1105
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.160
<v Speaker 6>what I wonder is,</v>

1106
00:31:25.161 --> 00:31:29.910
<v Speaker 6>is it possible that people could be organized enough to do it and,</v>

1107
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:30.180
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1108
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.650
<v Speaker 6>and get something going on without violence?</v>

1109
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean is,</v>

1110
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.570
<v Speaker 6>is it possible to,</v>

1111
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:41.940
<v Speaker 6>is it possible to overhaul government from an elected official point of view?</v>

1112
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.840
<v Speaker 6>Can you just elect the right people and slowly but surely they'd take care of</v>

1113
00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:46.111
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

1114
00:31:46.111 --> 00:31:46.351
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1115
00:31:46.351 --> 00:31:46.681
<v Speaker 6>is it,</v>

1116
00:31:46.681 --> 00:31:48.110
<v Speaker 6>is it even possible at this point?</v>

1117
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:48.491
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1118
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:50.920
<v Speaker 4>I want to address your other point cause I think that was very good to the idea</v>

1119
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:51.581
<v Speaker 4>of this whole,</v>

1120
00:31:51.581 --> 00:31:51.911
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1121
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:52.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1122
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:54.350
<v Speaker 4>we need the guns to stop the government from,</v>

1123
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 4>from taking over or whatever.</v>

1124
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.230
<v Speaker 4>I first encountered this when I was on the radio in Oregon because once you get</v>

1125
00:31:59.231 --> 00:32:00.400
<v Speaker 4>out into the back country,</v>

1126
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 4>where are you getting?</v>

1127
00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:04.780
<v Speaker 4>And this was in the era of the so called militia movement and everything and you</v>

1128
00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:07.450
<v Speaker 4>get these people calling you talking about that exact thing.</v>

1129
00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:07.661
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1130
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:08.740
<v Speaker 4>what happened in malicious,</v>

1131
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 4>I think the mainstream,</v>

1132
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.040
<v Speaker 4>I think they're still out there.</v>

1133
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:12.580
<v Speaker 4>I think they're just,</v>

1134
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.330
<v Speaker 4>they're the people in the government and the guy who you mentioned in Texas,</v>

1135
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.630
<v Speaker 4>probably an old militia member,</v>

1136
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.793
<v Speaker 4>but these guys,</v>

1137
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.440
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that the um,</v>

1138
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.860
<v Speaker 4>the nras kind of pushed to the areas of very different animal than it was 30 or</v>

1139
00:32:23.861 --> 00:32:24.670
<v Speaker 4>40 years ago.</v>

1140
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things they talk about now that they didn't use to talk about was</v>

1141
00:32:28.241 --> 00:32:31.390
<v Speaker 4>this idea that part of the reasons we have a second amendment is to overthrow</v>

1142
00:32:31.391 --> 00:32:31.961
<v Speaker 4>the government.</v>

1143
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:32.794
<v Speaker 4>If you need to,</v>

1144
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:33.873
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1145
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.250
<v Speaker 4>I'll leave that to a constitutional expert.</v>

1146
00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:37.210
<v Speaker 4>I would just point out that,</v>

1147
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 4>that I think people who think like that are,</v>

1148
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:41.180
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1149
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 4>are not paying a whole lot of attention to how much things have changed</v>

1150
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:45.014
<v Speaker 4>militarily.</v>

1151
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 4>You and I were talking about drones a minute ago,</v>

1152
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.740
<v Speaker 4>who thinks any government person's going to put themselves out as a target?</v>

1153
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:53.390
<v Speaker 4>They're just going to send a drone to your house.</v>

1154
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:54.350
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1155
00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:54.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think,</v>

1156
00:32:54.831 --> 00:32:57.500
<v Speaker 4>I think that ship has sailed but there's a lot of people,</v>

1157
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:00.700
<v Speaker 4>you remember there was Randy Weaver up in Idaho that got um,</v>

1158
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1159
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 4>into this conflict with federal agents cause he's at the Ruby Ridge as he saw</v>

1160
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:05.030
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1161
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 4>a shotgun off a little too far in a government agent,</v>

1162
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:10.250
<v Speaker 4>bought it from him and then all of a sudden their surrounding his cabin and</v>

1163
00:33:10.251 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 4>shooting his dog and shooting his wife and killing his son,</v>

1164
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 4>which really was a kind of a bad deal.</v>

1165
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>

1166
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:15.883
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1167
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.791
<v Speaker 4>he had a case,</v>

1168
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:17.750
<v Speaker 4>this is what I guess I'm saying,</v>

1169
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 4>but he was a bad enough,</v>

1170
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 4>weird enough unibomber looking kind of dude that you could spin that into.</v>

1171
00:33:22.911 --> 00:33:24.920
<v Speaker 4>Well he's a radical gun nuts kind of thing.</v>

1172
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.450
<v Speaker 4>And then you have the Waco situation happened.</v>

1173
00:33:27.451 --> 00:33:27.921
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>

1174
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:29.360
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of really weird dudes.</v>

1175
00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:30.860
<v Speaker 4>So you want to kind of go,</v>

1176
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.401
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1177
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:31.581
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1178
00:33:31.581 --> 00:33:32.630
<v Speaker 4>look at who you're dealing with,</v>

1179
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 4>child abuse and this or that.</v>

1180
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 4>But you kind of lose how nasty a deal that was because it's like terrorist.</v>

1181
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:39.890
<v Speaker 4>You can do anything you want to terrorist.</v>

1182
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 4>And if it's to terrorists,</v>

1183
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 4>we don't care as much.</v>

1184
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.573
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1185
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.800
<v Speaker 4>I think when you talk about,</v>

1186
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1187
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.770
<v Speaker 4>changing the elected officials and all that,</v>

1188
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.330
<v Speaker 4>we talk about this all the time.</v>

1189
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:50.541
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1190
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:50.930
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1191
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:51.380
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1192
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.670
<v Speaker 4>let's call it as it really is.</v>

1193
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:53.720
<v Speaker 4>We have a corrupt government.</v>

1194
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1195
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 4>when you have a representative,</v>

1196
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.463
<v Speaker 4>undeniably,</v>

1197
00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.540
<v Speaker 4>and they'll tell you that if you catch him off record,</v>

1198
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:00.140
<v Speaker 4>they know.</v>

1199
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 4>And when you have a government that's a representative democracy,</v>

1200
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:03.021
<v Speaker 4>like we have,</v>

1201
00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 4>you have a government by middlemen,</v>

1202
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1203
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 4>We have a membrane.</v>

1204
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:09.380
<v Speaker 4>If Joe Rogan gets a bunch of people together to change the laws,</v>

1205
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 4>you have to go through these representatives.</v>

1206
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 4>If that membrane is corrupt,</v>

1207
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 4>no matter what you do,</v>

1208
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.800
<v Speaker 4>when you end up with legislation on the other side of that membrane,</v>

1209
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:21.080
<v Speaker 4>it's going to have been tainted on the way through.</v>

1210
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 4>And this is why when you talk about reform,</v>

1211
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 4>reform has to get through those people.</v>

1212
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 4>They're the ones benefiting from the way things are,</v>

1213
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:29.540
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1214
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.111
<v Speaker 4>So in other words,</v>

1215
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:30.411
<v Speaker 4>if you say,</v>

1216
00:34:30.411 --> 00:34:32.210
<v Speaker 4>let's have some anticorruption legislation,</v>

1217
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.910
<v Speaker 4>who is going to be the people most hurt by that?</v>

1218
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:37.370
<v Speaker 4>The people that benefit from the way things are.</v>

1219
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.560
<v Speaker 4>So this is sort of the fly in the ointment.</v>

1220
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:43.400
<v Speaker 4>How do you get corruption reform through the very people that are benefiting</v>

1221
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:44.323
<v Speaker 4>from corruption?</v>

1222
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.530
<v Speaker 4>So that's the problem.</v>

1223
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.700
<v Speaker 4>And what is the answer?</v>

1224
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.171
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1225
00:34:48.171 --> 00:34:49.640
<v Speaker 4>this is another question entirely.</v>

1226
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 4>I think this is when you pressure people,</v>

1227
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:52.640
<v Speaker 4>I think when you talk about,</v>

1228
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.390
<v Speaker 4>let me think about the sixties protests.</v>

1229
00:34:54.391 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 4>People today make a big deal.</v>

1230
00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:00.080
<v Speaker 4>If you can get 50,000 people out with signs for one afternoon,</v>

1231
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.530
<v Speaker 4>that's a huge protest in the world of the 21st century.</v>

1232
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.360
<v Speaker 4>You've got to think of sixties protests when you have two hundred and fifty</v>

1233
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.800
<v Speaker 4>thousand three hundred thousand four hundred thousand civil rights type protests</v>

1234
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.990
<v Speaker 4>that are putting real pressure on the government.</v>

1235
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.690
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what it's gonna take.</v>

1236
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna take a real feeling like,</v>

1237
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:16.760
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1238
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.593
<v Speaker 4>the Jig is up.</v>

1239
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1240
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.590
<v Speaker 4>this whole,</v>

1241
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:18.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1242
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:19.700
<v Speaker 4>we're in threatened,</v>

1243
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 4>we're threatened with revolution.</v>

1244
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 4>You talked about revolution were threatened with revolution.</v>

1245
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 4>If we don't buckle down and you're going to have to have those people that are</v>

1246
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:27.470
<v Speaker 4>really feel like,</v>

1247
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.771
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1248
00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:28.551
<v Speaker 4>we have no choice.</v>

1249
00:35:28.551 --> 00:35:31.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what my contributor gave me to push this idea.</v>

1250
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have to at least throw something out there that's a fig leaf.</v>

1251
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.630
<v Speaker 4>And they don't feel that pressure.</v>

1252
00:35:35.631 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 4>Now is it possible,</v>

1253
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 6>and this was my,</v>

1254
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.451
<v Speaker 6>my question,</v>

1255
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 6>is it possible to go and get new elected officials and change that?</v>

1256
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:44.191
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1257
00:35:44.191 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 6>can you get people that aren't willing to be corrupt and aren't willing to</v>

1258
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:53.440
<v Speaker 6>capitalize on the system as it's written right now and profit off of it?</v>

1259
00:35:53.441 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 6>And</v>

1260
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:53.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1261
00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.120
<v Speaker 4>that scene from the Kevin Costner version of the untouchables,</v>

1262
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.470
<v Speaker 4>there's a scene in that movie,</v>

1263
00:35:58.471 --> 00:36:02.370
<v Speaker 4>and I quote it all the time where Al Capone has bought off the jury and he's</v>

1264
00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:04.920
<v Speaker 4>sitting in court and he knows he has nothing to worry about cause he's paid off</v>

1265
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:05.754
<v Speaker 4>the whole jury.</v>

1266
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.620
<v Speaker 4>And they've realized that he's paid off the jury.</v>

1267
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:08.401
<v Speaker 4>So at the last minute,</v>

1268
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 4>right before the verdict is read,</v>

1269
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.890
<v Speaker 4>the judge dismisses all the jury members and brings in all the alternates and</v>

1270
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 4>screws up the whole thing because now all of a sudden,</v>

1271
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 4>instead of a corrupt jury,</v>

1272
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 4>you have one that hasn't been bought off.</v>

1273
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Speaker 4>The way our government is set up is designed to keep radical change from</v>

1274
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:23.664
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1275
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:28.440
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't turn over all at once and there's a seniority system so that,</v>

1276
00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:33.441
<v Speaker 4>let's say you elected a third of the congress is new people not corrupt.</v>

1277
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.261
<v Speaker 4>They're part of an,</v>

1278
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:34.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1279
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 4>you have the tea party thing.</v>

1280
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine instead of the tea party,</v>

1281
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.500
<v Speaker 4>you had an anticorruption movement that was able to bring in a whole bunch of</v>

1282
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:44.860
<v Speaker 4>new congresspeople and their whole shtick is that we're non-corrupt,</v>

1283
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.170
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to vote for any of this corruption.</v>

1284
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.780
<v Speaker 4>The first thing that's going to happen is they're going to be told to sit in the</v>

1285
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 4>back of the room and shut up till they have seniority.</v>

1286
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.741
<v Speaker 4>When you're here,</v>

1287
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 4>two or three terms,</v>

1288
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.130
<v Speaker 4>we'll maybe give you a committee position.</v>

1289
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.170
<v Speaker 4>If you show that you're going to play ball,</v>

1290
00:36:58.171 --> 00:36:59.340
<v Speaker 4>we'll let you run the committee.</v>

1291
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:02.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's this whole system where you don't get to be influential until</v>

1292
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 4>you've proven you're a good corrupt official for a long time and you're not</v>

1293
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:09.450
<v Speaker 4>allowed to overthrow the entire government at once.</v>

1294
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.990
<v Speaker 4>You have to go in there and then you're still going to have John Kerry and John</v>

1295
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Mccain and all those guys running the show while you're in the back.</v>

1296
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 4>If you're lucky,</v>

1297
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:20.760
<v Speaker 4>getting a chance to give a speech on Cspan in front of an empty congression a</v>

1298
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:23.490
<v Speaker 4>room because all of your compatriots are out fundraising.</v>

1299
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.240
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that they have phone banks right off the congressional property</v>

1300
00:37:27.241 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 4>cause you're not allowed to fundraise on government property.</v>

1301
00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:34.650
<v Speaker 4>So they've built these phone banks like one foot off government property and</v>

1302
00:37:34.651 --> 00:37:37.860
<v Speaker 4>they go in there and they cast their vote and then their aids take them right to</v>

1303
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:39.690
<v Speaker 4>the phone banks and they start the fundraising.</v>

1304
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.110
<v Speaker 4>80% of their time is spent fundraising and they don't want to do this.</v>

1305
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 4>I should say that some of these guys,</v>

1306
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:45.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1307
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1308
00:37:45.421 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 4>Peter De Fazio is a congressman from Oregon.</v>

1309
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.030
<v Speaker 4>He didn't run for Senate because he said I'm already fundraising more than my</v>

1310
00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 4>conscience will allow and if I become a senator I have to do even more of that.</v>

1311
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 4>So there are some good people in there.</v>

1312
00:37:56.851 --> 00:37:57.480
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>

1313
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 4>I think outnumbered,</v>

1314
00:37:58.810 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1315
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.590
<v Speaker 4>85% to 15 or something like that.</v>

1316
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:06.650
<v Speaker 6>So their fund raising is essentially just person to person phone calls.</v>

1317
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:07.381
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1318
00:38:07.381 --> 00:38:09.770
<v Speaker 4>And as a matter of fact they will tell you when and you know,</v>

1319
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 4>you can almost see how they've compromised their own moral sense when you have a</v>

1320
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:14.400
<v Speaker 4>conversation with some of these guys.</v>

1321
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.660
<v Speaker 4>Cause like one of them told me,</v>

1322
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:15.901
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

1323
00:38:15.901 --> 00:38:16.680
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1324
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.680
<v Speaker 4>this is democracy in action and it's okay because anybody can play this game.</v>

1325
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 4>He said if you have money,</v>

1326
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.630
<v Speaker 4>and I said what about poor people?</v>

1327
00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 4>It's the poor people could get together in large organizations and groups.</v>

1328
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 4>He said if you have money you get to play.</v>

1329
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 4>He said it's totally fair.</v>

1330
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.780
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally level playing field.</v>

1331
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.200
<v Speaker 4>Anybody can take part,</v>

1332
00:38:35.201 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 4>but money is how you get our attention and they've convinced themselves that</v>

1333
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:39.754
<v Speaker 4>this is fine.</v>

1334
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.541
<v Speaker 4>To be honest,</v>

1335
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 4>it's been going on in one form or another for so long and some of these guys</v>

1336
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 4>have been on the hill for 30 years.</v>

1337
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.321
<v Speaker 4>I mean to them,</v>

1338
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:48.580
<v Speaker 4>this is just how it works.</v>

1339
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1340
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Lawrence Lessig um,</v>

1341
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:51.910
<v Speaker 4>wrote a book where he,</v>

1342
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.360
<v Speaker 4>he talked to some of these guys and they're almost confused.</v>

1343
00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 4>He had one guy where he went in and,</v>

1344
00:38:56.591 --> 00:38:56.781
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1345
00:38:56.781 --> 00:39:00.430
<v Speaker 4>and the guy was voting on one side of an issue and Lawrence Lessig said,</v>

1346
00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:00.521
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1347
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:01.930
<v Speaker 4>what about this other side of the issue?</v>

1348
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.560
<v Speaker 4>And the guy was completely unaware that anybody disagreed with the issue at all</v>

1349
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 4>because he hadn't heard from the other side because the other side hadn't given</v>

1350
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:08.681
<v Speaker 4>any money.</v>

1351
00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 4>He was unaware there was another side.</v>

1352
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.310
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1353
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:12.500
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1354
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1355
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:13.451
<v Speaker 4>so in a sense,</v>

1356
00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:15.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not trying to let these guys off the hook,</v>

1357
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 4>but they're in this bubble.</v>

1358
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1359
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 4>I remember we had a,</v>

1360
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll even name a name here.</v>

1361
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:22.510
<v Speaker 4>I had senator Mark Hatfield on my radio show once,</v>

1362
00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:27.511
<v Speaker 4>and this is way back in the 1990s and he comes on the show and he's about 80</v>

1363
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:32.671
<v Speaker 4>years old and he's led by the hand by some 19 year old girl who's his aide,</v>

1364
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 4>who's talking to him like he's an Alzheimer's patient.</v>

1365
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.791
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1366
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:37.571
<v Speaker 4>Senator Hatfield's,</v>

1367
00:39:37.571 --> 00:39:40.750
<v Speaker 4>you're going to sit down and you're going to talk to this guy for 15 minutes.</v>

1368
00:39:40.751 --> 00:39:41.171
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1369
00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 4>Then we have to go to the car.</v>

1370
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.641
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

1371
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:43.480
<v Speaker 4>he was like an uh,</v>

1372
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.590
<v Speaker 4>he was like a robot.</v>

1373
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:44.951
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1374
00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:45.161
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

1375
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:45.521
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1376
00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:45.761
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1377
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.470
<v Speaker 4>I'll talk to this guy and then where are we going next?</v>

1378
00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:48.131
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

1379
00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:49.210
<v Speaker 4>I thought the guy was like,</v>

1380
00:39:49.211 --> 00:39:49.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1381
00:39:49.391 --> 00:39:50.560
<v Speaker 4>a Manchurian candidate.</v>

1382
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:52.030
<v Speaker 4>They just hopped up on some kind of,</v>

1383
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.090
<v Speaker 4>they'd given him an injection and then they just lead him to wherever he has to</v>

1384
00:39:55.091 --> 00:39:55.271
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

1385
00:39:55.271 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Speaker 4>But in a sense,</v>

1386
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 4>I felt sorry for the guy because to go in and say,</v>

1387
00:39:58.571 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing about corruption?</v>

1388
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:01.390
<v Speaker 4>The first thing he's going to do is turn to his aid and goes,</v>

1389
00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 4>do we have a corruption problem?</v>

1390
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.580
<v Speaker 4>It was just on my schedule.</v>

1391
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean he really did know.</v>

1392
00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 4>So I don't want to cast these people as evil.</v>

1393
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure how much they're aware of some of this stuff.</v>

1394
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:11.171
<v Speaker 4>We'll also,</v>

1395
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 4>the businesses existed in this certain form,</v>

1396
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.120
<v Speaker 4>the form that it's in right now for quite a long time.</v>

1397
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.500
<v Speaker 4>So this is nothing new.</v>

1398
00:40:17.501 --> 00:40:17.650
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1399
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.550
<v Speaker 4>it's an evolution.</v>

1400
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.100
<v Speaker 4>So when they come into this Gig,</v>

1401
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.810
<v Speaker 4>everybody who works the Gig,</v>

1402
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.051
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1403
00:40:23.051 --> 00:40:23.481
<v Speaker 4>as they're,</v>

1404
00:40:23.481 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Speaker 4>they're learning the business and learning how it works.</v>

1405
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.390
<v Speaker 4>It's just this is how it is.</v>

1406
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:28.691
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

1407
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:29.830
<v Speaker 4>You go to orientation,</v>

1408
00:40:29.831 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 4>if you get elected of Joe Rogan gets elected to Congress your first week on the</v>

1409
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:33.341
<v Speaker 4>hill,</v>

1410
00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 4>you go to orientation and they're going to tell you where the cafeteria is.</v>

1411
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.661
<v Speaker 4>They're going to tell you,</v>

1412
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:37.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1413
00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:39.310
<v Speaker 4>where the phone banks are and this and that.</v>

1414
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:40.030
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing,</v>

1415
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1416
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:45.361
<v Speaker 4>you get essentially trained how to be an elected official and then they sit you</v>

1417
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:48.700
<v Speaker 4>in the back and you get to watch how business is done for a term or two.</v>

1418
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.331
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1419
00:40:49.331 --> 00:40:49.661
<v Speaker 4>And that's how,</v>

1420
00:40:49.661 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1421
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>

1422
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:51.250
<v Speaker 4>look at Ron Wyden.</v>

1423
00:40:51.251 --> 00:40:52.150
<v Speaker 4>He's another Oregon senator.</v>

1424
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 4>He's the one making the big stink about not being able to get any of these</v>

1425
00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:57.070
<v Speaker 4>secret documents on the drones and everything else.</v>

1426
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.680
<v Speaker 4>Widen is on the Senate intelligence committee,</v>

1427
00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:04.360
<v Speaker 4>which I believe is eight senators and you'd have to be there like forever to get</v>

1428
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 4>on the intelligence committee.</v>

1429
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:08.470
<v Speaker 4>And the committee is supposed to be the ones who actually get the secret stuff.</v>

1430
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.333
<v Speaker 4>Believe it or not,</v>

1431
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.410
<v Speaker 4>we don't tell senators the secret stuff.</v>

1432
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.810
<v Speaker 4>We only tell the people on the intelligence committee,</v>

1433
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.560
<v Speaker 4>the secret stuff about intelligence and widened says the eight guys on that</v>

1434
00:41:17.561 --> 00:41:18.910
<v Speaker 4>can't get the information.</v>

1435
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Speaker 4>So you have to be a senator for years and years and years to be trusted enough</v>

1436
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.290
<v Speaker 4>to be on the intelligence committee.</v>

1437
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.161
<v Speaker 4>So when you say,</v>

1438
00:41:27.161 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 4>couldn't we get new people in here and couldn't that fix everything?</v>

1439
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 4>No new person's going to even be given the secret intelligence until they prove</v>

1440
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 4>that they will play ball for many terms.</v>

1441
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.080
<v Speaker 4>And then you don't get to be the head of the intelligence committee until you</v>

1442
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 4>prove that even more.</v>

1443
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:40.311
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

1444
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:43.070
<v Speaker 6>It's essentially if you looked at the government as a living organism,</v>

1445
00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:44.660
<v Speaker 6>it's like it's trying to protect itself.</v>

1446
00:41:44.661 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 6>It has an immunity system.</v>

1447
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:46.001
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1448
00:41:46.001 --> 00:41:46.140
<v Speaker 6>Yep,</v>

1449
00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.580
<v Speaker 4>it every bureaucracy is like that.</v>

1450
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 4>Most companies when they get large enough or even like that.</v>

1451
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.130
<v Speaker 6>Now tell me about these phone banks.</v>

1452
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.581
<v Speaker 6>So they,</v>

1453
00:41:52.581 --> 00:41:53.090
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1454
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1455
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.070
<v Speaker 6>they get off the floor and they go one foot pass the government at the property</v>

1456
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.240
<v Speaker 6>and they just call who,</v>

1457
00:42:00.241 --> 00:42:01.074
<v Speaker 6>who are these people?</v>

1458
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.310
<v Speaker 6>How do they get their numbers right?</v>

1459
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1460
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.320
<v Speaker 4>generally what happens is they have a staff and they're going to have somebody</v>

1461
00:42:05.321 --> 00:42:08.410
<v Speaker 4>on their staff who helps them raise money and there's going to be fundraising</v>

1462
00:42:08.411 --> 00:42:09.244
<v Speaker 4>targets.</v>

1463
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.690
<v Speaker 4>Lessig talks about this in his book.</v>

1464
00:42:10.691 --> 00:42:11.410
<v Speaker 4>They will say,</v>

1465
00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:16.060
<v Speaker 4>you need to raise this much per day and if you fall short the next day it just,</v>

1466
00:42:16.061 --> 00:42:16.751
<v Speaker 4>it rolls over.</v>

1467
00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:20.620
<v Speaker 4>You have to make that much more per day and they'll have targeting goals that</v>

1468
00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:24.190
<v Speaker 4>are designed to be met by the next time you have to start campaigning.</v>

1469
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.570
<v Speaker 6>Now is that money to support their next campaign?</v>

1470
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.020
<v Speaker 6>That is that money what it is?</v>

1471
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.340
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

1472
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.700
<v Speaker 4>the best question of all because this is the one empowering thing about the</v>

1473
00:42:33.701 --> 00:42:37.810
<v Speaker 4>whole deal that goes right back to us as voters and how we can actually change</v>

1474
00:42:37.811 --> 00:42:38.620
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1475
00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.180
<v Speaker 4>This money is mostly,</v>

1476
00:42:40.181 --> 00:42:41.980
<v Speaker 4>some of it's for campaign organization,</v>

1477
00:42:41.981 --> 00:42:42.191
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1478
00:42:42.191 --> 00:42:43.630
<v Speaker 4>You want your guys going door to door,</v>

1479
00:42:43.631 --> 00:42:44.350
<v Speaker 4>you want to have,</v>

1480
00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.200
<v Speaker 4>you want to have your campaign office opened up in Iowa if you're running for</v>

1481
00:42:47.201 --> 00:42:48.220
<v Speaker 4>president right away,</v>

1482
00:42:48.221 --> 00:42:48.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1483
00:42:48.371 --> 00:42:48.851
<v Speaker 4>those kind of things.</v>

1484
00:42:48.851 --> 00:42:50.020
<v Speaker 4>So there's some money that goes to that,</v>

1485
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.810
<v Speaker 4>but the majority of this money is designed for ads.</v>

1486
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.231
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1487
00:42:53.231 --> 00:42:56.800
<v Speaker 4>And what are the ads designed to do to change your mind?</v>

1488
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.050
<v Speaker 4>What if the ads didn't work anymore?</v>

1489
00:42:59.260 --> 00:42:59.541
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1490
00:42:59.541 --> 00:43:00.374
<v Speaker 4>why all of a sudden,</v>

1491
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:00.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1492
00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.390
<v Speaker 4>we already are from a generation that's a lot more cynical about advertising</v>

1493
00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:04.721
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

1494
00:43:04.721 --> 00:43:08.170
<v Speaker 4>And you and I are both in a business where we realize how much of a tougher time</v>

1495
00:43:08.171 --> 00:43:10.630
<v Speaker 4>advertisers have than they used to have.</v>

1496
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.291
<v Speaker 4>And the old days,</v>

1497
00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:11.471
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1498
00:43:11.471 --> 00:43:12.101
<v Speaker 4>all you have to do is,</v>

1499
00:43:12.101 --> 00:43:12.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1500
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.360
<v Speaker 4>we have a new,</v>

1501
00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:13.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1502
00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.600
<v Speaker 4>surreal and it's got some different colored marshmallows and boom.</v>

1503
00:43:16.601 --> 00:43:18.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're selling that like hotcakes now.</v>

1504
00:43:18.671 --> 00:43:19.060
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1505
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.380
<v Speaker 4>it's a much more cynical group.</v>

1506
00:43:20.381 --> 00:43:23.380
<v Speaker 4>We have the dvrs and all these things that allow you to skip ads.</v>

1507
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.510
<v Speaker 4>What if they stopped working?</v>

1508
00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.690
<v Speaker 4>What if the old people who still buy into advertising the old way it happens.</v>

1509
00:43:28.691 --> 00:43:32.110
<v Speaker 4>That generation goes away and now all of a sudden everybody's like us.</v>

1510
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.650
<v Speaker 4>Don't you devalue what that money buys?</v>

1511
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.210
<v Speaker 4>Haven't we changed the system simply by not paying attention to the ads that the</v>

1512
00:43:40.211 --> 00:43:41.290
<v Speaker 4>entire system,</v>

1513
00:43:41.291 --> 00:43:43.570
<v Speaker 4>the money is designed to change your mind.</v>

1514
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.580
<v Speaker 4>If it doesn't change your mind anymore,</v>

1515
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.211
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't.</v>

1516
00:43:46.211 --> 00:43:47.350
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing kind of collapsed.</v>

1517
00:43:47.351 --> 00:43:47.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1518
00:43:47.531 --> 00:43:49.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't know cause we haven't seen it happen,</v>

1519
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.810
<v Speaker 4>but that seems to be the whole fly in the ointment when it comes to campaign and</v>

1520
00:43:52.811 --> 00:43:54.100
<v Speaker 4>money raising and everything else.</v>

1521
00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.020
<v Speaker 4>If I can't change your mind with the money,</v>

1522
00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.920
<v Speaker 4>why do I want to sell my soul and spend 80% of my time fundraising?</v>

1523
00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.660
<v Speaker 4>The whole point is to change your mind.</v>

1524
00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.231
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1525
00:44:02.231 --> 00:44:05.110
<v Speaker 4>the one thing that always changes my mind is those negative ads,</v>

1526
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.730
<v Speaker 4>like the really obvious one,</v>

1527
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1528
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.680
<v Speaker 4>President Obama Odor,</v>

1529
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1530
00:44:08.891 --> 00:44:10.300
<v Speaker 4>like when they get like real,</v>

1531
00:44:10.301 --> 00:44:11.160
<v Speaker 4>super negative,</v>

1532
00:44:11.161 --> 00:44:12.820
<v Speaker 4>you just can't trust him.</v>

1533
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.480
<v Speaker 4>Why those work though?</v>

1534
00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.480
<v Speaker 4>They work because you don't have an alternative.</v>

1535
00:44:16.481 --> 00:44:17.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>

1536
00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:19.450
<v Speaker 4>that's the whole democratic and republican thing.</v>

1537
00:44:19.451 --> 00:44:23.530
<v Speaker 4>If you had five choices and one guy went negative against another guy,</v>

1538
00:44:23.531 --> 00:44:24.370
<v Speaker 4>the average voter to say,</v>

1539
00:44:24.371 --> 00:44:24.461
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1540
00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:25.151
<v Speaker 4>I'm not voting for either.</v>

1541
00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:26.690
<v Speaker 4>I've heard bad things about both those guys.</v>

1542
00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:28.030
<v Speaker 4>So I'm voting for this third party.</v>

1543
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 4>The two party thing gets you into the lesser of two evils,</v>

1544
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 4>or your waste,</v>

1545
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.270
<v Speaker 5>your vote nonsense.</v>

1546
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:34.261
<v Speaker 5>And that's where,</v>

1547
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:34.501
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1548
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 5>that's why the negative ads work.</v>

1549
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:36.654
<v Speaker 5>Like they do that.</v>

1550
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 5>That's something that would go away if you had multiple choices.</v>

1551
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:41.730
<v Speaker 5>You can't do five negative ads very easily.</v>

1552
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:42.241
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1553
00:44:42.241 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 5>it became much more difficult for independence after Ron,</v>

1554
00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:47.131
<v Speaker 5>not Ron Paul,</v>

1555
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:47.641
<v Speaker 5>excuse me.</v>

1556
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 5>After um,</v>

1557
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 5>Perot.</v>

1558
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:49.840
<v Speaker 5>Ross Perot.</v>

1559
00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1560
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1561
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.760
<v Speaker 5>When Ross Perot came around and paid for his own television half hour to uh,</v>

1562
00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1563
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.920
<v Speaker 5>talk about his campaign and taxes and where your money's going and the Federal</v>

1564
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 5>Reserve.</v>

1565
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.220
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have never heard any of that stuff before.</v>

1566
00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 5>What if a not so goofy character had done it too?</v>

1567
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1568
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.600
<v Speaker 5>what if you'd had somebody who would,</v>

1569
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:10.860
<v Speaker 5>if Robert Redford,</v>

1570
00:45:10.861 --> 00:45:11.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1571
00:45:11.031 --> 00:45:11.970
<v Speaker 5>he gets right,</v>

1572
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.130
<v Speaker 5>I had a political science professor,</v>

1573
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:14.311
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1574
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:14.820
<v Speaker 5>From,</v>

1575
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 5>he was from Germany,</v>

1576
00:45:15.691 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 5>real old guy when I was in college and he said that one of the flaws in the</v>

1577
00:45:19.711 --> 00:45:22.820
<v Speaker 5>American system was that they have the PR,</v>

1578
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:27.180
<v Speaker 5>the job of president is actually two jobs in most foreign countries.</v>

1579
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 5>Usually you'll have like a prime minister and a guy who's called the chancellor</v>

1580
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:32.544
<v Speaker 5>or the president,</v>

1581
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 5>the prime ministers,</v>

1582
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.980
<v Speaker 5>the bean counter guy,</v>

1583
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:35.761
<v Speaker 5>the guy who's really,</v>

1584
00:45:35.761 --> 00:45:35.911
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1585
00:45:35.911 --> 00:45:39.480
<v Speaker 5>you put in there to do the work and then the chancellor or the president is the</v>

1586
00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:40.314
<v Speaker 5>figurehead guy,</v>

1587
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 5>the guy who goes to the state funerals,</v>

1588
00:45:41.911 --> 00:45:44.070
<v Speaker 5>the one who embodies the soul of the nation.</v>

1589
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.740
<v Speaker 5>And this guy said in your country,</v>

1590
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.780
<v Speaker 5>those two things have to be in the same person.</v>

1591
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:50.340
<v Speaker 5>So when you elect to Ronald Reagan,</v>

1592
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 5>what you were electing is a John Wayne.</v>

1593
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.690
<v Speaker 5>You want that guy.</v>

1594
00:45:53.691 --> 00:45:54.021
<v Speaker 5>I mean who,</v>

1595
00:45:54.021 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 5>who do you think of as president?</v>

1596
00:45:55.231 --> 00:45:58.530
<v Speaker 5>You don't want some wimpy bean counter account and looking guy.</v>

1597
00:45:58.531 --> 00:46:00.330
<v Speaker 5>You want some guy that looks like America,</v>

1598
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1599
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 5>But how often do you get the skills you want in the bean counter?</v>

1600
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I say bean counter,</v>

1601
00:46:05.281 --> 00:46:05.910
<v Speaker 5>but you know it's a,</v>

1602
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:06.870
<v Speaker 5>it's a whole range of things.</v>

1603
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:11.820
<v Speaker 5>But how often are you going to combine the Robert Redford look of a person with</v>

1604
00:46:11.821 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 5>the guy who's going to have all those other qualities you want,</v>

1605
00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:14.810
<v Speaker 5>especially if they've been an eraser,</v>

1606
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 5>clapper politician for 30 years or something.</v>

1607
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 5>So we're kind of hamstrung by that.</v>

1608
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 5>So if Ross,</v>

1609
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.720
<v Speaker 5>can you imagine Ross Perot is president?</v>

1610
00:46:21.721 --> 00:46:22.950
<v Speaker 5>Because I think most people are like,</v>

1611
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:23.531
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1612
00:46:23.531 --> 00:46:24.331
<v Speaker 5>I like what he's saying,</v>

1613
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:26.640
<v Speaker 5>but I can't imagine that little short,</v>

1614
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 5>strange talking.</v>

1615
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.180
<v Speaker 5>We're going to clean out the barn kind of guy being president.</v>

1616
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.510
<v Speaker 5>I think I would have imagined he could have pulled it off.</v>

1617
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:34.770
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

1618
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:35.521
<v Speaker 5>I wish you know,</v>

1619
00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:36.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1620
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.571
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1621
00:46:36.571 --> 00:46:37.650
<v Speaker 5>and you know what,</v>

1622
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.491
<v Speaker 5>to be honest,</v>

1623
00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:39.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what kind of president he'd be at.</v>

1624
00:46:39.771 --> 00:46:41.610
<v Speaker 5>My standards are just so low now.</v>

1625
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:41.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1626
00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:43.200
<v Speaker 5>if they're honest,</v>

1627
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm on board mean forget about it.</v>

1628
00:46:44.821 --> 00:46:46.700
<v Speaker 5>And are there specific policies my,</v>

1629
00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:48.330
<v Speaker 5>my take on it would be completely,</v>

1630
00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:53.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean it really would be all just guesswork because I have no idea what the</v>

1631
00:46:53.191 --> 00:46:56.310
<v Speaker 5>hell happens when you actually get into office,</v>

1632
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.420
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

1633
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.070
<v Speaker 5>But I really have no idea what the whole process must be like to say,</v>

1634
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:03.030
<v Speaker 5>when I'm president,</v>

1635
00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:03.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do this.</v>

1636
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:09.140
<v Speaker 5>And when you actually get elected and then you have meetings and get access and</v>

1637
00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:14.250
<v Speaker 5>get debriefed and they explain the world to you in a way that really no one has</v>

1638
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:15.630
<v Speaker 5>access to other than the president.</v>

1639
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:15.811
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1640
00:47:15.811 --> 00:47:18.640
<v Speaker 5>You're not bypassing that moment at the inauguration where they hit you up with</v>

1641
00:47:18.641 --> 00:47:22.190
<v Speaker 5>the needle and turn you into an imaginary candidate and me go,</v>

1642
00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.010
<v Speaker 5>go read a book.</v>

1643
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 5>You go look at Obama's speeches.</v>

1644
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:25.500
<v Speaker 5>I tell everybody to go do this.</v>

1645
00:47:25.501 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 5>Go Watch candidate Obama's speeches when he's running for the first term in</v>

1646
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 5>office and compare</v>

1647
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.550
<v Speaker 1>that to what we've had and then realize that that's pretty darn normal.</v>

1648
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 1>The before and after thing,</v>

1649
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you do start to come to this conspiratorial idea that some,</v>

1650
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1651
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>they go to Europe,</v>

1652
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.080
<v Speaker 1>they go to you right before your Noggin,</v>

1653
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 1>racially,</v>

1654
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.490
<v Speaker 1>we're going to kill your whole family if you don't do just what,</v>

1655
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you know what every other president does.</v>

1656
00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever heard of the Bill Hicks bit about it?</v>

1657
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:47.060
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1658
00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about the buildings up and his take was,</v>

1659
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.201
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1660
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:50.411
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1661
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you get become president,</v>

1662
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:57.100
<v Speaker 1>they take you into a smoky room filled with industrialists and it goes,</v>

1663
00:47:57.101 --> 00:47:57.934
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1664
00:47:58.570 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 1>roll the tape.</v>

1665
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:00.161
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1666
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 1>and then a projector drops down and they show you an angle of the Kennedy</v>

1667
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.110
<v Speaker 1>assassination.</v>

1668
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's never been seen before.</v>

1669
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1670
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And they say any questions?</v>

1671
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:09.401
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1672
00:48:09.401 --> 00:48:09.821
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1673
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:10.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1674
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1675
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1676
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 1>what's my agenda?</v>

1677
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:12.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1678
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost like an Algebra problem when you try to</v>

1679
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 4>plain all the reasons that these people might morph so much after election day.</v>

1680
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:20.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1681
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 4>they'll start to start looking not that far fetched because it's hard to explain</v>

1682
00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:25.174
<v Speaker 4>otherwise unless,</v>

1683
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:30.010
<v Speaker 4>unless these people just think campaign promises or campaign promises and that's</v>

1684
00:48:30.011 --> 00:48:30.281
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1685
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:30.881
<v Speaker 4>And I and I,</v>

1686
00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:31.714
<v Speaker 4>and I've been,</v>

1687
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean look Obama was,</v>

1688
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:37.210
<v Speaker 4>was the favorite of guys like Goldman Sachs and Citibank when he was running for</v>

1689
00:48:37.211 --> 00:48:38.044
<v Speaker 4>office.</v>

1690
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to square his agenda while running that he talked to the people with</v>

1691
00:48:42.971 --> 00:48:44.710
<v Speaker 4>the people that were providing the money.</v>

1692
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 4>And so I think,</v>

1693
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.880
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe that has more to do with it than anything else.</v>

1694
00:48:48.881 --> 00:48:50.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're not getting grassroots.</v>

1695
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.980
<v Speaker 4>You don't have Abbie Hoffman running for president,</v>

1696
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:54.491
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1697
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:56.620
<v Speaker 4>And if he was in Goldman Sachs were backing him,</v>

1698
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling he'd do the same thing.</v>

1699
00:48:58.530 --> 00:48:58.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1700
00:48:58.711 --> 00:49:03.711
<v Speaker 1>His with the image that was being portrayed was like nothing we'd ever seen</v>

1701
00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:04.591
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1702
00:49:04.591 --> 00:49:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1703
00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:05.790
<v Speaker 1>oh okay.</v>

1704
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.380
<v Speaker 1>He actually is us.</v>

1705
00:49:07.381 --> 00:49:08.490
<v Speaker 1>He is the misfit.</v>

1706
00:49:08.491 --> 00:49:09.360
<v Speaker 1>He is America.</v>

1707
00:49:09.361 --> 00:49:10.920
<v Speaker 1>He is half black,</v>

1708
00:49:10.921 --> 00:49:11.790
<v Speaker 1>half white.</v>

1709
00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.040
<v Speaker 1>He is a raised by a single mom.</v>

1710
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:14.521
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>

1711
00:49:14.521 --> 00:49:14.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1712
00:49:14.791 --> 00:49:16.650
<v Speaker 1>not from a silver spoon background.</v>

1713
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a persons cannot understand the</v>

1714
00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 4>constitutional law scholar.</v>

1715
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Remember all those to see,</v>

1716
00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:24.520
<v Speaker 4>this is where the Obama administration really angers me.</v>

1717
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:29.290
<v Speaker 4>It's not unusual to have some president go off half cocked and do wild,</v>

1718
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:32.770
<v Speaker 4>crazy things like President Bush did after nine 11 in fact,</v>

1719
00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:33.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1720
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of for,</v>

1721
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 4>I kind of forgive those people a little bit because I think it's unrealistic to</v>

1722
00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:42.010
<v Speaker 4>expect us to have acted sane after nine 11 as a matter of fact,</v>

1723
00:49:42.011 --> 00:49:43.510
<v Speaker 4>I've often said if we were smart people,</v>

1724
00:49:43.511 --> 00:49:48.511
<v Speaker 4>we would put legislation in right now mandating a cooling off period after the</v>

1725
00:49:49.271 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 4>next nine 11 so we don't legislate while we're temporarily insane.</v>

1726
00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:56.500
<v Speaker 4>I think the fact we don't do that shows you that they'd like to legislate when</v>

1727
00:49:56.501 --> 00:49:57.490
<v Speaker 4>we're temporarily insane,</v>

1728
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:00.280
<v Speaker 4>but I think we were going to go crazy when that happened.</v>

1729
00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:05.520
<v Speaker 4>It's the responsibility of the next guy though to get us back on track because</v>

1730
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 4>if he doesn't,</v>

1731
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.880
<v Speaker 4>what was an anomaly becomes the new law of the land when Obama from the other</v>

1732
00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:17.740
<v Speaker 4>party running on a platform that he's going to fix the abuses of the previous</v>

1733
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:19.840
<v Speaker 4>administration instead codifies them.</v>

1734
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:21.640
<v Speaker 4>That's the new reality.</v>

1735
00:50:21.641 --> 00:50:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Now that's not an anomaly.</v>

1736
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.180
<v Speaker 4>That's not an administration before him.</v>

1737
00:50:25.181 --> 00:50:26.140
<v Speaker 4>That was just different.</v>

1738
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 4>This is new post nine</v>

1739
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 5>11 world with both parties on board.</v>

1740
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:34.760
<v Speaker 5>How much say do you believe he has and the day to day things?</v>

1741
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1742
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 5>how much say does he have in our foreign policy where we go,</v>

1743
00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:39.884
<v Speaker 5>what we do?</v>

1744
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:40.090
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1745
00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:43.070
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting because this gets back to a point we made earlier.</v>

1746
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1747
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.660
<v Speaker 5>more than normal because of that whole war time authority that we talked about</v>

1748
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:47.901
<v Speaker 5>earlier.</v>

1749
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:48.291
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1750
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 5>presidents have more authority in the realm of foreign policy anyway.</v>

1751
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.640
<v Speaker 5>That's always been considered.</v>

1752
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 5>The reason presidents like to dabble in foreign policies cause they have the</v>

1753
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:56.930
<v Speaker 5>most leeway there.</v>

1754
00:50:56.931 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 5>If they want to get into budgetary things domestically,</v>

1755
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 5>you start running into congressional roadblocks all the time.</v>

1756
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:02.360
<v Speaker 5>So presidents,</v>

1757
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 5>even when they're not foreign policy guys liked to do foreign policy stuff cause</v>

1758
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:09.590
<v Speaker 5>you can actually do stuff and the congress can't say much about it in war time.</v>

1759
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 5>This guy has got amazing authority.</v>

1760
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:15.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean imagine using those same rationales that they use anytime they want to do</v>

1761
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:19.220
<v Speaker 5>something with the war on terror but using them for something totally.</v>

1762
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:19.550
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1763
00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:22.820
<v Speaker 5>we're going to stop this budget impasse because we're in a war on terror and I</v>

1764
00:51:22.821 --> 00:51:24.740
<v Speaker 5>have supreme authority and I'm just going to do what I want to do.</v>

1765
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:26.360
<v Speaker 5>What would anybody say?</v>

1766
00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:30.560
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's talked about limiting extreme more time authority at all.</v>

1767
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.951
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1768
00:51:30.951 --> 00:51:31.940
<v Speaker 5>if the Republicans are going to say,</v>

1769
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:32.391
<v Speaker 5>well you know,</v>

1770
00:51:32.391 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 5>you can't do that in war time.</v>

1771
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:35.241
<v Speaker 5>Well Gosh,</v>

1772
00:51:35.241 --> 00:51:35.691
<v Speaker 5>it's nice.</v>

1773
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:36.321
<v Speaker 5>There's a line,</v>

1774
00:51:36.321 --> 00:51:36.700
<v Speaker 5>somebody,</v>

1775
00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.840
<v Speaker 5>somebody who's designated to limit to the powers,</v>

1776
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.921
<v Speaker 5>they don't do that.</v>

1777
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:41.520
<v Speaker 5>Now there's a book by um,</v>

1778
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.690
<v Speaker 5>a Yale constitutional law professor named Bruce Ackerman,</v>

1779
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:46.520
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called the fall of the American republic.</v>

1780
00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.010
<v Speaker 5>And it's a little too wonky for most people,</v>

1781
00:51:49.011 --> 00:51:52.730
<v Speaker 5>but what he's essentially done is target what he thinks is the fly in the</v>

1782
00:51:52.731 --> 00:51:53.120
<v Speaker 5>ointment.</v>

1783
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 5>In terms of of these laws,</v>

1784
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:57.140
<v Speaker 5>and it's the presidential office of legal counsel.</v>

1785
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:59.180
<v Speaker 5>It's essentially the president's lawyers.</v>

1786
00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 5>These were supposed to be people who could answer the president's question,</v>

1787
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 5>is this constitutional?</v>

1788
00:52:04.251 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 5>Is it not constitutional?</v>

1789
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:06.201
<v Speaker 5>Instead,</v>

1790
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:09.830
<v Speaker 5>it's become the kind of people who explained to the president how we can do</v>

1791
00:52:09.831 --> 00:52:10.221
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1792
00:52:10.221 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Speaker 5>That's who John you was.</v>

1793
00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:13.520
<v Speaker 5>He was one of these people with president would say,</v>

1794
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.120
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1795
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.510
<v Speaker 5>how do we do this and how do we justify it constitutionally?</v>

1796
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 5>And it was John used job to go find out how to do that,</v>

1797
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.230
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1798
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:26.120
<v Speaker 5>Every president has these guys and what what Ackerman was saying is by the time</v>

1799
00:52:26.121 --> 00:52:29.480
<v Speaker 5>the supreme court gets around to ruling on these things,</v>

1800
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:30.920
<v Speaker 5>it's often two,</v>

1801
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.940
<v Speaker 5>three terms.</v>

1802
00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 5>After that was first,</v>

1803
00:52:32.931 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 5>and it's been the law of the land for a long time.</v>

1804
00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:39.170
<v Speaker 5>Now imagine the Supreme Court ruling on something from 1994 and saying,</v>

1805
00:52:39.171 --> 00:52:41.150
<v Speaker 5>everything we've done since 94 is wrong.</v>

1806
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.470
<v Speaker 5>You have to overturn it all.</v>

1807
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:43.820
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't tend to happen.</v>

1808
00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.720
<v Speaker 5>And so the office of legal counsel can make these rulings and there the law of</v>

1809
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:50.240
<v Speaker 5>the land until they're challenged and overturned by a court.</v>

1810
00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Speaker 5>By the time the court sees that it's settled law,</v>

1811
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:57.920
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me we're in like a system that is,</v>

1812
00:52:57.921 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 5>it's like compared to the other day to an old car,</v>

1813
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.050
<v Speaker 5>it's like you can have a model t and keep changing the oil and keep fixing.</v>

1814
00:53:06.051 --> 00:53:09.080
<v Speaker 5>Things are in place in the parts and it kind of keep working.</v>

1815
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna require a lot of work,</v>

1816
00:53:10.581 --> 00:53:11.860
<v Speaker 5>but it will sort of get you where you go.</v>

1817
00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:12.441
<v Speaker 5>Got to go.</v>

1818
00:53:12.441 --> 00:53:16.730
<v Speaker 5>Or You could buy a brand new Cadillac and you're not going to have any fucking</v>

1819
00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:17.301
<v Speaker 5>problems at all.</v>

1820
00:53:17.301 --> 00:53:17.751
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>

1821
00:53:17.751 --> 00:53:18.770
<v Speaker 5>Because it's improved.</v>

1822
00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:19.880
<v Speaker 5>It's been redesigned.</v>

1823
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 5>They've got all the kinks out,</v>

1824
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:24.620
<v Speaker 5>fixed the flaws and designed a completely new thing.</v>

1825
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.670
<v Speaker 5>We don't have that in government.</v>

1826
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.340
<v Speaker 5>We have like this old patchwork government.</v>

1827
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.830
<v Speaker 5>We have this old Wah,</v>

1828
00:53:30.831 --> 00:53:31.260
<v Speaker 5>Wah,</v>

1829
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.110
<v Speaker 5>Wacky I imperfect sort of system.</v>

1830
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:34.591
<v Speaker 5>What am I?</v>

1831
00:53:34.591 --> 00:53:36.450
<v Speaker 5>Listeners brought up a point that that that I,</v>

1832
00:53:36.451 --> 00:53:37.380
<v Speaker 5>that I thought of before,</v>

1833
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:38.120
<v Speaker 5>but I'd forgotten.</v>

1834
00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 5>And when you think about it,</v>

1835
00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:39.691
<v Speaker 5>it's rather,</v>

1836
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:40.010
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1837
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.151
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1838
00:53:40.151 --> 00:53:40.984
<v Speaker 5>it's a good point.</v>

1839
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:41.371
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

1840
00:53:41.371 --> 00:53:42.204
<v Speaker 5>not just that,</v>

1841
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:45.540
<v Speaker 5>it's a government designed for a tiny country,</v>

1842
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:46.111
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1843
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:49.860
<v Speaker 5>a one on one with 13 colonies all on the east coast,</v>

1844
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:50.311
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1845
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:53.100
<v Speaker 5>relatively homogenous and the whole thing.</v>

1846
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 5>And you're expecting that same system to work now.</v>

1847
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.201
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1848
00:53:58.201 --> 00:54:00.030
<v Speaker 5>you had 13 million people then or something.</v>

1849
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:02.480
<v Speaker 5>You have 300 million now with airplanes.</v>

1850
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:03.340
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

1851
00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 5>Any Internet and globalization where we're dealing with all these other</v>

1852
00:54:06.961 --> 00:54:07.830
<v Speaker 5>countries in ways.</v>

1853
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:08.191
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1854
00:54:08.191 --> 00:54:11.610
<v Speaker 5>we used to have two really nice protective barriers,</v>

1855
00:54:11.611 --> 00:54:15.000
<v Speaker 5>the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that are not barriers at all now.</v>

1856
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.871
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

1857
00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:16.471
<v Speaker 5>so things,</v>

1858
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:16.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1859
00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 5>that sense you're expecting a system designed in a completely different set of</v>

1860
00:54:20.761 --> 00:54:22.800
<v Speaker 5>circumstances to adapt.</v>

1861
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:22.921
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1862
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 5>Thomas Jefferson said that that's why the constitution was built to be amended.</v>

1863
00:54:26.701 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 5>He said to expect a child to adjacent,</v>

1864
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:32.850
<v Speaker 5>to expect this constitution to work as we wrote it forever,</v>

1865
00:54:32.851 --> 00:54:36.300
<v Speaker 5>would be to expect a child to continue to wear the same suit of clothes as they</v>

1866
00:54:36.301 --> 00:54:37.134
<v Speaker 5>grow up.</v>

1867
00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:38.550
<v Speaker 5>But there's a limit,</v>

1868
00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:39.001
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1869
00:54:39.001 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean at a certain point you reach the stretching point maybe.</v>

1870
00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 5>And again if the legislators and all those people were really acting in our</v>

1871
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:47.754
<v Speaker 5>interests,</v>

1872
00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 5>maybe they could make it work.</v>

1873
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 5>But when you have them working at cross purposes from us on a lot of this stuff</v>

1874
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.980
<v Speaker 5>that's asking too much.</v>

1875
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.360
<v Speaker 5>That's systemic failure.</v>

1876
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.731
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1877
00:54:57.731 --> 00:54:58.200
<v Speaker 5>and when you,</v>

1878
00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:58.380
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1879
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:03.380
<v Speaker 5>you get situations like corporations having the ability to spend as much money</v>

1880
00:55:06.301 --> 00:55:08.810
<v Speaker 5>as they like on candidates where you,</v>

1881
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:13.840
<v Speaker 5>you have no restriction in how much money they can spend to influence someone</v>

1882
00:55:13.891 --> 00:55:14.940
<v Speaker 5>who gets into office.</v>

1883
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.730
<v Speaker 5>It's so transparent.</v>

1884
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 5>It's like how does that ever get to be the way we run things?</v>

1885
00:55:21.301 --> 00:55:25.200
<v Speaker 5>Cause it seems like that's the most obvious method of bribery ever.</v>

1886
00:55:25.201 --> 00:55:27.150
<v Speaker 5>Well there's another one because even if you got rid of that,</v>

1887
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:30.150
<v Speaker 5>how do you stop this revolving door that we see where they say,</v>

1888
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 5>listen man,</v>

1889
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.820
<v Speaker 5>don't worry about it when you get out of office.</v>

1890
00:55:32.821 --> 00:55:37.380
<v Speaker 5>We got a nice cushy job at this defense industry or whatever where you helped us</v>

1891
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:37.651
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1892
00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 5>We'll help you on the other side.</v>

1893
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:40.110
<v Speaker 5>You'll be a very rich person.</v>

1894
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:41.880
<v Speaker 5>We see that all the time.</v>

1895
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:42.810
<v Speaker 5>How do you stop that?</v>

1896
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.230
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear about the guy who was the head of Monsanto's now the head of the</v>

1897
00:55:46.231 --> 00:55:47.064
<v Speaker 5>FDA?</v>

1898
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:47.731
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1899
00:55:47.731 --> 00:55:48.390
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1900
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.541
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1901
00:55:48.541 --> 00:55:48.811
<v Speaker 5>Bama.</v>

1902
00:55:48.811 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 5>Just put another guy in the treasury department that works for like city group</v>

1903
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:53.310
<v Speaker 5>or something and you turn around and go,</v>

1904
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.730
<v Speaker 5>it bothers me less than he did it.</v>

1905
00:55:57.030 --> 00:56:00.960
<v Speaker 5>Then he doesn't mind that we saw he did it in and everything that's gone on.</v>

1906
00:56:00.961 --> 00:56:01.794
<v Speaker 5>I mean you don't even,</v>

1907
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.210
<v Speaker 5>that's when the gloves are off.</v>

1908
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.070
<v Speaker 5>We used to hide the corruption.</v>

1909
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:06.240
<v Speaker 5>Now it's so open.</v>

1910
00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 5>Nobody even cares and that that's when you've reached a tipping point,</v>

1911
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:09.820
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

1912
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1913
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.191
<v Speaker 5>that's ridiculous.</v>

1914
00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:11.581
<v Speaker 5>The open.</v>

1915
00:56:11.581 --> 00:56:15.330
<v Speaker 5>That's just hoping that there's so much going on all we just have to suck it up</v>

1916
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:15.751
<v Speaker 5>as people.</v>

1917
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 5>We have nothing we could do.</v>

1918
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:18.210
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>

1919
00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:18.751
<v Speaker 5>what are you going to do?</v>

1920
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:19.710
<v Speaker 5>Vote for Mitt Romney.</v>

1921
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:19.981
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1922
00:56:19.981 --> 00:56:20.850
<v Speaker 5>that's how it goes.</v>

1923
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1924
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.530
<v Speaker 5>Well that was hilarious.</v>

1925
00:56:22.531 --> 00:56:23.230
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1926
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.690
<v Speaker 5>what do you,</v>

1927
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 5>you want to call</v>

1928
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.510
<v Speaker 6>it member or you want the same?</v>

1929
00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:26.371
<v Speaker 6>I mean they,</v>

1930
00:56:26.371 --> 00:56:29.770
<v Speaker 6>they came up with one of the weirdest candidates ever.</v>

1931
00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.550
<v Speaker 6>A comp,</v>

1932
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:31.331
<v Speaker 6>a cult member,</v>

1933
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:35.140
<v Speaker 6>billionaire with obvious disdain for the lower class and the working class.</v>

1934
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.940
<v Speaker 4>And what do you know what,</v>

1935
00:56:36.941 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 4>when was the last time though?</v>

1936
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 4>I think that's almost a,</v>

1937
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:41.190
<v Speaker 4>but you want to talk about conspiracy theories that,</v>

1938
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 4>that Oliver Stone can do a movie about.</v>

1939
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:47.470
<v Speaker 4>How about how we end up with these kinds of elections were how often is it one</v>

1940
00:56:47.471 --> 00:56:51.030
<v Speaker 4>guy that you'd like to replace and another guy who's worse?</v>

1941
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1942
00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean you look at Bill Clinton,</v>

1943
00:56:52.661 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Bob Doll,</v>

1944
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:54.783
<v Speaker 4>you look at,</v>

1945
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.290
<v Speaker 4>I remember people forget this,</v>

1946
00:56:56.291 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 4>we've lionized and romanticized Reagan so much.</v>

1947
00:56:58.301 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 4>People forget that an 84 there's a lot of people that would have gotten rid of</v>

1948
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:01.721
<v Speaker 4>Reagan.</v>

1949
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 4>You remember who he ran against though?</v>

1950
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.450
<v Speaker 4>Walter Mondale.</v>

1951
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:05.411
<v Speaker 4>Talk about people.</v>

1952
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 4>You can imagine president.</v>

1953
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean this happens all the time.</v>

1954
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.150
<v Speaker 4>How about Nick Nixon?</v>

1955
00:57:10.151 --> 00:57:10.984
<v Speaker 4>Humphrey,</v>

1956
00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:11.411
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1957
00:57:11.411 --> 00:57:12.131
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>

1958
00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:12.580
<v Speaker 4>you look at these,</v>

1959
00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 4>these are not this,</v>

1960
00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:16.290
<v Speaker 4>this is like saying let's have a good game of a,</v>

1961
00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:20.530
<v Speaker 4>a paper view NFL and we'll put the patriots up against some college team.</v>

1962
00:57:20.531 --> 00:57:20.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1963
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:22.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not even competitive.</v>

1964
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:22.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1965
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a high school team there.</v>

1966
00:57:24.361 --> 00:57:26.490
<v Speaker 4>You got the Mitt Romney's.</v>

1967
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:28.121
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1968
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:28.470
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1969
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.240
<v Speaker 6>it is funny if you want to go crazy,</v>

1970
00:57:30.241 --> 00:57:31.890
<v Speaker 6>Alex Jones conspiratorial,</v>

1971
00:57:31.891 --> 00:57:35.010
<v Speaker 6>he sort of a design a roadmap.</v>

1972
00:57:35.011 --> 00:57:35.780
<v Speaker 6>How they've decided,</v>

1973
00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.290
<v Speaker 6>decided to keep certain presidents.</v>

1974
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.840
<v Speaker 6>They believe that that's one of the,</v>

1975
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.970
<v Speaker 6>that was one of the problems with Ross Perot.</v>

1976
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.230
<v Speaker 6>I said Ross Perot is how Bill Clinton got into office three way split.</v>

1977
00:57:46.231 --> 00:57:46.531
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1978
00:57:46.531 --> 00:57:49.200
<v Speaker 6>Because Ross Perot took away from George Herbert Walker.</v>

1979
00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:51.140
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

1980
00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.700
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I can see that.</v>

1981
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.800
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

1982
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.210
<v Speaker 6>But I remember a lot of people at the time,</v>

1983
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.600
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1984
00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.321
<v Speaker 6>thinking like,</v>

1985
00:57:57.321 --> 00:57:57.860
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

1986
00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:58.220
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1987
00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.540
<v Speaker 6>what are they going to do about this?</v>

1988
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.450
<v Speaker 4>Like he,</v>

1989
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:03.800
<v Speaker 4>this guy did the commission on presidential debates up the bar.</v>

1990
00:58:03.801 --> 00:58:04.680
<v Speaker 4>I always try to tell people,</v>

1991
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.100
<v Speaker 4>do you realize that the debates used to be run by the League of women voters?</v>

1992
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.690
<v Speaker 4>They got out of the Gig.</v>

1993
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:10.471
<v Speaker 4>And the late eighties,</v>

1994
00:58:10.471 --> 00:58:11.191
<v Speaker 4>because the,</v>

1995
00:58:11.191 --> 00:58:14.520
<v Speaker 4>the rules that the Democrats and Republicans wanted in terms of controlling the</v>

1996
00:58:14.521 --> 00:58:16.020
<v Speaker 4>debate and the questions and everything else.</v>

1997
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:16.891
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

1998
00:58:16.891 --> 00:58:18.900
<v Speaker 4>well we won't run a debate under those conditions.</v>

1999
00:58:18.901 --> 00:58:20.850
<v Speaker 4>And they expected the other side to back down.</v>

2000
00:58:20.851 --> 00:58:21.451
<v Speaker 4>And the other side,</v>

2001
00:58:21.451 --> 00:58:22.860
<v Speaker 4>which were the two parties instead said,</v>

2002
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:23.730
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>

2003
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:25.200
<v Speaker 4>we didn't want to deal with you guys anyway,</v>

2004
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:26.490
<v Speaker 4>we'll form our own commission,</v>

2005
00:58:26.491 --> 00:58:27.950
<v Speaker 4>will make up for members on it,</v>

2006
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:31.350
<v Speaker 4>will be Democrats for will be Republicans and we'll set the standard for where</v>

2007
00:58:31.351 --> 00:58:33.630
<v Speaker 4>non Democrats or Republicans can play a role.</v>

2008
00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:34.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2009
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Perot exceeded their original rules and he was able to get enough of the</v>

2010
00:58:38.311 --> 00:58:42.000
<v Speaker 4>population and involvement in rise enough in the polls because of his money.</v>

2011
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:42.833
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>

2012
00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:44.520
<v Speaker 4>to get in the debates.</v>

2013
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.500
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wanted him in the debates.</v>

2014
00:58:46.501 --> 00:58:47.170
<v Speaker 4>Nobody likes,</v>

2015
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:47.941
<v Speaker 4>I mean they sweated.</v>

2016
00:58:47.941 --> 00:58:51.780
<v Speaker 4>You remember it cause he brings up things that are bipartisan failures.</v>

2017
00:58:51.781 --> 00:58:53.790
<v Speaker 4>And this is the rule of the debates don't bring up.</v>

2018
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:56.670
<v Speaker 4>If the Democrats can't tell the Republicans,</v>

2019
00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2020
00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 4>or the Republicans can't tell the Democrats or blame them for something that</v>

2021
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:01.590
<v Speaker 4>they had nothing to do with.</v>

2022
00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:02.910
<v Speaker 4>We don't talk about it.</v>

2023
00:59:02.911 --> 00:59:03.271
<v Speaker 4>The debt,</v>

2024
00:59:03.271 --> 00:59:03.901
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2025
00:59:03.901 --> 00:59:05.280
<v Speaker 4>that was bit Perot's big issue.</v>

2026
00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.320
<v Speaker 4>That's a bipartisan creation.</v>

2027
00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.660
<v Speaker 4>So the two parties had no reason to bring that up.</v>

2028
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.550
<v Speaker 4>You throw the third guy in there though.</v>

2029
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.001
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2030
00:59:12.001 --> 00:59:14.970
<v Speaker 4>he's going to make everybody sweat because nobody has a good answer for</v>

2031
00:59:14.971 --> 00:59:16.110
<v Speaker 4>bipartisan failures.</v>

2032
00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 4>So after parole crash,</v>

2033
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:18.691
<v Speaker 4>the debates,</v>

2034
00:59:18.691 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 4>the commission on presidential debates upped the rules for</v>

2035
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 5>inclusion and I went back and did the history of it.</v>

2036
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Speaker 5>Do you realize that there's never been a candidate in American politics from any</v>

2037
00:59:29.001 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 5>third party or independent that's ever come anywhere near their current bar that</v>

2038
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 5>they've said?</v>

2039
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:34.251
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2040
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:38.780
<v Speaker 5>Teddy Roosevelt ran as a third party candidate from the Bull Moose party after</v>

2041
00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:40.520
<v Speaker 5>he'd already been president.</v>

2042
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:40.791
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2043
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:44.300
<v Speaker 5>A very popular president running against two people that nobody wanted.</v>

2044
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:49.110
<v Speaker 5>He wouldn't have reached the benchmark to be included in the modern presidential</v>

2045
00:59:49.111 --> 00:59:49.310
<v Speaker 5>third.</v>

2046
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:49.580
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2047
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.170
<v Speaker 5>you're never going to have a third party person,</v>

2048
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:51.561
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

2049
00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 5>it's 15% they raised it to write more than that.</v>

2050
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 5>You have to raise a certain amount of money.</v>

2051
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.720
<v Speaker 5>You have to reach certain polls,</v>

2052
00:59:56.721 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 5>standards in a number of different polls,</v>

2053
00:59:59.300 --> 00:59:59.901
<v Speaker 5>and you have to,</v>

2054
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:01.340
<v Speaker 5>there's a name recognition thing.</v>

2055
01:00:01.341 --> 01:00:01.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2056
01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.530
<v Speaker 5>it's a whole list of criteria in that hilarious name recognition.</v>

2057
01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:05.721
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2058
01:00:05.721 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 5>Before the debates is where you get the name recognition.</v>

2059
01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:08.540
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

2060
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.440
<v Speaker 5>Really quite cute.</v>

2061
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:09.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2062
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm Gary Johnson.</v>

2063
01:00:10.821 --> 01:00:11.600
<v Speaker 5>Never had a chance.</v>

2064
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2065
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.890
<v Speaker 5>among other people.</v>

2066
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:13.251
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2067
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:13.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2068
01:00:13.461 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2069
01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:14.540
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

2070
01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.070
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to get a very rich,</v>

2071
01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:16.904
<v Speaker 5>handsome,</v>

2072
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.840
<v Speaker 5>famous person to run and they're going to still have to have all the breaks go</v>

2073
01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:21.171
<v Speaker 5>their way.</v>

2074
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:23.840
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna have to be running against Walter Mondale and Bob Dole.</v>

2075
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:27.710
<v Speaker 5>So essentially they've legally slapped it down to a two party system.</v>

2076
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.180
<v Speaker 5>There really is no third parties.</v>

2077
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:32.720
<v Speaker 5>What I like about it is I liked how they both act as though it's in the</v>

2078
01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:34.070
<v Speaker 5>constitution somewhere.</v>

2079
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.480
<v Speaker 5>While we have a two party system.</v>

2080
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.811
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2081
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:36.231
<v Speaker 5>we don't.</v>

2082
01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:37.070
<v Speaker 5>Where'd you find that?</v>

2083
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

2084
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.420
<v Speaker 5>that's a little propaganda from the two party.</v>

2085
01:00:39.421 --> 01:00:40.850
<v Speaker 5>We don't have in any party system.</v>

2086
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.560
<v Speaker 5>The founders hated party,</v>

2087
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:44.900
<v Speaker 5>they called him factions and they hated it.</v>

2088
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.550
<v Speaker 5>And it was like a generation later.</v>

2089
01:00:46.551 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 5>There we are.</v>

2090
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:47.301
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2091
01:00:47.301 --> 01:00:51.980
<v Speaker 5>when you have an issue like Bush to Obama where you not only do you see very</v>

2092
01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:55.670
<v Speaker 5>little change and how we operate same foreign policy almost exactly.</v>

2093
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:55.971
<v Speaker 5>Almost.</v>

2094
01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:56.804
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2095
01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.330
<v Speaker 5>But what is it then?</v>

2096
01:00:59.331 --> 01:00:59.930
<v Speaker 5>What are you,</v>

2097
01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:01.640
<v Speaker 5>where's the change?</v>

2098
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.200
<v Speaker 5>Where's the change and where's the hope?</v>

2099
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:06.230
<v Speaker 5>And if there's only two parties and you're both being funded by the same</v>

2100
01:01:06.231 --> 01:01:08.180
<v Speaker 5>gigantic corporations and banks,</v>

2101
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.343
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

2102
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.030
<v Speaker 5>Like what really has happened here?</v>

2103
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:15.680
<v Speaker 5>The late Gore Vidal said we have one party in this country with two wings that</v>

2104
01:01:15.681 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 5>represents 4% of the population.</v>

2105
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:18.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean that might be,</v>

2106
01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:19.910
<v Speaker 5>it might be a little extreme,</v>

2107
01:01:19.911 --> 01:01:20.041
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2108
01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:21.650
<v Speaker 5>but you start to see that way.</v>

2109
01:01:21.651 --> 01:01:21.801
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2110
01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:26.801
<v Speaker 5>especially when you compare what we consider to be left and right to say Europe</v>

2111
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:27.591
<v Speaker 5>for example.</v>

2112
01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:28.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2113
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.431
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

2114
01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:31.010
<v Speaker 5>our Republicans are to the right of anything.</v>

2115
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:31.581
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2116
01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 5>almost there's a few fascist parties in real weirdos in Europe.</v>

2117
01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 5>But we're to the right of anything like that and our Democrats are to the right</v>

2118
01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:38.990
<v Speaker 5>of most of their parties too.</v>

2119
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:40.250
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2120
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.083
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2121
01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 5>I have this conversation with a good buddy of mine,</v>

2122
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:48.200
<v Speaker 5>Brian Callen all the time when we talk about how crazy the world is today,</v>

2123
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:51.080
<v Speaker 5>but yet the greatest time to live ever.</v>

2124
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 5>The safest time to live ever.</v>

2125
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.380
<v Speaker 5>The most prosperous time,</v>

2126
01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:54.930
<v Speaker 5>the most.</v>

2127
01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:57.980
<v Speaker 5>We're most technologically advanced time.</v>

2128
01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.060
<v Speaker 5>When you look at today in comparison to a thousand years ago,</v>

2129
01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:03.110
<v Speaker 5>how brutal life was,</v>

2130
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:03.531
<v Speaker 5>or Geez,</v>

2131
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:04.400
<v Speaker 5>even a few hundred.</v>

2132
01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:04.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2133
01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 5>Where would you want to go back to?</v>

2134
01:02:05.841 --> 01:02:08.360
<v Speaker 5>The dentistry alone would keep you in the modern day.</v>

2135
01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:08.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2136
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:09.501
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>

2137
01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:14.501
<v Speaker 5>we have just this amazing potential as we stand today with our technological</v>

2138
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:15.951
<v Speaker 5>abilities,</v>

2139
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:19.100
<v Speaker 5>our internet connections are ability to exchange information.</v>

2140
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 5>We</v>

2141
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 6>see hobbled only by our representation.</v>

2142
01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.870
<v Speaker 6>It really does seem to be,</v>

2143
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 6>if you look at how advanced medicine is today,</v>

2144
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 6>if you look at how advanced sciences,</v>

2145
01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:33.870
<v Speaker 6>the incredible innovations that are coming out every day,</v>

2146
01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 6>the one place where we're disappointing is in our representation.</v>

2147
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:38.260
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2148
01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.400
<v Speaker 4>courage to me as you say that,</v>

2149
01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:40.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2150
01:02:40.721 --> 01:02:41.081
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

2151
01:02:41.081 --> 01:02:42.370
<v Speaker 4>maybe you and I and,</v>

2152
01:02:42.371 --> 01:02:45.820
<v Speaker 4>and the people who think like us are weird sort of minority.</v>

2153
01:02:45.821 --> 01:02:46.420
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you could,</v>

2154
01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.330
<v Speaker 4>you could come up with this idea and like I'm fleshing this out as we talk,</v>

2155
01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:52.990
<v Speaker 4>but I mean maybe there's a way to look at this outside our comfort zone where</v>

2156
01:02:52.991 --> 01:02:53.890
<v Speaker 4>people might say,</v>

2157
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2158
01:02:54.101 --> 01:02:56.220
<v Speaker 4>if all you do is play video games every day you go to Uta,</v>

2159
01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.453
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>

2160
01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.450
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they would say,</v>

2161
01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.350
<v Speaker 4>well listen,</v>

2162
01:02:59.350 --> 01:02:59.861
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2163
01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:03.850
<v Speaker 4>why do I care about the fact that the government's corrupt and why do I care</v>

2164
01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:04.870
<v Speaker 4>that all of these things are going on?</v>

2165
01:03:04.871 --> 01:03:05.950
<v Speaker 4>And why do I care about drones?</v>

2166
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.210
<v Speaker 4>What does it matter to me?</v>

2167
01:03:07.211 --> 01:03:09.580
<v Speaker 4>I have the best life anybody's ever had in all history.</v>

2168
01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.780
<v Speaker 4>What am I missing?</v>

2169
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.290
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's where you get into these arguments that we make about</v>

2170
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.190
<v Speaker 4>slippery slopes.</v>

2171
01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:15.401
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2172
01:03:15.401 --> 01:03:15.821
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2173
01:03:15.821 --> 01:03:17.110
<v Speaker 4>just cause you're happy today.</v>

2174
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2175
01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:21.430
<v Speaker 4>wait until a video game players who download games without permission or struck</v>

2176
01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:22.031
<v Speaker 4>by drones.</v>

2177
01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:22.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2178
01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:22.950
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2179
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.960
<v Speaker 4>so I guess maybe there's a way to look at it that there might be a lot of</v>

2180
01:03:25.961 --> 01:03:26.351
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2181
01:03:26.351 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2182
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:27.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2183
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.860
<v Speaker 4>brave new world territory that don't care.</v>

2184
01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.100
<v Speaker 4>There was certainly are,</v>

2185
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I have my medical marijuana,</v>

2186
01:03:33.401 --> 01:03:34.780
<v Speaker 4>I have my video games.</v>

2187
01:03:34.781 --> 01:03:34.991
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2188
01:03:34.991 --> 01:03:35.231
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2189
01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:35.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2190
01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:36.460
<v Speaker 4>I have my days off,</v>

2191
01:03:36.461 --> 01:03:38.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm on my disability payments and who cares?</v>

2192
01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:41.830
<v Speaker 6>That's I think what infuriates people about the whole hipster attitude.</v>

2193
01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:44.770
<v Speaker 6>That's what infuriates people about the attitude.</v>

2194
01:03:44.771 --> 01:03:44.921
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2195
01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:45.611
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

2196
01:03:45.611 --> 01:03:46.361
<v Speaker 6>who cares?</v>

2197
01:03:46.361 --> 01:03:46.990
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

2198
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.351
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2199
01:03:47.351 --> 01:03:48.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm here for me.</v>

2200
01:03:48.221 --> 01:03:49.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't care about what's going on.</v>

2201
01:03:49.481 --> 01:03:50.140
<v Speaker 6>Whatever.</v>

2202
01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.430
<v Speaker 6>Am I going to fix China?</v>

2203
01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:53.230
<v Speaker 6>Am I going to Afghanistan?</v>

2204
01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:53.660
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2205
01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.790
<v Speaker 6>my own problems were with,</v>

2206
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.030
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't born into a society of the day I created myself.</v>

2207
01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:59.110
<v Speaker 6>It already existed.</v>

2208
01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:00.340
<v Speaker 6>I'll just move forward.</v>

2209
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.980
<v Speaker 6>But I think as human beings,</v>

2210
01:04:02.981 --> 01:04:07.300
<v Speaker 6>we all ultimately realized that we're in this together and that a lot of people</v>

2211
01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:12.301
<v Speaker 6>had to exist before us that had the better good of mankind in mind when they</v>

2212
01:04:12.401 --> 01:04:14.350
<v Speaker 6>developed computer chips,</v>

2213
01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.700
<v Speaker 6>when they develop TVs,</v>

2214
01:04:15.701 --> 01:04:16.840
<v Speaker 6>when they develop cars,</v>

2215
01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.160
<v Speaker 6>we didn't develop anything.</v>

2216
01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.780
<v Speaker 6>We just sort of stumbled on.</v>

2217
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:22.090
<v Speaker 6>It's our job to do the same thing,</v>

2218
01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:25.750
<v Speaker 6>to continue innovating as those before us have innovated in every way.</v>

2219
01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:27.460
<v Speaker 6>Whether it's socially,</v>

2220
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.510
<v Speaker 6>technologically,</v>

2221
01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:29.470
<v Speaker 6>or governmentally.</v>

2222
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:29.950
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

2223
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:30.290
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

2224
01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:34.900
<v Speaker 6>we haven't governmentally it's The r one area where we've really stalled.</v>

2225
01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:38.920
<v Speaker 6>We really have in fact slipped backwards and to a,</v>

2226
01:04:38.921 --> 01:04:41.470
<v Speaker 6>a goofy your system cause it's more transparent.</v>

2227
01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.520
<v Speaker 6>People are more upset than ever and still government operates the same way.</v>

2228
01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:47.530
<v Speaker 6>When we saw the bailouts,</v>

2229
01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:51.250
<v Speaker 6>and I remember there was a speech where Obama gave where he said he was limiting</v>

2230
01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:53.710
<v Speaker 6>the bonuses of the CEOs to like,</v>

2231
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:56.140
<v Speaker 6>I was like a half a million dollars and a,</v>

2232
01:04:56.141 --> 01:04:56.591
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2233
01:04:56.591 --> 01:04:58.210
<v Speaker 6>this is the craziest,</v>

2234
01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:02.230
<v Speaker 6>you're watching robbery take place right before your eyes.</v>

2235
01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:05.530
<v Speaker 6>And this guy who's the representative of the people,</v>

2236
01:05:05.531 --> 01:05:09.490
<v Speaker 6>this Obama character is letting you know they're only going to rob a half a</v>

2237
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:10.240
<v Speaker 6>million dollars each.</v>

2238
01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:10.540
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2239
01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:10.961
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2240
01:05:10.961 --> 01:05:11.231
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2241
01:05:11.231 --> 01:05:12.580
<v Speaker 6>their company failed.</v>

2242
01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:17.610
<v Speaker 6>But see they have a contract and even though the bank didn't they all their</v>

2243
01:05:17.721 --> 01:05:18.080
<v Speaker 6>money,</v>

2244
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:18.990
<v Speaker 4>that guy gets money.</v>

2245
01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:20.570
<v Speaker 4>Money is money.</v>

2246
01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 4>Money is I think what,</v>

2247
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:22.221
<v Speaker 4>what when we just,</v>

2248
01:05:22.221 --> 01:05:22.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2249
01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.470
<v Speaker 4>my little fly in the ointment of this idea I had,</v>

2250
01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.370
<v Speaker 4>I think the fact that it's going to be very hard for a lot of Americans to make</v>

2251
01:05:28.371 --> 01:05:32.780
<v Speaker 4>a decent living is the most likely thing to prompt change.</v>

2252
01:05:32.781 --> 01:05:34.970
<v Speaker 4>I remember in the 1990s and I was doing my radio show,</v>

2253
01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.260
<v Speaker 4>I was the worst radio show host in the world for for the times cause like I was</v>

2254
01:05:39.261 --> 01:05:43.190
<v Speaker 4>on the station that had like these conservative stereotypical radio hosts all</v>

2255
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.400
<v Speaker 4>day long.</v>

2256
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.580
<v Speaker 4>And then right in the middle of the day part it was me and I didn't fit any of</v>

2257
01:05:46.581 --> 01:05:46.851
<v Speaker 4>these things.</v>

2258
01:05:46.851 --> 01:05:50.060
<v Speaker 4>So I fought with the audience all day long because they were these hold overs</v>

2259
01:05:50.061 --> 01:05:51.320
<v Speaker 4>from the other conservative shows.</v>

2260
01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.270
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm screaming and yelling about,</v>

2261
01:05:53.271 --> 01:05:53.451
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2262
01:05:53.451 --> 01:05:54.380
<v Speaker 4>when are you going to get out of the streets?</v>

2263
01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.120
<v Speaker 4>When are you going to do something?</v>

2264
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.320
<v Speaker 4>Some guy called me up and said something very prophetic.</v>

2265
01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:58.370
<v Speaker 4>I thought about it many times.</v>

2266
01:05:58.371 --> 01:05:59.204
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2267
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:03.020
<v Speaker 4>people aren't going to go out and face the bay and nets while they're able to</v>

2268
01:06:03.021 --> 01:06:06.410
<v Speaker 4>pay their bills and they have the food they want and they can give their kids a</v>

2269
01:06:06.411 --> 01:06:07.670
<v Speaker 4>halfway decent life.</v>

2270
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:09.890
<v Speaker 4>He said when that changes,</v>

2271
01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.330
<v Speaker 4>everything else will too,</v>

2272
01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.220
<v Speaker 4>and you sit there and think about what,</v>

2273
01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:16.660
<v Speaker 4>what's happened to middle class jobs in this country.</v>

2274
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:17.990
<v Speaker 4>The so called middle class jobs,</v>

2275
01:06:17.991 --> 01:06:20.570
<v Speaker 4>it's a combination of changes in trade deals,</v>

2276
01:06:20.571 --> 01:06:21.560
<v Speaker 4>which we all know about,</v>

2277
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:23.090
<v Speaker 4>but also automation,</v>

2278
01:06:23.091 --> 01:06:25.100
<v Speaker 4>which has gotten rid of a lot of jobs that the Av,</v>

2279
01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.650
<v Speaker 4>I always talk about them as the average joes and Janes,</v>

2280
01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:32.060
<v Speaker 4>people that don't have really high expectations but they want to work.</v>

2281
01:06:32.061 --> 01:06:35.480
<v Speaker 4>They'll go to work and they raise a family and maybe save up for college and you</v>

2282
01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.320
<v Speaker 4>just make it work.</v>

2283
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.400
<v Speaker 4>A little shell game here and there,</v>

2284
01:06:37.401 --> 01:06:38.420
<v Speaker 4>but just a decent life.</v>

2285
01:06:38.421 --> 01:06:39.740
<v Speaker 4>That's the American dream,</v>

2286
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2287
01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.880
<v Speaker 4>You take that away and maybe,</v>

2288
01:06:43.881 --> 01:06:45.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean when those video game,</v>

2289
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:50.350
<v Speaker 4>medicinal marijuana smoking hipster people can't pay the bills and get evicted.</v>

2290
01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:54.410
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's the kind of wakeup call that changes their belief system.</v>

2291
01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:56.990
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that's where you say we live in the greatest time ever.</v>

2292
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2293
01:06:58.011 --> 01:07:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're a black person in prison because they caught you with a little</v>

2294
01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:02.540
<v Speaker 4>cocaine or maybe less.</v>

2295
01:07:02.541 --> 01:07:05.360
<v Speaker 4>You're some guy that just got evicted and your house is under water.</v>

2296
01:07:05.361 --> 01:07:08.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean those are the things that all of a sudden make you and when you have</v>

2297
01:07:08.631 --> 01:07:09.291
<v Speaker 4>enough of those people,</v>

2298
01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:11.930
<v Speaker 4>because nobody cares if it's 1% of the population,</v>

2299
01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:16.550
<v Speaker 4>if 40% of the population dropped from what was the middle class into the lower</v>

2300
01:07:16.551 --> 01:07:17.384
<v Speaker 4>class,</v>

2301
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:22.130
<v Speaker 4>I think agitation hits an a level that you and I in our lifetimes haven't seen.</v>

2302
01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:22.431
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2303
01:07:22.431 --> 01:07:23.750
<v Speaker 4>I think it's at a level now.</v>

2304
01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:24.610
<v Speaker 4>I think it's on the way.</v>

2305
01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:25.031
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:26.560
<v Speaker 6>Where we've never seen before.</v>

2307
01:07:26.561 --> 01:07:28.280
<v Speaker 6>And that's one of the things that I was alluding to when,</v>

2308
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:31.960
<v Speaker 6>where it's what I was talking earlier about the desire to understand history.</v>

2309
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.050
<v Speaker 6>I think that more people today,</v>

2310
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:38.110
<v Speaker 6>and at least the conversations that I'm having based on my own personal</v>

2311
01:07:38.111 --> 01:07:38.920
<v Speaker 6>experiences,</v>

2312
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.820
<v Speaker 6>more people are concerned with talking about the corruptions of the past.</v>

2313
01:07:42.821 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 6>And why shouldn't we be surprised or why should we be surprised?</v>

2314
01:07:47.381 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 6>There's so much fucked up shit going on in politics today.</v>

2315
01:07:49.481 --> 01:07:49.870
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2316
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:50.920
<v Speaker 6>did you know this?</v>

2317
01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:51.491
<v Speaker 6>Did you know that?</v>

2318
01:07:51.491 --> 01:07:52.324
<v Speaker 6>Like it's like,</v>

2319
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:55.390
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a lot of people that are trying to figure out how the hell we</v>

2320
01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:55.700
<v Speaker 6>got,</v>

2321
01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:55.870
<v Speaker 6>so</v>

2322
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:56.381
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2323
01:07:56.381 --> 01:07:58.570
<v Speaker 4>you know what I was gonna you just took the words out of my mouth.</v>

2324
01:07:58.571 --> 01:08:01.150
<v Speaker 4>The reason history is important because it tells you how we got here.</v>

2325
01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:01.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2326
01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:02.050
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

2327
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:03.010
<v Speaker 4>I had a teacher wants to said,</v>

2328
01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:03.350
<v Speaker 4>look you,</v>

2329
01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:06.400
<v Speaker 4>you joined a soap opera and you watch the soap opera and you're going,</v>

2330
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.270
<v Speaker 4>who the hell is that?</v>

2331
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.451
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2332
01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Why are they mad at her and what?</v>

2333
01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Who screwed who?</v>

2334
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:10.121
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2335
01:08:10.121 --> 01:08:11.290
<v Speaker 4>that's what history teaches you.</v>

2336
01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:12.400
<v Speaker 4>It gives you context.</v>

2337
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:13.510
<v Speaker 4>You can understand the now.</v>

2338
01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:13.900
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2339
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 6>I think are the founding obviously</v>

2340
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 5>had some awesome ideas and then we're brilliant men and they were very well</v>

2341
01:08:19.821 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 5>schooled,</v>

2342
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:25.390
<v Speaker 5>but you can't possibly ask people from 1776 to figure out a way that's going to</v>

2343
01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:28.450
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2344
01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 5>You're going to govern people that exist in a time.</v>

2345
01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:36.310
<v Speaker 5>You could even possibly imagine the first people to say,</v>

2346
01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:36.720
<v Speaker 5>absolutely,</v>

2347
01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.553
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

2348
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:38.241
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>

2349
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:38.421
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2350
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:41.820
<v Speaker 5>I gave it to you to take care of where are the whys high day,</v>

2351
01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 5>where autopilot,</v>

2352
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 5>where are the wise men of today that step forth and and and and make sense of</v>

2353
01:08:47.571 --> 01:08:50.890
<v Speaker 5>the situation without need for you,</v>

2354
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:51.950
<v Speaker 5>with or without greed,</v>

2355
01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:53.090
<v Speaker 5>without corruption,</v>

2356
01:08:53.091 --> 01:08:53.301
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

2357
01:08:53.301 --> 01:08:53.720
<v Speaker 5>where are,</v>

2358
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.290
<v Speaker 5>where are they?</v>

2359
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:58.580
<v Speaker 5>Let me piggyback on that because I've thought about that to look at the 1960s</v>

2360
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:00.200
<v Speaker 5>which ha whatever you may have thought about.</v>

2361
01:09:00.201 --> 01:09:02.780
<v Speaker 5>It was a period of change in whatever direction.</v>

2362
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:07.760
<v Speaker 5>Look at how many people you can still name if you have any knowledge at all that</v>

2363
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:10.610
<v Speaker 5>were leading their own segments of movements one way or the other.</v>

2364
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:11.960
<v Speaker 5>They had tons of people.</v>

2365
01:09:11.961 --> 01:09:14.360
<v Speaker 5>Whether you want to talk about civil rights in the Martin Luther kings and the</v>

2366
01:09:14.361 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 5>Malcolm x is whether you want to talk about the yippies and all that.</v>

2367
01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:18.014
<v Speaker 5>What do you want to talk about?</v>

2368
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:22.550
<v Speaker 5>Everything had these people that step forward that are on your Wikipedia page.</v>

2369
01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:23.384
<v Speaker 5>If you want to go look up,</v>

2370
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 5>who the hell does that today?</v>

2371
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:30.610
<v Speaker 5>Can you name two people who are out front as political,</v>

2372
01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:31.041
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2373
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:31.874
<v Speaker 5>outside,</v>

2374
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.020
<v Speaker 5>outside politics,</v>

2375
01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 5>but people who lead movements and I can't,</v>

2376
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.330
<v Speaker 5>they've done an awesome job of marginalizing those people.</v>

2377
01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:44.030
<v Speaker 5>The government's way better at preventing a Martin Luther King today.</v>

2378
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:44.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2379
01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:44.991
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2380
01:09:44.991 --> 01:09:45.321
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2381
01:09:45.321 --> 01:09:49.310
<v Speaker 5>today you have your obvious race baiters like Jesse Jackson and you know,</v>

2382
01:09:49.311 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>

2383
01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.391
<v Speaker 5>that goes back.</v>

2384
01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:50.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2385
01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:51.650
<v Speaker 5>is he still around?</v>

2386
01:09:51.651 --> 01:09:51.891
<v Speaker 5>And I mean,</v>

2387
01:09:51.891 --> 01:09:53.180
<v Speaker 5>that's when I was in college.</v>

2388
01:09:53.181 --> 01:09:53.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2389
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.811
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2390
01:09:53.811 --> 01:09:57.260
<v Speaker 5>constantly and constantly getting called out for what he's doing with</v>

2391
01:09:57.261 --> 01:10:00.290
<v Speaker 5>corporations and forcing them to pay enormous sums of money.</v>

2392
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:03.020
<v Speaker 5>And he goes in for a racial education,</v>

2393
01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.610
<v Speaker 5>teaches people whenever they say,</v>

2394
01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:04.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2395
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:07.430
<v Speaker 5>essentially what he does is he finds someone who's done something,</v>

2396
01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:11.660
<v Speaker 5>either that could be racially distasteful or said something that's out of line,</v>

2397
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:13.130
<v Speaker 5>even in a joke.</v>

2398
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 5>And they go in and they blackmail him.</v>

2399
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:15.920
<v Speaker 5>But that's not a leader.</v>

2400
01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:18.080
<v Speaker 5>That's just somebody who found their own little scam.</v>

2401
01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:18.501
<v Speaker 5>Who else?</v>

2402
01:10:18.501 --> 01:10:19.190
<v Speaker 5>Al Sharpton.</v>

2403
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:20.200
<v Speaker 5>Even worse guy.</v>

2404
01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:23.510
<v Speaker 5>He started his whole career off with a fake rape case.</v>

2405
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.190
<v Speaker 5>You know that Tijuana Brawley.</v>

2406
01:10:25.191 --> 01:10:25.501
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:10:25.501 --> 01:10:26.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:26.840
<v Speaker 5>So that's,</v>

2409
01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:27.601
<v Speaker 5>that's your,</v>

2410
01:10:27.601 --> 01:10:27.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2411
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:29.450
<v Speaker 5>that's what they allow.</v>

2412
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.600
<v Speaker 5>They allow the most preposterous to exist.</v>

2413
01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.300
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

2414
01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:36.080
<v Speaker 5>those don't represent any of those kinds of people from the 60s who legitimately</v>

2415
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:36.914
<v Speaker 5>believed.</v>

2416
01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:37.670
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2417
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:38.870
<v Speaker 5>and that's what's missing.</v>

2418
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:42.830
<v Speaker 5>And maybe you think it's because we're cynical or it's our generation.</v>

2419
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.191
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2420
01:10:43.191 --> 01:10:43.490
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2421
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:45.140
<v Speaker 5>you and I are about the same age we come.</v>

2422
01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:46.460
<v Speaker 5>Remember we were generation axe,</v>

2423
01:10:46.461 --> 01:10:47.480
<v Speaker 5>you're a bunch of slackers.</v>

2424
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:48.410
<v Speaker 5>And everybody was like,</v>

2425
01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:49.011
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2426
01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:49.311
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2427
01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:50.660
<v Speaker 5>look of what this generation is going to be.</v>

2428
01:10:50.661 --> 01:10:51.530
<v Speaker 5>And the funny thing is,</v>

2429
01:10:51.531 --> 01:10:53.750
<v Speaker 5>I think compared to generations after us,</v>

2430
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.890
<v Speaker 5>we look good.</v>

2431
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:56.000
<v Speaker 5>So what does that mean?</v>

2432
01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:57.290
<v Speaker 5>If we're the slacker generation,</v>

2433
01:10:57.291 --> 01:10:58.310
<v Speaker 5>the people that came after us,</v>

2434
01:10:58.311 --> 01:10:59.000
<v Speaker 5>or even more than,</v>

2435
01:10:59.000 --> 01:10:59.833
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2436
01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 5>are we reaping what we saw or oh,</v>

2437
01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:04.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm not so happy with what the baby boomers did.</v>

2438
01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:05.090
<v Speaker 5>So who knows how that,</v>

2439
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:05.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2440
01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:10.860
<v Speaker 5>I think that this generation that's growing up today have this insane advantage</v>

2441
01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:12.360
<v Speaker 5>of the Internet from birth.</v>

2442
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.651
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2443
01:11:12.651 --> 01:11:13.380
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>

2444
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:15.900
<v Speaker 5>Imagine what those sixties people would have done with the Internet.</v>

2445
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.621
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2446
01:11:16.621 --> 01:11:16.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2447
01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 5>w one of the things about the sixties it's such a Trevon for so hard for people</v>

2448
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:25.140
<v Speaker 5>to wrap their head around it was that it was only 20 years after Hitler.</v>

2449
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.210
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

2450
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:28.223
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>

2451
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:29.940
<v Speaker 5>when you put that in your head,</v>

2452
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean 20 years ago was what,</v>

2453
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.380
<v Speaker 5>nineties I do this all the time.</v>

2454
01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:34.990
<v Speaker 5>It's funny you say that.</v>

2455
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:39.810
<v Speaker 5>I remember I'm born in 65 that's 20 years after the Second World War.</v>

2456
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:45.170
<v Speaker 5>20 years ago I was at ABC overhearing down ABC News.</v>

2457
01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:46.591
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2458
01:11:46.591 --> 01:11:48.900
<v Speaker 5>God hears is nothing anymore.</v>

2459
01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:49.890
<v Speaker 5>That's Seinfeld.</v>

2460
01:11:49.891 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 5>Seinfeld was on the air in 93 right.</v>

2461
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.711
<v Speaker 5>So think about that.</v>

2462
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 5>That's so recent.</v>

2463
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:55.080
<v Speaker 5>That's the Holocaust.</v>

2464
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:56.290
<v Speaker 5>That is amazing.</v>

2465
01:11:56.290 --> 01:12:01.290
<v Speaker 5>So the people that lived in the sixties were dealing with such a strange time,</v>

2466
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:03.121
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

2467
01:12:03.121 --> 01:12:07.770
<v Speaker 5>the introduction of psychedelic drugs into the community that had never existed</v>

2468
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:08.100
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

2469
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:08.310
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2470
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:12.030
<v Speaker 5>LSD and the proliferation or did in the late fifties with Huxley and those</v>

2471
01:12:12.031 --> 01:12:12.870
<v Speaker 5>people and then and the,</v>

2472
01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:14.340
<v Speaker 5>and the Kero acts and all that,</v>

2473
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:15.870
<v Speaker 5>and then burst into mainstream.</v>

2474
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 5>And unbeknownst to most folks,</v>

2475
01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 5>even though marijuana has been illegal in this country since the 1930s LSD</v>

2476
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:26.850
<v Speaker 5>didn't become illegal until 1970 they pass this sweeping schedule,</v>

2477
01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:29.160
<v Speaker 5>one psychedelic act where they,</v>

2478
01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:32.250
<v Speaker 5>they made everything from pod to mushrooms,</v>

2479
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.870
<v Speaker 5>all these different sacramental and few gins.</v>

2480
01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 5>They made them all illegal.</v>

2481
01:12:38.131 --> 01:12:41.790
<v Speaker 5>They made them illegal then cause that was the first time law enforcement around</v>

2482
01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:42.211
<v Speaker 5>the country.</v>

2483
01:12:42.211 --> 01:12:45.390
<v Speaker 5>It was running into widespread problems with it and they didn't know.</v>

2484
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:48.840
<v Speaker 5>There's a great drag net from the old drag nets that are so funny to watch.</v>

2485
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.861
<v Speaker 5>The one,</v>

2486
01:12:49.861 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 5>the one with blue boy,</v>

2487
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:53.100
<v Speaker 5>the most famous one ever is the,</v>

2488
01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:53.401
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2489
01:12:53.401 --> 01:12:56.130
<v Speaker 5>those were were all based on actual things and this was the,</v>

2490
01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.090
<v Speaker 5>they find out people are using this brand new drug called LSD and there's no law</v>

2491
01:13:00.091 --> 01:13:00.540
<v Speaker 5>against it.</v>

2492
01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.090
<v Speaker 5>So immediately the first thing they had to do is go find a new law that they can</v>

2493
01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:03.924
<v Speaker 5>put into place.</v>

2494
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like I say today,</v>

2495
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:09.120
<v Speaker 5>the problem with our drug policy is that we're not accounting for the fact that</v>

2496
01:13:09.121 --> 01:13:12.270
<v Speaker 5>we might come up with some darn good drugs that don't do as much damage as the</v>

2497
01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:13.104
<v Speaker 5>ones we have.</v>

2498
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.560
<v Speaker 5>Our policy will be to make whatever new drug we find illegal tomorrow.</v>

2499
01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:17.610
<v Speaker 5>If it intoxicates you,</v>

2500
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:18.623
<v Speaker 5>it's illegal.</v>

2501
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how much longer that's going to work,</v>

2502
01:13:20.431 --> 01:13:22.890
<v Speaker 5>but if I was the government trying to stamp out drugs,</v>

2503
01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.480
<v Speaker 5>I think I'd just make better drugs that competed with WWE.</v>

2504
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:26.701
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2505
01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 5>how do you,</v>

2506
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.830
<v Speaker 5>how do you get rid of bathtub gin?</v>

2507
01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:32.820
<v Speaker 5>You get Bombay Sapphire and nobody wants any bathtub gin anymore.</v>

2508
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:33.511
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>

2509
01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:35.130
<v Speaker 5>you have to address what,</v>

2510
01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:38.700
<v Speaker 5>what's being done with these drugs and what's the effect because they've made no</v>

2511
01:13:38.701 --> 01:13:41.280
<v Speaker 5>effort whatsoever to stop things that turn you stupid.</v>

2512
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:46.700
<v Speaker 5>There's no effort whatsoever to slow down oxycodone and oxy Maton vicodins well,</v>

2513
01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:47.910
<v Speaker 5>math sort of.</v>

2514
01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean they go after and make you go crazy.</v>

2515
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:50.371
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2516
01:13:50.371 --> 01:13:50.881
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're saying.</v>

2517
01:13:50.881 --> 01:13:51.611
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying is the,</v>

2518
01:13:51.611 --> 01:13:51.821
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2519
01:13:51.821 --> 01:13:52.210
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2520
01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:52.800
<v Speaker 5>the cover,</v>

2521
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.820
<v Speaker 5>the government is not trying to stop a hydrocodone from,</v>

2522
01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:58.290
<v Speaker 5>I think they are.</v>

2523
01:13:59.300 --> 01:13:59.730
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>

2524
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

2525
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.710
<v Speaker 5>they're passing laws now that say,</v>

2526
01:14:01.711 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2527
01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 5>oh there they're going after the hydrocodone.</v>

2528
01:14:03.841 --> 01:14:04.171
<v Speaker 5>Tough.</v>

2529
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:05.520
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm brand new stuff.</v>

2530
01:14:05.521 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 5>They're going to,</v>

2531
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:09.150
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be able to call in a prescription refill for that.</v>

2532
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to have a physical prescription now every time they're</v>

2533
01:14:12.221 --> 01:14:14.250
<v Speaker 5>going to crack down on that big they are,</v>

2534
01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:15.093
<v Speaker 5>they are now.</v>

2535
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.731
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

2536
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:16.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2537
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 5>I was in Florida recently and a,</v>

2538
01:14:18.251 --> 01:14:19.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking of hydrocodone.</v>

2539
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:22.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you know the situation in Florida,</v>

2541
01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:22.791
<v Speaker 5>they got a lot of the,</v>

2542
01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:23.081
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2543
01:14:23.081 --> 01:14:23.360
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2544
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.790
<v Speaker 5>the prescription doctors there.</v>

2545
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:25.121
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 5>They have pain management centers and what a pain management center is.</v>

2547
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:31.240
<v Speaker 5>You go in and it's one building and like,</v>

2548
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:34.420
<v Speaker 5>like this office and that door is the doctor you got hit me,</v>

2549
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:35.650
<v Speaker 5>I fuck my backup hurts.</v>

2550
01:14:35.651 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 5>Our calc can't sleep.</v>

2551
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:37.031
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2552
01:14:37.031 --> 01:14:37.930
<v Speaker 5>here's some oxycontin.</v>

2553
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:40.990
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you that five years that will not be around guarantee.</v>

2554
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:41.853
<v Speaker 5>I bet you're right.</v>

2555
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:46.180
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons why is because it's been exposed and because there are time</v>

2556
01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 5>when he documentaries.</v>

2557
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2558
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.830
<v Speaker 5>The um,</v>

2559
01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:49.340
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2560
01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.980
<v Speaker 5>those guys from current TV,</v>

2561
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:52.090
<v Speaker 5>I think it was current TV,</v>

2562
01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:53.890
<v Speaker 5>true to one of those fucking channels.</v>

2563
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:55.390
<v Speaker 5>Vanguard is this the,</v>

2564
01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:55.481
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2565
01:14:55.481 --> 01:14:56.230
<v Speaker 5>the show,</v>

2566
01:14:56.230 --> 01:15:00.730
<v Speaker 5>they had a show called the oxycontin express and what they did was essentially</v>

2567
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 5>they showed that there's a highway that connects Florida to the rest of the</v>

2568
01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:05.411
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>

2569
01:15:05.411 --> 01:15:06.790
<v Speaker 5>Ohio and Kentucky and Ohio.</v>

2570
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:09.050
<v Speaker 5>And these people just getting busted with,</v>

2571
01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:10.870
<v Speaker 5>we're just going to say like Tennessee,</v>

2572
01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:12.730
<v Speaker 5>they just sit on the side of the road and bust any,</v>

2573
01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:13.070
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2574
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2575
01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:14.560
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

2576
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced.</v>

2577
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:16.481
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2578
01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:17.314
<v Speaker 5>when you look at,</v>

2579
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.450
<v Speaker 5>if you look at modern society and you say,</v>

2580
01:15:19.451 --> 01:15:23.050
<v Speaker 5>where have we made the most technological advances,</v>

2581
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.550
<v Speaker 5>you would have to put pharmacology in the top three or four areas,</v>

2582
01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:27.761
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2583
01:15:27.761 --> 01:15:28.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2584
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:28.530
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2585
01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:28.871
<v Speaker 5>And when,</v>

2586
01:15:28.871 --> 01:15:29.081
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

2587
01:15:29.081 --> 01:15:29.711
<v Speaker 5>when for example,</v>

2588
01:15:29.711 --> 01:15:33.460
<v Speaker 5>when the Nazis wanted stuff to keep their soldiers awake for things like,</v>

2589
01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:33.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2590
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.370
<v Speaker 5>unlimited blitzkrieg attacks and fighter pilots,</v>

2591
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.680
<v Speaker 5>they would simply go to the pharmacy companies a,</v>

2592
01:15:38.681 --> 01:15:39.491
<v Speaker 5>here's what we need.</v>

2593
01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:40.330
<v Speaker 5>And they'd produce it.</v>

2594
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 5>If we were intelligent about this,</v>

2595
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:47.980
<v Speaker 5>we would say as Doctor Weil so famously wrote 20 years ago,</v>

2596
01:15:47.981 --> 01:15:50.260
<v Speaker 5>people want to change their consciousness.</v>

2597
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:55.650
<v Speaker 5>Can't we arrange for substances that do this in a more Safeway than the ones we</v>

2598
01:15:56.951 --> 01:16:01.510
<v Speaker 5>have that come with some pill that will sober you up when it's time to drive</v>

2599
01:16:01.511 --> 01:16:02.344
<v Speaker 5>home?</v>

2600
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:06.760
<v Speaker 5>That's better than what we have now and I guarantee you if you said the pharmacy</v>

2601
01:16:06.761 --> 01:16:07.091
<v Speaker 5>companies,</v>

2602
01:16:07.091 --> 01:16:07.601
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

2603
01:16:07.601 --> 01:16:10.210
<v Speaker 5>we'll give you the patent to this for 20 years afterwards,</v>

2604
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:14.860
<v Speaker 5>they will come up with something recreational better than anything we have,</v>

2605
01:16:14.861 --> 01:16:16.180
<v Speaker 5>but because of an almost,</v>

2606
01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:20.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's a puritan ethic or if it's the companies that make the</v>

2607
01:16:20.561 --> 01:16:23.500
<v Speaker 5>current products that are legal that don't want competition or whatever it is.</v>

2608
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.600
<v Speaker 5>Nobody even talks about this.</v>

2609
01:16:25.601 --> 01:16:29.890
<v Speaker 5>This is nothing drives me crazier about the way we conduct things in American</v>

2610
01:16:29.891 --> 01:16:30.490
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2611
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 5>Then we don't even bring up subjects.</v>

2612
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:35.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind if we come up with the wrong answer in a national debate on</v>

2613
01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:36.364
<v Speaker 5>something like this,</v>

2614
01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.140
<v Speaker 5>but can we have the national debate?</v>

2615
01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.280
<v Speaker 5>Can you come up and defend to me why we shouldn't be working on safer,</v>

2616
01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.850
<v Speaker 5>healthier alternatives if you're going to make this drug illegal for</v>

2617
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:46.780
<v Speaker 5>recreational use,</v>

2618
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:47.621
<v Speaker 5>no problem,</v>

2619
01:16:47.621 --> 01:16:51.430
<v Speaker 5>but give me something that people can use cause they want to use it that will do</v>

2620
01:16:51.431 --> 01:16:52.450
<v Speaker 5>something similar,</v>

2621
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:56.350
<v Speaker 5>will be less harmful to the individual using it and less harmful to society.</v>

2622
01:16:56.650 --> 01:17:01.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that the government has any plans whatsoever on either backing or</v>

2623
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:07.180
<v Speaker 5>or supporting any pharmaceutical company that creates psychedelics.</v>

2624
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a big difference between creating hydrocodone</v>

2625
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.160
<v Speaker 6>or creating a safer amphetamine or creating safer drugs that allow us to</v>

2626
01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:18.530
<v Speaker 6>continue to society as structured.</v>

2627
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:22.190
<v Speaker 6>When you start getting into things like mushrooms and LSD and acid,</v>

2628
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 6>the real problem is the boundary dissolving properties are these things which</v>

2629
01:17:25.911 --> 01:17:27.410
<v Speaker 6>make you want to absolve.</v>

2630
01:17:27.411 --> 01:17:29.840
<v Speaker 6>Society made you want to get rid of all the laws,</v>

2631
01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:33.680
<v Speaker 6>makes you want to sleep naked and each other's floors and do a lot of like</v>

2632
01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.980
<v Speaker 6>culturally unsanctioned shit and that creates chaos.</v>

2633
01:17:36.981 --> 01:17:38.570
<v Speaker 6>And that created the chaos of the 60s.</v>

2634
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:43.160
<v Speaker 6>It was a paradigm shifting sort of a way that people were looking at the world</v>

2635
01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:47.960
<v Speaker 6>that was impossible for the 1950s minded cops to control.</v>

2636
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more of a difference between medicinal and recreational.</v>

2637
01:17:52.091 --> 01:17:54.010
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think the authorities,</v>

2638
01:17:54.011 --> 01:17:54.910
<v Speaker 4>whoever that may be,</v>

2639
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.520
<v Speaker 4>have ever acknowledged that besides alcohol,</v>

2640
01:17:57.730 --> 01:17:59.770
<v Speaker 4>there is any such thing as recreational.</v>

2641
01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:00.923
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2642
01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:05.950
<v Speaker 4>unless you accept the idea in a free society that may be people should be</v>

2643
01:18:05.951 --> 01:18:07.450
<v Speaker 4>allowed to use recreational stuff.</v>

2644
01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.920
<v Speaker 4>I used to say there ought to be a system,</v>

2645
01:18:08.921 --> 01:18:09.580
<v Speaker 4>a test,</v>

2646
01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:10.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2647
01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.520
<v Speaker 4>And it should be something like a hundred questions.</v>

2648
01:18:13.090 --> 01:18:13.871
<v Speaker 4>Question number one,</v>

2649
01:18:13.871 --> 01:18:15.490
<v Speaker 4>how likely is it to be addicting?</v>

2650
01:18:15.491 --> 01:18:16.151
<v Speaker 4>Question number two,</v>

2651
01:18:16.151 --> 01:18:17.010
<v Speaker 4>how dangerous is it?</v>

2652
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.490
<v Speaker 4>Everything should pass this test.</v>

2653
01:18:18.491 --> 01:18:20.620
<v Speaker 4>And if you get above or below,</v>

2654
01:18:20.621 --> 01:18:21.454
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how it works.</v>

2655
01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:22.323
<v Speaker 4>A certain score,</v>

2656
01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.110
<v Speaker 4>you're legal.</v>

2657
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.740
<v Speaker 4>If you don't,</v>

2658
01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:24.910
<v Speaker 4>you're illegal and you,</v>

2659
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.100
<v Speaker 4>you put the current drugs that are legal on there too.</v>

2660
01:18:27.101 --> 01:18:28.030
<v Speaker 4>You put alcohol on there,</v>

2661
01:18:28.031 --> 01:18:30.010
<v Speaker 4>put caffeine on it and let's see how it scores.</v>

2662
01:18:30.011 --> 01:18:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Do you really think marijuana is going to fail that test and alcohol is going to</v>

2663
01:18:33.071 --> 01:18:33.904
<v Speaker 4>pass.</v>

2664
01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2665
01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:34.451
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2666
01:18:34.451 --> 01:18:35.320
<v Speaker 4>like I said to you before,</v>

2667
01:18:35.321 --> 01:18:39.850
<v Speaker 4>if somebody invents the perfect drug tomorrow in some bath tub somewhere,</v>

2668
01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:43.180
<v Speaker 4>our government's going to ban it the day after tomorrow with no testing,</v>

2669
01:18:43.181 --> 01:18:44.140
<v Speaker 4>no questions asked.</v>

2670
01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Just on the grounds that it's recreational,</v>

2671
01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:48.070
<v Speaker 4>you're not allowed to have any recreational drugs.</v>

2672
01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 6>Not only recreational is there's an issue with things being recreational,</v>

2673
01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:53.003
<v Speaker 6>Zo things,</v>

2674
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.160
<v Speaker 6>anything performance enhancing,</v>

2675
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2676
01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:56.831
<v Speaker 6>pro vigil.</v>

2677
01:18:56.831 --> 01:18:57.601
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what pro vigil,</v>

2678
01:18:57.601 --> 01:19:02.240
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what pro vigil is like the latest smart drug rage amongst the</v>

2679
01:19:02.241 --> 01:19:03.970
<v Speaker 6>silicon valley set and it's a,</v>

2680
01:19:03.971 --> 01:19:08.090
<v Speaker 6>it's very odd stimulant that I'm not qualified to describe them.</v>

2681
01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:10.700
<v Speaker 6>The mechanics and the mechanism behind what it does.</v>

2682
01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 6>But what it does is it gives you this sort of stimulated,</v>

2683
01:19:13.761 --> 01:19:16.970
<v Speaker 6>accelerated feeling without feeling like you're on speed.</v>

2684
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:18.560
<v Speaker 6>Your heart rate doesn't go up,</v>

2685
01:19:18.561 --> 01:19:19.394
<v Speaker 6>you don't get jittery.</v>

2686
01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:20.351
<v Speaker 2>What's the action?</v>

2687
01:19:20.351 --> 01:19:20.561
<v Speaker 2>How's,</v>

2688
01:19:20.561 --> 01:19:20.890
<v Speaker 2>how's it,</v>

2689
01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:21.730
<v Speaker 2>what's it do?</v>

2690
01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Does it,</v>

2691
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.680
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

2692
01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.750
<v Speaker 2>is it an amphetamine thing or no,</v>

2693
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a new thing.</v>

2694
01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.680
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] vitamin that just,</v>

2695
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:27.050
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2696
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.251
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2697
01:19:27.251 --> 01:19:27.431
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2698
01:19:27.431 --> 01:19:28.480
<v Speaker 2>It's much more intense.</v>

2699
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:29.230
<v Speaker 2>It's Brian,</v>

2700
01:19:29.230 --> 01:19:30.220
<v Speaker 2>you've experienced it.</v>

2701
01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:30.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2702
01:19:30.761 --> 01:19:30.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2703
01:19:30.941 --> 01:19:31.111
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2704
01:19:31.111 --> 01:19:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to zero sleep and I had to drive to San Diego.</v>

2705
01:19:34.721 --> 01:19:34.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2706
01:19:34.901 --> 01:19:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I could barely keep my eyes open and I took it and just immediately I was like,</v>

2707
01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:38.291
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2708
01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm awake.</v>

2709
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:39.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2710
01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.073
<v Speaker 2>Clear.</v>

2711
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what it is or do you just take it sight unseen?</v>

2712
01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2713
01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.313
<v Speaker 2>you got it from me.</v>

2714
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.551
<v Speaker 2>I take anything.</v>

2715
01:19:47.551 --> 01:19:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I gave it to him because I didn't want to.</v>

2716
01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.430
<v Speaker 2>We have to have a laboratory situations.</v>

2717
01:19:51.431 --> 01:19:51.551
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2718
01:19:51.551 --> 01:19:51.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2719
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.270
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2720
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.931
<v Speaker 6>well let me,</v>

2721
01:19:52.931 --> 01:19:53.230
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2722
01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:56.350
<v Speaker 6>let me find the exact mechanism behind it.</v>

2723
01:19:56.351 --> 01:19:56.681
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2724
01:19:56.681 --> 01:19:56.930
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2725
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:57.760
<v Speaker 6>is it legal?</v>

2726
01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.061
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

2727
01:19:58.061 --> 01:19:58.450
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>

2728
01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Is it legal because they just haven't gotten around the band question</v>

2729
01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.100
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2730
01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:03.940
<v Speaker 6>Here's rather the,</v>

2731
01:20:03.941 --> 01:20:04.021
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2732
01:20:04.021 --> 01:20:04.854
<v Speaker 6>the issue.</v>

2733
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.680
<v Speaker 6>It's a Pr,</v>

2734
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 6>it was created essentially to</v>

2735
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.200
<v Speaker 1>enhance mental performance and clarity.</v>

2736
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.153
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2737
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.930
<v Speaker 1>to get it as a prescription drug,</v>

2738
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you can't have something that just makes you better.</v>

2739
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:15.901
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

2740
01:20:15.901 --> 01:20:16.980
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with you.</v>

2741
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 1>So they had to say,</v>

2742
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2743
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:19.920
<v Speaker 1>narcolepsy,</v>

2744
01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:21.443
<v Speaker 1>narcolepsy.</v>

2745
01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the narcolepsy.</v>

2746
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2747
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting.</v>

2748
01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:25.210
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2749
01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:27.510
<v Speaker 1>it's how do you prove you have narcolepsy?</v>

2750
01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2751
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.930
<v Speaker 1>for the doctor's office and just shamelessly shift work,</v>

2752
01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>sleep disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive</v>

2753
01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:36.181
<v Speaker 1>sleep apnea,</v>

2754
01:20:36.181 --> 01:20:36.780
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

2755
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I have sleep app and it is not an amphetamine.</v>

2756
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2757
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:39.810
<v Speaker 1>it is not,</v>

2758
01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:41.690
<v Speaker 1>despite extensive research into the interaction,</v>

2759
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 1>it's called Modafinil.</v>

2760
01:20:43.081 --> 01:20:47.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the actual chemical name with a large number of neurotransmitter systems.</v>

2761
01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:47.761
<v Speaker 1>That precise,</v>

2762
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:51.000
<v Speaker 1>precise mechanism or mechanisms of action remain.</v>

2763
01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be a dopamine serotonin kind of thing,</v>

2764
01:20:53.761 --> 01:20:54.630
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't crash.</v>

2765
01:20:54.631 --> 01:20:55.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't crash afterwards.</v>

2766
01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It elevates hypothalmic histamine levels,</v>

2767
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2768
01:20:58.530 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 1>leading some return researchers to consider that Modafinil is a wakefulness</v>

2769
01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:06.720
<v Speaker 1>promoting agent rather than a classic amphetamine like Stimuli.</v>

2770
01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Are they using it on the street yet?</v>

2771
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:09.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2772
01:21:09.151 --> 01:21:09.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2773
01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:09.961
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2774
01:21:09.961 --> 01:21:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And people in school,</v>

2775
01:21:11.401 --> 01:21:13.200
<v Speaker 1>people in startups,</v>

2776
01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.630
<v Speaker 1>people that are forced to work long hours on casters,</v>

2777
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 1>podcasters.</v>

2778
01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.770
<v Speaker 1>It can if you're exhausted and you had to take a,</v>

2779
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:20.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2780
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.530
<v Speaker 1>like if you had to do something to try to wake up,</v>

2781
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.260
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing what the fungus free coffee doesn't work anymore.</v>

2782
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:26.850
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this.</v>

2783
01:21:26.851 --> 01:21:30.210
<v Speaker 1>What's the penalty for being caught with this stuff without a prescription?</v>

2784
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2785
01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.420
<v Speaker 1>being caught with any chemical,</v>

2786
01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:36.450
<v Speaker 1>the w the prescription is a misdemeanor,</v>

2787
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2788
01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

2789
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Depending on how much you have and what the prescription is,</v>

2790
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:40.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2791
01:21:40.111 --> 01:21:41.160
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a prescription,</v>

2792
01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:42.540
<v Speaker 1>but you can get one.</v>

2793
01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:42.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2794
01:21:42.841 --> 01:21:46.440
<v Speaker 1>you can just say you're tired and you'd get one sleep apnea.</v>

2795
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:47.131
<v Speaker 1>How can we,</v>

2796
01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you said,</v>

2797
01:21:48.331 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 1>think about how you would change the country if you said,</v>

2798
01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:50.904
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2799
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:51.660
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2800
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:52.080
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2801
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.880
<v Speaker 1>getting back to my Joe Friday dragnet thing,</v>

2802
01:21:53.881 --> 01:21:55.950
<v Speaker 1>cause this is apparently how I learned about all this as a youth.</v>

2803
01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I remember the marijuana episode where,</v>

2804
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:59.880
<v Speaker 1>where the guy is that the family man,</v>

2805
01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:00.580
<v Speaker 1>remember the one where he,</v>

2806
01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.610
<v Speaker 1>his child dies in the bathtub later.</v>

2807
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:05.730
<v Speaker 1>We're where he's trying to argue with Joe Friday about why there's nothing wrong</v>

2808
01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:06.330
<v Speaker 1>with marijuana.</v>

2809
01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:07.020
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2810
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:07.321
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

2811
01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:07.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2812
01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 1>it's less,</v>

2813
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.340
<v Speaker 1>less effective than alcohol.</v>

2814
01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:09.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

2815
01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.350
<v Speaker 1>doesn't bother you,</v>

2816
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.561
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

2817
01:22:10.561 --> 01:22:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Friday says,</v>

2818
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.900
<v Speaker 1>but look at all the problem alcohol causes.</v>

2819
01:22:12.901 --> 01:22:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Do we really need another drug that does that?</v>

2820
01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how they think.</v>

2821
01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I think they think that you're going to increase and they might be right.</v>

2822
01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Try to fatalities.</v>

2823
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I think a the wrong and B,</v>

2824
01:22:23.761 --> 01:22:26.150
<v Speaker 1>they don't really think that everything we've said here is about how they're</v>

2825
01:22:26.170 --> 01:22:26.611
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2826
01:22:26.611 --> 01:22:27.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2827
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2828
01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:27.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2829
01:22:27.451 --> 01:22:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe they're right about chain about traffic fatalities.</v>

2830
01:22:30.511 --> 01:22:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I think people are safer drivers when they're high.</v>

2831
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.900
<v Speaker 1>I think they drive slower.</v>

2832
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:34.651
<v Speaker 1>They're more aware,</v>

2833
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:36.810
<v Speaker 1>especially if they smoked pot on a regular basis.</v>

2834
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.540
<v Speaker 1>It might depend on how high oh yeah.</v>

2835
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:39.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2836
01:22:39.811 --> 01:22:40.644
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2837
01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean obliterated.</v>

2838
01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:44.310
<v Speaker 1>You can get obliterated toward the point where it's reality dissolving.</v>

2839
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I think if you legalize marijuana,</v>

2840
01:22:46.051 --> 01:22:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I think you would see more.</v>

2841
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2842
01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2843
01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost unequivocal.</v>

2844
01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:50.281
<v Speaker 1>You would see more,</v>

2845
01:22:50.281 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2846
01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:51.350
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

2847
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Nom Ui is what would you even know?</v>

2848
01:22:53.071 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think you'd say more merging,</v>

2849
01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:55.780
<v Speaker 1>more waving.</v>

2850
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Both allow you to merge.</v>

2851
01:22:57.511 --> 01:22:58.410
<v Speaker 1>You might listen to that.</v>

2852
01:22:58.430 --> 01:23:01.110
<v Speaker 1>There's no question that this stuff would come with a cost.</v>

2853
01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:01.861
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

2854
01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:05.500
<v Speaker 1>is the cost that you would pay worse than what we have now?</v>

2855
01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree that it would come with a cost.</v>

2856
01:23:07.181 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be beneficial to society as far as a relaxing.</v>

2857
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I think if there's anything that society needs right now is a change of</v>

2858
01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

2859
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 1>something to calm them down and more creativity and those are three things that</v>

2860
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:19.294
<v Speaker 1>are promoted by her.</v>

2861
01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I think you're speaking as a guy who's,</v>

2862
01:23:20.921 --> 01:23:22.030
<v Speaker 1>who's experienced with this,</v>

2863
01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I think remember what it's love for what you get kids first starting out with</v>

2864
01:23:25.661 --> 01:23:26.494
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

2865
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I look well,</v>

2866
01:23:28.151 --> 01:23:29.680
<v Speaker 1>kids should be educated.</v>

2867
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:30.191
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

2868
01:23:30.191 --> 01:23:32.800
<v Speaker 1>One of the thought of the problems with kids starting out with this stuff is</v>

2869
01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:34.660
<v Speaker 1>that they're going into it in an ignorant way,</v>

2870
01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:36.940
<v Speaker 1>experimenting on their own and no one knows what the,</v>

2871
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:38.740
<v Speaker 1>what the effects are going to be.</v>

2872
01:23:38.741 --> 01:23:42.130
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what to expect because how every kid gets understanding about</v>

2873
01:23:42.131 --> 01:23:42.641
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

2874
01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's going to be a similar kind of a learning curve down my now my kids,</v>

2875
01:23:45.971 --> 01:23:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I teach them,</v>

2876
01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I speak to,</v>

2877
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:49.330
<v Speaker 1>to drink,</v>

2878
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:51.160
<v Speaker 1>well I don't let them drink,</v>

2879
01:23:51.161 --> 01:23:51.994
<v Speaker 1>but I speak,</v>

2880
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.050
<v Speaker 1>but I have a 16 year old and I talked to her about alcohol varies.</v>

2881
01:23:56.051 --> 01:23:56.884
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>

2882
01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:57.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2883
01:23:57.311 --> 01:23:57.821
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2884
01:23:57.821 --> 01:23:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I tell her whenever,</v>

2885
01:23:58.721 --> 01:23:59.310
<v Speaker 1>whenever we have</v>

2886
01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:00.570
<v Speaker 6>conversations about anything,</v>

2887
01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.380
<v Speaker 6>one of the most important things that I bring up is all the things that I fucked</v>

2888
01:24:04.381 --> 01:24:05.214
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>

2889
01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't care about data.</v>

2890
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:07.571
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2891
01:24:07.571 --> 01:24:08.520
<v Speaker 1>of course they do.</v>

2892
01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:09.310
<v Speaker 1>How many do you have kids?</v>

2893
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2894
01:24:09.541 --> 01:24:09.840
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

2895
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

2896
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:10.820
<v Speaker 1>How old are they?</v>

2897
01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:13.010
<v Speaker 1>11 and eight when I,</v>

2898
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.260
<v Speaker 6>when?</v>

2899
01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:14.220
<v Speaker 6>When I was a kid,</v>

2900
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:16.960
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that I remember more than anything was a,</v>

2901
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:18.120
<v Speaker 6>I have a really cool uncle,</v>

2902
01:24:18.121 --> 01:24:18.750
<v Speaker 6>uncle Vinny,</v>

2903
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:20.670
<v Speaker 6>and one of the things that he would eat,</v>

2904
01:24:20.690 --> 01:24:22.170
<v Speaker 6>it seems like you believe uncle Vinny,</v>

2905
01:24:22.171 --> 01:24:24.180
<v Speaker 6>but he's actually an artist with long haired Hippie.</v>

2906
01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:24.960
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2907
01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.620
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

2908
01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.690
<v Speaker 6>when he would talk to me about things,</v>

2909
01:24:27.691 --> 01:24:29.040
<v Speaker 6>he would always talk to me.</v>

2910
01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.750
<v Speaker 6>Like if I did anything wrong,</v>

2911
01:24:30.751 --> 01:24:32.760
<v Speaker 6>it was always what he did,</v>

2912
01:24:32.761 --> 01:24:34.320
<v Speaker 6>how he fucked up first.</v>

2913
01:24:34.530 --> 01:24:36.120
<v Speaker 1>My father's famous line was do as I say,</v>

2914
01:24:36.121 --> 01:24:36.790
<v Speaker 1>not as I do.</v>

2915
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:37.770
<v Speaker 1>He was a film maker.</v>

2916
01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2917
01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:38.401
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2918
01:24:38.401 --> 01:24:39.234
<v Speaker 6>that's funny.</v>

2919
01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:44.260
<v Speaker 6>What I learned a lot listening to this guy tell him and I remember thinking like</v>

2920
01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:45.960
<v Speaker 6>that like he did.</v>

2921
01:24:45.961 --> 01:24:50.190
<v Speaker 6>He kept me from being on the defensive by explaining to me that it's just part</v>

2922
01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:52.710
<v Speaker 6>of human nature to fuck up and to make mistakes.</v>

2923
01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.660
<v Speaker 6>And because he was so honest about that,</v>

2924
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:56.640
<v Speaker 6>I would listen to all of his advice,</v>

2925
01:24:56.641 --> 01:24:57.780
<v Speaker 6>whether it's about alcohol,</v>

2926
01:24:57.781 --> 01:24:58.800
<v Speaker 6>whether it's about whatever.</v>

2927
01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:04.100
<v Speaker 6>And I think the most important thing you can give to a kid is information and</v>

2928
01:25:06.031 --> 01:25:06.570
<v Speaker 6>love.</v>

2929
01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:08.550
<v Speaker 6>And the only way they're going to accept it as it,</v>

2930
01:25:08.551 --> 01:25:09.384
<v Speaker 6>they trust you.</v>

2931
01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.940
<v Speaker 6>And the only way they're going to trust you is if you're a hundred percent</v>

2932
01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:13.320
<v Speaker 6>honest with them all the time.</v>

2933
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:14.100
<v Speaker 6>And you just,</v>

2934
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.780
<v Speaker 6>you don't play any bullshit games with them.</v>

2935
01:25:15.930 --> 01:25:16.950
<v Speaker 6>And you explained to them,</v>

2936
01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:19.080
<v Speaker 6>and even not just not just honest,</v>

2937
01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:21.600
<v Speaker 6>but you got to explain to them all the times you fucked up as well.</v>

2938
01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:26.080
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do if I saw something the other day where Snoop Dogg is smoking</v>

2939
01:25:26.081 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 1>weed with his kid?</v>

2940
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.653
<v Speaker 1>What about that?</v>

2941
01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2942
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.221
<v Speaker 1>how old's his kid?</v>

2943
01:25:30.221 --> 01:25:30.700
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2944
01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to the question.</v>

2945
01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean if his kids a dog man,</v>

2946
01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:34.811
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

2947
01:25:34.811 --> 01:25:35.501
<v Speaker 1>that is right there.</v>

2948
01:25:35.501 --> 01:25:37.470
<v Speaker 1>The limit of my knowledge already.</v>

2949
01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'm off in the deep end here already.</v>

2950
01:25:39.611 --> 01:25:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I think the younger the better.</v>

2951
01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I think stone kids or would be awesome.</v>

2952
01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:44.230
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not good for your divine.</v>

2953
01:25:44.231 --> 01:25:44.981
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to say,</v>

2954
01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm living up in Oregon where there's a whole generation of kids that were on</v>

2955
01:25:48.461 --> 01:25:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Lsd from like five years old and he turns you into Courtney love without the</v>

2956
01:25:52.841 --> 01:25:53.860
<v Speaker 1>creative Portland,</v>

2957
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Eugene gene.</v>

2958
01:25:55.691 --> 01:25:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2959
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Portland look conservative does,</v>

2960
01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:00.160
<v Speaker 1>it does make fun of the conservative.</v>

2961
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.540
<v Speaker 1>That's Hippieville central.</v>

2962
01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:01.931
<v Speaker 1>But God,</v>

2963
01:26:01.931 --> 01:26:03.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful country up there</v>

2964
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.761
<v Speaker 4>from here.</v>

2965
01:26:04.761 --> 01:26:05.391
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

2966
01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 4>coming back here is like,</v>

2967
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:07.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2968
01:26:07.011 --> 01:26:08.510
<v Speaker 4>I was telling my mom just today,</v>

2969
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2970
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.800
<v Speaker 4>this town feels claustrophobic to me.</v>

2971
01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:11.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2972
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:15.170
<v Speaker 4>we have like nine buildings where they used to have one on a lot and you just</v>

2973
01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:16.280
<v Speaker 4>feel like,</v>

2974
01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:16.551
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2975
01:26:16.551 --> 01:26:16.611
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2976
01:26:16.611 --> 01:26:18.830
<v Speaker 4>I need some outdoors areas.</v>

2977
01:26:18.831 --> 01:26:20.060
<v Speaker 4>You've got to go to the beach.</v>

2978
01:26:20.061 --> 01:26:20.511
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2979
01:26:20.511 --> 01:26:22.940
<v Speaker 4>You don't realize how s smothered yard.</v>

2980
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 4>This town used to be a great place to live.</v>

2981
01:26:25.011 --> 01:26:25.581
<v Speaker 4>No offense.</v>

2982
01:26:25.581 --> 01:26:26.420
<v Speaker 4>A Angelenos.</v>

2983
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:27.390
<v Speaker 1>It's still great.</v>

2984
01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just too big and crazy.</v>

2985
01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I live a little bit further out,</v>

2986
01:26:30.961 --> 01:26:31.331
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2987
01:26:31.331 --> 01:26:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to move even further out.</v>

2988
01:26:32.731 --> 01:26:32.881
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2989
01:26:32.881 --> 01:26:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been looking at Santa Barbara lately.</v>

2990
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I really like is called in Santa Barbara though.</v>

2991
01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scared of the cold.</v>

2992
01:26:38.491 --> 01:26:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Boston.</v>

2993
01:26:39.421 --> 01:26:40.650
<v Speaker 1>This is called is for pussies.</v>

2994
01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.173
<v Speaker 1>Boston's really bad.</v>

2995
01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.330
<v Speaker 1>That's brutality.</v>

2996
01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:43.990
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2997
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2998
01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.600
<v Speaker 1>where were we at?</v>

2999
01:26:45.601 --> 01:26:45.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3000
01:26:45.721 --> 01:26:47.820
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about them making drugs,</v>

3001
01:26:47.821 --> 01:26:48.510
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

3002
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:52.770
<v Speaker 1>that the idea is that it's a personal freedom issue and the personal freedom is</v>

3003
01:26:52.771 --> 01:26:53.604
<v Speaker 1>you're a man.</v>

3004
01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I should not be able to,</v>

3005
01:26:54.631 --> 01:26:56.190
<v Speaker 1>if it was only two people on the planet,</v>

3006
01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:57.030
<v Speaker 1>just you and me.</v>

3007
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.511
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3008
01:26:57.511 --> 01:26:57.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3009
01:26:57.631 --> 01:27:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I've made a law and the law is no alcohol.</v>

3010
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:00.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3011
01:27:00.721 --> 01:27:01.051
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

3012
01:27:01.051 --> 01:27:02.310
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3013
01:27:02.311 --> 01:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>There's only two of us and I want to drink.</v>

3014
01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:04.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3015
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3016
01:27:04.351 --> 01:27:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lock you in a cage if you drink the alcohol.</v>

3017
01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:07.770
<v Speaker 1>It sounds preposterous,</v>

3018
01:27:07.771 --> 01:27:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's just as preposterous for 3000 people to,</v>

3019
01:27:11.161 --> 01:27:11.520
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3020
01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.490
<v Speaker 1>to tell 300 million people that they can't have pot.</v>

3021
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:14.721
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3022
01:27:14.721 --> 01:27:15.860
<v Speaker 4>here's the difference to me,</v>

3023
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:18.260
<v Speaker 4>what's the difference between locking somebody up,</v>

3024
01:27:18.261 --> 01:27:22.460
<v Speaker 4>you find with the drug than locking somebody up who does something they</v>

3025
01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be doing when they're on the drug?</v>

3026
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:26.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean hold them accountable and responsible.</v>

3027
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:28.790
<v Speaker 4>Then we're still going to have a ton of people in prison,</v>

3028
01:27:28.791 --> 01:27:30.380
<v Speaker 4>but they're not going to be in prison for possession.</v>

3029
01:27:30.381 --> 01:27:32.450
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be in prison for doing something that,</v>

3030
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3031
01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 4>you go back to the old west and one of the standard stump speeches that the</v>

3032
01:27:36.981 --> 01:27:39.890
<v Speaker 4>person they were about to hang would give you.</v>

3033
01:27:39.891 --> 01:27:40.540
<v Speaker 4>The guy you know,</v>

3034
01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:41.241
<v Speaker 4>was about to hang,</v>

3035
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:41.990
<v Speaker 4>would always feel,</v>

3036
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.381
<v Speaker 4>not always,</v>

3037
01:27:42.381 --> 01:27:45.740
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of times feel like they needed to give some sort of lesson to the kids</v>

3038
01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:46.790
<v Speaker 4>and they'd say something like,</v>

3039
01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:46.881
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3040
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:49.850
<v Speaker 4>you need to do avoid alcohol and don't end up like I ended up.</v>

3041
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:50.450
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

3042
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3043
01:27:50.631 --> 01:27:51.464
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>

3044
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:52.370
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3045
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:53.270
<v Speaker 4>that's going to happen.</v>

3046
01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Then there's no question that,</v>

3047
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:55.530
<v Speaker 4>that I think it,</v>

3048
01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.190
<v Speaker 4>whether it's alcohol or anything else that's going to lead some people to</v>

3049
01:27:58.191 --> 01:27:58.461
<v Speaker 4>straight,</v>

3050
01:27:58.461 --> 01:27:59.630
<v Speaker 4>they call it a gateway drug.</v>

3051
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.600
<v Speaker 4>Anything as a gate with the first thing you use is a gateway drug.</v>

3052
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.831
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>

3053
01:28:03.831 --> 01:28:08.831
<v Speaker 4>we punish people now for the potential that they might do with the illegal drug</v>

3054
01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:12.530
<v Speaker 4>if you punish him for the actuality.</v>

3055
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:15.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure it's any less effective than what we have now.</v>

3056
01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.960
<v Speaker 4>And you increase the overall freedom level.</v>

3057
01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3058
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:19.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3059
01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:19.371
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3060
01:28:19.371 --> 01:28:23.450
<v Speaker 4>the idea that the founders had that we ought to use the states as laboratories.</v>

3061
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 4>This is where you get to the marijuana situation right now.</v>

3062
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:30.170
<v Speaker 4>I would love for states to be able to actually try this out.</v>

3063
01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:31.940
<v Speaker 4>Instead of us having to have a national,</v>

3064
01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:32.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3065
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:33.523
<v Speaker 4>experiment,</v>

3066
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3067
01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.540
<v Speaker 4>where everybody's sinks or swims together.</v>

3068
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Let Colorado try this weed thing out and let's see how it goes.</v>

3069
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the feds are going to let this really happen.</v>

3070
01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3071
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 4>but to me that's the intelligent way to do it.</v>

3072
01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:49.570
<v Speaker 4>What do you think's going to happen with Seattle or Washington is going to be a,</v>

3073
01:28:49.571 --> 01:28:51.850
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a showdown point and they're,</v>

3074
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.641
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3075
01:28:52.641 --> 01:28:54.410
<v Speaker 4>the Fed's already aren't letting this happen.</v>

3076
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3077
01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:55.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3078
01:28:55.311 --> 01:28:55.491
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3079
01:28:55.491 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 4>the state and it puts the state lawmakers in a really weird position because</v>

3080
01:28:58.941 --> 01:29:01.190
<v Speaker 4>they're supposed to listen to the will of the voters.</v>

3081
01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:05.580
<v Speaker 4>And yet state law is trumped by federal law and everybody knows that.</v>

3082
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:07.980
<v Speaker 4>So how they're supposed to act as a nether world.</v>

3083
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:11.910
<v Speaker 4>The feds have never given one second of,</v>

3084
01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 4>of lip service to the idea that they're going to allow this.</v>

3085
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:15.931
<v Speaker 4>They always say,</v>

3086
01:29:15.931 --> 01:29:16.111
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3087
01:29:16.111 --> 01:29:18.690
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to concentrate on individual users,</v>

3088
01:29:18.691 --> 01:29:19.290
<v Speaker 4>blah blah,</v>

3089
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:20.210
<v Speaker 4>but they do nothing</v>

3090
01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.670
<v Speaker 6>and the way they say that,</v>

3091
01:29:21.671 --> 01:29:23.320
<v Speaker 6>it's really just to sort of relax.</v>

3092
01:29:23.321 --> 01:29:25.600
<v Speaker 6>People are okay and then they move in.</v>

3093
01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't even think they're trying to relax people.</v>

3094
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:29.650
<v Speaker 6>I think you've made it clear that they're going to go going after individual</v>

3095
01:29:29.651 --> 01:29:33.010
<v Speaker 6>users at least makes people think if they said we're going after everybody.</v>

3096
01:29:33.011 --> 01:29:36.700
<v Speaker 6>Everybody was smiling upon us when if the feds ever gone after individual users,</v>

3097
01:29:36.701 --> 01:29:39.670
<v Speaker 6>they don't know that the FBI doesn't come and arrest the guy smoking weed on the</v>

3098
01:29:39.671 --> 01:29:40.060
<v Speaker 6>corner.</v>

3099
01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:40.241
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3100
01:29:40.241 --> 01:29:42.550
<v Speaker 6>you don't have five guys break into a house.</v>

3101
01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:45.580
<v Speaker 6>It was a joint selling joints and that's what's,</v>

3102
01:29:45.581 --> 01:29:46.330
<v Speaker 6>and that</v>

3103
01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:47.770
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to be a come up.</v>

3104
01:29:47.771 --> 01:29:50.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a moment and I don't know if that's going to be because one state goes one</v>

3105
01:29:50.961 --> 01:29:53.750
<v Speaker 4>step farther than everybody else and that's when you get knocked back.</v>

3106
01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Or if we get a new president in there and the first order,</v>

3107
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.770
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3108
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:58.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3109
01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand the forces at work that keep this stuff illegal.</v>

3110
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:02.810
<v Speaker 4>If I understood that better,</v>

3111
01:30:02.811 --> 01:30:03.740
<v Speaker 4>then you would know,</v>

3112
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:04.251
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3113
01:30:04.251 --> 01:30:08.540
<v Speaker 4>what's it gonna take to Piss off that group too far?</v>

3114
01:30:08.541 --> 01:30:08.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3115
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:11.120
<v Speaker 4>is it the alcohol lobby and when do you go so far?</v>

3116
01:30:11.121 --> 01:30:11.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3117
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:12.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3118
01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:14.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who's keeping this stuff illegal.</v>

3119
01:30:14.031 --> 01:30:15.680
<v Speaker 4>So it's hard for me to pin down what the,</v>

3120
01:30:15.681 --> 01:30:16.011
<v Speaker 4>what the,</v>

3121
01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:18.290
<v Speaker 4>what the moment of going too far it's going to be.</v>

3122
01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.360
<v Speaker 4>But as we talked about earlier,</v>

3123
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:23.390
<v Speaker 4>if they don't crack down at some point,</v>

3124
01:30:23.391 --> 01:30:26.870
<v Speaker 4>this stuff is going to become legal by default.</v>

3125
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:27.261
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3126
01:30:27.261 --> 01:30:27.620
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna,</v>

3127
01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:32.180
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna grow into legality where we've got these fig leaf laws on the books</v>

3128
01:30:32.181 --> 01:30:32.990
<v Speaker 4>that prohibited,</v>

3129
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:34.100
<v Speaker 4>but nobody pays any attention.</v>

3130
01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:34.301
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3131
01:30:34.301 --> 01:30:34.601
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3132
01:30:34.601 --> 01:30:39.220
<v Speaker 6>logically there's no reason to stop it from being legal and their idea that it's</v>

3133
01:30:39.221 --> 01:30:44.050
<v Speaker 6>somehow going to harm the interests of the people that are profiting from it</v>

3134
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.771
<v Speaker 6>being illegal.</v>

3135
01:30:44.771 --> 01:30:45.521
<v Speaker 6>I think it's silly.</v>

3136
01:30:45.521 --> 01:30:46.930
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to harm alcohol.</v>

3137
01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.220
<v Speaker 6>People are still going to drink.</v>

3138
01:30:48.221 --> 01:30:49.360
<v Speaker 6>People enjoy drinking.</v>

3139
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:50.440
<v Speaker 6>It's fun for people.</v>

3140
01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:54.970
<v Speaker 6>It may limit some prescription drugs because there's going to be natural</v>

3141
01:30:54.971 --> 01:30:55.780
<v Speaker 6>remedies,</v>

3142
01:30:55.780 --> 01:31:00.220
<v Speaker 6>especially like interocular pressure being cured by cannabis and people with</v>

3143
01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:05.221
<v Speaker 6>wasting disease and aids that have issues with nausea and it's one of the best</v>

3144
01:31:05.351 --> 01:31:06.340
<v Speaker 6>things for nausea.</v>

3145
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:11.530
<v Speaker 4>What happens when the people who have a lot of money invested in pseudo legal</v>

3146
01:31:11.871 --> 01:31:14.990
<v Speaker 4>marijuana start donating to the federal legislators?</v>

3147
01:31:14.991 --> 01:31:15.890
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

3148
01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:16.561
<v Speaker 4>You'll get the,</v>

3149
01:31:16.561 --> 01:31:20.510
<v Speaker 4>the corruption working at cross purposes to the way it's working,</v>

3150
01:31:20.511 --> 01:31:21.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3151
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:21.211
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3152
01:31:21.211 --> 01:31:24.600
<v Speaker 6>the way they've stopped that is you're not supposed to be profiting from it in</v>

3153
01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:25.390
<v Speaker 6>California,</v>

3154
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:27.210
<v Speaker 6>the only place where you're supposed to be profiting from it.</v>

3155
01:31:27.211 --> 01:31:27.661
<v Speaker 6>Ironically,</v>

3156
01:31:27.661 --> 01:31:28.494
<v Speaker 6>it's Colorado.</v>

3157
01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:32.710
<v Speaker 6>Colorado allows medical mirror the way the law pass the medical laws in Colorado</v>

3158
01:31:32.711 --> 01:31:34.890
<v Speaker 6>were different than the medical laws in California.</v>

3159
01:31:34.891 --> 01:31:35.910
<v Speaker 6>They allowed profit,</v>

3160
01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:38.720
<v Speaker 6>whereas in California it's supposed to be like a nonprofit.</v>

3161
01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:41.970
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much of this has to do with the fact too that it's the equivalent</v>

3162
01:31:41.971 --> 01:31:42.820
<v Speaker 4>of being able to,</v>

3163
01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:44.800
<v Speaker 4>to distill your own alcohol,</v>

3164
01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.050
<v Speaker 4>your backyard if you want to.</v>

3165
01:31:46.051 --> 01:31:46.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean you take,</v>

3166
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:50.040
<v Speaker 4>you take all of the companies that you might be able to get on your bandwagon</v>

3167
01:31:50.041 --> 01:31:53.580
<v Speaker 4>here at Philip Morris could make your marijuana cigarettes as opposed to</v>

3168
01:31:54.190 --> 01:31:57.250
<v Speaker 6>they have now where you'll just grow it in the back yard and nobody in the</v>

3169
01:31:57.251 --> 01:31:57.820
<v Speaker 6>house.</v>

3170
01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:00.550
<v Speaker 6>I mean the crazy thing is such a durable plant.</v>

3171
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:04.240
<v Speaker 6>It's not like something like a tomato where you have to have good soil and you</v>

3172
01:32:04.241 --> 01:32:07.210
<v Speaker 6>have to make sure that you tend to do it and these things grow with you want</v>

3173
01:32:07.211 --> 01:32:08.770
<v Speaker 6>them to dialed in all 50 states.</v>

3174
01:32:08.771 --> 01:32:09.510
<v Speaker 6>I read something,</v>

3175
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:13.330
<v Speaker 6>if you drive out the window and throw seeds out the window and come back in a</v>

3176
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:13.601
<v Speaker 6>month,</v>

3177
01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 6>you're going to see plants.</v>

3178
01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:15.340
<v Speaker 6>They just,</v>

3179
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:16.091
<v Speaker 6>they find a way,</v>

3180
01:32:16.091 --> 01:32:16.710
<v Speaker 6>those little fuck.</v>

3181
01:32:16.710 --> 01:32:17.610
<v Speaker 4>Well then we get back to the,</v>

3182
01:32:17.611 --> 01:32:20.130
<v Speaker 4>what we talked about earlier about trigger points.</v>

3183
01:32:20.131 --> 01:32:20.311
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3184
01:32:20.311 --> 01:32:22.050
<v Speaker 4>when do people rebel?</v>

3185
01:32:22.051 --> 01:32:22.884
<v Speaker 4>When have they had enough?</v>

3186
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:24.143
<v Speaker 4>What if</v>

3187
01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:24.631
<v Speaker 6>you get high?</v>

3188
01:32:24.631 --> 01:32:27.740
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens when you get some LSD and then they rebelled when the</v>

3189
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:28.583
<v Speaker 6>government</v>

3190
01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.850
<v Speaker 4>down and May and you know,</v>

3191
01:32:30.851 --> 01:32:34.000
<v Speaker 4>like if they go into Colorado or if they go into Washington or one of these</v>

3192
01:32:34.001 --> 01:32:34.834
<v Speaker 4>places where the vote,</v>

3193
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 4>the will of the people has been amply,</v>

3194
01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:37.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3195
01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:42.970
<v Speaker 4>a red enacted into law and the whole thing and they overturn that,</v>

3196
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:43.931
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be,</v>

3197
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:45.190
<v Speaker 4>those are going to be interesting,</v>

3198
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3199
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:47.980
<v Speaker 4>trigger points or benchmarks in,</v>

3200
01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:48.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3201
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:50.440
<v Speaker 4>wherever it is we're heading.</v>

3202
01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:50.850
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3203
01:32:50.850 --> 01:32:53.670
<v Speaker 6>you know what they'd been doing the way the DEA has been handling it and</v>

3204
01:32:53.671 --> 01:32:55.320
<v Speaker 6>California is very fascinating.</v>

3205
01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:56.490
<v Speaker 6>They go in,</v>

3206
01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.030
<v Speaker 6>they break down the door,</v>

3207
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:59.970
<v Speaker 6>do whatever they got to do guns in the air,</v>

3208
01:32:59.971 --> 01:33:03.030
<v Speaker 6>pulled people in the ground is a video of them stepping on some kids neck</v>

3209
01:33:03.150 --> 01:33:04.350
<v Speaker 6>college kid just working there.</v>

3210
01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:08.940
<v Speaker 6>The cop steps on his Nestle scene walks over him for no reason.</v>

3211
01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:11.040
<v Speaker 6>They smashed the security cameras.</v>

3212
01:33:11.130 --> 01:33:11.530
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3213
01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:14.610
<v Speaker 6>They thought that the cameras were on set.</v>

3214
01:33:14.611 --> 01:33:15.480
<v Speaker 6>It was actually sent,</v>

3215
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:18.780
<v Speaker 6>but through the Internet to a third party location always.</v>

3216
01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.501
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3217
01:33:19.501 --> 01:33:19.681
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3218
01:33:19.681 --> 01:33:21.450
<v Speaker 6>they got video of this where they tried to destroy it.</v>

3219
01:33:21.451 --> 01:33:22.284
<v Speaker 6>The cops tried to destroy it.</v>

3220
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:24.780
<v Speaker 6>They steal all the drugs,</v>

3221
01:33:24.810 --> 01:33:27.150
<v Speaker 6>they take all the marijuana and they steal all the money.</v>

3222
01:33:27.330 --> 01:33:28.350
<v Speaker 6>Then they say,</v>

3223
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:32.850
<v Speaker 6>we are holding a your file until we decide what to do with it.</v>

3224
01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:33.983
<v Speaker 6>And they do nothing.</v>

3225
01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.810
<v Speaker 6>So they take thousands of dollars,</v>

3226
01:33:36.811 --> 01:33:37.880
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck you have on,</v>

3227
01:33:37.881 --> 01:33:38.220
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

3228
01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:38.881
<v Speaker 6>on the premises,</v>

3229
01:33:38.881 --> 01:33:40.950
<v Speaker 6>they take thousands of dollars in marijuana.</v>

3230
01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:42.360
<v Speaker 6>They'd take all of your,</v>

3231
01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:43.081
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3232
01:33:43.081 --> 01:33:44.850
<v Speaker 6>all your cash on hand,</v>

3233
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:46.680
<v Speaker 6>everything that they want to take from you.</v>

3234
01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:47.850
<v Speaker 6>And then they say,</v>

3235
01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:49.230
<v Speaker 6>we're holding your file,</v>

3236
01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:49.531
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>

3237
01:33:49.531 --> 01:33:49.830
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>

3238
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:51.360
<v Speaker 6>we'll tell you what we do when we decide.</v>

3239
01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:54.600
<v Speaker 6>And they can hold onto it for years and years and years.</v>

3240
01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.250
<v Speaker 6>So essentially they put you out of business,</v>

3241
01:33:56.670 --> 01:33:58.410
<v Speaker 6>they put you out of business without arresting you.</v>

3242
01:33:58.530 --> 01:34:01.110
<v Speaker 6>So are they enforcing federal law?</v>

3243
01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:02.280
<v Speaker 6>SORTA,</v>

3244
01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:02.940
<v Speaker 6>but they don't.</v>

3245
01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.290
<v Speaker 6>Are they enforcing state law?</v>

3246
01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:04.741
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3247
01:34:04.741 --> 01:34:05.910
<v Speaker 6>So it's not a state law,</v>

3248
01:34:05.911 --> 01:34:06.810
<v Speaker 6>it's just the federal law,</v>

3249
01:34:06.811 --> 01:34:08.220
<v Speaker 6>but they don't actually do anything about it.</v>

3250
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:11.190
<v Speaker 6>They're very few people were actually getting brought to trial.</v>

3251
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.830
<v Speaker 4>You're saying,</v>

3252
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:12.760
<v Speaker 4>if you look at to what,</v>

3253
01:34:12.761 --> 01:34:13.561
<v Speaker 4>what the,</v>

3254
01:34:13.561 --> 01:34:13.811
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3255
01:34:13.811 --> 01:34:18.460
<v Speaker 4>the excuse for the militarization of police forces over the last 30 years has</v>

3256
01:34:18.461 --> 01:34:18.641
<v Speaker 4>been,</v>

3257
01:34:18.641 --> 01:34:21.370
<v Speaker 4>this drug war has been the greatest thing that ever happened in terms of,</v>

3258
01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:22.091
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3259
01:34:22.091 --> 01:34:23.290
<v Speaker 4>search and seizure laws,</v>

3260
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.950
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3261
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:24.670
<v Speaker 4>departments.</v>

3262
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea that someone thought up,</v>

3263
01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:26.741
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3264
01:34:26.741 --> 01:34:31.240
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't it be a great incentive to tell officers that they could get,</v>

3265
01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.320
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3266
01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.880
<v Speaker 4>there's actually some great books about this.</v>

3267
01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:36.490
<v Speaker 4>Dan Baum wrote one called smoking mirrors wants,</v>

3268
01:34:36.491 --> 01:34:37.480
<v Speaker 4>there are others where,</v>

3269
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:41.170
<v Speaker 4>where there used to be two kinds of forfeiture laws,</v>

3270
01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.520
<v Speaker 4>a criminal one and a civil one without going too deeply into it in order to</v>

3271
01:34:45.521 --> 01:34:46.331
<v Speaker 4>fight the drug war.</v>

3272
01:34:46.331 --> 01:34:50.710
<v Speaker 4>During this crazy time of the 80s they decided to combine the two taking the</v>

3273
01:34:50.711 --> 01:34:55.520
<v Speaker 4>lower standard required for one kind and the higher penalties for the other kind</v>

3274
01:34:55.521 --> 01:35:00.070
<v Speaker 4>of putting them together and is where you got the situations where if the police</v>

3275
01:35:00.071 --> 01:35:02.560
<v Speaker 4>officer's burst down your door and found drugs,</v>

3276
01:35:02.561 --> 01:35:05.920
<v Speaker 4>they could seize your corvette automatically without any sort of a,</v>

3277
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:09.970
<v Speaker 4>an acknowledgment that the corvette was bought with drug money on the grounds</v>

3278
01:35:09.971 --> 01:35:12.010
<v Speaker 4>that you have to sue us to get it back.</v>

3279
01:35:12.010 --> 01:35:16.570
<v Speaker 4>You have to prove that there was no drug money here and if you don't,</v>

3280
01:35:16.571 --> 01:35:18.520
<v Speaker 4>if we get to keep this car and sell it,</v>

3281
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.080
<v Speaker 4>at least some of that money,</v>

3282
01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:20.950
<v Speaker 4>some departments got it,</v>

3283
01:35:20.951 --> 01:35:22.630
<v Speaker 4>all others had to share it with other agencies.</v>

3284
01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Some of that money goes right back to the people who seized it.</v>

3285
01:35:25.210 --> 01:35:27.430
<v Speaker 4>Now this was supposed to be a great incentive,</v>

3286
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.821
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3287
01:35:27.821 --> 01:35:30.760
<v Speaker 4>Well we're going to crack it on the drug users and we'll be able to afford the</v>

3288
01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:33.220
<v Speaker 4>narcotics teams cause they will pay for itself.</v>

3289
01:35:33.490 --> 01:35:37.300
<v Speaker 4>But as Radley Balko is written in a book that's due out anytime now,</v>

3290
01:35:37.301 --> 01:35:39.160
<v Speaker 4>I saw an earlier version of it,</v>

3291
01:35:39.850 --> 01:35:44.440
<v Speaker 4>this has exploded the number of cases where please do these things and it comes</v>

3292
01:35:44.441 --> 01:35:49.120
<v Speaker 4>at the expense of robberies and other crimes that don't actually benefit the</v>

3293
01:35:49.121 --> 01:35:52.120
<v Speaker 4>department as much as these search and seizure drug crimes do.</v>

3294
01:35:52.210 --> 01:35:53.650
<v Speaker 4>And if you got rid of the drug crimes,</v>

3295
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:56.230
<v Speaker 4>what happens to those departments that are making a bunch of money off of it</v>

3296
01:35:56.231 --> 01:35:56.450
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

3297
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:59.330
<v Speaker 6>do you know about the scandal that's been going on in Tennessee?</v>

3298
01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:01.460
<v Speaker 4>You mean the I the the interstate?</v>

3299
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:02.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3300
01:36:02.110 --> 01:36:02.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3301
01:36:02.301 --> 01:36:02.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm all on top.</v>

3302
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:04.710
<v Speaker 6>The cops for folks who don't know,</v>

3303
01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:06.300
<v Speaker 6>there's this thing they're doing,</v>

3304
01:36:06.301 --> 01:36:06.571
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3305
01:36:06.571 --> 01:36:07.220
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3306
01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:11.280
<v Speaker 6>the police have this policy called policing for profit.</v>

3307
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.140
<v Speaker 6>So they pull you over,</v>

3308
01:36:13.141 --> 01:36:13.561
<v Speaker 6>like Save,</v>

3309
01:36:13.561 --> 01:36:17.400
<v Speaker 6>you're a truck driver and you live in your truck and all your money in the world</v>

3310
01:36:17.401 --> 01:36:18.120
<v Speaker 6>isn't that truck.</v>

3311
01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.430
<v Speaker 6>What if you have $50,000 and it's in your truck?</v>

3312
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.331
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3313
01:36:21.331 --> 01:36:22.440
<v Speaker 6>they pull you over.</v>

3314
01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:22.861
<v Speaker 6>They say,</v>

3315
01:36:22.861 --> 01:36:27.390
<v Speaker 6>why the fuck do you have $50,000 they take your money and that's theirs.</v>

3316
01:36:27.391 --> 01:36:32.391
<v Speaker 6>Now you have to prove that you got that money through legal means and the way</v>

3317
01:36:32.821 --> 01:36:34.410
<v Speaker 6>Tennessee's doing it is,</v>

3318
01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.260
<v Speaker 6>apparently they'd been doing this for a while.</v>

3319
01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:38.190
<v Speaker 6>They've been,</v>

3320
01:36:38.190 --> 01:36:42.180
<v Speaker 6>they've been seizing money and that money goes to their,</v>

3321
01:36:42.181 --> 01:36:42.510
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>

3322
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:43.500
<v Speaker 6>their police force.</v>

3323
01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:47.110
<v Speaker 4>Let me defend those people for a second though because one of the things that</v>

3324
01:36:47.111 --> 01:36:51.100
<v Speaker 4>doubt Balco his book had that I found fascinating was remember a lot of these</v>

3325
01:36:51.101 --> 01:36:51.970
<v Speaker 4>people are elected,</v>

3326
01:36:51.971 --> 01:36:52.691
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these shares,</v>

3327
01:36:52.691 --> 01:36:53.201
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3328
01:36:53.201 --> 01:36:55.090
<v Speaker 4>are elected and there was one county,</v>

3329
01:36:55.091 --> 01:36:56.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember where it was,</v>

3330
01:36:56.081 --> 01:36:57.940
<v Speaker 4>where the sheriff was not going to do this,</v>

3331
01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.820
<v Speaker 4>and the guy who ran against him for sheriff said,</v>

3332
01:37:00.821 --> 01:37:03.280
<v Speaker 4>do you know how much money we're missing out on?</v>

3333
01:37:03.281 --> 01:37:07.270
<v Speaker 4>We're cutting officers left and right enforcement because we won't just go and</v>

3334
01:37:07.271 --> 01:37:09.070
<v Speaker 4>do what other look up at the county next door has.</v>

3335
01:37:09.071 --> 01:37:11.980
<v Speaker 4>They've got all this equipment and all these officers because they're seizing</v>

3336
01:37:11.981 --> 01:37:13.270
<v Speaker 4>assets and we're not.</v>

3337
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:17.650
<v Speaker 4>In other words because the feds do not come in and enforce the constitution</v>

3338
01:37:17.651 --> 01:37:19.360
<v Speaker 4>because they allow this because it's,</v>

3339
01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:23.020
<v Speaker 4>remember before the war on terror made everything okay if it was part of the war</v>

3340
01:37:23.021 --> 01:37:23.620
<v Speaker 4>on terror,</v>

3341
01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:27.790
<v Speaker 4>the war on drugs allowed us to rip open parts of the Constitution on the grounds</v>

3342
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:31.060
<v Speaker 4>that this war was so important and that were so many lives at stake.</v>

3343
01:37:31.061 --> 01:37:32.140
<v Speaker 4>And like the mafia,</v>

3344
01:37:32.141 --> 01:37:34.120
<v Speaker 4>it was so resistant to normal,</v>

3345
01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:34.451
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3346
01:37:34.451 --> 01:37:38.680
<v Speaker 4>law enforcement techniques that we needed special tools that the federal</v>

3347
01:37:38.681 --> 01:37:42.070
<v Speaker 4>government not only allowed this stuff but encouraged people to do it.</v>

3348
01:37:42.071 --> 01:37:45.940
<v Speaker 4>And I would like to say proudly Los Angeles with Police Chief Daryl Gates in the</v>

3349
01:37:45.941 --> 01:37:48.370
<v Speaker 4>old days was one of the leaders in this when he would,</v>

3350
01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:49.960
<v Speaker 4>when we had the first tank,</v>

3351
01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I remember we had the first tank to knock down,</v>

3352
01:37:52.210 --> 01:37:52.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3353
01:37:52.421 --> 01:37:52.651
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3354
01:37:52.651 --> 01:37:54.850
<v Speaker 4>the drug buildings and everything else and seize the,</v>

3355
01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3356
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.260
<v Speaker 5>once that becomes standard fair,</v>

3357
01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.630
<v Speaker 5>are you going to be the sheriff that says,</v>

3358
01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:01.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't do that.</v>

3359
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:03.480
<v Speaker 5>When the guy running against you says,</v>

3360
01:38:03.481 --> 01:38:04.560
<v Speaker 5>look at our idiot sheriff,</v>

3361
01:38:04.561 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 5>he's missing out on all these federal dollars.</v>

3362
01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:07.314
<v Speaker 5>Plus the Fed,</v>

3363
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.840
<v Speaker 5>the Fed's actually match some of your costs.</v>

3364
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:15.600
<v Speaker 5>They will hand you down paramilitary stuff as part of like used war surplus and</v>

3365
01:38:15.601 --> 01:38:16.434
<v Speaker 5>everything else.</v>

3366
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:20.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you see these police officers in full cammo gear carrying ar</v>

3367
01:38:20.581 --> 01:38:21.600
<v Speaker 5>fifteens and everything,</v>

3368
01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.270
<v Speaker 5>a lot of that stuff is hand me down right from the military.</v>

3369
01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't want that,</v>

3370
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:30.930
<v Speaker 5>you're going to run around with a stupid cult 44 revolver when you could have an</v>

3371
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:32.400
<v Speaker 5>ar 15 and a tank.</v>

3372
01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.410
<v Speaker 5>What kind of bad sheriff are you?</v>

3373
01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:35.244
<v Speaker 5>Joe Rogan.</v>

3374
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:36.083
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>

3375
01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:36.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3376
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:36.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3377
01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:37.571
<v Speaker 6>believe it or not,</v>

3378
01:38:37.571 --> 01:38:38.500
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm saying,</v>

3379
01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:38.800
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3380
01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.910
<v Speaker 6>or some of the things that I've said,</v>

3381
01:38:39.911 --> 01:38:41.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm a big supporter of law enforcement too.</v>

3382
01:38:41.770 --> 01:38:42.940
<v Speaker 6>I think it's very important.</v>

3383
01:38:42.970 --> 01:38:43.990
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a,</v>

3384
01:38:43.991 --> 01:38:46.270
<v Speaker 6>they're underappreciated and it's not their gig.</v>

3385
01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.430
<v Speaker 6>The actual officers on the street don't make these rules.</v>

3386
01:38:48.490 --> 01:38:49.450
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

3387
01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:50.081
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

3388
01:38:50.081 --> 01:38:51.940
<v Speaker 6>And I think most of them are good guys.</v>

3389
01:38:51.941 --> 01:38:53.290
<v Speaker 6>They have the hardest job in the world.</v>

3390
01:38:53.291 --> 01:38:54.360
<v Speaker 6>It's really difficult.</v>

3391
01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:54.550
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3392
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:58.060
<v Speaker 6>you're protecting people from bad people and it's a,</v>

3393
01:38:58.061 --> 01:38:59.290
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to have bad people,</v>

3394
01:38:59.291 --> 01:39:00.250
<v Speaker 6>you're going to need cops.</v>

3395
01:39:00.610 --> 01:39:00.911
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

3396
01:39:00.911 --> 01:39:01.810
<v Speaker 6>the issue is one,</v>

3397
01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.460
<v Speaker 6>one bad one exists.</v>

3398
01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:04.570
<v Speaker 6>It makes it,</v>

3399
01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.290
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

3400
01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:05.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3401
01:39:05.710 --> 01:39:07.600
<v Speaker 6>it was 110 people in New Jersey.</v>

3402
01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:08.260
<v Speaker 6>Douchebag,</v>

3403
01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:09.011
<v Speaker 6>probably not even,</v>

3404
01:39:09.011 --> 01:39:10.210
<v Speaker 6>it's probably like one out of 20.</v>

3405
01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.390
<v Speaker 6>But when you think about jersey,</v>

3406
01:39:11.410 --> 01:39:12.420
<v Speaker 6>think about Douche bags.</v>

3407
01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:13.230
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

3408
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:14.660
<v Speaker 5>and what the laws,</v>

3409
01:39:14.661 --> 01:39:16.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean the cops just enforce the laws.</v>

3410
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:17.211
<v Speaker 5>They don't write them,</v>

3411
01:39:17.211 --> 01:39:18.020
<v Speaker 5>they don't make them,</v>

3412
01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:19.780
<v Speaker 5>they don't decide what's constitutional,</v>

3413
01:39:19.781 --> 01:39:20.201
<v Speaker 5>what's not.</v>

3414
01:39:20.201 --> 01:39:20.841
<v Speaker 5>And it's also,</v>

3415
01:39:20.841 --> 01:39:23.820
<v Speaker 5>they're dealing with fucking bad people all day long.</v>

3416
01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.753
<v Speaker 5>Every day.</v>

3417
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:27.500
<v Speaker 5>They're dealing with people that are too many crimes,</v>

3418
01:39:27.501 --> 01:39:28.490
<v Speaker 5>trying to get away with things,</v>

3419
01:39:28.491 --> 01:39:29.091
<v Speaker 5>lying to them,</v>

3420
01:39:29.091 --> 01:39:30.500
<v Speaker 5>constantly shooting at them.</v>

3421
01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:32.090
<v Speaker 5>When I was a reporter,</v>

3422
01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:32.751
<v Speaker 5>we had a lot of,</v>

3423
01:39:32.751 --> 01:39:32.990
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3424
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3425
01:39:33.230 --> 01:39:35.150
<v Speaker 5>you develop relationships with these people.</v>

3426
01:39:35.410 --> 01:39:35.900
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3427
01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.610
<v Speaker 5>and you do it at the weirdest times.</v>

3428
01:39:37.611 --> 01:39:39.170
<v Speaker 5>I would go out to these murder scenes.</v>

3429
01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.600
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like four in the morning in the rain.</v>

3430
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:43.070
<v Speaker 5>You're seeing the same guy,</v>

3431
01:39:43.071 --> 01:39:43.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3432
01:39:43.251 --> 01:39:46.250
<v Speaker 5>the same watch guy you see all the time in the field and,</v>

3433
01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.480
<v Speaker 5>or you call them.</v>

3434
01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:48.470
<v Speaker 5>When I was at ABC here,</v>

3435
01:39:48.471 --> 01:39:48.681
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3436
01:39:48.681 --> 01:39:49.310
<v Speaker 5>I used to do the,</v>

3437
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:50.121
<v Speaker 5>the beat checks.</v>

3438
01:39:50.121 --> 01:39:50.990
<v Speaker 5>They're called a news,</v>

3439
01:39:50.991 --> 01:39:53.900
<v Speaker 5>which is where you call all these police divisions and you're talking to the</v>

3440
01:39:53.901 --> 01:39:54.770
<v Speaker 5>same poor guy.</v>

3441
01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:57.370
<v Speaker 5>It's midnight and I'm calling the same guy how you do.</v>

3442
01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:57.830
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

3443
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:58.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3444
01:39:58.221 --> 01:40:01.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're just working schleps like the rest of us.</v>

3445
01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:01.881
<v Speaker 5>And you know what,</v>

3446
01:40:01.881 --> 01:40:06.190
<v Speaker 5>how many of us would perform any better after five years on the job with guys</v>

3447
01:40:06.191 --> 01:40:06.751
<v Speaker 5>shooting you?</v>

3448
01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:07.910
<v Speaker 5>That insane pressure.</v>

3449
01:40:07.911 --> 01:40:08.744
<v Speaker 5>It's insane pressure.</v>

3450
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:09.893
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

3451
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:13.280
<v Speaker 5>to get back to the people who are really responsible for this other people,</v>

3452
01:40:13.281 --> 01:40:15.550
<v Speaker 5>we elect that and boat wall.</v>

3453
01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:16.101
<v Speaker 5>It's also,</v>

3454
01:40:16.101 --> 01:40:21.101
<v Speaker 5>I think that as a society we have to put much more emphasis in our schools and</v>

3455
01:40:22.371 --> 01:40:24.230
<v Speaker 5>much more in our police force.</v>

3456
01:40:24.231 --> 01:40:25.100
<v Speaker 5>I think police,</v>

3457
01:40:25.101 --> 01:40:25.934
<v Speaker 5>fire,</v>

3458
01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.400
<v Speaker 5>EMT and schools,</v>

3459
01:40:28.401 --> 01:40:29.360
<v Speaker 5>it's the,</v>

3460
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:31.340
<v Speaker 5>there should be so much more money</v>

3461
01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:34.080
<v Speaker 6>dedicated to these areas so much more.</v>

3462
01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:35.380
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

3463
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:36.040
<v Speaker 6>it's really,</v>

3464
01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:36.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3465
01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:40.920
<v Speaker 6>a crime of society that we've allowed our politicians and the people in office</v>

3466
01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.030
<v Speaker 6>to allocate so much resources to other parts of the country while ignoring the,</v>

3467
01:40:45.031 --> 01:40:45.240
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3468
01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:47.070
<v Speaker 6>there are problems that we have here at home.</v>

3469
01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's anything wrong with help big out less fortunate countries,</v>

3470
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:56.630
<v Speaker 6>but the way we do it under the guise of military invasion and the amount of</v>

3471
01:40:57.531 --> 01:41:00.350
<v Speaker 6>money that goes to that and where that money goes and you look at how much</v>

3472
01:41:00.351 --> 01:41:03.550
<v Speaker 6>Halliburton has made off this fucking war and weapons manufacturers for me</v>

3473
01:41:03.551 --> 01:41:06.780
<v Speaker 6>enough this war that is really a,</v>

3474
01:41:06.781 --> 01:41:09.320
<v Speaker 6>a criminal misallocation of funds.</v>

3475
01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:10.560
<v Speaker 4>I was recently,</v>

3476
01:41:10.561 --> 01:41:12.270
<v Speaker 4>and this is a weird story in and of itself,</v>

3477
01:41:12.271 --> 01:41:14.220
<v Speaker 4>my listeners know about it cause I did a show on it.</v>

3478
01:41:14.490 --> 01:41:19.490
<v Speaker 4>I was invited to a Centcom US Central Command planning session not that long</v>

3479
01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:20.850
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

3480
01:41:20.850 --> 01:41:22.050
<v Speaker 4>They flew me to DC.</v>

3481
01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:22.681
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3482
01:41:22.681 --> 01:41:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Put me up in a hotel.</v>

3483
01:41:23.551 --> 01:41:26.800
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was assured that they were going to kill me and throw my body into</v>

3484
01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:29.350
<v Speaker 4>Potomac and this was all an excuse to get me over there too.</v>

3485
01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:31.960
<v Speaker 6>You refrained from jerking off in the hotel room because he felt like was a</v>

3486
01:41:31.961 --> 01:41:32.241
<v Speaker 6>camera.</v>

3487
01:41:32.241 --> 01:41:32.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3488
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:33.020
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3489
01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.240
<v Speaker 4>I assume there was a camera in there.</v>

3490
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3491
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:36.500
<v Speaker 4>do you want to Cameron,</v>

3492
01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:36.770
<v Speaker 4>Eric,</v>

3493
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:41.060
<v Speaker 4>but went in there probably more of a time problem I was dealing with there.</v>

3494
01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:42.970
<v Speaker 4>I was very rushed but I,</v>

3495
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:46.280
<v Speaker 4>but you arrive there and it was all these people with these amazing,</v>

3496
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:48.860
<v Speaker 4>I said they must have been thrilled to have me on the guest list because there</v>

3497
01:41:48.861 --> 01:41:52.130
<v Speaker 4>were only 12 participants and they all had these massively doctor,</v>

3498
01:41:52.131 --> 01:41:53.660
<v Speaker 4>this and that from this institution.</v>

3499
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:55.910
<v Speaker 4>And then Dan Carlin podcaster and it was just,</v>

3500
01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.020
<v Speaker 4>they had to be thrilled.</v>

3501
01:41:57.021 --> 01:41:57.854
<v Speaker 4>I was there.</v>

3502
01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:01.010
<v Speaker 4>But the first question I asked these folks,</v>

3503
01:42:01.011 --> 01:42:01.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was the,</v>

3504
01:42:01.501 --> 01:42:01.671
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3505
01:42:01.671 --> 01:42:04.250
<v Speaker 4>the general that was there was the head of US Central Command.</v>

3506
01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:06.530
<v Speaker 4>The vice admiral was there and I said,</v>

3507
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:09.830
<v Speaker 4>what are us taxpayers get from all of this?</v>

3508
01:42:09.831 --> 01:42:10.281
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

3509
01:42:10.281 --> 01:42:14.270
<v Speaker 4>if we're going to go cost to benefit and you talk about vital us national</v>

3510
01:42:14.271 --> 01:42:15.010
<v Speaker 4>security and this,</v>

3511
01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:15.890
<v Speaker 4>that or this other area,</v>

3512
01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:21.020
<v Speaker 4>what is the average us taxpayer who's paying for this get for all of this?</v>

3513
01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Now there was no good answer and it's not these guys job to answer it.</v>

3514
01:42:23.991 --> 01:42:24.824
<v Speaker 4>They don't make policy.</v>

3515
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:26.090
<v Speaker 4>They're like cops too.</v>

3516
01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:27.320
<v Speaker 4>They don't make policy,</v>

3517
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:29.360
<v Speaker 4>but you want to ask your representatives,</v>

3518
01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3519
01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:30.441
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3520
01:42:30.441 --> 01:42:33.200
<v Speaker 4>I know you say we need to be here and there to protect our security,</v>

3521
01:42:33.201 --> 01:42:35.300
<v Speaker 4>but really what does the United States,</v>

3522
01:42:35.301 --> 01:42:37.040
<v Speaker 4>from what I get from our involvement in the Middle East,</v>

3523
01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:38.270
<v Speaker 4>the oil situations,</v>

3524
01:42:38.271 --> 01:42:40.460
<v Speaker 4>not like it was in the early seventies we're not going to be,</v>

3525
01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:43.730
<v Speaker 4>there's not going to be petro blackmail like there wasn't the old days.</v>

3526
01:42:43.731 --> 01:42:45.320
<v Speaker 4>It's one big giant oil market.</v>

3527
01:42:45.321 --> 01:42:49.100
<v Speaker 4>Now why do we get to be the people to pay for this if it's,</v>

3528
01:42:49.101 --> 01:42:51.140
<v Speaker 4>if it's for the entire world's sake,</v>

3529
01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:53.410
<v Speaker 4>why isn't the entire world paying for,</v>

3530
01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:56.360
<v Speaker 4>why aren't their soldiers dying in the field as much as ours are?</v>

3531
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean these are the kinds of questions we talked earlier about why can't we</v>

3532
01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:00.920
<v Speaker 4>have a national debate about this?</v>

3533
01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:04.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if the answer comes from the wrong side of what I consider to be</v>

3534
01:43:04.671 --> 01:43:05.504
<v Speaker 4>right or wrong,</v>

3535
01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:06.860
<v Speaker 4>but let's just talk about it.</v>

3536
01:43:06.861 --> 01:43:09.410
<v Speaker 4>And I have this conspiracy theory that the reason we don't have these national</v>

3537
01:43:09.411 --> 01:43:12.080
<v Speaker 4>debates is cause some of this stuff is just indefensible.</v>

3538
01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.680
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing with President Obama trying to say it's okay to kill</v>

3539
01:43:15.681 --> 01:43:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Americans with drones.</v>

3540
01:43:16.581 --> 01:43:19.550
<v Speaker 4>You don't hear him talk about it cause I don't think you can get up and make</v>

3541
01:43:19.551 --> 01:43:20.384
<v Speaker 4>that case.</v>

3542
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:22.030
<v Speaker 4>And so just don't talk about it.</v>

3543
01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:23.150
<v Speaker 4>If you can't win an argument,</v>

3544
01:43:23.151 --> 01:43:24.080
<v Speaker 4>don't have the argument.</v>

3545
01:43:24.450 --> 01:43:24.691
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3546
01:43:24.691 --> 01:43:27.810
<v Speaker 6>That's the reason why I've never heard a politician bring up cigarettes.</v>

3547
01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:32.070
<v Speaker 6>You'll hear politicians talk about alcohol or drugs and even prescription</v>

3548
01:43:32.071 --> 01:43:33.270
<v Speaker 6>medications being issues.</v>

3549
01:43:33.271 --> 01:43:35.160
<v Speaker 6>You never hear him talking about cigarettes ever.</v>

3550
01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:36.030
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

3551
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:39.330
<v Speaker 6>Cause they spend billions of dollars to keep politicians from talking about</v>

3552
01:43:39.331 --> 01:43:40.164
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes.</v>

3553
01:43:40.890 --> 01:43:41.100
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3554
01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:44.820
<v Speaker 6>hundreds of thousands of people die every year from cigarettes.</v>

3555
01:43:44.821 --> 01:43:46.200
<v Speaker 6>He would think that's a real health issue.</v>

3556
01:43:46.230 --> 01:43:46.531
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3557
01:43:46.531 --> 01:43:47.101
<v Speaker 6>it's obesity.</v>

3558
01:43:47.101 --> 01:43:47.934
<v Speaker 6>We've got problems.</v>

3559
01:43:48.130 --> 01:43:48.300
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3560
01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:49.290
<v Speaker 6>we've got problems with cancer,</v>

3561
01:43:49.291 --> 01:43:50.400
<v Speaker 6>we've got problems with AIDS.</v>

3562
01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:51.110
<v Speaker 6>We've got,</v>

3563
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 6>we have problems with the</v>

3564
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.740
<v Speaker 5>fucking some poison that they sell at every corner.</v>

3565
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 5>But the people that sell that poison,</v>

3566
01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:58.160
<v Speaker 5>kick it back upstairs.</v>

3567
01:43:58.190 --> 01:43:59.300
<v Speaker 5>But this is nothing new.</v>

3568
01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:00.980
<v Speaker 5>This is part of how,</v>

3569
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3570
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:02.360
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

3571
01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.440
<v Speaker 5>as I said to somebody else,</v>

3572
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:04.041
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

3573
01:44:04.041 --> 01:44:05.780
<v Speaker 5>I should say I'm before cigarettes.</v>

3574
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.740
<v Speaker 5>If you want to smoke cigarettes,</v>

3575
01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:07.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3576
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:08.480
<v Speaker 5>I think cigarettes should be illegal.</v>

3577
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:09.430
<v Speaker 5>Stop talking about cigarettes.</v>

3578
01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:12.500
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

3579
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:12.900
<v Speaker 5>but listen,</v>

3580
01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.350
<v Speaker 5>I know I'm not trying to stop people except my friends.</v>

3581
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:17.330
<v Speaker 5>Every country in the world is corrupt.</v>

3582
01:44:17.331 --> 01:44:17.511
<v Speaker 5>Don't,</v>

3583
01:44:17.511 --> 01:44:18.650
<v Speaker 5>don't think that there's any government,</v>

3584
01:44:18.651 --> 01:44:18.751
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

3585
01:44:18.751 --> 01:44:19.251
<v Speaker 5>Sweden,</v>

3586
01:44:19.251 --> 01:44:19.491
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

3587
01:44:19.491 --> 01:44:22.520
<v Speaker 5>which always ranks in the top three or four is the least corrupt nations of the</v>

3588
01:44:22.521 --> 01:44:24.580
<v Speaker 5>world still has corruption there.</v>

3589
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.980
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>

3590
01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:26.270
<v Speaker 5>why Swiss chicks are hot?</v>

3591
01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:26.850
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3592
01:44:26.850 --> 01:44:28.940
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about Sweden and the two confused,</v>

3593
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 5>but we dish every country has been corruption.</v>

3594
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:36.180
<v Speaker 5>There's a tipping point as Sweden's number one on your list of I confused those</v>

3595
01:44:36.210 --> 01:44:36.490
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>

3596
01:44:36.490 --> 01:44:36.681
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3597
01:44:36.681 --> 01:44:37.161
<v Speaker 5>if you go there,</v>

3598
01:44:37.161 --> 01:44:38.180
<v Speaker 5>they won't be any confusion.</v>

3599
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.780
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3600
01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:41.010
<v Speaker 5>if you have the number one least corrupt country,</v>

3601
01:44:41.011 --> 01:44:41.760
<v Speaker 5>Sweden and that,</v>

3602
01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.360
<v Speaker 5>and the per the country at the bottom of the list is Nigeria,</v>

3603
01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:49.430
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you that government can function well a certain distance down that</v>

3604
01:44:49.431 --> 01:44:49.760
<v Speaker 5>list.</v>

3605
01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.810
<v Speaker 5>There's a tipping point,</v>

3606
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.831
<v Speaker 5>I think if you say,</v>

3607
01:44:51.831 --> 01:44:52.071
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3608
01:44:52.071 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 5>do you know the United States has always been corrupt?</v>

3609
01:44:53.811 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 5>Look at how things were in the 1950s.</v>

3610
01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:56.121
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3611
01:44:56.121 --> 01:44:58.220
<v Speaker 5>but we were still able to function.</v>

3612
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.611
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3613
01:44:58.611 --> 01:44:59.960
<v Speaker 5>the corruption was not so much of,</v>

3614
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:02.150
<v Speaker 5>it's like if you have a physical impediment and you say,</v>

3615
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.481
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3616
01:45:02.481 --> 01:45:03.171
<v Speaker 5>I limp around,</v>

3617
01:45:03.171 --> 01:45:04.160
<v Speaker 5>but I still get around.</v>

3618
01:45:04.161 --> 01:45:04.790
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3619
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:07.340
<v Speaker 5>and your knee gets much worse and all of a sudden you can't walk.</v>

3620
01:45:07.341 --> 01:45:07.630
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

3621
01:45:07.630 --> 01:45:10.790
<v Speaker 5>there's a tipping point not walking as a whole different thing than limping</v>

3622
01:45:10.791 --> 01:45:11.211
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>

3623
01:45:11.211 --> 01:45:12.020
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3624
01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.890
<v Speaker 5>Our government was always corrupt from the very beginning of the republic.</v>

3625
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:18.650
<v Speaker 5>We've just reached a point where it doesn't function any well then it's so</v>

3626
01:45:18.651 --> 01:45:18.980
<v Speaker 5>corrupt.</v>

3627
01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:23.180
<v Speaker 5>It's also that it is not just that it's so much more corrupt than ever before.</v>

3628
01:45:23.181 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 5>It's so much more transparent that it's corrupt because of our access to</v>

3629
01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:27.201
<v Speaker 5>information,</v>

3630
01:45:27.201 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 5>which is unprecedented and people are bewildered by it more than they ever have</v>

3631
01:45:32.151 --> 01:45:33.320
<v Speaker 5>been before because of this,</v>

3632
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 5>because if you go look and it's really simple,</v>

3633
01:45:35.511 --> 01:45:36.680
<v Speaker 5>just go looking real quick.</v>

3634
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:37.760
<v Speaker 5>Read any Matt tie.</v>

3635
01:45:37.761 --> 01:45:41.330
<v Speaker 5>He be article from rolling stone on on the financial crisis and you'll,</v>

3636
01:45:41.331 --> 01:45:41.780
<v Speaker 5>you'll,</v>

3637
01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:42.021
<v Speaker 5>you'll,</v>

3638
01:45:42.021 --> 01:45:42.291
<v Speaker 5>you'll,</v>

3639
01:45:42.291 --> 01:45:44.900
<v Speaker 5>you'll fucking pluck your eyebrows out screaming in the mirror.</v>

3640
01:45:44.901 --> 01:45:45.081
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

3641
01:45:45.081 --> 01:45:46.160
<v Speaker 5>you won't be able to feel,</v>

3642
01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:47.900
<v Speaker 5>you won't be able to feel like it makes any sense.</v>

3643
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you that this is the great wildcard though.</v>

3644
01:45:49.851 --> 01:45:52.670
<v Speaker 5>We alluded to this earlier when we talked about what at the sixties generation</v>

3645
01:45:52.671 --> 01:45:53.504
<v Speaker 5>had had the internet.</v>

3646
01:45:53.690 --> 01:45:54.523
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3647
01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:54.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3648
01:45:54.831 --> 01:45:59.831
<v Speaker 5>when you read about how much just printing presses change the world in terms of</v>

3649
01:46:00.651 --> 01:46:05.390
<v Speaker 5>just being able to disseminate English language bibles changed everything.</v>

3650
01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:06.770
<v Speaker 5>This w you know,</v>

3651
01:46:06.771 --> 01:46:07.401
<v Speaker 5>people forget,</v>

3652
01:46:07.401 --> 01:46:07.611
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3653
01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:08.990
<v Speaker 5>he's like you said 20 years ago,</v>

3654
01:46:09.150 --> 01:46:10.940
<v Speaker 5>it's like a blink of an eye when you've lived a while.</v>

3655
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.060
<v Speaker 5>This internet is still brand new.</v>

3656
01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:17.060
<v Speaker 5>We haven't begun to see what it's going to do yet and we haven't had these</v>

3657
01:46:17.061 --> 01:46:17.930
<v Speaker 5>situations.</v>

3658
01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:18.891
<v Speaker 5>Like you were saying,</v>

3659
01:46:18.891 --> 01:46:21.950
<v Speaker 5>these little tipping point moments where all of a sudden the Internet makes all</v>

3660
01:46:21.951 --> 01:46:23.000
<v Speaker 5>the difference in the world.</v>

3661
01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:27.980
<v Speaker 5>If the stupid printing press changes the world to the degree that did,</v>

3662
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:32.180
<v Speaker 5>what's this going to do and how are the authorities going to react when it</v>

3663
01:46:32.181 --> 01:46:33.080
<v Speaker 5>starts to doing it?</v>

3664
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.591
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3665
01:46:33.591 --> 01:46:33.801
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3666
01:46:33.801 --> 01:46:36.350
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about anonymous before the whole show started.</v>

3667
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.480
<v Speaker 5>That's just the tip of the iceberg.</v>

3668
01:46:38.481 --> 01:46:42.950
<v Speaker 5>What happens when this isn't some little teeny group on the fringes that's doing</v>

3669
01:46:42.951 --> 01:46:43.280
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>

3670
01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.600
<v Speaker 5>What happens when 40% of the population is so mad and maybe 20% of them are the</v>

3671
01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 5>right wing guys who think that they need the guns to stop the government.</v>

3672
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:53.250
<v Speaker 4>20% of them are the left wing guys that are so mad that they can't get,</v>

3673
01:46:53.290 --> 01:46:53.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3674
01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.353
<v Speaker 4>something else that they,</v>

3675
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:58.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean what happens when all these people are operating at cross purposes and</v>

3676
01:46:58.261 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 4>the Internet is this highway that lets them all talk in a way that during the</v>

3677
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:05.880
<v Speaker 4>1960 [inaudible] they would have been doing mimeographed letters on a copy</v>

3678
01:47:05.881 --> 01:47:09.790
<v Speaker 4>machine handing each other than by hand meeting in the park and this foam soap</v>

3679
01:47:09.791 --> 01:47:11.100
<v Speaker 4>box and on the phone.</v>

3680
01:47:11.101 --> 01:47:11.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is,</v>

3681
01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:12.300
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3682
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.700
<v Speaker 4>we have not yet begun to see what this is going to do.</v>

3683
01:47:14.701 --> 01:47:15.360
<v Speaker 4>Change.</v>

3684
01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:15.841
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>

3685
01:47:15.841 --> 01:47:20.841
<v Speaker 6>And I also think that this is just the beginning of what seems to be an ever</v>

3686
01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 6>increasing access to each other,</v>

3687
01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 6>access to information,</v>

3688
01:47:25.561 --> 01:47:27.300
<v Speaker 6>the ability to reach and connect with each other.</v>

3689
01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:30.750
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's going to eventually lead to something that's going to allow</v>

3690
01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:32.970
<v Speaker 6>people to read each other's minds.</v>

3691
01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:34.170
<v Speaker 6>I think we're going to,</v>

3692
01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:34.560
<v Speaker 6>we're a,</v>

3693
01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.560
<v Speaker 6>our eventual connection is going to be through some sort of wireless and neuro</v>

3694
01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:44.940
<v Speaker 6>frequency connection where we're going to be able to exchange information</v>

3695
01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:46.890
<v Speaker 6>without having to talk to each other.</v>

3696
01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.451
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

3697
01:47:47.451 --> 01:47:47.641
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

3698
01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:49.870
<v Speaker 4>you see the upside and that I see the downside.</v>

3699
01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:52.860
<v Speaker 4>What happens with the government reads your mind and it's,</v>

3700
01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3701
01:47:53.170 --> 01:47:54.010
<v Speaker 4>we just bypass.</v>

3702
01:47:54.011 --> 01:47:54.611
<v Speaker 4>This was just something,</v>

3703
01:47:54.611 --> 01:47:56.440
<v Speaker 4>it's too dangerous for an individual to have,</v>

3704
01:47:56.441 --> 01:47:58.900
<v Speaker 4>but we'll be able to watch you on your computers.</v>

3705
01:47:59.730 --> 01:48:01.620
<v Speaker 6>Government will become victims of themselves,</v>

3706
01:48:01.621 --> 01:48:02.441
<v Speaker 6>much like portray.</v>

3707
01:48:02.441 --> 01:48:07.290
<v Speaker 6>This has become a victim of this whole spy network and the ability to access</v>

3708
01:48:07.291 --> 01:48:08.240
<v Speaker 6>information that's been on</v>

3709
01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:08.690
<v Speaker 4>precedent.</v>

3710
01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:09.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry it was betray us.</v>

3711
01:48:09.771 --> 01:48:10.311
<v Speaker 4>An idiot.</v>

3712
01:48:10.311 --> 01:48:10.791
<v Speaker 4>Can I just,</v>

3713
01:48:10.791 --> 01:48:11.540
<v Speaker 4>can I just say this?</v>

3714
01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:13.310
<v Speaker 4>You're the head of the CIA</v>

3715
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:17.650
<v Speaker 4>and you think that they're not going to find out that you have it.</v>

3716
01:48:17.670 --> 01:48:17.961
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3717
01:48:17.961 --> 01:48:18.680
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing,</v>

3718
01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:19.010
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3719
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:20.180
<v Speaker 4>you talk about something weird.</v>

3720
01:48:20.181 --> 01:48:20.690
<v Speaker 4>There's something,</v>

3721
01:48:20.690 --> 01:48:23.010
<v Speaker 4>there's some little x there that we don't know about.</v>

3722
01:48:23.011 --> 01:48:23.844
<v Speaker 4>It's Ben Gazi.</v>

3723
01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3724
01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:25.313
<v Speaker 4>Ben Gazi.</v>

3725
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.581
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3726
01:48:25.581 --> 01:48:26.010
<v Speaker 4>for real.</v>

3727
01:48:26.010 --> 01:48:28.040
<v Speaker 4>I haven't figured out the Ben Gazi thing either.</v>

3728
01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:28.791
<v Speaker 6>I haven't either.</v>

3729
01:48:28.791 --> 01:48:31.120
<v Speaker 6>But there is connection and that's,</v>

3730
01:48:31.121 --> 01:48:33.290
<v Speaker 6>that's pretty much been established that they are there.</v>

3731
01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:37.010
<v Speaker 6>They're shielding by one of the things they're doing with punishing,</v>

3732
01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:41.360
<v Speaker 6>betray us in this way and going after him is acknowledging his failures in</v>

3733
01:48:41.361 --> 01:48:42.650
<v Speaker 6>Benghazi and the,</v>

3734
01:48:42.690 --> 01:48:47.090
<v Speaker 6>there's a sort of an internal motivation to get rid of him outside of just the</v>

3735
01:48:47.091 --> 01:48:49.370
<v Speaker 6>fact that the FBI busted him with an affair.</v>

3736
01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:53.750
<v Speaker 6>What I found most fascinating about this was first of all that the head spook</v>

3737
01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:54.860
<v Speaker 6>got spooked on.</v>

3738
01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean they,</v>

3739
01:48:56.110 --> 01:48:56.620
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3740
01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:57.090
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3741
01:48:57.090 --> 01:49:01.100
<v Speaker 6>and then that even when you're a general,</v>

3742
01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:04.310
<v Speaker 6>you're dealing with the kind of girl was going to fuck you when you're married</v>

3743
01:49:04.311 --> 01:49:05.630
<v Speaker 6>is crazy bitch.</v>

3744
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:06.560
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3745
01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.780
<v Speaker 6>And the kind of chick that's going to be your,</v>

3746
01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:13.160
<v Speaker 6>your mistress when she writes a book about you that that's going to be a</v>

3747
01:49:13.161 --> 01:49:13.811
<v Speaker 6>territorial,</v>

3748
01:49:13.811 --> 01:49:13.950
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3749
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:15.140
<v Speaker 4>that's a Greek tragedy.</v>

3750
01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:18.320
<v Speaker 4>And that goes back to him either a Greek plays that play off.</v>

3751
01:49:18.321 --> 01:49:19.250
<v Speaker 4>That's why I love it.</v>

3752
01:49:19.251 --> 01:49:20.870
<v Speaker 4>There's something that's so wonderfully,</v>

3753
01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3754
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:25.940
<v Speaker 4>we all have these tragic flaws and it's like that guy was born with that and</v>

3755
01:49:25.941 --> 01:49:27.410
<v Speaker 4>then he was like faded.</v>

3756
01:49:27.411 --> 01:49:28.041
<v Speaker 4>The Greeks would say,</v>

3757
01:49:28.041 --> 01:49:31.040
<v Speaker 4>it was like written into his faith that I'm going to have this wonderful</v>

3758
01:49:31.041 --> 01:49:31.680
<v Speaker 4>military career,</v>

3759
01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:36.680
<v Speaker 4>be respected by everybody and then I'm going to be brought low by so silly.</v>

3760
01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:39.080
<v Speaker 4>Bring yourself to the world of Oj Simpson.</v>

3761
01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:42.530
<v Speaker 4>I was just talking about that with my wife the other day.</v>

3762
01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:43.513
<v Speaker 4>We're watching them,</v>

3763
01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.840
<v Speaker 4>one of those top 10 footballs,</v>

3764
01:49:44.841 --> 01:49:45.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3765
01:49:45.021 --> 01:49:48.340
<v Speaker 4>greatest running backs of all time road and they're screwing poor Oj Simpson.</v>

3766
01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:48.791
<v Speaker 5>Nothing he's but,</v>

3767
01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:49.810
<v Speaker 5>but as a football player,</v>

3768
01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 5>if you remember how great he was and you know,</v>

3769
01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 5>they're putting like Tim Teebo or something ahead of him.</v>

3770
01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:55.451
<v Speaker 5>I'm going,</v>

3771
01:49:55.451 --> 01:49:55.631

3772
01:49:55.631 --> 01:49:58.180
<v Speaker 5>he's just getting rooked because of what he did off the phone.</v>

3773
01:49:58.181 --> 01:49:59.014
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3774
01:49:59.370 --> 01:49:59.580

3785
01:50:07.061 --> 01:50:08.920
<v Speaker 5>don't take away what he did on the field.</v>

3786
01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.170
<v Speaker 5>Oj Simpson was the most beautiful runner I ever saw.</v>

3787
01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 5>Barry Sanders was the most exciting,</v>

3788
01:50:12.551 --> 01:50:15.030
<v Speaker 5>but Oj Simpson was the most beautiful runner I ever saw.</v>

3789
01:50:15.370 --> 01:50:16.203
<v Speaker 5>And he's a,</v>

3790
01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:16.961
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's one of the,</v>

3791
01:50:16.961 --> 01:50:18.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's a terrible person.</v>

3792
01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:18.940
<v Speaker 5>We all know this now,</v>

3793
01:50:18.941 --> 01:50:19.870
<v Speaker 5>but God,</v>

3794
01:50:19.871 --> 01:50:20.380
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

3795
01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:25.380
<v Speaker 5>you know Oj Simpson was was the best and what a world changing moment for him.</v>

3796
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:26.130
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3797
01:50:26.130 --> 01:50:26.700
<v Speaker 5>To Go.</v>

3798
01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:28.210
<v Speaker 5>What a bad decision.</v>

3799
01:50:28.211 --> 01:50:29.044
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3800
01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 5>I could go back and take it back.</v>

3801
01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.830
<v Speaker 5>I know you think about that all the time.</v>

3802
01:50:32.831 --> 01:50:36.820
<v Speaker 5>The one moment that if I could just have that day or it's a groundhog day thing,</v>

3803
01:50:36.821 --> 01:50:38.740
<v Speaker 5>if I could just do that whole day differently.</v>

3804
01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:39.940
<v Speaker 5>The betrays thing.</v>

3805
01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:40.840
<v Speaker 5>Even though it's bad,</v>

3806
01:50:40.841 --> 01:50:44.200
<v Speaker 5>he still gets to bang that chick and she's way over AA still gets the pension.</v>

3807
01:50:44.201 --> 01:50:45.034
<v Speaker 5>That's all you care.</v>

3808
01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:46.620
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's still get his bomb shit.</v>

3809
01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:48.070
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe not the CIA one,</v>

3810
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:48.940
<v Speaker 5>but he gets the military,</v>

3811
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:51.570
<v Speaker 5>they have to give him a pension or he's going to start talking.</v>

3812
01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:52.160
<v Speaker 5>What do you want?</v>

3813
01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.850
<v Speaker 5>You want general Patraeus start writing books about shit really works.</v>

3814
01:50:54.851 --> 01:50:56.860
<v Speaker 5>I think that's when you have your Kennedy moment again.</v>

3815
01:50:56.861 --> 01:50:59.650
<v Speaker 5>General Patraeus knocked off in a visit to Guatemala.</v>

3816
01:50:59.700 --> 01:50:59.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3817
01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:02.350
<v Speaker 5>He's banging his mistress and her pussy explodes.</v>

3818
01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.510
<v Speaker 5>He's going to put Nitroglycerin in there.</v>

3819
01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:05.260
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

3820
01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:07.030
<v Speaker 5>the how you're off in the woods for me,</v>

3821
01:51:07.031 --> 01:51:09.520
<v Speaker 5>rogue going into territory.</v>

3822
01:51:09.521 --> 01:51:13.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't go to kill her too because this is Cheryl.</v>

3823
01:51:13.810 --> 01:51:16.000
<v Speaker 5>We knew this was going to happen in this show today.</v>

3824
01:51:16.001 --> 01:51:16.834
<v Speaker 5>Didn't we?</v>

3825
01:51:17.050 --> 01:51:18.280
<v Speaker 5>Pillow talk terrorism.</v>

3826
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:19.151
<v Speaker 5>That's what that is.</v>

3827
01:51:19.151 --> 01:51:20.110
<v Speaker 5>It's in the Patriot Act.</v>

3828
01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:20.900
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

3829
01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:21.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3830
01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:23.170
<v Speaker 5>she can't see who's doing pillow talk,</v>

3831
01:51:23.171 --> 01:51:23.681
<v Speaker 5>terrorism.</v>

3832
01:51:23.681 --> 01:51:25.510
<v Speaker 5>We had to take her out and uh,</v>

3833
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.750
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

3834
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:29.260
<v Speaker 5>it's unfortunate Patraeus was there but we clowned him so don't worry about it.</v>

3835
01:51:30.610 --> 01:51:31.510
<v Speaker 5>The poor guy.</v>

3836
01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:32.680
<v Speaker 5>And the whole thing is,</v>

3837
01:51:32.770 --> 01:51:35.490
<v Speaker 5>what's really tragic is you see the wife and you know,</v>

3838
01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:36.940
<v Speaker 5>his wife is sort of,</v>

3839
01:51:36.970 --> 01:51:39.850
<v Speaker 5>you let herself go over the years and I believe she had some health problems.</v>

3840
01:51:39.851 --> 01:51:40.840
<v Speaker 5>She's a little rather large.</v>

3841
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Remember in the military I think you can still be charged with adultery to which</v>

3842
01:51:44.041 --> 01:51:45.120
<v Speaker 5>you can't be nobody.</v>

3843
01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:48.700
<v Speaker 5>There is no law against adultery in the California penal code for an average</v>

3844
01:51:48.701 --> 01:51:49.060
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

3845
01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:51.670
<v Speaker 5>What's ironic about that is she taking trained killers,</v>

3846
01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:54.640
<v Speaker 5>putting them in an unbelievably stressful situations for months at a time away</v>

3847
01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:55.474
<v Speaker 5>from their wives.</v>

3848
01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:57.670
<v Speaker 5>And you're saying that if you're an adulterer,</v>

3849
01:51:57.671 --> 01:52:01.750
<v Speaker 5>we can court marshal yet goes back to the military code of honor,</v>

3850
01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:04.120
<v Speaker 5>which of course there's a lot of other things you could do that would seem to</v>

3851
01:52:04.121 --> 01:52:05.590
<v Speaker 5>violate the military code of honor,</v>

3852
01:52:05.591 --> 01:52:06.251
<v Speaker 5>but don't have,</v>

3853
01:52:06.251 --> 01:52:06.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3854
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:07.990
<v Speaker 5>don't have adulterous affairs.</v>

3855
01:52:07.991 --> 01:52:10.660
<v Speaker 5>I just thought it was beautiful that the head spooked got spooked on.</v>

3856
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:11.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

3857
01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:11.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3858
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.651
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

3859
01:52:11.651 --> 01:52:16.651
<v Speaker 5>It's not that to me that's a symptom of something else because he's not a dumb</v>

3860
01:52:17.081 --> 01:52:17.830
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

3861
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:20.500
<v Speaker 5>And yet what you're going to do when they arrive and they said,</v>

3862
01:52:20.501 --> 01:52:20.861
<v Speaker 5>guess what?</v>

3863
01:52:20.861 --> 01:52:21.490
<v Speaker 5>We found out?</v>

3864
01:52:21.490 --> 01:52:22.570
<v Speaker 5>Do you think he was shot?</v>

3865
01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:23.261
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3866
01:52:23.261 --> 01:52:24.670
<v Speaker 5>How did you find out about that?</v>

3867
01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:25.270
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3868
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:27.310
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what it is when,</v>

3869
01:52:27.311 --> 01:52:27.970
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

3870
01:52:27.970 --> 01:52:32.380
<v Speaker 5>they were together for over a year while they wrote that book.</v>

3871
01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.250
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3872
01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:34.720
<v Speaker 5>And when you know,</v>

3873
01:52:34.730 --> 01:52:37.710
<v Speaker 5>you can start off with a girl who's attempt trust,</v>

3874
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:39.190
<v Speaker 5>like how you've analyzed this,</v>

3875
01:52:39.191 --> 01:52:42.010
<v Speaker 5>I've analyzed this very carefully because that woman is marked much,</v>

3876
01:52:42.011 --> 01:52:44.770
<v Speaker 5>much more attractive as a woman than he is as a man.</v>

3877
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:45.331
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3878
01:52:45.331 --> 01:52:46.050
<v Speaker 5>but he's a man of</v>

3879
01:52:46.050 --> 01:52:46.400
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

3880
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>

3881
01:52:46.650 --> 01:52:48.090
<v Speaker 1>that happens all the time.</v>

3882
01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:48.570
<v Speaker 1>She does.</v>

3883
01:52:48.570 --> 01:52:49.710
<v Speaker 1>She do in with him.</v>

3884
01:52:49.711 --> 01:52:51.330
<v Speaker 1>That's Susan Anton and Dudley Moore.</v>

3885
01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3886
01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Well he's,</v>

3887
01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:53.431
<v Speaker 1>he's powerful.</v>

3888
01:52:53.431 --> 01:52:56.610
<v Speaker 1>He's the head of the CIA and she obviously in writing a book about that is,</v>

3889
01:52:56.611 --> 01:52:57.990
<v Speaker 1>is fascinated by that subject.</v>

3890
01:52:58.230 --> 01:52:59.880
<v Speaker 1>But I think a woman like that,</v>

3891
01:52:59.881 --> 01:53:02.010
<v Speaker 1>if she has access to a man like that,</v>

3892
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.700
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3893
01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:03.660
<v Speaker 1>he's going to break.</v>

3894
01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of time.</v>

3895
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.863
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter.</v>

3896
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:09.030
<v Speaker 1>He's going to decide this relationship is not working out that well and he wore,</v>

3897
01:53:09.031 --> 01:53:11.560
<v Speaker 1>he's going to decide it's something missing from his wife.</v>

3898
01:53:11.850 --> 01:53:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I love her as a friend,</v>

3899
01:53:13.291 --> 01:53:13.771
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

3900
01:53:13.771 --> 01:53:14.604
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>

3901
01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:15.571
<v Speaker 4>Power thing.</v>

3902
01:53:15.571 --> 01:53:16.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean these guys,</v>

3903
01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:17.730
<v Speaker 4>I think there's this,</v>

3904
01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:18.090
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3905
01:53:18.090 --> 01:53:19.800
<v Speaker 4>you get this sense and you see it with,</v>

3906
01:53:19.801 --> 01:53:21.300
<v Speaker 4>with celebrities all the time.</v>

3907
01:53:21.301 --> 01:53:25.320
<v Speaker 4>This sense get right back to Oj Simpson that I can get away with anything.</v>

3908
01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3909
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:26.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3910
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:27.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm not regular this,</v>

3911
01:53:27.331 --> 01:53:28.980
<v Speaker 4>that only applies to normal people.</v>

3912
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Well think that comes from a lot of people around you that are in a support</v>

3913
01:53:33.601 --> 01:53:36.840
<v Speaker 1>position that are constantly catering to you and kissing your ass.</v>

3914
01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I get it all the time.</v>

3915
01:53:38.401 --> 01:53:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding man to man?</v>

3916
01:53:40.150 --> 01:53:40.951
<v Speaker 1>As you see a bar,</v>

3917
01:53:40.951 --> 01:53:42.090
<v Speaker 1>a vast staff here,</v>

3918
01:53:42.091 --> 01:53:44.430
<v Speaker 1>number of women you have circulating around here?</v>

3919
01:53:44.431 --> 01:53:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3920
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3921
01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:45.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3922
01:53:45.570 --> 01:53:46.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3923
01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:46.651
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3924
01:53:46.651 --> 01:53:46.911
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3925
01:53:46.911 --> 01:53:51.660
<v Speaker 1>the celebrity thing is probably tenfold when you're dealing with a military man</v>

3926
01:53:51.661 --> 01:53:53.280
<v Speaker 1>who's a trained killer,</v>

3927
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:56.660
<v Speaker 1>who's been responsible for leading armies to battle.</v>

3928
01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:56.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

3929
01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:58.300
<v Speaker 4>And they live like puff daddy.</v>

3930
01:53:58.301 --> 01:53:58.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3931
01:53:58.601 --> 01:54:00.880
<v Speaker 4>they have limousines and I mean,</v>

3932
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.280
<v Speaker 4>they have the generals live very well.</v>

3933
01:54:03.281 --> 01:54:03.521
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3934
01:54:03.521 --> 01:54:05.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to begrudge them anything,</v>

3935
01:54:05.021 --> 01:54:06.730
<v Speaker 4>but if you get to the level of general,</v>

3936
01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:08.320
<v Speaker 4>it's quite a lifestyle.</v>

3937
01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:09.493
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3938
01:54:09.570 --> 01:54:09.960
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

3939
01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:10.200
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3940
01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:14.470
<v Speaker 4>and it's just as attractive a lifestyle to some outside entity as any other</v>

3941
01:54:14.471 --> 01:54:14.951
<v Speaker 4>celebrities.</v>

3942
01:54:14.951 --> 01:54:16.330
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not quite Elvis,</v>

3943
01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:17.403
<v Speaker 4>but you know.</v>

3944
01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:18.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3945
01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3946
01:54:19.091 --> 01:54:19.441
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3947
01:54:19.441 --> 01:54:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a man who's revered,</v>

3948
01:54:22.050 --> 01:54:25.260
<v Speaker 1>who publicly was a hero portrayal.</v>

3949
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3950
01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:28.180
<v Speaker 1>that was the military guy that you heard of.</v>

3951
01:54:28.181 --> 01:54:29.170
<v Speaker 1>General Petraeus.</v>

3952
01:54:29.290 --> 01:54:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Petraeus is moving the truth.</v>

3953
01:54:30.701 --> 01:54:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Patraeus is doing this.</v>

3954
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:33.160
<v Speaker 1>How different is this from Clinton?</v>

3955
01:54:33.161 --> 01:54:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Because I always think with Clinton and Lewinsky,</v>

3956
01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.790
<v Speaker 1>what are you an idiot?</v>

3957
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think,</v>

3958
01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:38.620
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3959
01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:40.930
<v Speaker 1>do you really think that girl's going to keep her mouth shut?</v>

3960
01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:41.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3961
01:54:41.410 --> 01:54:42.430
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to find out.</v>

3962
01:54:42.490 --> 01:54:42.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3963
01:54:42.731 --> 01:54:43.361
<v Speaker 1>to me these are,</v>

3964
01:54:43.361 --> 01:54:44.440
<v Speaker 1>these are flaws.</v>

3965
01:54:44.441 --> 01:54:44.981
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

3966
01:54:44.981 --> 01:54:48.460
<v Speaker 1>like a Greek tragedy because the minute you fall for that,</v>

3967
01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:49.571
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

3968
01:54:49.571 --> 01:54:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3969
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:53.650
<v Speaker 1>how can you be so smart in every other respect and yet not there?</v>

3970
01:54:53.710 --> 01:54:53.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3971
01:54:53.921 --> 01:54:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Clinton is a freak and I don't know if you know freaks,</v>

3972
01:54:56.651 --> 01:54:56.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3973
01:54:56.861 --> 01:54:57.371
<v Speaker 1>any freaks,</v>

3974
01:54:57.371 --> 01:54:57.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3975
01:54:57.551 --> 01:54:58.360
<v Speaker 1>any real freaks.</v>

3976
01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it depends on the definition.</v>

3977
01:55:00.610 --> 01:55:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that are freaks.</v>

3978
01:55:02.111 --> 01:55:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

3979
01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I have dudes that you could,</v>

3980
01:55:04.690 --> 01:55:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you could count on them doing something stupid if given the opportunity,</v>

3981
01:55:09.210 --> 01:55:10.300
<v Speaker 1>everybody in every other way,</v>

3982
01:55:10.301 --> 01:55:11.440
<v Speaker 1>they can be gifted and yeah,</v>

3983
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:12.280
<v Speaker 1>they can be brilliant.</v>

3984
01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.510
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to checks,</v>

3985
01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.340
<v Speaker 1>some guys just are off.</v>

3986
01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:16.331
<v Speaker 1>I could see that.</v>

3987
01:55:16.331 --> 01:55:17.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think Clinton is a freak.</v>

3988
01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I think you might be writing those dues that would just pull his dick out.</v>

3989
01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I think Clinton,</v>

3990
01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I think he did many times.</v>

3991
01:55:23.861 --> 01:55:24.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3992
01:55:24.101 --> 01:55:25.630
<v Speaker 1>that was the state trooper,</v>

3993
01:55:25.631 --> 01:55:25.971
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

3994
01:55:25.971 --> 01:55:26.441
<v Speaker 1>the police.</v>

3995
01:55:26.441 --> 01:55:27.274
<v Speaker 1>What was her name?</v>

3996
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:27.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3997

<v Speaker 1>what's a Paula Jones?</v>

3998
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Paula Jones said he's whipped and guy.</v>

3999
01:55:31.130 --> 01:55:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we just pull Paula Jones out?</v>

4000
01:55:33.281 --> 01:55:34.840
<v Speaker 1>That's how big of a deal it was at the time.</v>

4001
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4002

4003
01:55:35.950 --> 01:55:37.530
<v Speaker 1>she is fascinating to me too.</v>

4004
01:55:37.810 --> 01:55:39.960
<v Speaker 1>She eventually went on to do house,</v>

4005
01:55:40.050 --> 01:55:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Bulletproof.</v>

4085
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:15.250
<v Speaker 5>They'll never catch me.</v>

4086
01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.370
<v Speaker 5>If you think I'm having an extramarital affair,</v>

4087
01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:18.930
<v Speaker 5>tail me and find out.</v>

4088
01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.120
<v Speaker 5>And he was running for president while this was happening,</v>

4089
01:57:21.121 --> 01:57:22.260
<v Speaker 5>not just running for president member.</v>

4090
01:57:22.261 --> 01:57:25.680
<v Speaker 5>We had this conversation about how weak the competition was at the time.</v>

4091
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:29.160
<v Speaker 5>Gary Hart was huge compared to the people he,</v>

4092
01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:33.450
<v Speaker 5>he would've been running against like George Bush senior or something and it</v>

4093
01:57:33.451 --> 01:57:36.570
<v Speaker 5>would have been like having a Kennedy run against Nixon.</v>

4094
01:57:36.571 --> 01:57:38.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean it would have been slam dunk.</v>

4095
01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:40.550
<v Speaker 5>You're in and he taught,</v>

4096
01:57:40.570 --> 01:57:42.240
<v Speaker 5>there's a man who blew the presidency.</v>

4097
01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:43.320
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

4098
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:46.260
<v Speaker 5>And probably correctly now in hindsight.</v>

4099
01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:47.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4100
01:57:47.071 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 5>well probably for all of them.</v>

4101
01:57:48.841 --> 01:57:53.841
<v Speaker 5>I mean look again at Kennedy who was like one of our most loved president and</v>

4102
01:57:55.411 --> 01:57:57.330
<v Speaker 5>this gets back to your thing about 20 years and say,</v>

4103
01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:01.230
<v Speaker 5>do you realize how short a time Kennedy was in office?</v>

4104
01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:02.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like two and him,</v>

4105
01:58:02.651 --> 01:58:04.890
<v Speaker 5>you said he was in the middle of his first term.</v>

4106
01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:10.050
<v Speaker 5>It would be like Barack Obama died three years ago or something.</v>

4107
01:58:10.051 --> 01:58:10.321
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4108
01:58:10.321 --> 01:58:15.300
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy how much the guy gets a lionized when you really didn't even know</v>

4109
01:58:15.301 --> 01:58:16.380
<v Speaker 5>what you had there yet.</v>

4110
01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:16.620
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4111
01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:18.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's what James Dean,</v>

4112
01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:19.370
<v Speaker 5>you know when people die,</v>

4113
01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:20.370
<v Speaker 5>people love them.</v>

4114
01:58:20.610 --> 01:58:21.960
<v Speaker 5>Oh my mother even says today.</v>

4115
01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:23.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean you were just in trance.</v>

4116
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:25.110
<v Speaker 5>She was entranced by the guy.</v>

4117
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:25.861
<v Speaker 5>By James Dean.</v>

4118
01:58:25.861 --> 01:58:26.161
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4119
01:58:26.161 --> 01:58:26.994
<v Speaker 5>by Kennedy.</v>

4120
01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:30.150
<v Speaker 5>Well he was the first guy that seemed,</v>

4121
01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:32.880
<v Speaker 5>first of all to be a regular person.</v>

4122
01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:33.930
<v Speaker 5>He seemed to come on.</v>

4123
01:58:33.931 --> 01:58:37.020
<v Speaker 5>He was also a movie star was it was Nixon,</v>

4124
01:58:37.021 --> 01:58:38.760
<v Speaker 5>Eisenhower and John F.</v>

4125
01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:38.761
<v Speaker 5>Kennedy.</v>

4126
01:58:38.761 --> 01:58:40.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was certainly handsome guy,</v>

4127
01:58:40.741 --> 01:58:44.320
<v Speaker 5>but what I mean by a regular person was he didn't seem like a liar.</v>

4128
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:48.070
<v Speaker 5>He didn't seem like a co like Nixon seemed like a piece of plastic.</v>

4129
01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:52.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're looking at a guy with a two dimensional mask in front of them</v>

4130
01:58:52.391 --> 01:58:55.740
<v Speaker 5>that never gave you who he really was and was just a slip rate.</v>

4131
01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:56.770
<v Speaker 5>He was funny too.</v>

4132
01:58:56.771 --> 01:58:58.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you listen to him and like off the cuff discussion,</v>

4133
01:58:59.070 --> 01:58:59.903
<v Speaker 5>right man,</v>

4134
01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:01.180
<v Speaker 5>fall down funny.</v>

4135
01:59:01.181 --> 01:59:02.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean he had this witty dry sensing.</v>

4136
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:04.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean people were putty in his hands.</v>

4137
01:59:04.901 --> 01:59:06.850
<v Speaker 5>We haven't had a president that funny since.</v>

4138
01:59:06.851 --> 01:59:09.580
<v Speaker 5>We really haven't no nowhere near that high level.</v>

4139
01:59:09.581 --> 01:59:10.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean the guy was the kind of,</v>

4140
01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:14.110
<v Speaker 5>well and Frank Sinatra and all those guys used to party with him cause he</v>

4141
01:59:14.111 --> 01:59:17.640
<v Speaker 5>Kennedy was a fun guy on a bunch of different levels and they love themselves</v>

4142
01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:20.110
<v Speaker 5>and love themselves to posting.</v>

4143
01:59:20.230 --> 01:59:22.840
<v Speaker 5>Robert was the more serious of the of the guys.</v>

4144
01:59:22.841 --> 01:59:23.111
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

4145
01:59:23.111 --> 01:59:25.780
<v Speaker 5>he had an older brother that was the guy they were really grooming for the</v>

4146
01:59:25.781 --> 01:59:26.614
<v Speaker 5>presidency.</v>

4147
01:59:26.710 --> 01:59:30.760
<v Speaker 5>Joe was his older brother's name and he died on a World War II mission.</v>

4148
01:59:30.761 --> 01:59:34.120
<v Speaker 5>And the family was like crushed because they'd spent all the time grooming Joe</v>

4149
01:59:34.121 --> 01:59:37.150
<v Speaker 5>to be the presidential guy and now of course they're going to have to go to</v>

4150
01:59:37.151 --> 01:59:38.770
<v Speaker 5>number two and number two was jack.</v>

4151
01:59:38.890 --> 01:59:39.610
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4152
01:59:39.610 --> 01:59:42.520
<v Speaker 5>He died on one of those missions where he was going to volunteer to take a</v>

4153
01:59:42.521 --> 01:59:47.440
<v Speaker 5>bomber into like some really hardcore clandestine thing and the bomber takes off</v>

4154
01:59:47.441 --> 01:59:49.990
<v Speaker 5>and it's like just in the sky and the whole thing just explodes.</v>

4155
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:50.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

4156
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:51.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4157
01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:51.791
<v Speaker 5>So that's how,</v>

4158
01:59:51.791 --> 01:59:52.181
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4159
01:59:52.181 --> 01:59:56.290
<v Speaker 5>John was involved in that PT 109 thing with his bad back.</v>

4160
01:59:56.291 --> 02:00:00.610
<v Speaker 5>And I mean all those guys you think about what they did as lightweight as John</v>

4161
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:00.610
<v Speaker 5>F.</v>

4162
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:00.791
<v Speaker 5>Kennedy was.</v>

4163
02:00:00.791 --> 02:00:04.570
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine Clinton out there on the PT boat and were award too?</v>

4164
02:00:04.571 --> 02:00:05.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean it just doesn't even reach it.</v>

4165
02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:08.970
<v Speaker 5>It was almost a requirement back then to be president that you had served some</v>

4166
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:09.510
<v Speaker 5>ACA.</v>

4167
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:10.260
<v Speaker 5>It really was.</v>

4168
02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:10.511
<v Speaker 5>It really,</v>

4169
02:00:10.511 --> 02:00:12.070
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing how that sort of change.</v>

4170
02:00:12.071 --> 02:00:14.350
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't society accepted Bush?</v>

4171
02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:14.711
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4172
02:00:14.711 --> 02:00:16.480
<v Speaker 5>the drug when they accepted the whole draft dot,</v>

4173
02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:17.650
<v Speaker 5>but you get to the baby boomers,</v>

4174
02:00:17.651 --> 02:00:21.010
<v Speaker 5>you're ruling out a heck of a lot of people and everybody went through that war</v>

4175
02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:21.170
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

4176
02:00:21.170 --> 02:00:21.910
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing.</v>

4177
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:24.730
<v Speaker 5>How many people were you going to find that weren't in World War II and if you</v>

4178
02:00:24.731 --> 02:00:25.570
<v Speaker 5>weren't you in World War II,</v>

4179
02:00:25.571 --> 02:00:27.790
<v Speaker 5>you were a psycho or a flat foot.</v>

4180
02:00:27.791 --> 02:00:28.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm even flat footed.</v>

4181
02:00:28.631 --> 02:00:31.690
<v Speaker 5>Guys were making it into World War Two when he got to Vietnam,</v>

4182
02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:32.011
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

4183
02:00:32.011 --> 02:00:32.850
<v Speaker 5>it got to be a,</v>

4184
02:00:32.851 --> 02:00:34.840
<v Speaker 5>it's so much different because people are like,</v>

4185
02:00:34.841 --> 02:00:35.051
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4186
02:00:35.051 --> 02:00:36.270
<v Speaker 5>it was a stupid fucking war.</v>

4187
02:00:36.271 --> 02:00:38.620
<v Speaker 5>It's a war we should have never been involved with in the first place.</v>

4188
02:00:38.621 --> 02:00:39.820
<v Speaker 5>Who wants to be in Vietnam.</v>

4189
02:00:39.821 --> 02:00:40.031
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4190
02:00:40.031 --> 02:00:40.560
<v Speaker 5>if I,</v>

4191
02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:41.680
<v Speaker 5>I was alive back then,</v>

4192
02:00:41.681 --> 02:00:43.060
<v Speaker 5>I probably would have dodged the draft.</v>

4193
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:44.350
<v Speaker 5>We still had people like that.</v>

4194
02:00:44.351 --> 02:00:45.011
<v Speaker 5>Carrie was there,</v>

4195
02:00:45.011 --> 02:00:45.880
<v Speaker 5>McCain was there.</v>

4196
02:00:45.881 --> 02:00:46.360
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4197
02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:49.660
<v Speaker 5>and yet guys like Gore who was writing in like the Stars and Stripes newspaper</v>

4198
02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.130
<v Speaker 5>in Vietnam when he was doing,</v>

4199
02:00:51.131 --> 02:00:51.970
<v Speaker 5>he was a journalist.</v>

4200
02:00:51.971 --> 02:00:52.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4201
02:00:52.630 --> 02:00:53.170
<v Speaker 5>Military.</v>

4202
02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:54.160
<v Speaker 5>You're like the dude in a,</v>

4203
02:00:54.161 --> 02:00:56.590
<v Speaker 5>like a Matthew Modine and full metal jacket.</v>

4204
02:00:57.130 --> 02:00:57.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4205
02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:57.851
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4206
02:00:57.851 --> 02:00:58.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

4207
02:00:58.750 --> 02:01:00.240
<v Speaker 5>I actually saw full metal jacket.</v>

4208
02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:00.761
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

4209
02:01:00.761 --> 02:01:01.630
<v Speaker 5>So that's a bad night.</v>

4210
02:01:01.690 --> 02:01:03.250
<v Speaker 5>Matthew Modine was the,</v>

4211
02:01:03.251 --> 02:01:03.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4212
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:04.301
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4213
02:01:04.301 --> 02:01:05.530
<v Speaker 5>the dude for vision quest.</v>

4214
02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:06.340
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

4215
02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:06.900
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4216
02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:07.300
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

4217
02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:08.290
<v Speaker 5>the guy with glasses,</v>

4218
02:01:08.291 --> 02:01:08.740
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

4219
02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:08.891
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4220
02:01:08.891 --> 02:01:09.551
<v Speaker 5>I know who he is.</v>

4221
02:01:09.551 --> 02:01:10.570
<v Speaker 5>I just don't remember the role.</v>

4222
02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:12.880
<v Speaker 5>His role was a journalist.</v>

4223
02:01:12.881 --> 02:01:14.020
<v Speaker 5>He was over there a,</v>

4224
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:15.880
<v Speaker 5>he went through boot camp and everything.</v>

4225
02:01:15.890 --> 02:01:16.301
<v Speaker 5>Like Gore.</v>

4226
02:01:16.301 --> 02:01:18.400
<v Speaker 5>His Dad was a senator and the whole thing was,</v>

4227
02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:21.020
<v Speaker 5>they were thinking about as his future politics will,</v>

4228
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.261
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4229
02:01:21.261 --> 02:01:22.720
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to keep the war.</v>

4230
02:01:22.721 --> 02:01:23.021
<v Speaker 5>You're going to,</v>

4231
02:01:23.021 --> 02:01:23.854
<v Speaker 5>what about your politics?</v>

4232
02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:25.000
<v Speaker 5>So he went and he got,</v>

4233
02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:25.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4234
02:01:25.161 --> 02:01:26.080
<v Speaker 5>one of the cush jobs.</v>

4235
02:01:26.081 --> 02:01:27.220
<v Speaker 5>Vietnam is famous for that.</v>

4236
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:27.461
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4237
02:01:27.461 --> 02:01:31.150
<v Speaker 5>Gordon had his moment with a massage therapist claimed that there was more than</v>

4238
02:01:31.151 --> 02:01:31.481
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>

4239
02:01:31.481 --> 02:01:32.540
<v Speaker 5>actually more than that.</v>

4240
02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:34.780
<v Speaker 5>So that's his move I used do.</v>

4241
02:01:34.781 --> 02:01:36.880
<v Speaker 5>It's that careful side doors moves.</v>

4242
02:01:36.881 --> 02:01:37.690
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4243
02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:39.890
<v Speaker 5>You know these dudes that kept massages,</v>

4244
02:01:39.891 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

4245
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>don't know turf off before you get your massage.</v>

4246
02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I have a better point again and it gets to that,</v>

4247
02:01:44.371 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>that being smart thing.</v>

4248
02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're in Gore's position,</v>

4249
02:01:47.630 --> 02:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>don't you want to have like a third party witness there?</v>

4250
02:01:50.061 --> 02:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Because even if you did nothing,</v>

4251
02:01:51.501 --> 02:01:52.334
<v Speaker 1>aren't you opening?</v>

4252
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

4253
02:01:53.731 --> 02:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4254
02:01:54.110 --> 02:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Because he wants to get jerked off and if there's a third party that you're not</v>

4255
02:01:57.501 --> 02:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>going to get jerked off to make it a close friend and,</v>

4256
02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:00.621
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

4257
02:02:00.621 --> 02:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>he's getting jerked off on a regular.</v>

4258
02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what I bet.</v>

4259
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to have him on the show.</v>

4260
02:02:04.551 --> 02:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a poignant question you can ask him.</v>

4261
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:07.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4262
02:02:07.101 --> 02:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>since I brought it up like that in the podcast on the Internet,</v>

4263
02:02:11.001 --> 02:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he'll respond.</v>

4264
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

4265
02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4266
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:13.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4267
02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:14.684
<v Speaker 1>he has a Twitter,</v>

4268
02:02:14.690 --> 02:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>he'll hear about this.</v>

4269
02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

4270
02:02:16.190 --> 02:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it'll be an interesting conversation,</v>

4271
02:02:18.471 --> 02:02:19.304
<v Speaker 1>won't it?</v>

4272
02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:20.241
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say to him,</v>

4273
02:02:20.241 --> 02:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>first and foremost,</v>

4274
02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>everyone likes getting jerked off.</v>

4275
02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to feel bad about.</v>

4276
02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>And if we were living in China,</v>

4277
02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:27.350
<v Speaker 1>that would be a normal part of your massage.</v>

4278
02:02:27.370 --> 02:02:28.101
<v Speaker 1>And once again,</v>

4279
02:02:28.101 --> 02:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>we're in the woods now.</v>

4280
02:02:29.031 --> 02:02:29.331
<v Speaker 1>Rogan,</v>

4281
02:02:29.331 --> 02:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>this shows taking a left hand turn the woods.</v>

4282
02:02:31.311 --> 02:02:32.030
<v Speaker 1>This is where we land.</v>

4283
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

4284
02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4285
02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I have ventured into the woods with 13 miles down a dirt road and your car just</v>

4286
02:02:36.741 --> 02:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>broke down with a tarp to keep the rain out and we sleep under it.</v>

4287
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:41.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4288
02:02:41.391 --> 02:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong with getting jerked off and I don't think</v>

4289
02:02:43.701 --> 02:02:44.534
<v Speaker 1>he should feel bad.</v>

4290
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:46.100
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're going to get a massage,</v>

4291
02:02:46.101 --> 02:02:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you're basically getting jerked off anyway.</v>

4292
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:47.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4293
02:02:47.961 --> 02:02:48.231
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

4294
02:02:48.231 --> 02:02:48.471
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

4295
02:02:48.471 --> 02:02:49.304
<v Speaker 1>what does a massage,</v>

4296
02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>ice and deal with this guy?</v>

4297
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Was any of this coming up with Tyson?</v>

4298
02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:54.043
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the show.</v>

4299
02:02:54.190 --> 02:02:54.891
<v Speaker 1>We talked about,</v>

4300
02:02:54.891 --> 02:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4301

02:02:55.650 --> 02:02:57.170
<v Speaker 1>fart theory of aliens.</v>

4304
02:02:57.171 --> 02:02:57.411
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>

4305
02:02:57.411 --> 02:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>We talked about some and he went there with you.</v>

4306
02:02:59.360 --> 02:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4307
02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:00.140
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>

4308
02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:00.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4309
02:03:00.551 --> 02:03:00.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

02:03:00.811 --> 02:03:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4311
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.881
<v Speaker 1>I'm pleased.</v>

4312
02:03:01.881 --> 02:03:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel bad anymore.</v>

4313
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4314
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't feel bad.</v>

4315
02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:04.841
<v Speaker 1>The Internet.</v>

4316
02:03:04.841 --> 02:03:05.601
<v Speaker 1>We're grown men.</v>

4317
02:03:05.601 --> 02:03:06.351
<v Speaker 1>We're fathers.</v>

4318
02:03:06.351 --> 02:03:10.160
<v Speaker 1>We're taxpayers were law abiding citizens were allowed to talk about anybody</v>

4319
02:03:10.161 --> 02:03:12.500
<v Speaker 1>knows getting jerked off in a hotel room by,</v>

4320
02:03:12.501 --> 02:03:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm assume he's in a country where that's legal.</v>

4321
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>He should be able to pay that.</v>

4322
02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:16.521
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4323
02:03:16.521 --> 02:03:16.821
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

4324
02:03:16.821 --> 02:03:17.654
<v Speaker 1>An extra hundred bucks.</v>

4325
02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:18.561
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference?</v>

4326
02:03:18.561 --> 02:03:20.960
<v Speaker 1>He rubbing someone's dirty feet and rubbing their dick.</v>

4327
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4328
02:03:21.650 --> 02:03:24.290
<v Speaker 1>some people would probably be happier to rub your Dick then you're dirty feet.</v>

4329
02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know anything of a,</v>

4330
02:03:25.441 --> 02:03:25.881
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

4331
02:03:25.881 --> 02:03:27.380
<v Speaker 1>see my wife's probably watching this,</v>

4332
02:03:27.381 --> 02:03:27.531
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4333
02:03:27.531 --> 02:03:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're talking.</v>

4334
02:03:28.581 --> 02:03:29.630
<v Speaker 1>If I understand well,</v>

4335
02:03:29.631 --> 02:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you should do that,</v>

4336
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:32.150
<v Speaker 1>nor do I want it or need it.</v>

4337
02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:33.980
<v Speaker 1>When I'm saying is there's a man,</v>

4338
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:38.390
<v Speaker 1>if the man wants to get jerked off and he wants to go to a hotel and pay for</v>

4339
02:03:38.391 --> 02:03:39.770
<v Speaker 1>that poor,</v>

4340
02:03:39.771 --> 02:03:40.221
<v Speaker 1>poor,</v>

4341
02:03:40.221 --> 02:03:41.150
<v Speaker 1>poor Al Gore,</v>

4342
02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:43.130
<v Speaker 1>unless his name is Petraeus.</v>

4343
02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:43.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4344
02:03:43.761 --> 02:03:43.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4345
02:03:43.911 --> 02:03:44.600
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't just,</v>

4346
02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>he was getting his freak on 100% he was in a relationship.</v>

4347
02:03:47.451 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 1>He was in love.</v>

4348
02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:49.730
<v Speaker 1>That's why what happened was,</v>

4349
02:03:49.731 --> 02:03:50.421
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole story,</v>

4350
02:03:50.421 --> 02:03:55.160
<v Speaker 1>that other woman who's a also sketchy and sort of slutty on a dirty Washington</v>

4351
02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:55.790
<v Speaker 1>groupies.</v>

4352
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4353
02:03:56.350 --> 02:03:56.901
<v Speaker 1>What was her name?</v>

4354
02:03:56.901 --> 02:03:58.130
<v Speaker 1>That the chicken Florida.</v>

4355
02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Which one is the other Patraeus one.</v>

4356
02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not up to speed on it.</v>

4357
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4358
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:02.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole betray situation.</v>

4359
02:04:02.901 --> 02:04:03.770
<v Speaker 1>There's two girls,</v>

4360
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>one girl who was in Florida who was getting emailed by the old light and she is</v>

4361
02:04:09.021 --> 02:04:09.854
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

4362
02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:12.860
<v Speaker 1>And she's in that Group B group that goes after all the generals.</v>

4363
02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You're the general's wife.</v>

4364
02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:17.091
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

4365
02:04:17.091 --> 02:04:18.710
<v Speaker 1>And letting them go to the group he meetings.</v>

4366
02:04:18.711 --> 02:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to know.</v>

4367
02:04:19.530 --> 02:04:23.120
<v Speaker 1>She probably doesn't know that there's together for generals outrageously.</v>

4368
02:04:23.121 --> 02:04:23.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4369
02:04:23.391 --> 02:04:24.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4370
02:04:24.450 --> 02:04:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to let him anywhere near that.</v>

4371
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Well this girl was a,</v>

4372
02:04:27.381 --> 02:04:32.381
<v Speaker 1>this woman was married and her and the husband were both like really into like</v>

4373
02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>celebrity military functions and military parties and they would both</v>

4374
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.910
<v Speaker 5>be into that social socialite sort of military social world.</v>

4375
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.110
<v Speaker 5>So it wasn't,</v>

4376
02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:44.760
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't that cut and dry,</v>

4377
02:04:44.761 --> 02:04:45.090
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it?</v>

4378
02:04:45.090 --> 02:04:47.490
<v Speaker 5>Like the weirdest goes on more than you would think in those groups.</v>

4379
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 5>I happened to know some people that would have been astronauts had it not been</v>

4380
02:04:51.001 --> 02:04:54.540
<v Speaker 5>for going after the wives of people who are ranked higher than they were.</v>

4381
02:04:54.541 --> 02:04:55.081
<v Speaker 5>So I mean this,</v>

4382
02:04:55.081 --> 02:04:55.440
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

4383
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:57.450
<v Speaker 5>this stuff has been going on forever.</v>

4384
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:58.530
<v Speaker 5>It's always going to go on.</v>

4385
02:04:58.531 --> 02:04:59.790
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about trained killers,</v>

4386
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:00.181
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4387
02:05:00.181 --> 02:05:01.530
<v Speaker 5>I have friends that,</v>

4388
02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:02.281
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4389
02:05:02.281 --> 02:05:05.760
<v Speaker 5>we're in various branches of the military would tell me the wild,</v>

4390
02:05:05.761 --> 02:05:07.740
<v Speaker 5>crazy fucking stories about war time.</v>

4391
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:08.420
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4392
02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:09.001
<v Speaker 5>dudes,</v>

4393
02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:09.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4394
02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:10.560
<v Speaker 5>hey look scans.</v>

4395
02:05:10.561 --> 02:05:11.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean these are just party,</v>

4396
02:05:11.491 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 5>state side with guys who aren't even at war.</v>

4397
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:15.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a culture by the way,</v>

4398
02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:16.590
<v Speaker 5>you don't know if you're going to die.</v>

4399
02:05:16.710 --> 02:05:17.041
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4400
02:05:17.041 --> 02:05:17.321
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

4401
02:05:17.321 --> 02:05:17.460
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

4402
02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:21.630
<v Speaker 5>you're over there in involved in the scariest thing you could ever be involved</v>

4403
02:05:21.631 --> 02:05:22.620
<v Speaker 5>in an actual war.</v>

4404
02:05:22.890 --> 02:05:26.460
<v Speaker 5>Bombs and planes and rocket launchers and grenades.</v>

4405
02:05:26.461 --> 02:05:27.990
<v Speaker 5>And these are also hard drinking,</v>

4406
02:05:27.991 --> 02:05:28.321
<v Speaker 5>hard,</v>

4407
02:05:28.321 --> 02:05:28.711
<v Speaker 5>partying,</v>

4408
02:05:28.711 --> 02:05:29.910
<v Speaker 5>hard exercising.</v>

4409
02:05:29.911 --> 02:05:31.470
<v Speaker 5>Like I was just talking to one guy last night.</v>

4410
02:05:31.471 --> 02:05:31.920
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

4411
02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:32.880
<v Speaker 5>we get up in the morning,</v>

4412
02:05:32.970 --> 02:05:34.140
<v Speaker 5>you run 10 miles,</v>

4413
02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:35.610
<v Speaker 5>you go work hard all day,</v>

4414
02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:36.361
<v Speaker 5>you're done with the day.</v>

4415
02:05:36.361 --> 02:05:38.670
<v Speaker 5>You go out and you drink as hard as you work.</v>

4416
02:05:38.671 --> 02:05:39.504
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4417
02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:42.720
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of a cultural thing and you know what you want to let down after a</v>

4418
02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.350
<v Speaker 5>hard day at work.</v>

4419
02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:45.360
<v Speaker 5>My Dad works not as hard as those guys.</v>

4420
02:05:45.361 --> 02:05:50.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean if the letting down is in is in proportion to how hard the day was,</v>

4421
02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:50.791
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4422
02:05:50.791 --> 02:05:52.800
<v Speaker 5>you're going to need a lot more beers than I would need.</v>

4423
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:53.221
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4424
02:05:53.221 --> 02:05:54.450
<v Speaker 5>Let Al Gore get jerked off.</v>

4425
02:05:54.451 --> 02:05:55.284
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4426
02:05:55.530 --> 02:05:56.610
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what I'm saying.</v>

4427
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:59.760
<v Speaker 5>Why you hating on Al Gore and John Travolta?</v>

4428
02:05:59.761 --> 02:06:03.300
<v Speaker 5>John Travolta makes movies about war and I think he should get jerked off to,</v>

4429
02:06:03.301 --> 02:06:04.970
<v Speaker 5>I think it's absolutely commiserate.</v>

4430
02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:05.813
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

4431
02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:06.331
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

4432
02:06:06.331 --> 02:06:07.420
<v Speaker 5>it's not that it's commensurate,</v>

4433
02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.710
<v Speaker 5>but in order for him to play the role correctly,</v>

4434
02:06:10.711 --> 02:06:11.301
<v Speaker 5>I think he's got,</v>

4435
02:06:11.301 --> 02:06:12.570
<v Speaker 5>he was just research for a part.</v>

4436
02:06:12.571 --> 02:06:13.404
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

4437
02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:14.293
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4438
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:14.761
<v Speaker 5>What else?</v>

4439
02:06:14.761 --> 02:06:18.780
<v Speaker 5>What do you want the guy to do to just pretend and to sort of fill in the blanks</v>

4440
02:06:18.810 --> 02:06:20.700
<v Speaker 5>with his lack of personal experience?</v>

4441
02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:23.100
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what it must've been.</v>

4442
02:06:23.370 --> 02:06:24.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4443
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4444
02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:26.190
<v Speaker 5>lack of personal experience.</v>

4445
02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:27.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm just researching again.</v>

4446
02:06:27.690 --> 02:06:28.830
<v Speaker 5>What do you think about,</v>

4447
02:06:28.831 --> 02:06:31.050
<v Speaker 5>this is something that I really want to make sure that we touch on.</v>

4448
02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:31.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4449
02:06:31.710 --> 02:06:33.180
<v Speaker 5>and bringing it back to Al Gore,</v>

4450
02:06:33.181 --> 02:06:33.930
<v Speaker 5>believe it or not,</v>

4451
02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:34.561
<v Speaker 5>but in a,</v>

4452
02:06:34.561 --> 02:06:35.400
<v Speaker 5>in a serious way,</v>

4453
02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:40.730
<v Speaker 5>the Hbo Documentary Hacking Democracy when over the issue with the Diebold,</v>

4454
02:06:41.590 --> 02:06:42.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4455
02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:42.250
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4456
02:06:42.250 --> 02:06:42.381
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4457
02:06:42.381 --> 02:06:47.010
<v Speaker 5>the voting machines machines and how they can be influenced by a third party and</v>

4458
02:06:47.011 --> 02:06:49.980
<v Speaker 5>third party information besides the person counting the vote,</v>

4459
02:06:49.981 --> 02:06:51.180
<v Speaker 5>the person making the vote.</v>

4460
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.961
<v Speaker 5>Third Party.</v>

4461
02:06:51.961 --> 02:06:53.100
<v Speaker 5>There was room for a third party.</v>

4462
02:06:53.550 --> 02:06:53.990
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4463
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.410
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4464
02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.690
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4465
02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:57.090
<v Speaker 5>they talked about how disturbing that was and how it hit.</v>

4466
02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:02.120
<v Speaker 5>It had been engineered for that and they essentially said,</v>

4467
02:07:02.221 --> 02:07:02.610
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4468
02:07:02.610 --> 02:07:03.330
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4469
02:07:03.330 --> 02:07:04.081
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>

4470
02:07:04.081 --> 02:07:04.920
<v Speaker 5>you could rig a vote.</v>

4471
02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:06.083
<v Speaker 5>You could rig it.</v>

4472
02:07:06.250 --> 02:07:06.510
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4473
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:06.811
<v Speaker 5>what do you,</v>

4474
02:07:06.811 --> 02:07:07.890
<v Speaker 5>what do you think about all that?</v>

4475
02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:09.631
<v Speaker 5>When you mentioned that,</v>

4476
02:07:09.631 --> 02:07:13.370
<v Speaker 5>all I can think about is how is this flying under the conversation?</v>

4477
02:07:14.650 --> 02:07:15.080
<v Speaker 5>You want,</v>

4478
02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:15.900
<v Speaker 5>you want one of the,</v>

4479
02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:16.231
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4480
02:07:16.231 --> 02:07:17.820
<v Speaker 5>if you want to get down on anybody,</v>

4481
02:07:17.821 --> 02:07:20.040
<v Speaker 5>let's get down on the journalist who aren't doing their job.</v>

4482
02:07:20.041 --> 02:07:20.370
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4483
02:07:20.370 --> 02:07:21.660
<v Speaker 5>that used to be my profession,</v>

4484
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:26.990
<v Speaker 5>these wimpy kiss ass journalists who want to hang out afterwards behind the</v>

4485
02:07:27.811 --> 02:07:28.411
<v Speaker 5>velvet rope,</v>

4486
02:07:28.411 --> 02:07:29.310
<v Speaker 5>but the people they cover.</v>

4487
02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:32.490
<v Speaker 5>The question to ask the president and the other candidates is everything.</v>

4488
02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:34.350
<v Speaker 5>What do you think about this voting machines?</v>

4489
02:07:34.351 --> 02:07:34.650
<v Speaker 5>Are you,</v>

4490
02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:35.490
<v Speaker 5>you know what you tell,</v>

4491
02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 5>ask</v>

4492
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:36.850
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

4493
02:07:36.850 --> 02:07:38.200
<v Speaker 4>Let's get their opinion.</v>

4494
02:07:38.201 --> 02:07:39.034
<v Speaker 4>Make them come.</v>

4495
02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:44.180
<v Speaker 4>You know the old line was make them go on the record to these guys are able to</v>

4496
02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:46.390
<v Speaker 4>say basically on the sly,</v>

4497
02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:50.560
<v Speaker 4>if you ask me any questions beyond these five things I have on this list right</v>

4498
02:07:50.561 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

4499
02:07:51.010 --> 02:07:54.250
<v Speaker 4>you're never coming to another function again and I won't answer your question</v>

4500
02:07:54.251 --> 02:07:54.820
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

4501
02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 4>You won't even get the satisfaction of saying,</v>

4502
02:07:56.531 --> 02:07:56.651
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4503
02:07:56.651 --> 02:07:58.570
<v Speaker 4>I got an answer before I was kicked out of the room.</v>

4504
02:07:58.690 --> 02:08:02.200
<v Speaker 4>You don't get your question answered and you never get to come back.</v>

4505
02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.670
<v Speaker 4>And that works now.</v>

4506
02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:08.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean in the Cold War they used to cut some slack of the politicians on certain</v>

4507
02:08:08.621 --> 02:08:12.010
<v Speaker 4>kinds of questions and there were certain manly rules like,</v>

4508
02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:13.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody knew John F.</v>

4509
02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy was having all these affairs and it was not considered to be proper to</v>

4510
02:08:16.571 --> 02:08:17.141
<v Speaker 4>bring that up,</v>

4511
02:08:17.141 --> 02:08:19.960
<v Speaker 4>which is crazy when you consider the potential for blackmail.</v>

4512
02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:21.040
<v Speaker 4>But nonetheless,</v>

4513
02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:21.550
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4514
02:08:21.550 --> 02:08:22.930
<v Speaker 4>that sort of stuff was off the record.</v>

4515
02:08:22.931 --> 02:08:25.600
<v Speaker 4>But you get some damn tough questions on other things.</v>

4516
02:08:25.810 --> 02:08:26.860
<v Speaker 4>We don't have that today.</v>

4517
02:08:26.861 --> 02:08:27.431
<v Speaker 4>And if you want to say,</v>

4518
02:08:27.431 --> 02:08:30.430
<v Speaker 4>how does the country get as bad as it does without anyone talking about it?</v>

4519
02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 4>That's because our so called fourth estate who plays a constitutional watchdog</v>

4520
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:36.790
<v Speaker 4>role in our system isn't doing that.</v>

4521
02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Our fourth estate,</v>

4522
02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:39.190
<v Speaker 4>that's what the,</v>

4523
02:08:39.190 --> 02:08:40.023
<v Speaker 4>that's what the,</v>

4524
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:42.040
<v Speaker 4>there are three estates of government that are official.</v>

4525
02:08:42.041 --> 02:08:43.420
<v Speaker 4>You have the executive branch,</v>

4526
02:08:43.421 --> 02:08:45.280
<v Speaker 4>the judicial branch and the legislative branch.</v>

4527
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Those are the three estates that work from inside the government and they're</v>

4528
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:50.110
<v Speaker 4>officially constitutional branches.</v>

4529
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:54.700
<v Speaker 4>The fourth estate is a term used to describe a non constitutional branch,</v>

4530
02:08:54.730 --> 02:08:56.200
<v Speaker 4>a nongovernmental branch,</v>

4531
02:08:56.410 --> 02:09:00.010
<v Speaker 4>the watchdogs who watched the government from outside the government.</v>

4532
02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:01.040
<v Speaker 4>And that's the meeting.</v>

4533
02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:01.311
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4534
02:09:01.311 --> 02:09:02.330
<v Speaker 6>don't you think though,</v>

4535
02:09:02.331 --> 02:09:06.170
<v Speaker 6>that with this new access to information that we're enjoying because of the</v>

4536
02:09:06.171 --> 02:09:06.531
<v Speaker 6>internet,</v>

4537
02:09:06.531 --> 02:09:08.810
<v Speaker 6>what's also rising is shows like yours,</v>

4538
02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:10.100
<v Speaker 6>the young Turks,</v>

4539
02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:10.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4540
02:09:10.670 --> 02:09:13.730
<v Speaker 6>people who are openly,</v>

4541
02:09:13.790 --> 02:09:16.520
<v Speaker 6>actively questioning every single aspect.</v>

4542
02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:17.220
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4543
02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:19.830
<v Speaker 4>But let me tell you the difference because you're absolutely right and thank</v>

4544
02:09:19.831 --> 02:09:20.240
<v Speaker 4>goodness.</v>

4545
02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:20.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4546
02:09:20.490 --> 02:09:21.960
<v Speaker 4>and thank goodness you brought that up Joe.</v>

4547
02:09:22.230 --> 02:09:22.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4548
02:09:22.650 --> 02:09:23.730
<v Speaker 4>but here's the difference.</v>

4549
02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:26.670
<v Speaker 4>We don't have access to the sea here.</v>

4550
02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:29.940
<v Speaker 4>When CNN officially cut their investigative reporting budget,</v>

4551
02:09:29.941 --> 02:09:30.511
<v Speaker 4>which is a joke,</v>

4552
02:09:30.511 --> 02:09:33.030
<v Speaker 4>and he would cause they weren't doing any investigative reporting worth a salt</v>

4553
02:09:33.031 --> 02:09:33.864
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

4554
02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.280
<v Speaker 4>they got rid of the stuff that provides the basis of information.</v>

4555
02:09:38.281 --> 02:09:38.971
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to CNN,</v>

4556
02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:39.804
<v Speaker 4>I mean everywhere.</v>

4557
02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:42.150
<v Speaker 4>The investigative reporting is how we,</v>

4558
02:09:42.151 --> 02:09:44.220
<v Speaker 4>whether you're talking about me or the young Turks or anyone else,</v>

4559
02:09:44.430 --> 02:09:48.390
<v Speaker 4>that's where we get our info that allows us to then comment on it.</v>

4560
02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:51.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm not out doing the investigative work that is,</v>

4561
02:09:51.811 --> 02:09:52.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4562
02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:52.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4563
02:09:52.620 --> 02:09:56.040
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason that the very first amendment to the constitution protects</v>

4564
02:09:56.041 --> 02:09:57.240
<v Speaker 4>freedom of the press.</v>

4565
02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.080
<v Speaker 4>And it's not because someone thinks you have should have the right to tail some</v>

4566
02:10:01.081 --> 02:10:05.700
<v Speaker 4>celebrity for TMZ because we just have to know who they're dating on the side.</v>

4567
02:10:05.970 --> 02:10:09.270
<v Speaker 4>It's because this is considered to be of national import.</v>

4568
02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:11.220
<v Speaker 4>The country goes to hell in a hand basket.</v>

4569
02:10:11.221 --> 02:10:15.210
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know what's going on and really what's going on,</v>

4570
02:10:15.870 --> 02:10:19.740
<v Speaker 4>the 1970s are turning out to be the high watermark of American journalism.</v>

4571
02:10:19.890 --> 02:10:21.510
<v Speaker 4>When you look at what was going on,</v>

4572
02:10:21.511 --> 02:10:22.380
<v Speaker 4>then you try and run and go.</v>

4573
02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:26.100
<v Speaker 4>You can't imagine that happening today and that's totally the opposite of what</v>

4574
02:10:26.101 --> 02:10:26.761
<v Speaker 4>you normally expect.</v>

4575
02:10:26.761 --> 02:10:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Normally you expect everything to get better.</v>

4576
02:10:29.070 --> 02:10:32.970
<v Speaker 4>the 70s from a news standpoint was so much better than what we have now in terms</v>

4577
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.591
<v Speaker 4>expos,</v>

4578
02:10:33.591 --> 02:10:37.340
<v Speaker 4>A's and people getting nailed and that's Pre-internet.</v>

4579
02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:41.810
<v Speaker 4>If you took that level of dedication to investigative reporting,</v>

4580
02:10:41.811 --> 02:10:45.140
<v Speaker 4>it's all the post Watergate era stuff when everybody was going in and the way</v>

4581
02:10:45.141 --> 02:10:48.320
<v Speaker 4>you made your bones in journalism was to try to be Woodward and Bernstein.</v>

4582
02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:49.933
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you a story.</v>

4583
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:52.130
<v Speaker 4>When I got my first job in reporting,</v>

4584
02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:55.410
<v Speaker 4>I went from here in la where I was working on the assignment desk,</v>

4585
02:10:55.530 --> 02:10:57.230
<v Speaker 4>know behind the scenes to work in,</v>

4586
02:10:57.231 --> 02:11:00.500
<v Speaker 4>in front of the camera and the first thing that happens that that makes you</v>

4587
02:11:00.501 --> 02:11:04.310
<v Speaker 4>upset as a reporter is they'll send you to like the dog show and the knife show</v>

4588
02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:05.570
<v Speaker 4>and all these things where you're going,</v>

4589
02:11:05.571 --> 02:11:06.890
<v Speaker 4>this is why I got into news.</v>

4590
02:11:06.891 --> 02:11:08.630
<v Speaker 4>I want some meaty stories so I get my,</v>

4591
02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:10.760
<v Speaker 4>I get my hands on my first meaty story.</v>

4592
02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Members of the sheriff's department call me up on the slide and they start</v>

4593
02:11:13.881 --> 02:11:15.680
<v Speaker 4>telling me what the sheriff is doing secretly,</v>

4594
02:11:15.681 --> 02:11:16.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4595
02:11:16.370 --> 02:11:19.850
<v Speaker 4>I jump on this story takes weeks to flesh this thing out,</v>

4596
02:11:19.851 --> 02:11:20.031
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4597
02:11:20.031 --> 02:11:21.560
<v Speaker 4>It's totally non cost effective.</v>

4598
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:22.790
<v Speaker 4>I break the story.</v>

4599
02:11:22.791 --> 02:11:23.840
<v Speaker 4>It's this big deal.</v>

4600
02:11:23.841 --> 02:11:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's on it and the news director gives me an award because he has to</v>

4601
02:11:27.261 --> 02:11:28.190
<v Speaker 4>because it's this big deal,</v>

4602
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:32.840
<v Speaker 4>but then he takes me in the office privately and tears me a new one and says,</v>

4603
02:11:32.841 --> 02:11:33.980
<v Speaker 4>don't you ever do that again?</v>

4604
02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:34.761
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

4605
02:11:34.761 --> 02:11:34.891
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4606
02:11:34.891 --> 02:11:35.870
<v Speaker 4>what am I supposed to be doing?</v>

4607
02:11:35.871 --> 02:11:36.470
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

4608
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:38.750
<v Speaker 4>now the sheriff is never going to give us a story again.</v>

4609
02:11:38.751 --> 02:11:40.160
<v Speaker 4>They're never going to talk to us again.</v>

4610
02:11:40.190 --> 02:11:41.870
<v Speaker 4>You just burned our bridge with them.</v>

4611
02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:42.471
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4612
02:11:42.471 --> 02:11:42.921
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

4613
02:11:42.921 --> 02:11:44.690
<v Speaker 4>the guys involved in illegal activities.</v>

4614
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:45.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4615
02:11:45.141 --> 02:11:48.650
<v Speaker 4>but there's 57 stories we need to do down the road where we need their</v>

4616
02:11:48.651 --> 02:11:50.360
<v Speaker 4>cooperation and now they're not going to help us.</v>

4617
02:11:50.690 --> 02:11:51.800
<v Speaker 4>That's what's happened.</v>

4618
02:11:52.190 --> 02:11:52.670
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

4619
02:11:52.670 --> 02:11:52.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4620
02:11:52.881 --> 02:11:54.410
<v Speaker 4>on the national scale it's the same thing.</v>

4621
02:11:54.411 --> 02:11:56.840
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to be Woodward Bernstein because Woodward and Bernstein are</v>

4622
02:11:56.841 --> 02:11:58.220
<v Speaker 4>getting another interview with the president.</v>

4623
02:11:58.720 --> 02:11:58.931
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4624
02:11:58.931 --> 02:11:59.381
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

4625
02:11:59.381 --> 02:12:00.220
<v Speaker 6>that's a very,</v>

4626
02:12:00.221 --> 02:12:05.110
<v Speaker 6>very good point about how this whole thing sort of gets more and more complex</v>

4627
02:12:05.111 --> 02:12:05.690
<v Speaker 6>and more,</v>

4628
02:12:05.690 --> 02:12:06.900
<v Speaker 4>more so you can have the internet,</v>

4629
02:12:06.901 --> 02:12:09.780
<v Speaker 4>but if anonymous doesn't tell us and release cables of what's going on,</v>

4630
02:12:09.781 --> 02:12:12.870
<v Speaker 4>who did the investigative work to give us enough information for me to comment?</v>

4631
02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:14.370
<v Speaker 4>How do you feel about wikileaks?</v>

4632
02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:16.380
<v Speaker 4>I disagree with,</v>

4633
02:12:16.381 --> 02:12:18.600
<v Speaker 4>but from what I can tell from the angry emails,</v>

4634
02:12:18.601 --> 02:12:20.280
<v Speaker 4>90% of my audience on that,</v>

4635
02:12:20.590 --> 02:12:25.590
<v Speaker 4>cause I think he looked in a world of the 1970s if we could have a media that</v>

4636
02:12:25.801 --> 02:12:26.640
<v Speaker 4>used to do its job,</v>

4637
02:12:26.641 --> 02:12:27.610
<v Speaker 4>we don't need a wikileaks.</v>

4638
02:12:28.090 --> 02:12:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4639
02:12:28.530 --> 02:12:31.440
<v Speaker 4>in a world where the media is not doing its job.</v>

4640
02:12:31.770 --> 02:12:33.440
<v Speaker 4>You do need to wikileaks and that.</v>

4641
02:12:33.441 --> 02:12:34.141
<v Speaker 4>That's what's sad.</v>

4642
02:12:34.141 --> 02:12:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather you could have a wiki leaks that didn't give out information that</v>

4643
02:12:37.561 --> 02:12:38.640
<v Speaker 4>none of us wants given out,</v>

4644
02:12:38.970 --> 02:12:40.200
<v Speaker 4>but you get the good with the bad.</v>

4645
02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:45.300
<v Speaker 6>I don't think anybody could have done that job except that one guy who got ahold</v>

4646
02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:46.691
<v Speaker 6>of that information.</v>

4647
02:12:46.691 --> 02:12:47.650
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's a matter of,</v>

4648
02:12:47.730 --> 02:12:51.360
<v Speaker 4>you don't think that it was inevitable at some point that some group of either</v>

4649
02:12:51.361 --> 02:12:52.620
<v Speaker 4>hackers or,</v>

4650
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:53.281
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

4651
02:12:53.281 --> 02:12:54.114
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>

4652
02:12:54.150 --> 02:12:54.601
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4653
02:12:54.601 --> 02:12:55.240
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

4654
02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:56.660
<v Speaker 6>it was an inevitability maybe,</v>

4655
02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:58.120
<v Speaker 6>but I mean to do it illegally.</v>

4656
02:12:58.150 --> 02:12:58.811
<v Speaker 6>I mean when you're,</v>

4657
02:12:58.811 --> 02:13:01.900
<v Speaker 6>when you're talking about the journalism journalists doing their job,</v>

4658
02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:06.810
<v Speaker 6>if what really been interesting is if Bradley Manning had gotten those documents</v>

4659
02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:07.720
<v Speaker 6>in New York Times,</v>

4660
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:09.310
<v Speaker 6>I wonder how they would have handled it.</v>

4661
02:13:09.490 --> 02:13:10.540
<v Speaker 6>What would they have done?</v>

4662
02:13:10.541 --> 02:13:12.340
<v Speaker 6>What wikileaks did and if they did,</v>

4663
02:13:12.341 --> 02:13:13.900
<v Speaker 6>would they be considered criminals?</v>

4664
02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:15.920
<v Speaker 6>Like he like Julian Assange,</v>

4665
02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:16.320
<v Speaker 6>you</v>

4666
02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:19.440
<v Speaker 4>say that because I just had a listener download an article for me about five</v>

4667
02:13:19.441 --> 02:13:20.700
<v Speaker 4>weeks ago cause I heard about it.</v>

4668
02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:24.960
<v Speaker 4>It was in the wake of the whole Watergate thing.</v>

4669
02:13:25.470 --> 02:13:25.801
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4670
02:13:25.801 --> 02:13:26.250
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4671
02:13:26.250 --> 02:13:30.450
<v Speaker 4>the head of the Washington Post gave a speech to all these big corporate muckety</v>

4672
02:13:30.451 --> 02:13:32.370
<v Speaker 4>mucks a couple years after that.</v>

4673
02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Trying to explain that,</v>

4674
02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:35.160
<v Speaker 4>that don't worry,</v>

4675
02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:39.120
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to get all expos a now this isn't gonna this isn't going to be a</v>

4676
02:13:39.121 --> 02:13:41.370
<v Speaker 4>trend of ours to bring down presidents and everything.</v>

4677
02:13:41.371 --> 02:13:43.880
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to worry and you can go actually down,</v>

4678
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:44.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4679
02:13:44.070 --> 02:13:46.890
<v Speaker 4>if you have a j store account or whatever with these libraries,</v>

4680
02:13:46.891 --> 02:13:51.270
<v Speaker 4>you can actually download the speech from like 1976 and it was a Katharine</v>

4681
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.271
<v Speaker 4>Graham,</v>

4682
02:13:51.271 --> 02:13:54.270
<v Speaker 4>the head of the Washington Post where it was this reassuring thing to the powers</v>

4683
02:13:54.271 --> 02:13:55.650
<v Speaker 4>that be that don't worry,</v>

4684
02:13:55.651 --> 02:13:58.710
<v Speaker 4>the media is not going to get to investigative and we're going to make sure we</v>

4685
02:13:58.711 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 4>protect your secrets enough so you don't have to worry.</v>

4686
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:04.290
<v Speaker 4>That's what wikileaks and groups like it don't do.</v>

4687
02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:06.290
<v Speaker 4>And the truth is,</v>

4688
02:14:06.291 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 4>is I think we can all agree that there are secrets that should not come out.</v>

4689
02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4690
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:12.690
<v Speaker 4>the government abuses this privilege over and over again,</v>

4691
02:14:12.691 --> 02:14:15.630
<v Speaker 4>but if it's really going to kill us service members for example.</v>

4692
02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:16.020
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

4693
02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:16.710
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4694
02:14:16.710 --> 02:14:17.610
<v Speaker 4>I understand that.</v>

4695
02:14:17.730 --> 02:14:20.370
<v Speaker 4>But when you say anything's going to kill us service members,</v>

4696
02:14:20.371 --> 02:14:21.021
<v Speaker 4>so I mean that,</v>

4697
02:14:21.021 --> 02:14:21.900
<v Speaker 4>that when you abuse it,</v>

4698
02:14:21.901 --> 02:14:22.320
<v Speaker 4>you stop,</v>

4699
02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.153
<v Speaker 4>you lose me.</v>

4700
02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:23.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4701
02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:23.971
<v Speaker 4>if the,</v>

4702
02:14:23.971 --> 02:14:26.040
<v Speaker 4>if the media and the government were doing their job,</v>

4703
02:14:26.041 --> 02:14:28.410
<v Speaker 4>you don't need a wiki leaks when they're not.</v>

4704
02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Is it better to have no wikileaks at all or is it better to have a wikileaks</v>

4705
02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:33.780
<v Speaker 4>with all its flaws?</v>

4706
02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:35.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry if the government,</v>

4707
02:14:35.490 --> 02:14:40.490
<v Speaker 4>if the stuff that we're already finding out opens up such a window of importance</v>

4708
02:14:40.651 --> 02:14:44.280
<v Speaker 4>in terms of us understanding how the world really works behind the scenes.</v>

4709
02:14:44.670 --> 02:14:45.211
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

4710
02:14:45.211 --> 02:14:47.370
<v Speaker 4>to me that's pretty darn invaluable.</v>

4711
02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:47.881
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

4712
02:14:47.881 --> 02:14:48.131
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

4713
02:14:48.131 --> 02:14:48.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm biased as,</v>

4714
02:14:48.971 --> 02:14:49.830
<v Speaker 4>as a journalistic guy.</v>

4715
02:14:49.831 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 4>I believe in that kind of openness.</v>

4716
02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:52.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4717
02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:52.801
<v Speaker 6>most certainly.</v>

4718
02:14:52.801 --> 02:14:53.041
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

4719
02:14:53.041 --> 02:14:53.671
<v Speaker 6>and I do too.</v>

4720
02:14:53.671 --> 02:14:55.730
<v Speaker 6>And I believe in it also for the people that are in,</v>

4721
02:14:55.731 --> 02:14:56.011
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

4722
02:14:56.011 --> 02:14:56.960
<v Speaker 6>in power.</v>

4723
02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:58.800
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of my listeners don't,</v>

4724
02:14:58.801 --> 02:14:59.311
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you,</v>

4725
02:14:59.311 --> 02:15:00.780
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them are conditioned,</v>

4726
02:15:00.781 --> 02:15:02.430
<v Speaker 4>I think conditioned to think that that's,</v>

4727
02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:02.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4728
02:15:02.821 --> 02:15:04.920
<v Speaker 4>you're going to release important secrets and get people killed.</v>

4729
02:15:04.921 --> 02:15:08.340
<v Speaker 4>And I got a lot of flack when I said that I was in favor of wikileaks releasing</v>

4730
02:15:08.341 --> 02:15:09.174
<v Speaker 4>some of this stuff.</v>

4731
02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:11.150
<v Speaker 6>You can correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

4732
02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:11.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4733
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:12.231
<v Speaker 6>online people,</v>

4734
02:15:12.231 --> 02:15:15.200
<v Speaker 6>but I don't believe they released any names of anyone that,</v>

4735
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:17.300
<v Speaker 6>who security hadn't already been compromised.</v>

4736
02:15:17.370 --> 02:15:17.521
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4737
02:15:17.521 --> 02:15:18.151
<v Speaker 4>and to be honest,</v>

4738
02:15:18.151 --> 02:15:18.781
<v Speaker 4>we may not know,</v>

4739
02:15:18.781 --> 02:15:19.770
<v Speaker 4>but has the,</v>

4740
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:22.170
<v Speaker 4>has the world falling apart since they did?</v>

4741
02:15:22.171 --> 02:15:22.471
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4742
02:15:22.471 --> 02:15:22.831
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4743
02:15:22.831 --> 02:15:25.140
<v Speaker 4>I think we can see here it has an exactly destroyed everything.</v>

4744
02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:30.200
<v Speaker 6>We got to look into the mentality of the people that are in the military in</v>

4745
02:15:31.021 --> 02:15:32.550
<v Speaker 6>crisis situations like that.</v>

4746
02:15:32.551 --> 02:15:33.930
<v Speaker 6>A collateral murder video.</v>

4747
02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:34.261
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4748
02:15:34.261 --> 02:15:35.130
<v Speaker 4>it's bigger than that minister,</v>

4749
02:15:35.150 --> 02:15:36.800
<v Speaker 4>diplomatic stuff going and,</v>

4750
02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:37.580
<v Speaker 4>and I mean,</v>

4751
02:15:37.580 --> 02:15:37.980
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

4752
02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:39.300
<v Speaker 4>The truth of the matter is is,</v>

4753
02:15:39.570 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 4>is you can only form a,</v>

4754
02:15:41.701 --> 02:15:41.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4755
02:15:41.881 --> 02:15:42.150
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

4756
02:15:42.150 --> 02:15:42.380
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

4757
02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:43.560
<v Speaker 4>when you analyze news,</v>

4758
02:15:43.561 --> 02:15:43.711
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4759
02:15:43.711 --> 02:15:44.011
<v Speaker 4>You said,</v>

4760
02:15:44.011 --> 02:15:44.791
<v Speaker 4>Dan Carlin's during this,</v>

4761
02:15:44.791 --> 02:15:45.624
<v Speaker 4>the young Turks are doing it.</v>

4762
02:15:45.630 --> 02:15:47.130
<v Speaker 4>We're doing news analysis.</v>

4763
02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:51.450
<v Speaker 4>But that requires you to have enough facts to really analyze.</v>

4764
02:15:51.451 --> 02:15:52.141
<v Speaker 4>If you don't,</v>

4765
02:15:52.141 --> 02:15:55.140
<v Speaker 4>you can't give it an analysis that has any sort of value at all.</v>

4766
02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:59.130
<v Speaker 4>And wikileaks was providing context that the media used to provide.</v>

4767
02:15:59.480 --> 02:15:59.841
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4768
02:15:59.841 --> 02:15:59.921
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4769
02:15:59.921 --> 02:16:00.681
<v Speaker 6>I think in,</v>

4770
02:16:00.681 --> 02:16:00.981
<v Speaker 6>in the,</v>

4771
02:16:00.981 --> 02:16:02.000
<v Speaker 6>in their situation,</v>

4772
02:16:02.001 --> 02:16:02.960
<v Speaker 6>I think their,</v>

4773
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:07.250
<v Speaker 6>their position was so extreme having this secret files,</v>

4774
02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:10.240
<v Speaker 6>having this access to this one guy and having secret files down.</v>

4775
02:16:10.370 --> 02:16:14.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how the media could have gotten that in any other way unless it's</v>

4776
02:16:14.481 --> 02:16:17.450
<v Speaker 6>Bradley manning guy or someone like him offered that stuff.</v>

4777
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.630
<v Speaker 4>That's how it would have been the,</v>

4778
02:16:18.631 --> 02:16:19.560
<v Speaker 4>and that's how it used to be.</v>

4779
02:16:19.630 --> 02:16:20.930
<v Speaker 4>What would happen is that we'll,</v>

4780
02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:23.370
<v Speaker 4>how did it happen for a Woodward and Bernstein?</v>

4781
02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:26.070
<v Speaker 4>You had a guy who was in the CIA,</v>

4782
02:16:26.071 --> 02:16:27.300
<v Speaker 4>one of the top people,</v>

4783
02:16:27.301 --> 02:16:28.380
<v Speaker 4>feet deep throat.</v>

4784
02:16:28.410 --> 02:16:29.243
<v Speaker 4>Who was that?</v>

4785
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

4786
02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:31.990
<v Speaker 4>he died just a few years ago.</v>

4787
02:16:31.991 --> 02:16:32.590
<v Speaker 4>What they know.</v>

4788
02:16:32.590 --> 02:16:33.101
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4789
02:16:33.101 --> 02:16:34.000
<v Speaker 4>They know who he is now.</v>

4790
02:16:34.001 --> 02:16:37.040
<v Speaker 4>And he was disgruntled and mad at being a,</v>

4791
02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:41.050
<v Speaker 4>not getting a promotion and all this and so he was feeding them this stuff that</v>

4792
02:16:41.051 --> 02:16:42.340
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't allowed to feed them.</v>

4793
02:16:42.341 --> 02:16:42.851
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

4794
02:16:42.851 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm the guy who,</v>

4795
02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:44.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4796
02:16:44.710 --> 02:16:46.780
<v Speaker 4>Daniel Ellsberg who was involved in that whole thing,</v>

4797
02:16:46.781 --> 02:16:47.680
<v Speaker 4>the Pentagon papers.</v>

4798
02:16:47.890 --> 02:16:50.320
<v Speaker 4>He says today that Julian Assange is,</v>

4799
02:16:50.350 --> 02:16:55.180
<v Speaker 4>is the modern day version of him and that he could have been brought up on the</v>

4800
02:16:55.181 --> 02:16:56.830
<v Speaker 4>exact same charge as an almost was,</v>

4801
02:16:57.010 --> 02:16:57.251
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4802
02:16:57.251 --> 02:17:02.251
<v Speaker 4>to bring up the 1917 espionage act as a way to go after somebody in the modern</v>

4803
02:17:03.521 --> 02:17:07.740
<v Speaker 4>21st century world is to me an example of how desperate they are mean.</v>

4804
02:17:07.810 --> 02:17:09.070
<v Speaker 4>Here's all you have to know.</v>

4805
02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:12.940
<v Speaker 4>This isn't really about this or that individual losing their lives.</v>

4806
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:16.960
<v Speaker 4>This is about how much scandal you would have if we really knew what was going</v>

4807
02:17:16.961 --> 02:17:20.640
<v Speaker 4>on behind the scenes and what are politicians gave the okay for</v>

4808
02:17:23.490 --> 02:17:25.170
<v Speaker 4>in the same way that Watergate was.</v>

4809
02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4810
02:17:26.050 --> 02:17:26.883
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

4811
02:17:27.130 --> 02:17:29.440
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange to me watching him in the embassy,</v>

4812
02:17:29.850 --> 02:17:34.850
<v Speaker 1>was he the Guatemalan embassy and just hang out on a balcony giving speeches.</v>

4813
02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:36.940
<v Speaker 1>You said Ross Perot.</v>

4814
02:17:36.941 --> 02:17:37.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4815
02:17:37.201 --> 02:17:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not</v>

4816
02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:37.681
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

4817
02:17:37.681 --> 02:17:40.530
<v Speaker 4>Part of the problem here is that this guy is such a weirdo anyway.</v>

4818
02:17:40.531 --> 02:17:41.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4819
02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:44.520
<v Speaker 4>if you'd had the all American boy that it would be a lot harder.</v>

4820
02:17:44.521 --> 02:17:46.020
<v Speaker 4>You'd still find weirder stories.</v>

4821
02:17:46.021 --> 02:17:49.410
<v Speaker 4>But why is it always one of these guys where it's so easy?</v>

4822
02:17:49.470 --> 02:17:49.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4823
02:17:49.681 --> 02:17:50.041
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

4824
02:17:50.041 --> 02:17:50.520
<v Speaker 1>why do that?</v>

4825
02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Why does he have to help so much?</v>

4826
02:17:52.261 --> 02:17:52.621
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4827
02:17:52.621 --> 02:17:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the video of him dancing?</v>

4828
02:17:54.330 --> 02:17:54.931
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4829
02:17:54.931 --> 02:17:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine.</v>

4830
02:17:55.891 --> 02:17:56.521
<v Speaker 1>You must see it.</v>

4831

<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>

4832
02:17:57.210 --> 02:17:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>

4833
02:17:57.860 --> 02:17:58.510
<v Speaker 1>We can do that though.</v>

4834
02:17:58.510 --> 02:18:01.350
<v Speaker 1>The marvels of 21st of this studio has capabilities.</v>

4835
02:18:01.351 --> 02:18:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Mind doesn't have it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm looking up at Edmond Joe's wonderful monitor here.</v>

4842
02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Julian assigns dancing is one of the silliest things you've ever seen in your</v>

4843
02:18:12.001 --> 02:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>life because did it get leaked?</v>

4844
02:18:13.711 --> 02:18:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Is that how we know about it?</v>

4845

<v Speaker 1>It must've a rival anonymous from gets.</v>

4846
02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:20.120
<v Speaker 1>What about someone who wanted to put a stop to this nonsense?</v>

4847
02:18:20.121 --> 02:18:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4848

4851
02:18:23.250 --> 02:18:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4852
02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:25.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a funny thing because we will judge you by the way.</v>

4853
02:18:25.741 --> 02:18:26.850
<v Speaker 1>You move your body to music,</v>

4854
02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:29.280
<v Speaker 1>which is why I won't do that on video.</v>

4855
02:18:29.310 --> 02:18:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4856
02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:30.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

4857
02:18:30.210 --> 02:18:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to be respected.</v>

4858
02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4859
02:18:31.650 --> 02:18:32.730

4860
02:18:32.731 --> 02:18:33.270
<v Speaker 1>There's any difference.</v>

4861
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I am willing to dance at every possible opportunity to keep me from ever having</v>

4862
02:18:37.441 --> 02:18:38.670
<v Speaker 1>to be in any sort of a political</v>

4863
02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:39.240
<v Speaker 7>position.</v>

4864
02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:39.600
<v Speaker 7>Let's see.</v>

4865
02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:40.433
<v Speaker 7>Look at this.</v>

4866
02:18:40.530 --> 02:18:41.363
<v Speaker 7>First of all.</v>

4867
02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:42.350
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4868
02:18:42.350 --> 02:18:44.960
<v Speaker 1>How much ecstasy do you have to be on before you want to dance like that?</v>

4869
02:18:44.961 --> 02:18:45.794
<v Speaker 1>Did we lose it?</v>

4870
02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

4871
02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:49.160
<v Speaker 1>we have the shittiest fucking Internet here.</v>

4872
02:18:49.330 --> 02:18:51.340
<v Speaker 7>It's getting fixed by the end of this month.</v>

4873
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.830
<v Speaker 7>We're almost,</v>

4874
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:54.401
<v Speaker 7>when is this?</v>

4875
02:18:54.401 --> 02:18:56.120
<v Speaker 7>Does anybody know where this is taken?</v>

4876
02:18:56.121 --> 02:18:58.270
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't matter if this was taken in a past life.</v>

4877
02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:00.910
<v Speaker 7>He's guilty and he's all by himself.</v>

4878
02:19:00.911 --> 02:19:01.250
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>

4879
02:19:01.250 --> 02:19:01.720
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

4880
02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:02.680
<v Speaker 7>Oh my gosh.</v>

4881
02:19:02.770 --> 02:19:04.060
<v Speaker 7>Look at him by himself.</v>

4882
02:19:04.210 --> 02:19:06.370
<v Speaker 7>Imagine Ross Perot dancing like that.</v>

4883
02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:07.930
<v Speaker 7>He'd never be President Clinton.</v>

4884
02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:08.600
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4885
02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:09.433
<v Speaker 7>Clinton's done that.</v>

4886
02:19:09.490 --> 02:19:10.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4887
02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:11.260
<v Speaker 7>the club was a lot darker.</v>

4888
02:19:11.350 --> 02:19:13.780
<v Speaker 7>This is what the Clinton do before he shot his third load.</v>

4889
02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:16.110
<v Speaker 7>It goes out there to get a little exercise.</v>

4890
02:19:16.660 --> 02:19:17.111
<v Speaker 7>I've just,</v>

4891
02:19:17.111 --> 02:19:17.944
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry this,</v>

4892
02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:19.330
<v Speaker 7>this is part of the problem though.</v>

4893
02:19:19.331 --> 02:19:19.571
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

4894
02:19:19.571 --> 02:19:21.350
<v Speaker 7>you know Julian Assange Lens Lens.</v>

4895
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:22.061
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4896
02:19:22.061 --> 02:19:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Look at it this way.</v>

4897
02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:23.473
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

4898
02:19:25.250 --> 02:19:25.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4899
02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:26.293
<v Speaker 1>that is pretty funny.</v>

4900
02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite</v>

4901
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.701
<v Speaker 5>gay.</v>

4902
02:19:28.701 --> 02:19:30.380
<v Speaker 5>It's not quite feminine.</v>

4903
02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:31.790
<v Speaker 5>It's not masculine.</v>

4904
02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:32.653
<v Speaker 5>Pretty damn good.</v>

4905
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:33.703
<v Speaker 5>You like it.</v>

4906
02:19:34.290 --> 02:19:35.120

4907
02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:35.511

<v Speaker 5>Who's taking those guys home and some poor girl rocks?</v>

4911
02:19:46.310 --> 02:19:46.490
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

4912
02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:47.930
<v Speaker 5>his situation is hilarious.</v>

4913
02:19:47.931 --> 02:19:50.480
<v Speaker 5>If you know the story with what they're charging him with,</v>

4914
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:51.680
<v Speaker 5>when everybody sees like,</v>

4915

02:19:53.331 --> 02:19:55.130

4920
02:19:55.131 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 5>She must've been guilty of leaking secrets.</v>

4921
02:19:56.841 --> 02:19:58.040
<v Speaker 5>He must be guilty of something bad.</v>

4922
02:19:58.730 --> 02:19:59.900
<v Speaker 5>That's not why they're after him.</v>

4923
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.943
<v Speaker 5>Thereafter,</v>

4924
02:20:00.990 --> 02:20:03.890
<v Speaker 5>they're after him because he had sex with a woman.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and this is what folks don't understand.</v>

4927
02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:10.430
<v Speaker 5>The actual charges they've trumped up against Julian Assange are,</v>

4928
02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:11.970
<v Speaker 5>he had had sex with him,</v>

4929
02:20:11.971 --> 02:20:12.651
<v Speaker 5>one with the condom.</v>

4930
02:20:12.651 --> 02:20:13.700
<v Speaker 5>They were lying in bed naked.</v>

4931
02:20:13.701 --> 02:20:15.020
<v Speaker 5>He stuck it in without a condom.</v>

4932
02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:15.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4933
02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:15.890
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

4934
02:20:15.890 --> 02:20:16.221
<v Speaker 5>here's the,</v>

4935
02:20:16.221 --> 02:20:16.911
<v Speaker 5>here's the key.</v>

4936
02:20:16.911 --> 02:20:17.210
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

4937
02:20:17.210 --> 02:20:17.871
<v Speaker 5>he's sending,</v>

4938
02:20:17.871 --> 02:20:18.651
<v Speaker 5>his lawyers have said,</v>

4939
02:20:18.651 --> 02:20:19.580
<v Speaker 5>as I understand it,</v>

4940
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:22.700
<v Speaker 5>that as long as he gets a written pledge from our government,</v>

4941
02:20:22.701 --> 02:20:23.534
<v Speaker 5>the British government,</v>

4942
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:24.860
<v Speaker 5>that they're not going to nab him.</v>

4943
02:20:24.861 --> 02:20:26.300
<v Speaker 5>He'll go back and face the charges.</v>

4944
02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:27.201
<v Speaker 5>The key is,</v>

4945
02:20:27.201 --> 02:20:30.770
<v Speaker 5>is everybody knows that those are the governments that wanted it.</v>

4946
02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:33.620
<v Speaker 5>The danger isn't that he's going to go to Sweden and face these charges.</v>

4947
02:20:33.621 --> 02:20:36.620
<v Speaker 5>The danger is that somebody is going to disappear him.</v>

4948
02:20:36.621 --> 02:20:37.131
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

4949
02:20:37.131 --> 02:20:40.400
<v Speaker 5>And he's given a dissident and the government would like to do that to set an</v>

4950
02:20:40.401 --> 02:20:41.234
<v Speaker 5>example.</v>

4951
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:42.141
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>

4952
02:20:42.141 --> 02:20:42.501
<v Speaker 5>is one,</v>

4953
02:20:42.501 --> 02:20:43.680
<v Speaker 5>he's not an American citizen.</v>

4954
02:20:43.681 --> 02:20:43.940
<v Speaker 5>So what?</v>

4955
02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:45.800
<v Speaker 5>You can't charge him with the same things.</v>

4956
02:20:45.801 --> 02:20:47.120
<v Speaker 5>You could charge a Bradley Manning.</v>

4957
02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:48.350
<v Speaker 5>Would he become,</v>

4958
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:51.230
<v Speaker 5>do you think you'd become a martyr if something like that happened?</v>

4959
02:20:51.231 --> 02:20:52.160
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think there's a danger?</v>

4960
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:53.660
<v Speaker 5>You're already getting some of that?</v>

4961
02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:53.960
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4962
02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:54.380
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4963
02:20:54.380 --> 02:20:55.000
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

4964
02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:55.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4965
02:20:55.530 --> 02:20:56.000
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

4966
02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the government cares too much about that.</v>

4967
02:20:58.011 --> 02:21:01.760
<v Speaker 5>I think their attitude is they want you to see what happens to somebody who does</v>

4968
02:21:01.761 --> 02:21:04.220
<v Speaker 5>what Julian Assange does so that you know,</v>

4969
02:21:04.221 --> 02:21:04.910
<v Speaker 5>if you do it.</v>

4970
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:05.480
<v Speaker 5>I think the,</v>

4971
02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:06.590
<v Speaker 5>who was the guy who just died?</v>

4972
02:21:06.591 --> 02:21:07.520
<v Speaker 5>He just killed himself.</v>

4973
02:21:07.730 --> 02:21:09.270
<v Speaker 5>That the government was after for stealing files.</v>

4974
02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:10.041
<v Speaker 5>Aaron,</v>

4975
02:21:10.041 --> 02:21:11.000
<v Speaker 5>what was his last name?</v>

4976
02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:14.540
<v Speaker 5>The guy who killed himself was under pressure from the governor for stealing</v>

4977
02:21:14.541 --> 02:21:15.560
<v Speaker 5>some stuff from MIT,</v>

4978
02:21:15.561 --> 02:21:16.490
<v Speaker 5>some digital files.</v>

4979
02:21:16.491 --> 02:21:17.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm not aware of this guy.</v>

4980
02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:17.780
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4981
02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:18.111
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>

4982
02:21:18.111 --> 02:21:18.381
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

4983
02:21:18.381 --> 02:21:19.191
<v Speaker 5>this is a big story.</v>

4984
02:21:19.191 --> 02:21:20.090
<v Speaker 5>The guy killed himself,</v>

4985
02:21:20.091 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 5>a big computer guy who helped create a child himself.</v>

4986
02:21:23.661 --> 02:21:24.170
<v Speaker 5>Aaron,</v>

4987
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.860
<v Speaker 5>Aaron.</v>

4988
02:21:24.860 --> 02:21:25.251
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4989
02:21:25.251 --> 02:21:25.920
<v Speaker 5>I know who you're talking,</v>

4990
02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:26.241
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

4991
02:21:26.241 --> 02:21:27.390
<v Speaker 5>How can I forget his last time?</v>

4992
02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:31.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to ask the guy who was the responsible for the creation of RSS feeds.</v>

4993
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:32.120
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

4994
02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:32.481
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

4995
02:21:32.481 --> 02:21:32.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4996
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:33.340
<v Speaker 5>Aaron Schwartz.</v>

4997
02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:33.651
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

4998
02:21:33.651 --> 02:21:34.131
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

4999
02:21:34.131 --> 02:21:34.791
<v Speaker 5>I should have known that.</v>

5000
02:21:34.791 --> 02:21:34.961
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5001
02:21:34.961 --> 02:21:39.961
<v Speaker 5>and but he's another example where the government wants to break that guy as,</v>

5002
02:21:40.791 --> 02:21:43.010
<v Speaker 5>as to set a precedent so that you know,</v>

5003
02:21:43.011 --> 02:21:44.600
<v Speaker 5>when you want to try to do something like that,</v>

5004
02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:47.180
<v Speaker 5>you're sacrificing your life in effect,</v>

5005
02:21:47.230 --> 02:21:47.920
<v Speaker 5>in effect.</v>

5006
02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:48.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5007
02:21:48.330 --> 02:21:49.250
<v Speaker 5>you can do this,</v>

5008
02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.380
<v Speaker 5>but look at what happened at the last guy who did it.</v>

5009
02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:52.041
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

5010
02:21:52.041 --> 02:21:52.874
<v Speaker 5>I think what they want to do too,</v>

5011
02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:53.541
<v Speaker 5>with signage to,</v>

5012
02:21:53.541 --> 02:21:54.980
<v Speaker 5>to say to all those hackers out there,</v>

5013
02:21:55.130 --> 02:21:55.460
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5014
02:21:55.460 --> 02:21:55.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5015
02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:56.271
<v Speaker 5>just so you know,</v>

5016
02:21:56.271 --> 02:21:57.140
<v Speaker 5>you're playing with your future.</v>

5017
02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:59.270
<v Speaker 5>They've done this at the so called ecoterrorists too,</v>

5018
02:21:59.271 --> 02:22:02.120
<v Speaker 5>where they'll give you 35 years or something for,</v>

5019
02:22:02.121 --> 02:22:05.260
<v Speaker 5>for starting a fire where you can kill a guy and get out in 12.</v>

5020
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:07.340
<v Speaker 5>And could they put you on no fly list?</v>

5021
02:22:07.370 --> 02:22:07.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5022
02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:08.390
<v Speaker 5>you're done.</v>

5023
02:22:08.390 --> 02:22:10.880
<v Speaker 5>They'd do everything they can to sort of stifle your life.</v>

5024
02:22:11.390 --> 02:22:12.110
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

5025
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:13.880
<v Speaker 5>the fact that we accept that though,</v>

5026
02:22:13.881 --> 02:22:14.960
<v Speaker 5>the fact that this,</v>

5027
02:22:14.961 --> 02:22:19.961
<v Speaker 5>this guy does not have the same access to a representation to rights that,</v>

5028
02:22:20.390 --> 02:22:23.090
<v Speaker 5>that we do that he's not an American start.</v>

5029
02:22:23.091 --> 02:22:23.901
<v Speaker 5>Start with that though.</v>

5030
02:22:23.901 --> 02:22:24.171
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5031
02:22:24.171 --> 02:22:24.560
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

5032
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.030
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

5033
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 5>and not that an American</v>

5034
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:28.560
<v Speaker 4>would either if you were accused of a crime of terrorism,</v>

5035
02:22:28.561 --> 02:22:29.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5036
02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:29.431
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

5037
02:22:29.431 --> 02:22:31.950
<v Speaker 4>if you're accused of a crime of terrorism and you're in a place like</v>

5038
02:22:31.951 --> 02:22:32.820
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan,</v>

5039
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:34.080
<v Speaker 4>you have no rights at all.</v>

5040
02:22:34.081 --> 02:22:36.900
<v Speaker 4>If a guy in the executive branch of government decides,</v>

5041
02:22:37.130 --> 02:22:37.281
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5042
02:22:37.281 --> 02:22:39.620
<v Speaker 6>what a creepy sweeping term terrorism is,</v>

5043
02:22:39.621 --> 02:22:42.170
<v Speaker 6>if it applies to you exposing murder.</v>

5044
02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:44.350
<v Speaker 6>And just so exposing the,</v>

5045
02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:48.730
<v Speaker 6>whether it's an aptitude or just a casual disdain or,</v>

5046
02:22:48.731 --> 02:22:48.940
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

5047
02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:49.131
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

5048
02:22:49.131 --> 02:22:50.330
<v Speaker 6>or just,</v>

5049
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:51.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5050
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:51.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5051
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:53.660
<v Speaker 6>a lack of respect for human life.</v>

5052
02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:56.200
<v Speaker 4>And here's the thing you want to get into history and where history is</v>

5053
02:22:56.201 --> 02:22:57.034
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

5054
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:58.240
<v Speaker 4>Every time,</v>

5055
02:22:58.380 --> 02:22:59.440
<v Speaker 4>every is a sweeping word,</v>

5056
02:22:59.441 --> 02:22:59.921
<v Speaker 4>but many,</v>

5057
02:22:59.921 --> 02:23:03.460
<v Speaker 4>many times throughout history when someone wants to exempt people from the</v>

5058
02:23:03.461 --> 02:23:04.630
<v Speaker 4>normal rules of conduct,</v>

5059
02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:06.340
<v Speaker 4>you call them terrorists.</v>

5060
02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:07.181
<v Speaker 4>It's a term,</v>

5061
02:23:07.181 --> 02:23:07.901
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not,</v>

5062
02:23:07.901 --> 02:23:12.310
<v Speaker 4>Adolph Hitler used it when he was explaining why you didn't have to treat</v>

5063
02:23:12.311 --> 02:23:16.270
<v Speaker 4>captured prisoners in the Soviet Union with any sort of the laws of war.</v>

5064
02:23:16.390 --> 02:23:17.320
<v Speaker 4>They're terrorists,</v>

5065
02:23:17.530 --> 02:23:18.363
<v Speaker 4>Jews,</v>

5066
02:23:18.430 --> 02:23:23.430
<v Speaker 4>commissar has anyone found behind the front lines is a terrorist which exempts</v>

5067
02:23:23.561 --> 02:23:25.360
<v Speaker 4>you from treating them like prisoners of war.</v>

5068
02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:26.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5069
02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:29.980
<v Speaker 4>terrorist is a word that means anything you want it to mean.</v>

5070
02:23:30.010 --> 02:23:32.140
<v Speaker 4>And it's been proven to be that over and over.</v>

5071
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.681
<v Speaker 4>Not that,</v>

5072
02:23:32.681 --> 02:23:34.540
<v Speaker 4>not that there aren't real terrorists,</v>

5073
02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:38.900
<v Speaker 4>but the term is so remarkably flexible and allows you to essentially how,</v>

5074
02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:41.950
<v Speaker 4>who can you waterboard you could only waterboard terrorist who's a terrorist.</v>

5075
02:23:42.610 --> 02:23:43.690
<v Speaker 4>That's to be determined.</v>

5076
02:23:43.810 --> 02:23:45.670
<v Speaker 4>We don't know who tomorrow's terrorists are.</v>

5077
02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:46.900
<v Speaker 4>We'll tell you when we get there.</v>

5078
02:23:47.010 --> 02:23:47.161
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5079
02:23:47.161 --> 02:23:50.760
<v Speaker 6>terrorists are also defined as people sell drugs.</v>

5080
02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:51.511
<v Speaker 6>They've,</v>

5081
02:23:51.511 --> 02:23:52.050
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5082
02:23:52.050 --> 02:23:55.830
<v Speaker 6>because of all these different things that they passed the Patriot Act,</v>

5083
02:23:55.831 --> 02:23:57.510
<v Speaker 6>the Patriot Act to the NDA.</v>

5084
02:23:57.540 --> 02:23:57.751
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5085
02:23:57.751 --> 02:24:01.830
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that they've done in these sort of sweeping definitions as</v>

5086
02:24:01.831 --> 02:24:02.340
<v Speaker 6>they've,</v>

5087
02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:02.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5088
02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:07.380
<v Speaker 6>they've allowed the government to use things that were supposed to be there to</v>

5089
02:24:07.381 --> 02:24:10.560
<v Speaker 6>protect you from terrorism or to enforce laws against terrorism.</v>

5090
02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:12.030
<v Speaker 6>And now they use it for drugs.</v>

5091
02:24:12.031 --> 02:24:12.781
<v Speaker 6>Like for instance,</v>

5092
02:24:12.781 --> 02:24:13.590
<v Speaker 6>the Patriot Act,</v>

5093
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:18.590
<v Speaker 6>the Patriot Act has been used rough more than a thousand times for drugs.</v>

5094
02:24:18.930 --> 02:24:19.260
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

5095
02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:20.550
<v Speaker 4>this goes way back though.</v>

5096
02:24:20.551 --> 02:24:20.910
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5097
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:25.890
<v Speaker 4>it's the old American Canard of the targeted extra extraordinary law.</v>

5098
02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:27.930
<v Speaker 4>Start with Rico.</v>

5099
02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:29.880
<v Speaker 4>Most people have heard of the Rico Act.</v>

5100
02:24:29.881 --> 02:24:32.700
<v Speaker 4>We use the Rico act against everybody in their brother today,</v>

5101
02:24:32.701 --> 02:24:33.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5102
02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:36.120
<v Speaker 4>The Rico Act is an extra constitutional law.</v>

5103
02:24:36.330 --> 02:24:39.990
<v Speaker 4>It was extra constitutional because when we passed it in the early seventies,</v>

5104
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:43.560
<v Speaker 4>we needed to go after the mafia organized crime.</v>

5105
02:24:43.561 --> 02:24:46.920
<v Speaker 4>And the way this thing was sold is that organized crime because of their power,</v>

5106
02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:50.370
<v Speaker 4>was resistant to normal rules and approaches.</v>

5107
02:24:50.490 --> 02:24:55.380
<v Speaker 4>So you had to have special laws and it will only be used against organized</v>

5108
02:24:55.381 --> 02:24:55.681
<v Speaker 4>crime.</v>

5109
02:24:55.681 --> 02:24:56.191
<v Speaker 4>And the Mafia.</v>

5110
02:24:56.191 --> 02:24:57.001
<v Speaker 4>He was really the Mafia.</v>

5111
02:24:57.001 --> 02:24:58.080
<v Speaker 4>We called it organized crime,</v>

5112
02:24:58.081 --> 02:25:01.500
<v Speaker 4>but it was the mafia and because they were so specially powerful and so</v>

5113
02:25:01.501 --> 02:25:02.071
<v Speaker 4>insulated,</v>

5114
02:25:02.071 --> 02:25:03.300
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't get the top guys.</v>

5115
02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:06.990
<v Speaker 4>We were going to have a special law that just applied to them and just like all</v>

5116
02:25:06.991 --> 02:25:11.310
<v Speaker 4>these other special laws eventually becomes too nice and easy of a tool to start</v>

5117
02:25:11.311 --> 02:25:12.480
<v Speaker 4>applying it to other things.</v>

5118
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:16.020
<v Speaker 4>We use Rico against two people in a room making a drug deal.</v>

5119
02:25:16.021 --> 02:25:18.620
<v Speaker 4>Now all but this is a long history.</v>

5120
02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Anytime they pass a special law that's extra constitutional because of the</v>

5121
02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 4>extremity of the threat,</v>

5122
02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:26.680
<v Speaker 4>it always gets brought down to lower level.</v>

5123
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:27.940
<v Speaker 1>When people don't understand,</v>

5124
02:25:27.941 --> 02:25:29.320
<v Speaker 1>if you hear about the Patriot Act,</v>

5125
02:25:29.321 --> 02:25:29.531
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

5126
02:25:29.531 --> 02:25:30.720
<v Speaker 1>well guess that's a,</v>

5127
02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:34.690
<v Speaker 1>so they can stop people from plotting crimes against America.</v>

5128
02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:39.180
<v Speaker 1>The Patriot Act is used way more for marijuana than it ever has been for Teleco.</v>

5129
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Wrote about this in his book too.</v>

5130
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:42.470
<v Speaker 1>In 2011 the,</v>

5131
02:25:42.471 --> 02:25:42.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5132
02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:46.750
<v Speaker 1>the numbers were 1,618 drug cases,</v>

5133
02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:49.090
<v Speaker 1>15 terrorism cases.</v>

5134
02:25:49.390 --> 02:25:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5135
02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5136
02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:51.460
<v Speaker 1>there just isn't that much terrorism.</v>

5137
02:25:51.490 --> 02:25:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a waste of a good law and that is a problem with having laws and</v>

5138
02:25:57.221 --> 02:25:59.950
<v Speaker 1>then removing laws that people have to be aware of when they talk about,</v>

5139
02:25:59.951 --> 02:26:00.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5140
02:26:00.191 --> 02:26:00.341
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

5141
02:26:00.341 --> 02:26:01.840
<v Speaker 1>they should just make drugs legal.</v>

5142
02:26:02.050 --> 02:26:03.850
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do with all his DEA agents?</v>

5143
02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Were you going to do with those people that don't have jobs?</v>

5144
02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:06.853
<v Speaker 4>Back to the media thing,</v>

5145
02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:09.440
<v Speaker 4>how does the president not have to answer a question about that?</v>

5146
02:26:09.441 --> 02:26:09.890
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

5147
02:26:09.890 --> 02:26:10.630
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>

5148
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:11.050
<v Speaker 4>the the,</v>

5149
02:26:11.050 --> 02:26:15.830
<v Speaker 4>the fact that this all goes on confounds us because nobody ever has to comment</v>

5150
02:26:15.831 --> 02:26:16.011
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

5151
02:26:16.011 --> 02:26:17.960
<v Speaker 4>The job of the journalist is say to the president,</v>

5152
02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:21.230
<v Speaker 4>16,000 [inaudible] say exactly what you said and say,</v>

5153
02:26:21.231 --> 02:26:24.410
<v Speaker 4>what's your opinion of that and what are you going to do about it?</v>

5154
02:26:24.690 --> 02:26:25.880
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I mean,</v>

5155
02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:26.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5156
02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:30.470
<v Speaker 4>you watch the British parliament in action sometimes on cspan and every time I</v>

5157
02:26:30.471 --> 02:26:30.981
<v Speaker 4>mentioned this,</v>

5158
02:26:30.981 --> 02:26:31.520
<v Speaker 4>the British,</v>

5159
02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:31.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5160
02:26:31.761 --> 02:26:32.930
<v Speaker 4>podcasting is wonderful,</v>

5161
02:26:32.931 --> 02:26:33.171
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

5162
02:26:33.171 --> 02:26:34.070
<v Speaker 4>You have an international audience.</v>

5163
02:26:34.071 --> 02:26:34.731
<v Speaker 4>The British shall we say,</v>

5164
02:26:34.731 --> 02:26:36.020
<v Speaker 4>don't romanticize it.</v>

5165
02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:37.820
<v Speaker 4>It sucks just as bad as your government,</v>

5166
02:26:37.940 --> 02:26:40.550
<v Speaker 4>but to an American when you watch parliament than action.</v>

5167
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:42.080
<v Speaker 4>And the head of the government,</v>

5168
02:26:42.081 --> 02:26:44.510
<v Speaker 4>the equivalent of our president has to get up there and actually defend his</v>

5169
02:26:44.511 --> 02:26:49.370
<v Speaker 4>policies to the hooting and hollering and borderline violence of the rest of the</v>

5170
02:26:49.371 --> 02:26:50.270
<v Speaker 4>people in parliament.</v>

5171
02:26:51.020 --> 02:26:51.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm done.</v>

5172
02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:53.360
<v Speaker 4>Forget about real reform.</v>

5173
02:26:53.390 --> 02:26:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I just want him to get up there and have to face the questions and hear how they</v>

5174
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:57.440
<v Speaker 4>wheeze allowed.</v>

5175
02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:58.970
<v Speaker 4>If you throw that question,</v>

5176
02:26:59.030 --> 02:27:03.200
<v Speaker 4>like if we'd had a real debate during this last presidential campaign and you</v>

5177
02:27:03.201 --> 02:27:05.960
<v Speaker 4>ask Mitt Romney that question and us Barack Obama,</v>

5178
02:27:05.961 --> 02:27:06.794
<v Speaker 4>that question,</v>

5179
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:07.940
<v Speaker 4>and it was asked by the way,</v>

5180
02:27:07.941 --> 02:27:11.900
<v Speaker 4>if you saw the third party debate where all of those interesting and sometimes</v>

5181
02:27:11.901 --> 02:27:14.300
<v Speaker 4>freaky people actually talked about the issues,</v>

5182
02:27:14.301 --> 02:27:15.200
<v Speaker 4>they brought this up,</v>

5183
02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:18.590
<v Speaker 4>but Barack Obama and Mitt Romney didn't have to talk about it because it wasn't</v>

5184
02:27:18.591 --> 02:27:21.050
<v Speaker 4>agreed to buy them in advance.</v>

5185
02:27:21.470 --> 02:27:24.200
<v Speaker 4>Get to that commission on presidential debates thing where they agree on what</v>

5186
02:27:24.201 --> 02:27:24.860
<v Speaker 4>they're going to talk about.</v>

5187
02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:27.650
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to talk about this and they never talk about this and they never</v>

5188
02:27:27.651 --> 02:27:28.670
<v Speaker 4>get asked this.</v>

5189
02:27:28.970 --> 02:27:29.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5190
02:27:29.211 --> 02:27:32.510
<v Speaker 4>how do you get away with two terms in office and you never have to answer a</v>

5191
02:27:32.511 --> 02:27:33.500
<v Speaker 4>question on that at all.</v>

5192
02:27:33.650 --> 02:27:35.120
<v Speaker 4>The commission for presidential debates,</v>

5193
02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:36.210
<v Speaker 4>for folks who don't know,</v>

5194
02:27:36.270 --> 02:27:37.730
<v Speaker 4>they probably own company as well.</v>

5195
02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:40.520
<v Speaker 4>It's not for Democrats and four Republicans sit on the board.</v>

5196
02:27:42.130 --> 02:27:42.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5197
02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:43.460
<v Speaker 4>do you remember Jeff Gannon?</v>

5198
02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Why does the name ring a bell?</v>

5199
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

5200
02:27:45.210 --> 02:27:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Gannon was the guy who was an embedded White House reporter during the Bush</v>

5201
02:27:49.201 --> 02:27:50.034
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

5202
02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Any would lob these really softball partisan questions at Bush like Mr</v>

5203
02:27:56.071 --> 02:27:56.790
<v Speaker 1>President,</v>

5204
02:27:56.790 --> 02:28:01.790
<v Speaker 1>when are the Democrats going to wake up and come to reality?</v>

5205
02:28:01.890 --> 02:28:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Who did he work for here?</v>

5206
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.823
<v Speaker 1>Here's where it gets crazy.</v>

5207
02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5208
02:28:05.130 --> 02:28:05.963
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>

5209
02:28:06.090 --> 02:28:09.160
<v Speaker 1>but what happened was people started getting suspicious.</v>

5210
02:28:09.161 --> 02:28:09.391
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

5211
02:28:09.391 --> 02:28:10.290
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is this guy?</v>

5212
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:13.020
<v Speaker 1>He's coming back to me a little going on with these questions.</v>

5213
02:28:13.021 --> 02:28:14.220
<v Speaker 1>These are ridiculous questions.</v>

5214
02:28:14.221 --> 02:28:14.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5215
02:28:14.431 --> 02:28:17.280
<v Speaker 1>these are over the top and obvious.</v>

5216
02:28:17.281 --> 02:28:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Even if plant no worse,</v>

5217
02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:24.250
<v Speaker 1>he was a gay prostitute and he was a man who ran a gig prostitute</v>

5218
02:28:24.510 --> 02:28:24.900
<v Speaker 5>site.</v>

5219
02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:25.860
<v Speaker 5>We did not see that coming.</v>

5220
02:28:25.861 --> 02:28:26.850
<v Speaker 5>By the way with him,</v>

5221
02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:31.740
<v Speaker 5>he had dog tags on and a towel over his genitals and he was like naked otherwise</v>

5222
02:28:31.741 --> 02:28:34.250
<v Speaker 5>and famously outed for this.</v>

5223
02:28:34.290 --> 02:28:36.870
<v Speaker 5>I just want to say I didn't know any journalist you don't run back in my day.</v>

5224
02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:38.790
<v Speaker 5>Well I remember this story.</v>

5225
02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:40.170
<v Speaker 5>I remember the guys name.</v>

5226
02:28:40.171 --> 02:28:41.040
<v Speaker 5>But here's my question.</v>

5227
02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5228
02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:45.510
<v Speaker 5>what was the motive for softball and the president?</v>

5229
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:47.650
<v Speaker 5>The question Ken.</v>

5230
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:48.660
<v Speaker 5>Ken Lay mostly.</v>

5231
02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:49.913
<v Speaker 5>Probably.</v>

5232
02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:51.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5233
02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:51.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5234
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.681
<v Speaker 5>Or you know,</v>

5235
02:28:52.681 --> 02:28:53.880
<v Speaker 5>who else wait,</v>

5236
02:28:54.210 --> 02:28:57.960
<v Speaker 5>somebody might say to take up one questioning position that wasn't used by a</v>

5237
02:28:57.961 --> 02:28:59.580
<v Speaker 5>journalist who would have asked a tough question.</v>

5238
02:28:59.660 --> 02:29:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5239
02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:00.980

02:29:01.611 --> 02:29:01.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5242
02:29:01.970 --> 02:29:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I think there was probably some gay people that worked in the White House in</v>

5243
02:29:04.641 --> 02:29:08.990
<v Speaker 1>high positions of power that a wanted this guy around for various reasons.</v>

5244
02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

5245
02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:11.373
<v Speaker 1>no answer to that.</v>

5281
02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:02.350
<v Speaker 1>He was a White House reporter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

5290
02:30:11.610 --> 02:30:14.830
<v Speaker 1>there were worried that he was asking questions so friendly.</v>

5291
02:30:14.831 --> 02:30:18.490
<v Speaker 1>This is in quotes that they might have been planted and this is how people were,</v>

5292
02:30:18.491 --> 02:30:18.701

<v Speaker 1>So they found out that he had some website.</v>

5299
02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:26.561

<v Speaker 1>let me find the name of the website cause it's fucking ridiculous.</v>

5301
02:30:29.980 --> 02:30:31.170

02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:34.180
<v Speaker 1>the super gay super,</v>

<v Speaker 5>If anybody could see me right now.</v>

5305
02:30:37.871 --> 02:30:41.110
<v Speaker 5>My mouth is wide open though cause really I had not heard of this story and I'm</v>

5306
02:30:41.111 --> 02:30:43.810
<v Speaker 5>just thinking about what it took for me to get a press pass,</v>

5307
02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:47.380
<v Speaker 5>not to see the president and this guy had to be fingerprinted,</v>

5308
02:30:47.470 --> 02:30:50.260
<v Speaker 5>background check and the whole thing and made it through all that.</v>

5309
02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:50.770
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5310
02:30:50.770 --> 02:30:51.041
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5311
02:30:51.041 --> 02:30:52.180
<v Speaker 5>Because he was someone's boyfriend.</v>

5312
02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:53.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm almost positive.</v>

5313
02:30:53.501 --> 02:30:55.960
<v Speaker 5>But you gotta be a lot of people's boyfriends cause there's a lot of people</v>

5314
02:30:55.961 --> 02:30:57.390
<v Speaker 5>you've got to get through to get to that gate.</v>

5315
02:30:57.430 --> 02:31:01.090
<v Speaker 5>Well he ran a whole website where he was,</v>

5316
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:02.740
<v Speaker 5>had male escorts.</v>

5317
02:31:03.160 --> 02:31:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5318
02:31:03.460 --> 02:31:06.610
<v Speaker 5>So this is like the Barney frank story where he's got the intern running the</v>

5319
02:31:06.611 --> 02:31:07.820
<v Speaker 5>house of prostitution and,</v>

5320
02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:08.471
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

5321
02:31:08.471 --> 02:31:09.120
<v Speaker 5>That's funny.</v>

5322
02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:09.791
<v Speaker 5>Just check your head.</v>

5323
02:31:09.791 --> 02:31:10.571
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not funny,</v>

5324
02:31:10.571 --> 02:31:11.410
<v Speaker 5>but you know what I mean.</v>

5325
02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:12.460
<v Speaker 5>Check by history.</v>

5326
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:15.543
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5327
02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:17.171
<v Speaker 5>I'll find his,</v>

5328
02:31:17.171 --> 02:31:17.590

5329
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:19.350
<v Speaker 5>his website here cause was,</v>

5330
02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:20.193
<v Speaker 5>it was like a richness.</v>

5331
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Now that's my next question.</v>

5332
02:31:22.081 --> 02:31:22.890
<v Speaker 1>What's he do now?</v>

5333
02:31:22.890 --> 02:31:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5334
02:31:23.310 --> 02:31:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a blogger.</v>

5335
02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Coughing keys.</v>

5336
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Got Congressman from Nebraska.</v>

5337
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5338
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:33.060
<v Speaker 1>he came out in 2006 after it was all over,</v>

5339
02:31:33.061 --> 02:31:36.930
<v Speaker 1>but he was a $200 an hour male escorts cheat.</v>

5340
02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5341
02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:38.520
<v Speaker 1>That's not a lot of money,</v>

5342
02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:40.320
<v Speaker 1>but you're dealing with a long time ago.</v>

5343
02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:43.470
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with the two thousands.</v>

5344
02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5345
02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:44.401
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5346
02:31:44.401 --> 02:31:44.611
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5347
02:31:44.611 --> 02:31:48.410
<v Speaker 1>it's quite fascinating because this is also something that really kind of</v>

5348
02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:50.040
<v Speaker 1>disappeared under the radar.</v>

5349
02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I gotta be honest with you and now that you brought it all up,</v>

5350
02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember this.</v>

5351
02:31:53.490 --> 02:31:54.151
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

5352
02:31:54.151 --> 02:31:54.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5353
02:31:54.451 --> 02:31:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And I can really informed.</v>

5354
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember any of this.</v>

5355
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5356
02:31:56.911 --> 02:31:57.601
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

5357
02:31:57.601 --> 02:31:58.860
<v Speaker 1>How could you call yourself pretty,</v>

5358
02:31:59.130 --> 02:31:59.963
<v Speaker 1>you'll know about that.</v>

5359
02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been proven wrong actually.</v>

5360
02:32:01.981 --> 02:32:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not following the right kind of newsfeeds.</v>

5361
02:32:03.690 --> 02:32:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the,</v>

5362
02:32:04.500 --> 02:32:04.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5363
02:32:04.921 --> 02:32:05.311
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5364
02:32:05.311 --> 02:32:05.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5365
02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:06.750
<v Speaker 1>they caught him,</v>

5366
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:07.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5367
02:32:07.530 --> 02:32:08.131
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

5368
02:32:08.131 --> 02:32:08.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5369
02:32:08.610 --> 02:32:09.031
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5370
02:32:09.031 --> 02:32:09.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5371
02:32:09.330 --> 02:32:10.950
<v Speaker 1>they just looked into his,</v>

5372
02:32:10.951 --> 02:32:11.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5373
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:14.190
<v Speaker 1>his press credentials because people couldn't believe that the silly questions</v>

5374
02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:14.930
<v Speaker 1>that he was asking.</v>

5375
02:32:14.930 --> 02:32:17.520
<v Speaker 1>But you look into the press credentials before you actually get the press</v>

5376
02:32:17.521 --> 02:32:18.031
<v Speaker 1>credentials.</v>

5377
02:32:18.031 --> 02:32:18.960
<v Speaker 1>That's how it goes.</v>

5378
02:32:18.961 --> 02:32:19.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

5379
02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:22.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a law enforcement person signature on the press credentials.</v>

5380
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>

5381
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I've done nothing really bad and my background and I remember sweating out me</v>

5382
02:32:27.661 --> 02:32:28.800
<v Speaker 1>getting press credentials,</v>

5383
02:32:29.310 --> 02:32:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a hard time finding the name of his website is,</v>

5384
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.150
<v Speaker 1>this is an interesting,</v>

5385
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:37.530
<v Speaker 1>but he had naked pictures on a bunch of different gay escort sites.</v>

5386
02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:39.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5387
02:32:39.751 --> 02:32:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to have real doubts about the secret service and the ability of the</v>

5388
02:32:43.411 --> 02:32:44.340
<v Speaker 1>background checks.</v>

5389
02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:46.610
<v Speaker 1>This is what year 2006,</v>

5390
02:32:46.650 --> 02:32:48.330
<v Speaker 1>2003 to 2005.</v>

5391
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:49.950
<v Speaker 1>This war on terror.</v>

5392
02:32:49.980 --> 02:32:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5393
02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:51.300
<v Speaker 1>This is wild.</v>

5394
02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5395
02:32:51.570 --> 02:32:51.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5396
02:32:51.721 --> 02:32:52.554
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating stuff.</v>

5397
02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I think he had a boyfriend.</v>

5398
02:32:53.701 --> 02:32:53.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5399
02:32:53.911 --> 02:32:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unquestionable.</v>

5400
02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when that,</v>

5401
02:32:56.881 --> 02:32:57.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5402
02:32:57.390 --> 02:32:59.400
<v Speaker 1>madam in Washington DC,</v>

5403
02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:00.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5404
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.020
<v Speaker 1>came out with a whole list of different senators and she wasn't a Heidi Fleiss</v>

5405
02:33:04.021 --> 02:33:04.291
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

5406
02:33:04.291 --> 02:33:04.660
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>

5407
02:33:04.660 --> 02:33:04.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5408
02:33:04.791 --> 02:33:04.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5409
02:33:04.841 --> 02:33:05.041
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5410
02:33:05.041 --> 02:33:06.210
<v Speaker 1>This is the DC Madam.</v>

5411
02:33:06.211 --> 02:33:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Then she turned out she committed suicide and all the,</v>

5412
02:33:08.611 --> 02:33:09.090
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

5413
02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:09.531
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

5414
02:33:09.531 --> 02:33:09.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5415
02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:10.740
<v Speaker 1>the names disappeared.</v>

5416
02:33:10.770 --> 02:33:11.603
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

5417
02:33:12.410 --> 02:33:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I remember the story.</v>

5418
02:33:13.381 --> 02:33:13.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5419
02:33:13.531 --> 02:33:13.861
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

5420
02:33:13.861 --> 02:33:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I do remember.</v>

5421
02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:15.930
<v Speaker 1>That was on my RSS feed.</v>

5422
02:33:15.931 --> 02:33:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5423
02:33:16.530 --> 02:33:17.071
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

5424
02:33:17.071 --> 02:33:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5425
02:33:17.370 --> 02:33:20.430
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't as good at keeping her mouth shut as this Jeff Gannon dude.</v>

5426
02:33:20.431 --> 02:33:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Or keep it in his mouth open or having enough secrets somewhere where he goes,</v>

5427
02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

5428
02:33:24.510 --> 02:33:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I've got Julian Assange is going to release this with a secret code if anything</v>

5429
02:33:27.601 --> 02:33:28.261
<v Speaker 1>happens to me.</v>

5430
02:33:28.261 --> 02:33:28.821
<v Speaker 1>Automatic.</v>

5431
02:33:28.821 --> 02:33:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

5432
02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:30.001
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

5433
02:33:30.001 --> 02:33:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ruin my great country by telling how many of you guys are</v>

5434
02:33:33.751 --> 02:33:35.460
<v Speaker 1>fucking each other behind closed doors.</v>

5435
02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5436
02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:37.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5437
02:33:37.170 --> 02:33:37.681
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>

5438
02:33:37.681 --> 02:33:37.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5439
02:33:37.980 --> 02:33:39.990
<v Speaker 1>this was one of my favorite stories though,</v>

5440
02:33:39.991 --> 02:33:44.130
<v Speaker 1>about how you can't trust the press because who put the press into that</v>

5441
02:33:44.131 --> 02:33:44.550
<v Speaker 1>position?</v>

5442
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Especially during,</v>

5443
02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:45.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5444
02:33:45.841 --> 02:33:47.700
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that people had commented about,</v>

5445
02:33:47.701 --> 02:33:48.870
<v Speaker 1>about the Bush administration.</v>

5446
02:33:48.871 --> 02:33:48.991
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5447
02:33:48.991 --> 02:33:49.111
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

5448
02:33:49.111 --> 02:33:50.610
<v Speaker 1>this is the first time like,</v>

5449
02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:51.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5450
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:54.150
<v Speaker 1>an administration has been so transparent about its corruption,</v>

5451
02:33:54.151 --> 02:33:56.700
<v Speaker 1>so transparent about the influences that has,</v>

5452
02:33:56.701 --> 02:33:57.600
<v Speaker 1>has that,</v>

5453
02:33:57.601 --> 02:33:58.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5454
02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:01.680
<v Speaker 1>the influences by Halbert and Halbert and CEO all of a sudden is now the vice</v>

5455
02:34:01.681 --> 02:34:05.760
<v Speaker 1>president and Halliburton's making billions of dollars in it and no bid</v>

5456
02:34:05.761 --> 02:34:06.331
<v Speaker 1>contracts.</v>

5457
02:34:06.331 --> 02:34:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5458
02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it was so obvious and corrupt.</v>

5459
02:34:08.251 --> 02:34:12.270
<v Speaker 1>And then here's this guy in the White House embedded White House reporter</v>

5460
02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:16.110
<v Speaker 1>lobbing these ridiculous questions and it turns out to be he's a gay escort.</v>

5461
02:34:16.170 --> 02:34:16.861
<v Speaker 1>I really think,</v>

5462
02:34:16.861 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the war</v>

5463
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:21.010
<v Speaker 4>on terror and the that that makes it,</v>

5464
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:25.060
<v Speaker 4>you able to be so open about the corruption because what are you going to do?</v>

5465
02:34:25.390 --> 02:34:26.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean we have,</v>

5466
02:34:26.110 --> 02:34:30.040
<v Speaker 4>we have extreme wartime authority till the war's over now there will be no end</v>

5467
02:34:30.041 --> 02:34:30.311
<v Speaker 4>to the war.</v>

5468
02:34:30.311 --> 02:34:31.750
<v Speaker 4>Well here's the thing,</v>

5469
02:34:31.930 --> 02:34:33.040
<v Speaker 4>how can it end?</v>

5470
02:34:33.250 --> 02:34:33.910
<v Speaker 4>That's what I always,</v>

5471
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:34.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5472
02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:38.080
<v Speaker 4>one of the memes we had going on our show was was how do you end a war on</v>

5473
02:34:38.081 --> 02:34:38.800
<v Speaker 4>terror?</v>

5474
02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:39.380
<v Speaker 4>There is,</v>

5475
02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:40.660
<v Speaker 4>there is no way to,</v>

5476
02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:42.520
<v Speaker 4>there's nobody just surrender to you.</v>

5477
02:34:42.521 --> 02:34:42.880
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

5478
02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:44.770
<v Speaker 4>and if you called off the war tomorrow,</v>

5479
02:34:44.771 --> 02:34:47.950
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing that prevents the next president after some minor little terror</v>

5480
02:34:47.951 --> 02:34:50.710
<v Speaker 4>attack in any part of the world from calling it on again.</v>

5481
02:34:50.711 --> 02:34:55.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean if we really cared about the direction the country was going long term,</v>

5482
02:34:55.540 --> 02:34:59.470
<v Speaker 4>you would realize and a lot of good writers and constitutional law scholars have</v>

5483
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:01.630
<v Speaker 4>that this is an open hole and things.</v>

5484
02:35:01.631 --> 02:35:05.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're allowed to basically suspend the constitution until the war's</v>

5485
02:35:05.111 --> 02:35:05.710
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

5486
02:35:05.710 --> 02:35:07.030
<v Speaker 4>And yet it's one of those wars that,</v>

5487
02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:07.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5488
02:35:07.211 --> 02:35:07.631
<v Speaker 4>you can't say,</v>

5489
02:35:07.631 --> 02:35:08.860
<v Speaker 4>once we take Berlin,</v>

5490
02:35:08.890 --> 02:35:10.210
<v Speaker 4>everything goes back to normal.</v>

5491
02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:13.360
<v Speaker 4>There is no end to this and this and there's no end to what you can,</v>

5492
02:35:13.361 --> 02:35:13.870
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

5493
02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:15.790
<v Speaker 4>no end to what you can call terrorism.</v>

5494
02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:16.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean it just,</v>

5495
02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:17.230
<v Speaker 4>it's like saying,</v>

5496

5498
02:35:20.771 --> 02:35:21.700
<v Speaker 4>constitution back.</v>

5499
02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't we just change the definition of terror?</v>

5500
02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:25.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5501
02:35:25.161 --> 02:35:25.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

5502
02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:25.981
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

5503
02:35:25.981 --> 02:35:27.810
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're going.</v>

5504
02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:28.420
<v Speaker 1>That's where we went.</v>

5505
02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5506
02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Holes.</v>

5507
02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:30.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a war on tickling a,</v>

5508
02:35:30.971 --> 02:35:35.590
<v Speaker 1>he's actually a blogger now for the national press club for the weight from the</v>

5509
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.620
<v Speaker 1>National Press Club.</v>

5510
02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

5511
02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:37.060
<v Speaker 1>That's not a group of,</v>

5512
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:38.530
<v Speaker 1>that's not a like side,</v>

5513
02:35:38.531 --> 02:35:42.080
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty influential halfway normal groups.</v>

5514
02:35:42.081 --> 02:35:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Or there's an l in that club.</v>

02:35:47.021 --> 02:35:47.620
<v Speaker 1>It's sucking deck.</v>

5519
02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I bet he can turn a phrase really well.</v>

5520
02:35:49.721 --> 02:35:51.550
<v Speaker 1>And he's the Hunter Thompson of gay media.</v>

5521
02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:52.773

<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

5524
02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:58.000
<v Speaker 1>He should sell shirts that say that.</v>

5525
02:35:58.090 --> 02:35:58.923
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave that to you again.</v>

5526
02:35:59.150 --> 02:36:00.340
<v Speaker 1>You have the better ecommerce.</v>

5528
02:36:01.931 --> 02:36:02.681
<v Speaker 1>I don't want his money.</v>

5529
02:36:02.681 --> 02:36:04.240
<v Speaker 1>He should sell shirts that say that.</v>

5530
02:36:04.390 --> 02:36:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Hunter Thompson of gay media.</v>

5531
02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:07.833
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin,</v>

5532
02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:11.600
<v Speaker 1>which will allow him to use it while she meant I'm,</v>

5533
02:36:11.730 --> 02:36:13.910
<v Speaker 1>it's making me out to be the Hunter Thompson.</v>

5536
02:36:16.690 --> 02:36:17.830
<v Speaker 1>That's confusing.</v>

5537
02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:18.251
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5538
02:36:18.251 --> 02:36:19.001
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I meant.</v>

5539
02:36:19.001 --> 02:36:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I meant you calling Jeff Gannon to a hundred times that of gay media.</v>

5540
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:22.623
<v Speaker 1>If he shared,</v>

5541
02:36:22.950 --> 02:36:24.250
<v Speaker 1>but he can put it on a book jacket.</v>

5542
02:36:24.251 --> 02:36:25.084
<v Speaker 1>A blurb.</v>

5543
02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin calls him the Hunter Thompson of gay media.</v>

5544
02:36:28.270 --> 02:36:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Well he's out now,</v>

5545
02:36:29.231 --> 02:36:30.070
<v Speaker 1>so I guess he could.</v>

5546
02:36:30.071 --> 02:36:30.820
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>

5547
02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:31.560
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

5548
02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:32.261
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll email them.</v>

5549
02:36:32.261 --> 02:36:33.041
<v Speaker 1>You got to staff here.</v>

02:36:33.041 --> 02:36:35.590
<v Speaker 1>You people can even my staff is virtually imaginary.</v>

5551
02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:35.741
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5552
02:36:35.741 --> 02:36:36.640
<v Speaker 1>this is even better.</v>

5553
02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:41.700
<v Speaker 1>His professional name in the homosexual escort service was bulldog.</v>

5554
02:36:42.250 --> 02:36:44.260
<v Speaker 1>His professional name was bulldog.</v>

5555
02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

5556
02:36:45.911 --> 02:36:47.880
<v Speaker 1>God helps makes bones,</v>

5557
02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.860
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know cause it's cause it's sexy.</v>

5558
02:36:50.930 --> 02:36:51.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5559
02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:53.310
<v Speaker 1>fucking bulldog is.</v>

5560
02:36:53.380 --> 02:36:55.390
<v Speaker 1>This is a picture of him from his website</v>

5561
02:36:56.980 --> 02:36:57.760
<v Speaker 1>for rail.</v>

5562
02:36:57.760 --> 02:36:59.360
<v Speaker 1>That was an embedded White House report.</v>

5563
02:36:59.670 --> 02:37:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Well and listen just for the audience out there,</v>

5564
02:37:01.421 --> 02:37:01.891
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't go well.</v>

5565
02:37:01.891 --> 02:37:02.724
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can.</v>

5566
02:37:03.150 --> 02:37:04.890
<v Speaker 4>It's not the homosexual thing.</v>

5567
02:37:04.891 --> 02:37:06.630
<v Speaker 4>It's the stereotypical,</v>

5568
02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:09.200
<v Speaker 4>I was a government plant in a,</v>

5569
02:37:09.201 --> 02:37:10.034
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

5570
02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:11.460
<v Speaker 4>it is almost like a fiction.</v>

5571
02:37:11.770 --> 02:37:12.491
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also,</v>

5572
02:37:12.491 --> 02:37:14.560
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to the secrecy in,</v>

5573
02:37:14.561 --> 02:37:16.280
<v Speaker 1>in our government that for sure</v>

5574
02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:17.113
<v Speaker 6>someone in there,</v>

5575
02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:19.650
<v Speaker 4>I ain't for sure someone in there has a boyfriend.</v>

5576
02:37:19.690 --> 02:37:20.390
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

5577
02:37:20.390 --> 02:37:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

5578
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:22.760
<v Speaker 4>why was nobody asked about this?</v>

5579
02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:25.460
<v Speaker 4>Can you please explain to me how he got the press credentials?</v>

5580
02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:27.740
<v Speaker 4>We can know all about portraying his girlfriend,</v>

5581
02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:30.110
<v Speaker 4>but we can't know how this guy got the press credentials.</v>

5582
02:37:30.111 --> 02:37:30.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand.</v>

5583
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:31.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5584
02:37:31.650 --> 02:37:31.951
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5585
02:37:31.951 --> 02:37:33.060
<v Speaker 6>Nobody wants to ask</v>

5586
02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:34.160
<v Speaker 4>what about white wave?</v>

5587
02:37:34.190 --> 02:37:37.070
<v Speaker 4>But the reason no one wants to ask is because everybody else in government who</v>

5588
02:37:37.071 --> 02:37:37.821
<v Speaker 4>would ask this question,</v>

5589
02:37:37.821 --> 02:37:40.610
<v Speaker 4>who gets access is innocent and not gay like him,</v>

5590
02:37:40.611 --> 02:37:42.500
<v Speaker 4>but it's just planted people.</v>

5591
02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:45.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like watching meet the press now.</v>

5592
02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.840
<v Speaker 4>Am I the only person that thinks David Gregory is,</v>

5593
02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:49.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a softball pitcher.</v>

5594
02:37:49.311 --> 02:37:49.791
<v Speaker 4>Literally.</v>

5595
02:37:49.791 --> 02:37:51.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean watch this and you just go,</v>

5596
02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:53.030
<v Speaker 4>how is this satisfying to,</v>

5597
02:37:53.031 --> 02:37:53.661
<v Speaker 4>no offense,</v>

5598
02:37:53.661 --> 02:37:54.171
<v Speaker 4>NBC,</v>

5599
02:37:54.171 --> 02:37:54.690
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

5600
02:37:54.690 --> 02:37:55.271
<v Speaker 4>but how,</v>

5601
02:37:55.271 --> 02:37:56.320
<v Speaker 4>how is the satisfy?</v>

5602
02:37:56.321 --> 02:37:57.154
<v Speaker 4>How has this,</v>

5603
02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:57.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

5604
02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:59.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand media anymore.</v>

5605
02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:00.371
<v Speaker 4>The mainstream,</v>

5606
02:38:00.371 --> 02:38:00.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

5607
02:38:00.450 --> 02:38:05.450
<v Speaker 6>Media's approach in the sort of con those conversation shows about a serious</v>

5608
02:38:05.731 --> 02:38:06.151
<v Speaker 6>issues.</v>

5609
02:38:06.151 --> 02:38:06.451
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

5610
02:38:06.451 --> 02:38:06.781
<v Speaker 6>boy,</v>

5611
02:38:06.781 --> 02:38:07.091
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

5612
02:38:07.091 --> 02:38:10.470
<v Speaker 6>they are softball down the middle lobs.</v>

5613
02:38:10.471 --> 02:38:11.310
<v Speaker 6>Everything is,</v>

5614
02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:11.791
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

5615
02:38:11.791 --> 02:38:13.850
<v Speaker 6>there's no real controversy when it comes to them.</v>

5616
02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:15.830
<v Speaker 4>Journalists learn issues.</v>

5617
02:38:15.890 --> 02:38:19.400
<v Speaker 4>A real journalist would look at something like Wikipedia and if,</v>

5618
02:38:19.430 --> 02:38:20.660
<v Speaker 4>if they couldn't support it,</v>

5619
02:38:20.661 --> 02:38:22.910
<v Speaker 4>they'd certainly have a soft spot in their heart for it.</v>

5620
02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:23.840
<v Speaker 4>If I recall,</v>

5621
02:38:23.841 --> 02:38:26.510
<v Speaker 4>mainstream journalism was horrified at Wikipedia.</v>

5622
02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:28.310
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't ring true to me.</v>

5623
02:38:28.311 --> 02:38:30.220
<v Speaker 4>But while you can't just publish these secrets thing,</v>

5624
02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:32.000
<v Speaker 4>well you have to do something.</v>

5625
02:38:32.001 --> 02:38:32.420
<v Speaker 4>Don't you?</v>

5626
02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:33.253
<v Speaker 4>Wiki leaks,</v>

5627
02:38:33.850 --> 02:38:34.683
<v Speaker 4>wiki media,</v>

5628
02:38:35.710 --> 02:38:36.250
<v Speaker 4>wikis.</v>

02:38:36.250 --> 02:38:36.761

5630
02:38:36.761 --> 02:38:37.900
<v Speaker 4>I thank you for clarifying that.</v>

5631
02:38:38.130 --> 02:38:38.970
<v Speaker 6>Baffled by why?</v>

5632
02:38:39.050 --> 02:38:39.630
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5633
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:39.931
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5634
02:38:39.931 --> 02:38:40.261
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5635
02:38:40.261 --> 02:38:40.580

5637
02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:41.311
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

5638
02:38:41.311 --> 02:38:41.880
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5639
02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:45.090
<v Speaker 6>access to information when it exposes crime is always good.</v>

5640
02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:45.540
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5641
02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:46.560
<v Speaker 6>if it exposes crime,</v>

5642
02:38:46.561 --> 02:38:47.490
<v Speaker 6>that's irrational crime.</v>

5643
02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:47.821
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5644
02:38:47.821 --> 02:38:48.061
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5645
02:38:48.061 --> 02:38:51.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm not talking about like a beating off or something,</v>

5646
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:52.343
<v Speaker 6>smoking pot,</v>

5647
02:38:52.410 --> 02:38:53.940
<v Speaker 6>something victimless crime.</v>

5648
02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:54.451
<v Speaker 6>But when you're,</v>

5649
02:38:54.451 --> 02:38:56.130
<v Speaker 6>when you're talking about real corruption,</v>

5650
02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:56.641
<v Speaker 6>corruption,</v>

5651
02:38:56.641 --> 02:39:01.590
<v Speaker 6>being exposed by a wiki leaks or being exposed by the New York Times,</v>

5652
02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:06.000
<v Speaker 6>which he should be upset about always is the corruption and you should praise</v>

5653
02:39:06.001 --> 02:39:11.001
<v Speaker 6>always whatever method of access to information has been utilized in order to</v>

5654
02:39:11.431 --> 02:39:12.270
<v Speaker 6>get it out to the people,</v>

5655
02:39:12.271 --> 02:39:13.260
<v Speaker 6>whether it's a website,</v>

5656
02:39:13.261 --> 02:39:14.490
<v Speaker 6>whether it's The New York Times,</v>

5657
02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:17.610
<v Speaker 6>it's like you should be happy that the New York Times exposes things.</v>

5658
02:39:17.611 --> 02:39:22.230
<v Speaker 6>You should be happy that Woodward and Bernstein broke Watergate.</v>

5659
02:39:22.231 --> 02:39:22.630
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5660
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:23.760
<v Speaker 6>we should all be happy.</v>

5661
02:39:23.930 --> 02:39:27.570
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a simpler rule and the simpler rule is will we be worse or</v>

5662
02:39:27.571 --> 02:39:32.250
<v Speaker 4>better off with more information or less information and a great way of putting</v>

5663
02:39:32.251 --> 02:39:33.000
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

5664
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I have yet to find someone who can really explain to me that that tradeoff</v>

5665
02:39:37.890 --> 02:39:40.440
<v Speaker 4>argues in favor of keeping things secret.</v>

5666
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5667
02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:41.581
<v Speaker 4>somebody will say,</v>

5668
02:39:41.581 --> 02:39:41.701
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5669
02:39:41.701 --> 02:39:43.900
<v Speaker 4>we'll lose an agent in this or that city and that,</v>

5670
02:39:43.901 --> 02:39:44.101
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

5671
02:39:44.101 --> 02:39:45.420
<v Speaker 4>that's a breach of trust.</v>

5672
02:39:45.421 --> 02:39:49.680
<v Speaker 4>And I understand that at the same time this country is dying from lack of</v>

5673
02:39:49.681 --> 02:39:53.520
<v Speaker 4>investigative journalism and uncovering malfeasance and corruption and all these</v>

5674
02:39:53.521 --> 02:39:53.880
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

5675
02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:58.020
<v Speaker 4>You can't tell me that the protection of a source here or there outweighs what</v>

5676
02:39:58.021 --> 02:39:59.130
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing all around us.</v>

5677
02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:04.360
<v Speaker 6>So this weird thing that happened after September 11th where uh,</v>

5678
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:09.490
<v Speaker 6>it was very scary to me where all of a sudden no one wanted to question the</v>

5679
02:40:09.491 --> 02:40:10.270
<v Speaker 6>government.</v>

5680
02:40:10.270 --> 02:40:12.970
<v Speaker 6>Everyone wanted to support the government,</v>

5681
02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 6>the troops</v>

5682
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:16.950
<v Speaker 5>support whatever hard decisions that had to be made,</v>

5683
02:40:16.951 --> 02:40:20.580
<v Speaker 5>but no one wanted to have any of the healthy skepticism.</v>

5684
02:40:21.330 --> 02:40:24.510
<v Speaker 5>That's why we have to have a cooling off period after the next one because</v>

5685
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:25.703
<v Speaker 5>here's the way it goes.</v>

5686
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:28.080
<v Speaker 5>If the experts say and they do that,</v>

5687
02:40:28.081 --> 02:40:29.100
<v Speaker 5>we're going to get hit again,</v>

5688
02:40:29.101 --> 02:40:30.630
<v Speaker 5>that it's inevitable that you can't stop it.</v>

5689
02:40:30.631 --> 02:40:31.500
<v Speaker 5>It's going to happen.</v>

5690
02:40:31.740 --> 02:40:35.550
<v Speaker 5>And if you know you are going to freak out when it happens again,</v>

5691
02:40:35.551 --> 02:40:37.260
<v Speaker 5>we're not talking about like a little teeny attack.</v>

5692
02:40:37.261 --> 02:40:40.270
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about another two buildings go down or there's a nuclear attack in</v>

5693
02:40:40.271 --> 02:40:41.104
<v Speaker 5>a harbor or you know,</v>

5694
02:40:41.250 --> 02:40:42.450
<v Speaker 5>pick your worst case scenario.</v>

5695
02:40:42.570 --> 02:40:46.080
<v Speaker 5>If you know that you're going to be crazy and ready to rip up the constant,</v>

5696
02:40:46.130 --> 02:40:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

5697
02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:49.380
<v Speaker 5>we're going to legislate during a period of temporary insanity.</v>

5698
02:40:49.500 --> 02:40:51.210
<v Speaker 5>If you really want to save the country,</v>

5699
02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:52.590
<v Speaker 5>write some rules about that.</v>

5700
02:40:52.590 --> 02:40:54.750
<v Speaker 5>Now say we're going to be out of our minds.</v>

5701
02:40:54.751 --> 02:40:55.530
<v Speaker 5>Let's make some,</v>

5702
02:40:55.530 --> 02:40:56.640
<v Speaker 5>let's put some speed bumps.</v>

5703
02:40:56.641 --> 02:40:57.120
<v Speaker 5>Let's say you,</v>

5704
02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:59.070
<v Speaker 5>you can't legislate for 60 days.</v>

5705
02:40:59.180 --> 02:40:59.400
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5706
02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:00.990
<v Speaker 5>you can close loopholes that let the terror,</v>

5707
02:41:00.991 --> 02:41:02.580
<v Speaker 5>you know that we found a loophole that led him in.</v>

5708
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:03.503
<v Speaker 5>You can close that,</v>

5709
02:41:03.570 --> 02:41:07.740
<v Speaker 5>but let's not write any Patriot Act three until we've had enough time to calm</v>

5710
02:41:07.741 --> 02:41:08.370
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

5711
02:41:08.370 --> 02:41:12.270
<v Speaker 5>What blows me away is the way that they sold the Patriot Act to us was by saying</v>

5712
02:41:12.271 --> 02:41:13.410
<v Speaker 5>there's a sunset clause.</v>

5713
02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:14.280
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be renewed.</v>

5714
02:41:14.281 --> 02:41:14.580
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5715
02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:15.271
<v Speaker 5>Don't be afraid.</v>

5716
02:41:15.271 --> 02:41:16.104
<v Speaker 5>This isn't permanent.</v>

5717
02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:17.220
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be renewed.</v>

5718
02:41:17.610 --> 02:41:18.720
<v Speaker 5>It's been renewed every time.</v>

5719
02:41:18.810 --> 02:41:21.480
<v Speaker 5>It's been renewed every time with no,</v>

5720
02:41:21.481 --> 02:41:22.590
<v Speaker 5>it's not even close.</v>

5721
02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:23.191
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

5722
02:41:23.191 --> 02:41:25.920
<v Speaker 5>most people are not aware that it's legislation that was written far before</v>

5723
02:41:25.921 --> 02:41:27.540
<v Speaker 5>September 11th but couldn't get past.</v>

5724
02:41:27.570 --> 02:41:28.590
<v Speaker 5>Peter Defazio's told me,</v>

5725
02:41:28.591 --> 02:41:28.790
<v Speaker 5>I haven't,</v>

5726
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:29.281
<v Speaker 5>I suppose to say this,</v>

5727
02:41:29.281 --> 02:41:29.850
<v Speaker 5>maybe it would be.</v>

5728
02:41:29.850 --> 02:41:30.181
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

5729
02:41:30.181 --> 02:41:30.780
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

5730
02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:31.591
<v Speaker 5>a lot of this stuff,</v>

5731
02:41:31.591 --> 02:41:36.591
<v Speaker 5>you can't write a giant Patriot Act like that in the time it took to actually</v>

5732
02:41:36.601 --> 02:41:37.230
<v Speaker 5>write it.</v>

5733
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:37.531
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

5734
02:41:37.531 --> 02:41:39.930
<v Speaker 5>a lot of these were sitting on the shelf things.</v>

5735
02:41:39.931 --> 02:41:44.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean you think about a standalone laws and they just pick this stuff off the</v>

5736
02:41:44.071 --> 02:41:44.780
<v Speaker 5>shelf through it.</v>

5737
02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:46.320
<v Speaker 5>And what a lot of people don't know,</v>

5738
02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:48.030
<v Speaker 5>although this happens with a lot of laws,</v>

5739
02:41:48.270 --> 02:41:52.230
<v Speaker 5>is that there's a lot of blank spaces because people don't quite know how it's</v>

5740
02:41:52.231 --> 02:41:53.064
<v Speaker 5>gonna work out.</v>

5741
02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:54.390
<v Speaker 5>So when you sign these things,</v>

5742
02:41:54.391 --> 02:41:58.080
<v Speaker 5>you actually signed something with a lot of blank spaces because,</v>

5743
02:41:58.081 --> 02:41:58.980
<v Speaker 5>and this happens with a lot of us,</v>

5744
02:41:58.981 --> 02:42:00.780
<v Speaker 5>cause they don't know the specifics yet.</v>

5745
02:42:00.781 --> 02:42:02.670
<v Speaker 5>It's not that it's part of the scheme or,</v>

5746
02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:04.650
<v Speaker 5>or the trying to to slip something through.</v>

5747
02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:05.910
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times with these laws,</v>

5748
02:42:05.911 --> 02:42:07.680
<v Speaker 5>they don't know the mechanism yet.</v>

5749
02:42:07.890 --> 02:42:10.770
<v Speaker 5>They know that they want to get from a to C and they're not quite sure how be</v>

5750
02:42:10.771 --> 02:42:11.580
<v Speaker 5>works out yet.</v>

5751
02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:15.360
<v Speaker 5>But you sign onto the concept but you support C and we'll figure out how to get</v>

5752
02:42:15.361 --> 02:42:17.070
<v Speaker 5>there when we figured out how to get there.</v>

5753
02:42:17.310 --> 02:42:20.430
<v Speaker 5>And so they sign a lot of these things that have a lot of blank spaces and how</v>

5754
02:42:20.431 --> 02:42:23.190
<v Speaker 5>few politicians read any of those things they signed.</v>

5755
02:42:23.191 --> 02:42:27.180
<v Speaker 5>One of the things they've gone over is like the amount of paperwork that these</v>

5756
02:42:27.181 --> 02:42:29.730
<v Speaker 5>guys would have to read if they read everything they signed.</v>

5757
02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:30.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5758
02:42:30.090 --> 02:42:30.461
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

5759
02:42:30.461 --> 02:42:32.160
<v Speaker 5>it's impossible and they've said that they've,</v>

5760
02:42:32.260 --> 02:42:33.510
<v Speaker 5>they've openly admitted that,</v>

5761
02:42:33.511 --> 02:42:33.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5762
02:42:33.751 --> 02:42:36.660
<v Speaker 5>there's no way anyone could around all this stuff in the amount of time you're</v>

5763
02:42:36.661 --> 02:42:37.350
<v Speaker 5>given.</v>

5764
02:42:37.350 --> 02:42:39.030
<v Speaker 5>We have to be able to read each other's minds.</v>

5765
02:42:39.031 --> 02:42:39.690
<v Speaker 5>Dan Carlin,</v>

5766
02:42:39.690 --> 02:42:41.160
<v Speaker 5>that's where we're going to fix this whole thing.</v>

5767
02:42:41.270 --> 02:42:42.990
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be able to absolve lies.</v>

5768
02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:43.680
<v Speaker 5>We're going to,</v>

5769
02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:47.550
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be able to stop all the nonsense as soon as everyone agrees to</v>

5770
02:42:47.551 --> 02:42:48.330
<v Speaker 5>the neural chip.</v>

5771
02:42:48.330 --> 02:42:51.930
<v Speaker 5>I think if you're going to have a lot of government people right on your side on</v>

5772
02:42:51.931 --> 02:42:53.070
<v Speaker 5>that job and they're going to be,</v>

5773
02:42:53.250 --> 02:42:53.761
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

5774
02:42:53.761 --> 02:42:54.840
<v Speaker 5>that's just what we were thinking.</v>

5775
02:42:54.841 --> 02:42:55.051
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

5776
02:42:55.051 --> 02:42:56.100
<v Speaker 5>come and work at Darpa.</v>

5777
02:42:56.101 --> 02:42:56.460
<v Speaker 5>The defense.</v>

5778
02:42:56.460 --> 02:42:59.100
<v Speaker 5>We've been thinking about how to read people's minds for a long time ago there</v>

5779
02:42:59.101 --> 02:43:02.550
<v Speaker 5>and they got robot dogs patrolling the perimeter at laser beam eyeball.</v>

5780
02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I think the bigger danger is they're already reading your mind and that's the</v>

5781
02:43:05.281 --> 02:43:05.760
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

5782
02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:05.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5783
02:43:05.881 --> 02:43:06.221
<v Speaker 5>the big,</v>

5784
02:43:06.221 --> 02:43:08.040
<v Speaker 5>I always said like with clones,</v>

5785
02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:08.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5786
02:43:08.581 --> 02:43:12.160
<v Speaker 5>like it's just a matter of time before they clone like</v>

5787
02:43:13.410 --> 02:43:14.380
<v Speaker 6>acumen,</v>

5788
02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:17.050
<v Speaker 6>hybrid slash.</v>

5789
02:43:17.210 --> 02:43:17.750
<v Speaker 4>Creatures.</v>

5790
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:20.990
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that explains why the president's always change on inauguration day.</v>

5791
02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:23.120
<v Speaker 4>Maybe those aren't made me can imagine,</v>

5792
02:43:23.150 --> 02:43:24.560
<v Speaker 4>imagine if that was a science fiction movie.</v>

5793
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:27.200
<v Speaker 4>They pull the president into another room and it's like an invasion of the body</v>

5794
02:43:27.210 --> 02:43:27.970
<v Speaker 4>snatchers.</v>

5795
02:43:27.970 --> 02:43:28.431
<v Speaker 4>Odd wait,</v>

5796
02:43:28.431 --> 02:43:30.110
<v Speaker 4>foaming and growing in the corner.</v>

5797
02:43:30.111 --> 02:43:30.860
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5798
02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:31.730
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

5799
02:43:31.770 --> 02:43:32.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5800
02:43:32.300 --> 02:43:33.080
<v Speaker 4>how</v>

5801
02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:38.080
<v Speaker 6>we're going to keep this sort of a very flawed system of float over the next</v>

5802
02:43:41.330 --> 02:43:41.670
<v Speaker 6>decade to,</v>

5803
02:43:41.670 --> 02:43:42.501
<v Speaker 4>isn't that what I said?</v>

5804
02:43:42.501 --> 02:43:42.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5805
02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:42.951
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5806
02:43:42.951 --> 02:43:46.300
<v Speaker 4>it's harder to imagine you talk about revolution on one hand there's,</v>

5807
02:43:46.310 --> 02:43:47.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to call it fascism,</v>

5808
02:43:47.481 --> 02:43:49.760
<v Speaker 4>but let's just call it a more repressive kind of stayed.</v>

5809
02:43:49.761 --> 02:43:50.510
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>

5810
02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:54.980
<v Speaker 4>it's weirder for me to think of the spaces that we're in now continuing than it</v>

5811
02:43:54.981 --> 02:43:57.050
<v Speaker 4>is to imagine it going far off into,</v>

5812
02:43:57.140 --> 02:43:58.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know which direction it's going to go.</v>

5813
02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:02.450
<v Speaker 4>I just can't imagine we stay in this weird Netherworld for another 10 years.</v>

5814
02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:03.900
<v Speaker 6>Feel that it's a,</v>

5815
02:44:03.970 --> 02:44:08.170
<v Speaker 6>the biggest resistance right now to governments right now is technological.</v>

5816
02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:08.531
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

5817
02:44:08.531 --> 02:44:10.480
<v Speaker 6>the anonymous movement and the Wiki leaks.</v>

5818
02:44:10.570 --> 02:44:12.490
<v Speaker 4>But look at how they're cracking down on that already.</v>

5819
02:44:12.491 --> 02:44:13.330
<v Speaker 4>A lot of countries are,</v>

5820
02:44:13.540 --> 02:44:14.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean we've got,</v>

5821
02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:17.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean the only thing we tend to agree upon with Iran and stuff is that you need</v>

5822
02:44:17.951 --> 02:44:20.710
<v Speaker 4>a more controlled internet and those kinds of things.</v>

5823
02:44:20.711 --> 02:44:24.670
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of these countries are starting to try to form their own regional</v>

5824
02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:28.270
<v Speaker 4>internets that they can control and everybody will be cells and all,</v>

5825
02:44:28.271 --> 02:44:29.130
<v Speaker 4>all these tech guys will,</v>

5826
02:44:29.131 --> 02:44:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I can't control the Internet.</v>

5827
02:44:30.251 --> 02:44:32.120
<v Speaker 4>It was designed to avert a nuclear war.</v>

5828
02:44:32.121 --> 02:44:33.100
<v Speaker 4>And you know what?</v>

5829
02:44:33.101 --> 02:44:34.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm not so sure those guys are right.</v>

5830
02:44:35.110 --> 02:44:35.950
<v Speaker 4>They say that,</v>

5831
02:44:35.951 --> 02:44:39.760
<v Speaker 4>but the governments of all of the world are putting in so much effort to this.</v>

5832
02:44:40.090 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm not so sure that then that's just going to switch us over to another</v>

5833
02:44:43.601 --> 02:44:47.020
<v Speaker 4>internet and then drown the other one in spam someday so that it becomes</v>

5834
02:44:47.021 --> 02:44:47.854
<v Speaker 4>unusable.</v>

5835
02:44:47.980 --> 02:44:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5836
02:44:48.490 --> 02:44:49.323
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're going to,</v>

5837
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:50.631
<v Speaker 6>I think the,</v>

5838
02:44:50.631 --> 02:44:50.840
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5839
02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:53.870
<v Speaker 6>the real issue is who are the most intelligent people?</v>

5840
02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:54.230
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>

5841
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:55.190
<v Speaker 6>what side are they on?</v>

5842
02:44:55.370 --> 02:44:57.380
<v Speaker 6>The most intelligent people on the side of the resistance,</v>

5843
02:44:57.381 --> 02:44:59.210
<v Speaker 6>the most intelligent people in the side of the coders,</v>

5844
02:44:59.211 --> 02:44:59.841
<v Speaker 6>the hackers,</v>

5845
02:44:59.841 --> 02:45:01.940
<v Speaker 6>the people that are are writing software.</v>

5846
02:45:01.941 --> 02:45:02.780
<v Speaker 6>The people that are the,</v>

5847
02:45:02.781 --> 02:45:04.190
<v Speaker 6>the technological innovators,</v>

5848
02:45:04.370 --> 02:45:05.450
<v Speaker 6>they're not government agents.</v>

5849
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:06.500
<v Speaker 6>Those guys are dummies.</v>

5850
02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:06.921
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

5851
02:45:06.921 --> 02:45:08.690
<v Speaker 6>that's why they can hack into the White House.</v>

5852
02:45:08.850 --> 02:45:09.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5853
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:11.063
<v Speaker 4>Long term.</v>

5854
02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:13.530
<v Speaker 4>We talk about a five year old growing up today,</v>

5855
02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:16.770
<v Speaker 4>are they going to grow up with this kind of mentality we have.</v>

5856
02:45:16.771 --> 02:45:17.581
<v Speaker 4>This is the problem.</v>

5857
02:45:17.581 --> 02:45:20.580
<v Speaker 4>When you change the constitutional rights situation slowly,</v>

5858
02:45:20.581 --> 02:45:24.510
<v Speaker 4>the way we have is you begin to grow a new generation of people that never knew.</v>

5859
02:45:24.511 --> 02:45:26.370
<v Speaker 4>A pre nine 11 world for example,</v>

5860
02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:31.560
<v Speaker 4>that don't have the same feeling we have about loss of rights or any of these</v>

5861
02:45:31.561 --> 02:45:33.150
<v Speaker 4>other things because they've never known any better.</v>

5862
02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:36.630
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to get the next generation of people growing up with a hacker</v>

5863
02:45:36.631 --> 02:45:40.620
<v Speaker 4>mentality or they're going to be every bit as good on computers is our best</v>

5864
02:45:40.621 --> 02:45:41.454
<v Speaker 4>people are,</v>

5865
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:44.100
<v Speaker 4>but come from a mentality that doesn't say,</v>

5866
02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:44.581
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5867
02:45:44.581 --> 02:45:46.290
<v Speaker 4>what about our fourth amendment rights being gone?</v>

5868
02:45:46.291 --> 02:45:46.950
<v Speaker 4>And what about the,</v>

5869
02:45:46.950 --> 02:45:48.600
<v Speaker 4>they've never known any other world.</v>

5870
02:45:48.930 --> 02:45:49.651
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting.</v>

5871
02:45:49.651 --> 02:45:49.941
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

5872
02:45:49.941 --> 02:45:50.460
<v Speaker 6>Agree.</v>

5873
02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:50.830
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5874
02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:51.140
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

5875
02:45:51.140 --> 02:45:53.220
<v Speaker 6>I think that children,</v>

5876
02:45:53.221 --> 02:45:53.941
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

5877
02:45:53.941 --> 02:45:57.420
<v Speaker 6>almost always look at old people like they're fucking stupid and they've ruined</v>

5878
02:45:57.421 --> 02:45:57.811
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

5879
02:45:57.811 --> 02:45:59.880
<v Speaker 6>They might have a point and they might have a point and then you're,</v>

5880
02:45:59.881 --> 02:46:00.181
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

5881
02:46:00.181 --> 02:46:04.380
<v Speaker 6>you're growing up in this society that they created that they,</v>

5882
02:46:04.381 --> 02:46:07.650
<v Speaker 6>they've been running and they've been running shittily they'd done a terrible</v>

5883
02:46:07.651 --> 02:46:09.150
<v Speaker 6>job and running this government.</v>

5884
02:46:09.350 --> 02:46:12.830
<v Speaker 6>I don't think anybody's going to be like a super computer expert and be all Gung</v>

5885
02:46:12.830 --> 02:46:16.520
<v Speaker 6>Ho to his follow protocol as written because this government is a,</v>

5886
02:46:16.521 --> 02:46:17.780
<v Speaker 6>all wise and all knowing.</v>

5887
02:46:17.781 --> 02:46:17.990
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

5888
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:18.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's any,</v>

5889
02:46:18.750 --> 02:46:19.583
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5890
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.870
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

5891
02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:20.740
<v Speaker 4>so if you're the government,</v>

5892
02:46:20.741 --> 02:46:23.140
<v Speaker 4>there's two choices in your scenario and your scenario.</v>

5893
02:46:23.141 --> 02:46:25.000
<v Speaker 4>One choice is the revolution,</v>

5894
02:46:25.001 --> 02:46:25.541
<v Speaker 4>as you call it,</v>

5895
02:46:25.541 --> 02:46:26.530
<v Speaker 4>the resistance wins.</v>

5896
02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:30.160
<v Speaker 4>The other choice is that if the government wants to stay in power,</v>

5897
02:46:30.310 --> 02:46:33.550
<v Speaker 4>they crack down more and they turn us into something that's more repressive than</v>

5898
02:46:33.551 --> 02:46:34.050
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

5899
02:46:34.050 --> 02:46:38.670
<v Speaker 6>Well then it gets really tricky because who is the government when I guess we</v>

5900
02:46:38.671 --> 02:46:39.720
<v Speaker 6>find out Ben don't.</v>

5901
02:46:39.721 --> 02:46:39.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5902
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:41.040
<v Speaker 6>because when,</v>

5903
02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:41.791
<v Speaker 6>one of the,</v>

5904
02:46:41.791 --> 02:46:42.240
<v Speaker 6>my point,</v>

5905
02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:42.661
<v Speaker 6>one of my,</v>

5906
02:46:42.661 --> 02:46:43.494
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5907
02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:46.950
<v Speaker 6>one of the points of fascination that I had about this whole betray thing was</v>

5908
02:46:46.951 --> 02:46:49.380
<v Speaker 6>the fact that it was the government versus the government and I,</v>

5909
02:46:49.381 --> 02:46:52.890
<v Speaker 6>that was something that I was not aware of before that the FBI and the CIA don't</v>

5910
02:46:52.891 --> 02:46:53.724
<v Speaker 6>like each other,</v>

5911
02:46:53.820 --> 02:46:54.650
<v Speaker 6>which is</v>

5912
02:46:54.650 --> 02:46:58.100
<v Speaker 4>like when you get the corruption from the pro marijuana people putting in money</v>

5913
02:46:58.101 --> 02:46:59.390
<v Speaker 4>to campaigns and the now,</v>

5914
02:46:59.391 --> 02:47:01.220
<v Speaker 4>now you see things start to even out a little.</v>

5915
02:47:01.221 --> 02:47:01.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5916
02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:03.390
<v Speaker 6>Well also in the marijuana world,</v>

5917
02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:07.580
<v Speaker 6>you see illegal growers who are against legalization because it would cut down</v>

5918
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:08.423
<v Speaker 6>their profits.</v>

5919
02:47:08.670 --> 02:47:13.050
<v Speaker 6>There's people who are illegal growers who voted against medical marijuana and</v>

5920
02:47:13.051 --> 02:47:14.430
<v Speaker 6>that's cannibalism and it's,</v>

5921
02:47:14.850 --> 02:47:16.110
<v Speaker 6>those kinds of things are very interesting.</v>

5922
02:47:16.310 --> 02:47:16.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5923
02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:18.360
<v Speaker 6>You're always going to have situations like that?</v>

5924
02:47:18.361 --> 02:47:19.260
<v Speaker 6>I think so.</v>

5925
02:47:19.261 --> 02:47:20.094
<v Speaker 6>It's uh,</v>

5926
02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:22.150
<v Speaker 6>I think the,</v>

5927
02:47:22.151 --> 02:47:22.381
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5928
02:47:22.381 --> 02:47:26.100
<v Speaker 6>the factions of the government can't agree on what,</v>

5929
02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:27.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5930
02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:27.751
<v Speaker 6>who they are,</v>

5931
02:47:27.751 --> 02:47:30.960
<v Speaker 6>who they're for and who they're not for the fact that the FBI was willing to go</v>

5932
02:47:30.961 --> 02:47:35.190
<v Speaker 6>after the CIA and that's how this whole thing happened with betray us and he</v>

5933
02:47:35.191 --> 02:47:35.700
<v Speaker 6>got,</v>

5934
02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:36.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5935
02:47:36.090 --> 02:47:37.110
<v Speaker 6>smoked out like that.</v>

5936
02:47:37.111 --> 02:47:38.930
<v Speaker 6>I think that you're,</v>

5937
02:47:39.090 --> 02:47:41.370
<v Speaker 6>you've got too many people and they're,</v>

5938
02:47:41.371 --> 02:47:42.840
<v Speaker 6>they're not a unified front.</v>

5939
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:45.180
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to get together and say this is what we need to do.</v>

5940
02:47:45.181 --> 02:47:45.590
<v Speaker 6>We need to,</v>

5941
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:50.280
<v Speaker 6>I think they will believe that they can pass laws to try to stop things,</v>

5942
02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:53.340
<v Speaker 6>but while they're doing this and passing laws,</v>

5943
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.420
<v Speaker 6>technology waits for no one and these people don't understand technology.</v>

5944
02:47:57.421 --> 02:47:58.350
<v Speaker 6>These people are old.</v>

5945
02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:02.730
<v Speaker 6>These people that are in their sixties and seventies that are in positions of</v>

5946
02:48:02.731 --> 02:48:03.091
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>

5947
02:48:03.091 --> 02:48:06.540
<v Speaker 6>I do not think they truly appreciate most of them.</v>

5948
02:48:06.541 --> 02:48:10.100
<v Speaker 6>At least truly appreciate the power of the movement of,</v>

5949
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.530
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

5950
02:48:10.530 --> 02:48:12.030
<v Speaker 6>of free information on the Internet.</v>

5951
02:48:12.031 --> 02:48:12.430
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

5952
02:48:12.430 --> 02:48:13.130
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

5953
02:48:13.130 --> 02:48:13.280
<v Speaker 6>like</v>

5954
02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:13.671
<v Speaker 4>we said though,</v>

5955
02:48:13.671 --> 02:48:18.470
<v Speaker 4>I think the key is going to be how the average individuals impacted by the</v>

5956
02:48:18.471 --> 02:48:19.071
<v Speaker 4>changes.</v>

5957
02:48:19.071 --> 02:48:20.150
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing to say,</v>

5958
02:48:20.151 --> 02:48:20.301
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

5959
02:48:20.301 --> 02:48:21.170
<v Speaker 4>my life's pretty good.</v>

5960
02:48:21.171 --> 02:48:22.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to still play video games.</v>

5961
02:48:22.461 --> 02:48:23.294
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine with my job.</v>

5962
02:48:23.570 --> 02:48:25.100
<v Speaker 4>When they get thrown out of their house,</v>

5963
02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:27.470
<v Speaker 4>when they can't make enough money to live,</v>

5964
02:48:27.471 --> 02:48:28.720
<v Speaker 4>when the American dream is,</v>

5965
02:48:28.750 --> 02:48:32.090
<v Speaker 4>is nowhere near within their reach and there's enough of those people.</v>

5966
02:48:32.690 --> 02:48:34.670
<v Speaker 4>I think all of a sudden the motivation changes.</v>

5967
02:48:34.671 --> 02:48:34.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5968
02:48:34.881 --> 02:48:38.960
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend who was a draft protester in the 1960s and he said,</v>

5969
02:48:38.961 --> 02:48:43.100
<v Speaker 4>the real sad part of the antiwar movement was how much of it was based on the</v>

5970
02:48:43.101 --> 02:48:46.700
<v Speaker 4>fact that I was going to be drafted and when Nixon got rid of the draft,</v>

5971
02:48:46.850 --> 02:48:50.120
<v Speaker 4>he did it cynically believing that a lot of people would then say,</v>

5972
02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.271
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5973
02:48:50.271 --> 02:48:51.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about the warranty more if I,</v>

5974
02:48:51.531 --> 02:48:52.370
<v Speaker 4>if I'm not going to go,</v>

5975
02:48:52.371 --> 02:48:53.204
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

5976
02:48:53.390 --> 02:48:54.131
<v Speaker 4>And he was right.</v>

5977
02:48:54.131 --> 02:48:54.631
<v Speaker 4>And the the,</v>

5978
02:48:54.631 --> 02:48:58.940
<v Speaker 4>the membership that the people attending these anti war rallies plummeted once</v>

5979
02:48:58.941 --> 02:49:00.320
<v Speaker 4>those people weren't going to get drafted.</v>

5980
02:49:01.100 --> 02:49:05.660
<v Speaker 4>If you talk about people being impacted by a worsening economy and worsening</v>

5981
02:49:05.661 --> 02:49:07.160
<v Speaker 4>conditions and bad government decisions,</v>

5982
02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:09.720
<v Speaker 4>pay no attention to what the average American's lifestyles like.</v>

5983
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:11.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like drafting those people.</v>

5984
02:49:11.940 --> 02:49:15.030
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden people who had no stake in this care because they can't afford</v>

5985
02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:18.480
<v Speaker 4>food or they can't afford a TV and they can't afford cable or whatever it is</v>

5986
02:49:18.481 --> 02:49:19.140
<v Speaker 4>they need.</v>

5987
02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:19.973
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5988
02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:21.330
<v Speaker 6>as we wrap this thing up,</v>

5989
02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:22.470
<v Speaker 6>how do you think,</v>

5990
02:49:22.590 --> 02:49:23.580
<v Speaker 6>if you had to guess,</v>

5991
02:49:23.581 --> 02:49:25.020
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't want to ask anybody.</v>

5992
02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:26.520
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5993
02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:29.190
<v Speaker 6>you're one of the few people that would ever asked this question.</v>

5994
02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:32.370
<v Speaker 6>How do you think it's going to go down over the next 10 years?</v>

5995
02:49:32.371 --> 02:49:35.350
<v Speaker 6>What if you had to guess what is a,</v>

5996
02:49:35.430 --> 02:49:37.050
<v Speaker 6>what's going to take place in this country?</v>

5997
02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:38.520
<v Speaker 4>I told you already my,</v>

5998
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:41.840
<v Speaker 4>my big fear is that we're going to have another terror attack because I don't</v>

5999
02:49:41.841 --> 02:49:43.190
<v Speaker 4>see how we avoid that,</v>

6000
02:49:43.191 --> 02:49:46.580
<v Speaker 4>where we're at and it's not just the terrorist bombing were out there poking,</v>

6001
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:47.860
<v Speaker 4>poking a nest.</v>

6002
02:49:47.861 --> 02:49:48.860
<v Speaker 4>It's all over the world.</v>

6003
02:49:48.861 --> 02:49:51.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's how people respond in a lot of these places.</v>

6004
02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:53.360
<v Speaker 4>And I think if we get hit again,</v>

6005
02:49:53.361 --> 02:49:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to go crazy.</v>

6006
02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:55.970
<v Speaker 1>So you think it's going to be bad?</v>

6007
02:49:56.010 --> 02:49:57.970
<v Speaker 1>You think it's going to be like right after September 11?</v>

6008
02:49:58.430 --> 02:49:59.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't make,</v>

6009
02:49:59.130 --> 02:50:00.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't see enough positives.</v>

6010
02:50:00.301 --> 02:50:01.560
<v Speaker 4>I just don't see enough positives.</v>

6011
02:50:01.561 --> 02:50:01.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

6012
02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:02.713
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping,</v>

6013
02:50:02.940 --> 02:50:03.900
<v Speaker 4>but I don't see,</v>

6014
02:50:04.050 --> 02:50:07.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't see enough variables that can break in the good direction and I see a</v>

6015
02:50:07.441 --> 02:50:09.450
<v Speaker 4>lot of variables that can break in the bad direction.</v>

6016
02:50:09.451 --> 02:50:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Do you think</v>

6017
02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:10.581
<v Speaker 6>summit we move,</v>

6018
02:50:10.581 --> 02:50:12.530
<v Speaker 6>we're moving towards a one world government.</v>

6019
02:50:14.810 --> 02:50:16.190
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a weird statement.</v>

6020
02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:16.911
<v Speaker 4>Loaded statement.</v>

6021
02:50:16.911 --> 02:50:18.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about one world government.</v>

6022
02:50:18.261 --> 02:50:18.740
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

6023
02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:22.490
<v Speaker 4>I think we're moving towards a government that agrees with a lot of other</v>

6024
02:50:22.491 --> 02:50:26.300
<v Speaker 4>governments about certain things and one is I don't think most of the world</v>

6025
02:50:26.301 --> 02:50:26.900
<v Speaker 4>governments are,</v>

6026
02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:29.630
<v Speaker 4>are happy about the Internet's ability to,</v>

6027
02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:31.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're fine with us watching cat videos and,</v>

6028
02:50:31.771 --> 02:50:33.470
<v Speaker 4>and having that keep us pacified.</v>

6029
02:50:33.650 --> 02:50:35.540
<v Speaker 4>None of them are happy about information sharing.</v>

6030
02:50:35.541 --> 02:50:36.980
<v Speaker 4>None of them are happy about that kind of stuff.</v>

6031
02:50:37.310 --> 02:50:38.143
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

6032
02:50:38.590 --> 02:50:39.970
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] context though,</v>

6033
02:50:39.971 --> 02:50:42.700
<v Speaker 1>the fact that everyone was so isolated for so long.</v>

6034
02:50:42.850 --> 02:50:45.400
<v Speaker 1>And then over the last less than a hundred years,</v>

6035
02:50:45.430 --> 02:50:47.320
<v Speaker 1>there's been this incredible interaction.</v>

6036
02:50:47.321 --> 02:50:48.730
<v Speaker 1>That's how the podcast,</v>

6037
02:50:48.731 --> 02:50:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you hit your heard all over the world.</v>

6038
02:50:50.130 --> 02:50:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6039
02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Escalated.</v>

6040
02:50:51.180 --> 02:50:53.230
<v Speaker 1>And this is just people shooting the shit,</v>

6041
02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:54.370
<v Speaker 1>but just the,</v>

6042
02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:54.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6043
02:50:54.650 --> 02:50:58.990
<v Speaker 1>the ability to translate into those websites and exchange information and kind</v>

6044
02:50:58.991 --> 02:51:00.810
<v Speaker 1>of understand that were absolutely revolutionary.</v>

6045
02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:01.361
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>

6046
02:51:01.361 --> 02:51:05.170
<v Speaker 1>We're not much different than anyone anywhere else other than the environment,</v>

6047
02:51:05.171 --> 02:51:05.621
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

6048
02:51:05.621 --> 02:51:06.251
<v Speaker 1>all that other stuff.</v>

6049
02:51:06.251 --> 02:51:07.420
<v Speaker 1>But people want the same thing.</v>

6050
02:51:07.450 --> 02:51:08.051
<v Speaker 1>They want to be happy,</v>

6051
02:51:08.051 --> 02:51:10.510
<v Speaker 1>they want to be healthy and they want to know why the fuck they were in a war,</v>

6052
02:51:11.230 --> 02:51:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

6053
02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:12.980
<v Speaker 1>And maybe maybe some little,</v>

6054
02:51:12.990 --> 02:51:13.290
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

6055
02:51:13.290 --> 02:51:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6056
02:51:13.460 --> 02:51:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Some of them do it better answer.</v>

6057
02:51:14.590 --> 02:51:16.240
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them do the ones who are going,</v>

6058
02:51:16.241 --> 02:51:17.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6059
02:51:17.070 --> 02:51:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

6060
02:51:17.390 --> 02:51:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit more a positive than you are.</v>

6061
02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Less cynical maybe.</v>

6062
02:51:20.890 --> 02:51:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I think a technological innovation is our savior.</v>

6063
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:25.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what I really</v>

6064
02:51:25.330 --> 02:51:25.990
<v Speaker 4>could be,</v>

6065
02:51:25.990 --> 02:51:26.411
<v Speaker 4>could be.</v>

6066
02:51:26.411 --> 02:51:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I could see it.</v>

6067
02:51:27.311 --> 02:51:27.580
<v Speaker 4>I paid,</v>

6068
02:51:27.580 --> 02:51:28.630
<v Speaker 4>the variables are there.</v>

6069
02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:31.600
<v Speaker 4>I just see so many more on one side of the ledger than the other.</v>

6070
02:51:31.700 --> 02:51:32.091
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

6071
02:51:32.091 --> 02:51:35.480
<v Speaker 1>But I also see culturally so much more on the technological side of the ledger.</v>

6072
02:51:35.481 --> 02:51:37.700
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the Internet has provided</v>

6073
02:51:37.730 --> 02:51:38.563
<v Speaker 6>this open,</v>

6074
