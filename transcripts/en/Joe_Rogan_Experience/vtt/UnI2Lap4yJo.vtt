<v Speaker 1>Fairfax.</v>

10
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like a scene in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I was confused.</v>

<v Speaker 1>who was on Dr Phil Show and Ufo Sorta.</v>

17
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>believe is so x files the year to 1999 </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it was like when was the x </v>

18
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>files on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on now,</v>

19
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when was the original one?</v>

20
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late nineties.</v>

21
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Mid Nineties I believe is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that poster and I always just.</v>

22
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't disconnect them from the Po,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poster and molders office,</v>

23
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but believed that that's today.</v>

24
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even whoever made that shirt,</v>

25
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe that's a cool shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

26
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe that would have seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the poster believed that's better,</v>

27
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>but I do want to believe of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things of all the stupid things.</v>

28
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I would love to believe that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like got real footage of Ufo is like </v>

29
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.341
<v Speaker 1>more than almost any other weird like </v>
<v Speaker 1>big foot type,</v>

30
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>loch ness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

31
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:37.791
<v Speaker 1>all the really nutty shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they could find out one of those was </v>

32
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:37.791
<v Speaker 1>true fucking aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

33
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

34
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Even if you just knew for sure that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw a real ship or if the aliens looked </v>

35
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>like a big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you kill two birds with one stone.</v>

36
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>That was the actual theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

37
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>some of these big foot people are so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's spectrums of big foot people,</v>

38
00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This big foot people.</v>

39
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are like real </v>
<v Speaker 1>primatologists,</v>

40
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>like Jane Goodall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jane Goodall believes in bigfoot.</v>

41
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating.</v>

42
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole interview with her where</v>
<v Speaker 1>she says she's sure of it.</v>

43
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>She said she sure that there's another </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

44
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>How can she be sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's play the clip,</v>

45
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>see if we can find that clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>who's Jane Goodall is a world famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>primatologist who did some </v>

47
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>groundbreaking work with chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She essentially live with chimpanzees.</v>

48
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>She's so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>this lady is amazing if he watched her </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries.</v>

50
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>So when someone like her says something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

51
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

52
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>well I should shut the fuck up and stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my lane.</v>

53
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>What am I to argue with Jane Goodall </v>
<v Speaker 1>about primates?</v>

54
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>And it used to be a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to really be a gigantic topic </v>

55
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.641
<v Speaker 1>is an eight foot tall orangutang like </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that probably walked on two legs </v>

56
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>and she believes it's real.</v>

57
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>She thinks it did exist or she thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that links it exists right now.</v>

58
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was taken out of </v>

60
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.170
<v Speaker 1>context because I'm pretty sure it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.400
<v Speaker 1>someone asked her a question and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>she gave a long and detailed answer </v>

62
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>based on what we know about certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee subspecies that are really,</v>

63
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>really hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're just finding out.</v>

64
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>I think they figured it out from like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 nineties.</v>

65
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a giant version of chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lives in the Congo.</v>

66
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.020
<v Speaker 1>It's what they call them a Bondo apes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple different names for </v>

67
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.230
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call them,</v>

68
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>but they sleep on the ground like </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorillas.</v>

69
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>They're giant chimps who love that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

70
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I watch planet earth to the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>just mesmerized,</v>

71
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>just physically saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

72
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.950
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a normal person </v>

73
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>understands what you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say a six foot tall chimp.</v>

74
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think they know what you're</v>

75
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:54.661
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about like a super </v>

76
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:54.661
<v Speaker 1>gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like not.</v>

77
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:59.070
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way scarier than a gorilla because </v>

78
00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>they're their chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimps are scarier.</v>

79
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Chimps are predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Chimps eat monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

81
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

82
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.890
<v Speaker 1>People want associate chimps with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bananas and nuts and stuff like that and</v>

83
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>they eat that stuff too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also eat monkeys.</v>

84
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>

85
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>They're ruthless motherfuckers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can find the actual recording </v>

87
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.020

<v Speaker 1>the tone of her voice.</v>

88
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>She says something like,</v>

92
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hanging out with them constantly.</v>

93
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.920
<v Speaker 1>You know what kind of a human being you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be to be able to keep your shit </v>

94
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>together and a tribe of wild chimps </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they accept you.</v>

95
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 1>They don't just smash your fucking head </v>
<v Speaker 1>in for a goof.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Did you always believe that they </v>

110
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.660

118
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Jeffrey Meldrum and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

119
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:41.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he brought in the big foot foot.</v>

120
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Meldrum was a really nice guy.</v>

121
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>We also said he'd be willing to cut off </v>
<v Speaker 1>a finger to know that big foot was real.</v>

122
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

123
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

124
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.370
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what finger?</v>

125
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Pinky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinky.</v>

126
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Which one would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one would you go with?</v>

127
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Pinky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

128
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>because you'd want the</v>

129
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 2>pinky because that's the farthest </v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage to the other side of the thumb.</v>

130
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of like a claw,</v>

131
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe the ring finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

132
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 2>The middle finger seems pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointless.</v>

133
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the interview,</v>

134
00:06:10.691 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know where in the interview </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

135
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

136
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.240
<v Speaker 1>My perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess just considering the.</v>

137
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.170
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be amazed when I tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

138
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a scene in a movie when she </v>

139
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.610
<v Speaker 1>says it because here she is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>esteemed scientist.</v>

140
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're expecting,</v>

141
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.430
<v Speaker 1>well there's no evidence and right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just.</v>

142
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.610
<v Speaker 1>We think of it as legend and could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be a bunch of different things </v>

143
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.610
<v Speaker 1>that people think they saw</v>

144
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.150
<v Speaker 2>voice and delivery's important when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to being convinced of something </v>

145
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.560
<v Speaker 2>you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

146
00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:48.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way to just comedians being </v>

147
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:48.561
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle's voice.</v>

148
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.700
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the transcript of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle saying at times,</v>

149
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:54.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's not that insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you listen to him say those things.</v>

150
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Singles who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz.</v>

151
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

152
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

153
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.690
<v Speaker 1>and when it's coming from a scientist </v>
<v Speaker 1>with long gray hair who lives with </v>

154
00:07:05.681 --> 00:07:06.310
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

155
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 2>she must be amy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think she's hooked up with the </v>

156
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 2>champ?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

157
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 2>all those come on chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lives with all of them.</v>

158
00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

159
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

160
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.910
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like there's some monkey </v>
<v Speaker 2>business going on.</v>

161
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.720
<v Speaker 2>It didn't help me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even mean set it up.</v>

162
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

163
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

164
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.220
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

165
00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

166
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:24.880
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

167
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

168
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 3>How you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering to if you believed her at </v>

169
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 3>any undiscovered large APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

170
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 3>A yeti or big photos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing message I'm missing here are </v>

171
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 3>pretty much out of the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

172
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.480
<v Speaker 3>now you will be amazed when I tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm.</v>

173
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

174
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to so many native Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>who described the same songs to who's </v>

175
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.620
<v Speaker 3>seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've probably got about 30 books that </v>

176
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.950
<v Speaker 3>have come from different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

177
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.780
<v Speaker 3>from China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

178
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 3>from all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You always have this belief that they're</v>

179
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.150
<v Speaker 3>debating that big of a romantic one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right Jerry.</v>

180
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.290
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for calling.</v>

181
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.500
<v Speaker 1>She probably knows more than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know if you can.</v>

182
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>When in doubt go with the person knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than you,</v>

183
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.930
<v Speaker 1>but I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen any like real evidence </v>

184
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>other than these footprint things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything else is just bullshit.</v>

185
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>They find hair turns out to be bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

186
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.390
<v Speaker 1>They find scat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out to be like a wolf scat.</v>

187
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Where did they find the footprints at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they find them everywhere,</v>

188
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:43.871
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know what you're looking </v>

189
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:43.871
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

190
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:47.470
<v Speaker 1>it could be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be someone decided to fake </v>

191
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 1>footprints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

192
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>it could be a big bear that's less </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely,</v>

193
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>but it depends on the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a big grizzly bear print,</v>

194
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he would.</v>

195
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>It took to make it look already human </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>

196
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.230
<v Speaker 1>It would after either be a giant human </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot or be just incredible special </v>

197
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>

198
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 1>It's one or two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them when they got like ridges,</v>

199
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.260
<v Speaker 1>they've found like dermal ridges that </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate a.</v>

200
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>They think it indicates a footprint type</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

201
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 1>but with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the feet of these things,</v>

202
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>they seem to think that that somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another makes it very,</v>

203
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:33.170
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people want to believe that shit.</v>

204
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem is it's fun.</v>

205
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>It's super fun to believe that someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fucking with you,</v>

206
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's some big giant monkey just </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked through with every day,</v>

207
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>every passing minute of every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes way less likely that that's a</v>

208
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:54.411
<v Speaker 1>real thing because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with cameras and these people go </v>

209
00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 1>deep into the woods</v>

210
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.830
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's also like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cooler things to believe in because it's</v>

211
00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

212
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be even if they did exist,</v>

213
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:08.080
<v Speaker 4>like we have guns and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like if aliens existed were</v>

214
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.070
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

215
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.170
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked navy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're sort of rooting for the </v>

216
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.890
<v Speaker 1>sasquatches in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What of all the look,</v>

217
00:10:15.891 --> 00:10:20.891
<v Speaker 1>there had to be a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of human being like creatures that</v>

218
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:25.220
<v Speaker 1>existed is it just only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're finding new ones all that time.</v>

219
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.640
<v Speaker 1>They're like constantly finding some new</v>
<v Speaker 1>subspecies of people that they weren't </v>

220
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.421
<v Speaker 1>aware of before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super possible that something grew </v>

221
00:10:34.421 --> 00:10:38.620
<v Speaker 1>to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why wouldn't it be if we can get a </v>

222
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:38.620
<v Speaker 1>chance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

223
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Why is that so weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not any weirder than a person </v>

224
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.460
<v Speaker 1>or a chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of those things are way weirder.</v>

225
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Like we found another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>

226
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what it's done.</v>

227
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Like if we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we poked our head into some other </v>

228
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.180
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

229
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.710
<v Speaker 1>And we just stuck our head through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw the impact of a human </v>

230
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.970
<v Speaker 1>civilization on the natural world.</v>

231
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.220
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

232
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.400
<v Speaker 1>That's way crazier than bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a human being is making tubes out </v>

233
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:11.840
<v Speaker 1>of aluminum with giant wings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting itself into the sky and landing</v>

234
00:11:11.841 --> 00:11:16.841
<v Speaker 1>on different spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sucking oil out of the ground and </v>

235
00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:19.070
<v Speaker 1>using it to build everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's talking on vine and it goes through</v>

236
00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:24.071
<v Speaker 1>the air and winds up on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this is done by a human that's way </v>

237
00:11:24.071 --> 00:11:25.160
<v Speaker 1>crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big foot.</v>

238
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go to chimps.</v>

239
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Chimps are way crazier than bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hot and monkeys,</v>

240
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:35.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking forming little societies</v>

241
00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:36.860
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are figuring out how to use</v>

242
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:41.640
<v Speaker 1>tools and they're right there like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's way crazier than bigfoot.</v>

243
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Bigfoot's just a shy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to be alone and just let </v>

244
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:51.890
<v Speaker 1>him find a good place to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't find any big foot shed because</v>

245
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 1>he's always paranoid that people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching them.</v>

246
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.170
<v Speaker 1>So he's holding his shit in it.</v>

247
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 5>I think Jane Goodall's wrong on this </v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

248
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where,</v>

249
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to go out there off on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>limb</v>

250
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that is limb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's quite a limb,</v>

251
00:12:06.631 --> 00:12:08.970
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you think that she would think</v>

252
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.680
<v Speaker 1>it's real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she wants it to be real.</v>

253
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

254
00:12:12.501 --> 00:12:16.140
<v Speaker 5>she said that she was talking to native </v>
<v Speaker 5>Americans about it and you know,</v>

255
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.180
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

256
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.880
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go off on a little bit trippy.</v>

257
00:12:19.881 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

258
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 5>They might be sent to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

259
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

260
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 1>just like saying you talked to to native</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

261
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying I talked to white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>

262
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:36.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because they happen to be native </v>

263
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they got street cred for big foot.</v>

264
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.300
<v Speaker 5>She's what she's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

265
00:12:36.301 --> 00:12:37.050
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Native Americans bigfoot street cred.</v>

267
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.150
<v Speaker 5>It's closer to the sasquatch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They named it.</v>

268
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.930
<v Speaker 5>It's like if anybody knows about almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>going extinct,</v>

269
00:12:48.931 --> 00:12:52.490
<v Speaker 5>it should be state of California sued </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it won't recognize it is</v>

<v Speaker 1>bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

271
00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:55.370

273
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:05.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>who claimed to believe the existence of </v>

274
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.911
<v Speaker 1>big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one California woman believes it's </v>

275
00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:10.971
<v Speaker 1>so strongly in the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's actually filed a lawsuit to prove </v>

276
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:14.761
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine being the court </v>

299
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's nothing.</v>

300
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no footprints that are like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to hair.</v>

00:14:27.821 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>hair off of it and say,</v>

308
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.481
<v Speaker 1>fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that I haven't seen one </v>

309
00:14:45.481 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 1>picture that looks real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen one video.</v>

<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

313
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that looks like a man in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a suit as a man in a suit like this,</v>

314
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.370
<v Speaker 1>even a chip doesn't look like a man in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>suit.</v>

315
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.430
<v Speaker 1>They moved different men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimps Kinda like throw themselves with </v>

316
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 1>their arms and up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moved.</v>

317
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 1>If you can't move like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't move like that.</v>

318
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.280
<v Speaker 1>You could try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to move the </v>

319
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:15.280
<v Speaker 1>way a chimp modes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with chimps moving fast.</v>

320
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Just get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even close.</v>

321
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 1>You look like a guy pretending to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp.</v>

322
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>You're moving like a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things move like people.</v>

323
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.470
<v Speaker 1>They move like people like your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little computer in your brain that </v>

324
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.470
<v Speaker 1>recognize the shapes goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

325
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a guy in a monkey suit.</v>

326
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

327
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instantly.</v>

328
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.890
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what you think because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that one,</v>

329
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.540
<v Speaker 1>the famous one that we know that one was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy in a suit,</v>

330
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:41.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

331
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.970
<v Speaker 1>there's people that dispute it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the patterson footage.</v>

332
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 1>The Patterson footage is like the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous footage and all of bigfoot lore </v>

333
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:56.190
<v Speaker 1>because this guy who I'm pretty sure the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy was a.</v>

334
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.660
<v Speaker 1>He was arrested for something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for not pay.</v>

335
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was something like not </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for the very camera that he used </v>

336
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.390
<v Speaker 1>to film the big foot footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

337
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Arrested for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guy,</v>

338
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.840
<v Speaker 1>he's stealing cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Dad's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

340
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.670
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another guy who claims </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he wore the suit.</v>

341
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.500
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always forget that guys name Gimlet is</v>

342
00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:26.440
<v Speaker 1>the guy that was there and then there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the other guy who wore the suit,</v>

343
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 1>who's a large fellow</v>

344
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.280
<v Speaker 1>and there's a picture of him walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he.</v>

345
00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:37.281
<v Speaker 1>He showed how he did it and he walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you see on the other side of </v>

346
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:41.501
<v Speaker 1>the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy in the monkey suit doing the </v>

347
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:41.501
<v Speaker 1>exact same walkin hieronymus Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

349
00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:47.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I remember Bob Hieronymus who's a </v>

350
00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Speaker 1>big cowboy looking dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had him walk with a monkey suit</v>

351
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:52.910
<v Speaker 1>on and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real big foot footage.</v>

352
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.010
<v Speaker 1>This guy bought a monkey suit too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

353
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.480
<v Speaker 1>The guy who made the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had bought a monkey suit.</v>

354
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he was going to use the </v>

355
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.750
<v Speaker 1>monkey suit to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

356
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 1>film a reenactment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So practice filming with it or something</v>

357
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:11.021
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some cockamamie reason for having a </v>

358
00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>monkey suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is so stupid.</v>

359
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>It's if you look at all the pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

360
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:15.680
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

361
00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you guys were fucking around and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

362
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.280
<v Speaker 1>you filmed some shit while you were on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse,</v>

363
00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:25.281
<v Speaker 1>so it was all bouncy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see this thing walk her across the </v>

364
00:17:25.281 --> 00:17:27.701
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they can isolate that footage </v>

365
00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>because it used to be all bouncing shaky</v>
<v Speaker 1>with computers.</v>

366
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 1>They can isolate it and get it all into </v>
<v Speaker 1>one flat plane and you watch it move.</v>

367
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking guy and a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 100 percent.</v>

368
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen it.</v>

369
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:41.890
<v Speaker 1>How have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Watch that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

371
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:45.680
<v Speaker 1>what am I looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing here?</v>

372
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.770
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people want to believe so bad.</v>

373
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never</v>

374
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 2>had a chance of believing in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

375
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>in the whole big foot thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was always just silly to me.</v>

376
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it John Lithgow and Harry and the </v>

377
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Hendersons back in the day or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

378
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

379
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.260
<v Speaker 2>I grew up on that and I was just stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

380
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a fake character.</v>

381
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be see Harry and the </v>

382
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:09.980
<v Speaker 2>hendersons before finding out about big </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot.</v>

383
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like believing that Barney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dinosaur would exist out there.</v>

384
00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Only reason to give it any credence at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all is the vast expanse of wilderness </v>

385
00:18:20.591 --> 00:18:24.850
<v Speaker 1>that exists in the Pacific northwest </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so lush.</v>

386
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:29.140
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy that no one's getting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and figuring out exactly what's in</v>

387
00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every I.</v>

388
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I really think everyone who lives in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this area,</v>

389
00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:36.550
<v Speaker 1>especially because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd get up there pretty quick,</v>

390
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.540
<v Speaker 1>but anybody anywhere should go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific northwest.</v>

391
00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I go to the mountains right above </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seattle.</v>

392
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

393
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.620
<v Speaker 1>That was way crazier than looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigfoot.</v>

394
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.970
<v Speaker 1>One of the craziest parts about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip was being in that real rain forest.</v>

395
00:18:51.971 --> 00:18:56.690
<v Speaker 1>The real thing was fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's thick like La,</v>

396
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.490
<v Speaker 1>like you can't see anything like every </v>
<v Speaker 1>two feet.</v>

397
00:19:00.491 --> 00:19:03.460
<v Speaker 1>There's another tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just thick with trees.</v>

398
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Which reminds me of my what my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

399
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Basically mystery ever db cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's where he jumped out of </v>

400
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:17.181
<v Speaker 2>that plane at really was in the hort </v>
<v Speaker 2>most horrible place you can imagine.</v>

401
00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Did he do that in Pacific northwest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

402
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Super.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They flew out to Seattle head and back </v>

403
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.410
<v Speaker 2>down again and he just hit that button </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the rear.</v>

404
00:19:26.411 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They felt the plane shake and then boof,</v>

405
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:34.341
<v Speaker 2>he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to land in the trees for </v>

406
00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:34.341
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like that.</v>

407
00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 2>But his parachute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of his stuff ever recovered.</v>

408
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 2>And then they combed that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did find like a stack of money,</v>

409
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I think like 10 or 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the bills sort of buried it.</v>

410
00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:49.011
<v Speaker 2>A beach next to a creek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part it's one of my </v>

411
00:19:49.011 --> 00:19:53.960
<v Speaker 2>favorite fucking little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that that guy may be </v>

412
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.960
<v Speaker 2>made off with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was only,</v>

413
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:58.620
<v Speaker 2>it was something low like 150 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>$200,000.</v>

414
00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>

415
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:04.731
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back then because this is in what </v>

416
00:20:04.731 --> 00:20:04.731
<v Speaker 2>year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 71.</v>

417
00:20:04.731 --> 00:20:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Seventy one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

418
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't just hijack the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made the plane land,</v>

419
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.050
<v Speaker 2>get rid of the passengers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring them parachutes,</v>

420
00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 2>bring the money and have it take off </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

421
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Like this is way back before p,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.990
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a true hijack and they land at </v>

423
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:23.990
<v Speaker 2>the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

424
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to save all the passengers </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

425
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 2>but here's the catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need $200,000,</v>

426
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 2>a few parachutes and something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like something weird.</v>

427
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

428
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 2>And they never found him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never found the body.</v>

429
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 2>They never found his suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found this clip on tie somehow that</v>

430
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:47.300
<v Speaker 2>was found somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it makes it even crazier when you </v>

431
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.811
<v Speaker 2>factor in that they found the clip on </v>
<v Speaker 2>tie and not the parachute and not the </v>

432
00:20:50.811 --> 00:20:50.811
<v Speaker 2>suit and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

433
00:20:50.811 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Because then it's almost like he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>got his 200,000</v>

434
00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 2>is just walking off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they said that the money was </v>

435
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 2>never spent though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

436
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking up a and August of last year</v>
<v Speaker 6>they found a 18 inch nylon strap,</v>

437
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 6>which they think might have been a piece</v>
<v Speaker 6>of his parachute.</v>

438
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.280
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how they would know that </v>

439
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.941
<v Speaker 6>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but some looking up some other </v>

440
00:21:17.941 --> 00:21:17.941
<v Speaker 6>information</v>

441
00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.320
<v Speaker 2>might've been some shit campers left </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind too.</v>

442
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just in a,</v>

443
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:28.010
<v Speaker 2>in Australia and I visited the grave of </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

444
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:33.670
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tie him should shimmered should the,</v>

445
00:21:33.921 --> 00:21:36.380
<v Speaker 2>another crazy mystery one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever hear that one?</v>

446
00:21:36.381 --> 00:21:39.950
<v Speaker 2>The guy that was found at the beach in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adelaide,</v>

447
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I actually went to the cemetery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>visited his grave during the day.</v>

448
00:21:43.431 --> 00:21:48.431
<v Speaker 2>One of the days I had off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're out when I was doing shows in </v>

449
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Adelaide and this guy was founded a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach.</v>

450
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.990
<v Speaker 2>This is one and another one of the great</v>
<v Speaker 2>mysteries ever found it a beach wearing </v>

451
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.560
<v Speaker 2>a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

452
00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.380
<v Speaker 2>he had a half lit a cigarette that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in his collar.</v>

453
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.210
<v Speaker 2>They found him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd been dead.</v>

454
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.480
<v Speaker 2>They don't know the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no id on him,</v>

455
00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:08.600
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they keep them around for a few weeks</v>

456
00:22:08.601 --> 00:22:13.601
<v Speaker 2>in the morgue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for some type of information on </v>

457
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:13.601
<v Speaker 2>the guy.</v>

458
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to bury him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And eventually they cut through is </v>

459
00:22:19.251 --> 00:22:23.720
<v Speaker 2>closed and they find that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little pocket with a piece of paper,</v>

460
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.000
<v Speaker 2>like on the inseam of his pants or </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt,</v>

461
00:22:26.001 --> 00:22:28.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They trace that.</v>

462
00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:33.340
<v Speaker 2>They can tell that it's cut out of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book called the tie am should or </v>

463
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.241
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it right because it's </v>

464
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:39.041
<v Speaker 2>some old Latin word or something and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a code on it and a phone </v>

465
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:40.670
<v Speaker 2>number or some or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a code on it,</v>

466
00:22:40.671 --> 00:22:43.190
<v Speaker 2>but they know that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a code on it.</v>

467
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.060
<v Speaker 2>It's just a piece of paper from a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have the page and everything.</v>

468
00:22:47.061 --> 00:22:48.620
<v Speaker 2>So they go to the newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

469
00:22:48.621 --> 00:22:51.680
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does anybody know have this copy of this</v>

470
00:22:51.681 --> 00:22:53.480
<v Speaker 2>book so that we can find out who this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy is on,</v>

471
00:22:53.481 --> 00:22:54.560
<v Speaker 2>why this is so dead on them.</v>

472
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:59.950
<v Speaker 2>They don't get anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go nationwide do Australia and </v>

473
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:00.110
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out what this piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers from.</v>

474
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.410
<v Speaker 2>They find the book in another part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia with the missing part.</v>

475
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.720
<v Speaker 2>And in that book is a phone number and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>code that every codebreaker ever is </v>

476
00:23:08.841 --> 00:23:10.760
<v Speaker 2>tried to figure out and they just don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

477
00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:13.610
<v Speaker 2>So it's the tomb of the unknown man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

478
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes like deep.</v>

479
00:23:16.581 --> 00:23:21.020
<v Speaker 2>There's so many theories about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to this guy.</v>

480
00:23:21.021 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 2>And it could have been the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could have been an American spy,</v>

481
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.660
<v Speaker 2>could have been a Russian spy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have been an Australian spy,</v>

482
00:23:26.661 --> 00:23:29.360
<v Speaker 2>like nobody knows anything about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

483
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.080
<v Speaker 2>And they followed up and there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy that like,</v>

484
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.960
<v Speaker 2>has some crazy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

485
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.600
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy that has a crazy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

486
00:23:38.601 --> 00:23:40.760
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of freedom in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

487
00:23:40.761 --> 00:23:43.040
<v Speaker 2>there's people that think that the Elon </v>
<v Speaker 2>musk thing was fake.</v>

488
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.750
<v Speaker 2>It was a hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

489
00:23:44.751 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 2>I someone yesterday</v>

490
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.310
<v Speaker 1>with that malarkey tie to mystery death </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Australia to Thomas Jefferson.</v>

491
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Winds that from this is that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified man found dead Australian </v>

492
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.760
<v Speaker 1>beach baffled investigators for decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>and new DNA analysis links somerton man </v>

493
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.900
<v Speaker 1>to Thomas Jefferson and native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

494
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 1>So he was an ancestor of Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jefferson and native Americans.</v>

495
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never read that.</v>

496
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they essentially just did a DNA test </v>

497
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.151
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call them the somerton man because </v>

498
00:24:19.151 --> 00:24:19.151
<v Speaker 1>that's the beach that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

499
00:24:19.151 --> 00:24:19.820
<v Speaker 1>he was found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys,</v>

500
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.550
<v Speaker 1>you know about this Elizabeth Warren </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

501
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who that woman is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a politician and she apparently at</v>

502
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:33.881
<v Speaker 1>one point in her life claim to be part </v>
<v Speaker 1>native American and now just like won't </v>

503
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:38.090
<v Speaker 1>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't do a DNA test,</v>

504
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 1>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

505
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.410
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any pictures?</v>

506
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:42.920
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

507
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I have many pictures and they're not for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

508
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.020
<v Speaker 1>This is what she said to investigators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

509
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.530
<v Speaker 1>And then you got trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Hollander Polka Pocahontas.</v>

510
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:56.531
<v Speaker 1>It's so brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hits back at trump's use of </v>

511
00:24:56.531 --> 00:24:57.530
<v Speaker 1>pocahontas vows to highlight native </v>
<v Speaker 1>American issues.</v>

512
00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I wasn't skeptical.</v>

513
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she was.</v>

514
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 1>She was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't real.</v>

515
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:09.430
<v Speaker 1>But what's weird is that I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gave you some sort of an advantage </v>

516
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:15.161
<v Speaker 1>for her to be native American in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like getting into certain schools or </v>

517
00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:19.301
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true and she </v>

518
00:25:19.301 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 1>might be part native American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might be like,</v>

519
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to tell you.</v>

520
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 1>That's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the best move,</v>

521
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but maybe she doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she like,</v>

522
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:32.380
<v Speaker 1>there's always something that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a thing with families like your </v>

523
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:32.380
<v Speaker 1>family telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

524
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.581
<v Speaker 1>you're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your grandmother was 23 percent Navajo </v>

525
00:25:36.581 --> 00:25:36.581
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

526
00:25:36.581 --> 00:25:36.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking cool.</v>

527
00:25:36.581 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 1>It gives you an extra little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad ass.</v>

528
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:44.350
<v Speaker 1>This is why Jane Goodall was willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept the two native Americans told me,</v>

529
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have talked to two other ones </v>

530
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:50.170
<v Speaker 1>who would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck out of here with that?</v>

531
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

532
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.680
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you're a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>person or a native American person or </v>

533
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever your ethnicity is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be a spectrum of people in</v>

534
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 1>that group and some of them are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be big foot believers.</v>

535
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:07.871
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if they're native </v>

536
00:26:07.871 --> 00:26:07.871
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean there's.</v>

537
00:26:07.871 --> 00:26:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people are bored and they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe in bigfoot.</v>

538
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:15.610
<v Speaker 1>So they start thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hear things that they don't really </v>

539
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:15.610
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start thinking they're camping out.</v>

540
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:16.700
<v Speaker 1>This one guy thought they were camping </v>
<v Speaker 1>out outside his window,</v>

541
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.060
<v Speaker 1>that they lived in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right outside his backdoor that </v>

542
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.600
<v Speaker 1>they come near where he is season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They read your mind.</v>

543
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 1>They they can sense when cameras are </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

544
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:28.440
<v Speaker 1>They won't show themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

545
00:26:28.441 --> 00:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a great evolved habit that is,</v>

546
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 1>but then like we were saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them truly believe that big foot</v>

547
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:40.751
<v Speaker 1>is like some interstellar traveler that </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be from another dimension is a </v>

548
00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:43.230
<v Speaker 1>creature from another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

549
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>because creatures</v>

550
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.040
<v Speaker 2>from other dimensions are super hairy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look just like that and that makes </v>

551
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.170
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

552
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.230
<v Speaker 7>Real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you can only see them when you're on</v>

553
00:26:51.231 --> 00:26:53.900
<v Speaker 7>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you imagine that?</v>

554
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:59.050
<v Speaker 7>That sort of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Imagine if you did like there was a </v>

555
00:26:59.050 --> 00:26:59.050
<v Speaker 7>perfect dose.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We.</v>

556
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:04.001
<v Speaker 7>You could see him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he'd get into his world and you see </v>

557
00:27:04.001 --> 00:27:06.451
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It looks like bigfoot buddies all in </v>

558
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:06.451
<v Speaker 7>like a rainbow.</v>

559
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been on mushrooms and seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing that wasn't there is </v>

560
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.180
<v Speaker 2>somebody next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a Ufo,</v>

561
00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:15.730
<v Speaker 2>but somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys told me that it was a,</v>

562
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone playing with like a laser </v>

563
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 2>light thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like out in the distance.</v>

564
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.950
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't know.</v>

565
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.100
<v Speaker 7>It could have been if you're on </v>
<v Speaker 7>mushrooms,</v>

566
00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:28.490
<v Speaker 7>it could be if you saw laser,</v>
<v Speaker 7>laser pointers are so weird,</v>

567
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.760
<v Speaker 7>like assholes point at planes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that's how ridiculous those things </v>

568
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:33.760
<v Speaker 7>are.</v>

569
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.200
<v Speaker 7>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's Kinda weird.</v>

570
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.920
<v Speaker 7>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I was a kid that was like,</v>

571
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:48.210
<v Speaker 7>the funniest thing you could do was just</v>
<v Speaker 7>have a laser pointer and have a red dot </v>

572
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 7>appear on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like during class teacher has no first.</v>

573
00:27:53.531 --> 00:27:54.690
<v Speaker 7>They didn't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Remember?</v>

574
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.590
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Teachers who didn't know about it.</v>

575
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.270
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was red dots are showing up.</v>

576
00:27:58.271 --> 00:28:00.520
<v Speaker 7>They didn't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was very rebellious.</v>

577
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.820
<v Speaker 7>Cats love those things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's always fun.</v>

578
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.800
<v Speaker 7>That became like a thing in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man.</v>

579
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:10.830
<v Speaker 7>Dude's got his hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Red Dots moving all over his body means </v>

580
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.440
<v Speaker 7>they had the gun on him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

581
00:28:11.441 --> 00:28:13.780
<v Speaker 7>That was the exciting part of a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

582
00:28:13.781 --> 00:28:14.750
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>

584
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened to me and my buddies once we</v>

585
00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:19.570
<v Speaker 2>were speeding away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were under age.</v>

586
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.220
<v Speaker 2>A highschool drinking party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

587
00:28:22.221 --> 00:28:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was nasty in the party.</v>

588
00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:29.311
<v Speaker 2>Got Busted by the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody ran out the back door like 70 </v>

589
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:29.380
<v Speaker 2>kids at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

590
00:28:29.381 --> 00:28:34.381
<v Speaker 2>my four buddies got slammed into my one </v>
<v Speaker 2>pals car and we're driving down the </v>

591
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Speaker 2>street and you just hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

592
00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Stopped off fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked to my right.</v>

593
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.270
<v Speaker 2>My buddy in the middle of the backseat </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the red dot right on.</v>

594
00:28:43.271 --> 00:28:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm up and down from his head to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

595
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.790
<v Speaker 2>He was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

596
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.480
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We all got in trouble cause you never </v>

597
00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:55.480
<v Speaker 7>know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They never know.</v>

598
00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.000
<v Speaker 7>Could it be young Tony Hinchcliffe and </v>
<v Speaker 7>is ms dot [inaudible] friend or could it</v>

599
00:28:59.001 --> 00:29:03.020
<v Speaker 7>be murderer bank robber trying to flee?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

600
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.650
<v Speaker 2>This cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that cop in particular was a real,</v>

601
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.390
<v Speaker 2>real bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

602
00:29:08.391 --> 00:29:13.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew that they just busted up a kids </v>

603
00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:16.600
<v Speaker 2>drinking party and that all the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>were scattering at once and he decided </v>

604
00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.900
<v Speaker 2>to stand in the middle of the street and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that like,</v>

605
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

606
00:29:20.331 --> 00:29:24.080
<v Speaker 2>he could have easily have shot us </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're standing in the middle of</v>

607
00:29:24.081 --> 00:29:26.840
<v Speaker 2>the street instead of having common </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

608
00:29:26.841 --> 00:29:29.570
<v Speaker 2>like there's so many other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

609
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:30.920
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

610
00:29:30.921 --> 00:29:35.921
<v Speaker 2>he could say that that's assault with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deadly weapon if you're driving towards </v>

611
00:29:35.921 --> 00:29:36.070
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he runs out in the street,</v>

612
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.060
<v Speaker 2>pulls out his gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost can't wait.</v>

613
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 2>It seemed from my buddy to not stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

614
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was one of those,</v>

615
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 4>one of those shady cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

616
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:50.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure that's the same cop from</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I'm from that saw a Ufo and it was</v>

617
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 4>on a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a big thing in liberty </v>

618
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.490
<v Speaker 4>township just outside of youngstown </v>
<v Speaker 4>where this one cop saw a Ufo.</v>

619
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.390
<v Speaker 4>Nobody could take them seriously.</v>

620
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>

621
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.290
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by me saying all this,</v>

622
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that people haven't seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ufos because I don't know what they've </v>

623
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.241
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible that something </v>

624
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:17.300
<v Speaker 1>that's capable of coming here from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another dimension,</v>

625
00:30:17.301 --> 00:30:20.610
<v Speaker 1>especially before recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

626
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 1>would be able to figure out how to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>detection somehow or another.</v>

627
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.060
<v Speaker 1>They're probably pretty close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to do that now.</v>

628
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the stealth bomber which </v>

629
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 1>avoids radar detection and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they have those cloaks.</v>

630
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.800
<v Speaker 1>You've seen those jackets of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

631
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:41.060
<v Speaker 1>where it literally shows a video of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's behind you,</v>

632
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:47.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like this new technology that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to develop where </v>

634
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.750
<v Speaker 1>literally you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your clothes would show exactly what's </v>

635
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.820
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a camera,</v>

636
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:57.850
<v Speaker 1>some sort of camera system mounted </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere on you and it's taking a </v>

637
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.030
<v Speaker 1>picture of what's behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's streaming what's behind you.</v>

638
00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.640
<v Speaker 1>And so then that appears on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

639
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 1>So as you move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally are everything that's </v>

640
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.611
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this weird like Predator effect </v>

641
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:10.430
<v Speaker 1>from the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very crude right now,</v>

642
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.760
<v Speaker 1>but you look at it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

643
00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.490
<v Speaker 1>this is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to become,</v>

644
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to be.</v>

645
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.230
<v Speaker 4>It's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>

646
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.240
<v Speaker 4>You watched veneer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

647
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make it look like everything in the</v>

648
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 4>future's going to make us crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

649
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.540
<v Speaker 1>so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

650
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

651
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of like a show that makes you </v>

652
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.120
<v Speaker 1>just like after the show's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go,</v>

653
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.901
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That crocodile expert episode rather </v>

654
00:31:37.901 --> 00:31:42.470
<v Speaker 1>crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like 15 friends text me after that</v>

655
00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:45.200
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck was that?</v>

656
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:50.620
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy and it's so good and you </v>

657
00:31:51.051 --> 00:31:52.640
<v Speaker 1>can see it happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

658
00:31:52.641 --> 00:31:54.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fucking way.</v>

659
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.230
<v Speaker 1>No fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

660
00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember a show ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that powerful?</v>

661
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Like when it comes to science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>type show?</v>

662
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

663
00:32:04.671 --> 00:32:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were some amazing shows on </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

664
00:32:07.011 --> 00:32:09.800
<v Speaker 1>but they're all really fiction shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

665
00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Like this is fiction with like a dash of</v>
<v Speaker 1>futuristic possibility,</v>

666
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 1>like dystopian future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking dog one with the robot dog.</v>

667
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that called?</v>

668
00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Metal head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

669
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

670
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I could see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could be real,</v>

671
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.150
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>

672
00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.110
<v Speaker 1>The future seems scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that robot open up the door,</v>

673
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 1>open up the door and hold it for his now</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

674
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Robot opened up a door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click open the latch.</v>

675
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

676
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.510
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

677
00:32:48.511 --> 00:32:50.780
<v Speaker 1>look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this shit.</v>

678
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's just first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it and just imagine it with guns</v>

679
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you could imagine that,</v>

680
00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laser pointers and guns everywhere.</v>

681
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.850
<v Speaker 1>So this thing walks up,</v>

682
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.100
<v Speaker 5>grabs the fucking handle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turns the door,</v>

683
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 5>check this out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>puts its leg there to stop the door,</v>

684
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.420
<v Speaker 5>walks the door back so it has some kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of intelligence in less.</v>

685
00:33:16.421 --> 00:33:21.421
<v Speaker 5>That's a programmed move in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has there ever been anything that </v>

686
00:33:21.421 --> 00:33:23.380
<v Speaker 5>doesn't get it like a virus or things go</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong at some point?</v>

687
00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.440
<v Speaker 5>Of course this is all gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go wrong,</v>

688
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.560
<v Speaker 5>it's going to go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I wonder if that's a program to </v>

689
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.311
<v Speaker 5>move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it told them the exact steps to </v>

690
00:33:35.311 --> 00:33:37.951
<v Speaker 5>take and it measured out all the inches </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then knew the exact movements to </v>

691
00:33:37.951 --> 00:33:42.271
<v Speaker 5>make or if it can accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>accurately calculate distance.</v>

692
00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.900
<v Speaker 5>So they've given it in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of electronic eyes,</v>

693
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.180
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it can walk up to a door,</v>

694
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.610
<v Speaker 5>grab the handle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn it and pull it,</v>

695
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.270
<v Speaker 5>and then hold the door open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it's leg lead,</v>

696
00:33:55.271 --> 00:33:58.750
<v Speaker 5>it's friends go by like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're fucked.</v>

697
00:33:58.751 --> 00:33:59.950
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's.</v>

698
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:05.280
<v Speaker 5>That kind of articulation is very crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>to think that you could teach something </v>

699
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:05.680
<v Speaker 5>to do that.</v>

700
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.940
<v Speaker 5>So if you only teach and to do doors or </v>
<v Speaker 5>can I do that with everything?</v>

701
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.630
<v Speaker 5>That's when it gets weird when it gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird is if,</v>

702
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.910
<v Speaker 5>if it can create.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you could figure out,</v>

703
00:34:15.911 --> 00:34:18.880
<v Speaker 5>well if it works on this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of door do we have here?</v>

704
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.490
<v Speaker 5>Oh I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This thing is just a slide.</v>

705
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.080
<v Speaker 5>Is it going to be able to figure that </v>
<v Speaker 5>out?</v>

706
00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.670
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of,</v>

707
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.450
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems.</v>

708
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it would be able to figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>it out pretty easily.</v>

709
00:34:29.381 --> 00:34:34.381
<v Speaker 5>Especially when you factor in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything in the future is going to be </v>

710
00:34:34.381 --> 00:34:37.081
<v Speaker 5>more like technological anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the doors even turning a knob or </v>

711
00:34:37.271 --> 00:34:41.920
<v Speaker 5>sliding a door is going to be ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people are just going to be like</v>

712
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.330
<v Speaker 5>jet eyes or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

713
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.360
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have fingerprint things </v>
<v Speaker 5>now for stuff like fingerprint things </v>

714
00:34:48.671 --> 00:34:52.990
<v Speaker 5>for like opening doors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seeing fingerprint things for a locks at</v>

715
00:34:52.991 --> 00:34:54.910
<v Speaker 5>the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a fingerprint thing now.</v>

716
00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:55.720
<v Speaker 5>That's like a new thing.</v>

717
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

718
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why you wouldn't want to cut off </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thumb out of,</v>

719
00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.410
<v Speaker 1>out of all the fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut Off.</v>

720
00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

721
00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:08.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just really interesting to me how </v>

722
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.750
<v Speaker 1>quick all this technology's moving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how that doesn't.</v>

723
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.690
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like there's any end in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sight and most of us,</v>

724
00:35:13.691 --> 00:35:18.691
<v Speaker 1>like you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like normal people are sitting back </v>

725
00:35:18.691 --> 00:35:19.630
<v Speaker 1>watching this on internet videos going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whew.</v>

726
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we,</v>

727
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.070
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

728
00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:29.220
<v Speaker 1>when do we stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we stop making robots that </v>

729
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.941
<v Speaker 1>could kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like before they're smart or after </v>

730
00:35:32.941 --> 00:35:33.010
<v Speaker 1>they're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're smart,</v>

731
00:35:33.011 --> 00:35:34.180
<v Speaker 1>they're going to just stay alive</v>

732
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 5>and obviously as soon as we can latch </v>
<v Speaker 5>guns onto them</v>

733
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 2>going in.</v>

734
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a drone is.</v>

735
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about one of the drone where the </v>

736
00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.271
<v Speaker 1>drone is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a drone is it someone is piloting </v>

737
00:35:49.271 --> 00:35:49.271
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because it's flying around,</v>

738
00:35:49.271 --> 00:35:50.060
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it's not a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

739
00:35:50.061 --> 00:35:55.061
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a robot airship and they're flying </v>

740
00:35:55.061 --> 00:35:58.671
<v Speaker 1>it around and they're getting these kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are wizards and video games I'll </v>

741
00:35:58.671 --> 00:36:02.700
<v Speaker 1>give you want to have some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to beat armies.</v>

742
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:08.330
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Hook them up with some of those I </v>

743
00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.241
<v Speaker 1>robot things from that will smith movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make them all bulletproof and you </v>

744
00:36:10.241 --> 00:36:13.670
<v Speaker 1>have a bunch of kids that just play </v>
<v Speaker 1>wicked video games all day.</v>

745
00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Know how to fuck people up with madden </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that UFC game.</v>

746
00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.820
<v Speaker 1>You fucking send those kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piloting these things in real time.</v>

747
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.690
<v Speaker 1>You send them to parts of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why that would be.</v>

748
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.320
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be 10 times more terrifying than </v>

749
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:32.320
<v Speaker 1>drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

750
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Some things were running through your </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

751
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 6>I just thought of something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say.</v>

752
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.820
<v Speaker 6>The problem I've always had with this </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea is like our battery life that we </v>

753
00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.160
<v Speaker 6>use on stuff is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

754
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:46.161
<v Speaker 6>it's going to eat people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what batteries are they using in </v>

755
00:36:46.161 --> 00:36:49.001
<v Speaker 6>those drones that are flying up above </v>
<v Speaker 6>now that are over overseas doing damage </v>

756
00:36:49.001 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 6>on and whatnot?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are those like special batteries that we</v>

757
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:55.950
<v Speaker 6>don't have access to that maybe in five </v>
<v Speaker 6>years we will ask this question won't be</v>

758
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:56.790
<v Speaker 6>so weird to us</v>

759
00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.820
<v Speaker 1>is are you sure that that's the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things fly was almost just going </v>

760
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:01.820
<v Speaker 1>to ask that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they fly.</v>

761
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're gas powered </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

762
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:03.690
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

763
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:05.610
<v Speaker 1>let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a good thing to know.</v>

764
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Might not be able to find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they won't.</v>

765
00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Department of Defense stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're scared to Google it.</v>

766
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.300
<v Speaker 1>That you want to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not want to google.</v>

767
00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 1>How far?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far can you fly a drone and wonder?</v>

768
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather run on gasoline while it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying two missiles.</v>

769
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Just wondering.</v>

770
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.220
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like the most American thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

771
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.600
<v Speaker 2>The drones filled with gas and oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wondering with missiles.</v>

772
00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drones.</v>

773
00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to worry about people more than </v>

774
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:47.570
<v Speaker 1>we even have to worry about drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

775
00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.380
<v Speaker 1>This new shooting in Florida freaked me </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out again.</v>

776
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happening all the time now.</v>

777
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the crazy thing is like kids used to</v>

778
00:37:58.941 --> 00:38:01.280
<v Speaker 1>joke around about this guy doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someday.</v>

779
00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:04.010
<v Speaker 1>That was something they joked around </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

780
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

781
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that the way that the news </v>
<v Speaker 2>reports it and the way that it's such </v>

782
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:16.371
<v Speaker 2>big news isn't helping at all because </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that I've noticed is the whole</v>

783
00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:19.500
<v Speaker 2>car ramming thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's a new thing,</v>

784
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:24.590
<v Speaker 2>car ramming where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the things that are happening </v>

785
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:27.600
<v Speaker 2>or people just getting in a truck or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>car and just running people down.</v>

786
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a fairly new thing that started </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like,</v>

787
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:35.571
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that French one or something like </v>

788
00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:35.571
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the first one,</v>

789
00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:35.960
<v Speaker 2>but since then because report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.980
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they report it and they blow these </v>

791
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:40.980
<v Speaker 2>things up and then bing bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

792
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.391
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like going off of the car </v>
<v Speaker 2>ramming situation and the growth in car </v>

793
00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:50.401
<v Speaker 2>rammings alone that we could sort of see</v>
<v Speaker 2>how overly reporting these.</v>

794
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's even a thing or </v>

795
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.550
<v Speaker 2>if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is making sense at all,</v>

796
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.550
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

797
00:38:56.550 --> 00:39:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the counter to that I would be </v>

798
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 1>someone had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>

799
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.550
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone made a really good analogy.</v>

800
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:12.190
<v Speaker 1>The point being what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is only happening here.</v>

801
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.620
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure out why it's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

802
00:39:15.621 --> 00:39:18.230
<v Speaker 1>So often it rarely happens anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

803
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.320
<v Speaker 1>but here it happens pretty often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is that?</v>

804
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Is it access to guns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it mental health?</v>

805
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Is it both of those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

806
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:35.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just far too easy to get guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it that you're not being monitored in</v>

807
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:40.410
<v Speaker 1>the sense of being talked about and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to anybody infringing </v>

808
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:41.370
<v Speaker 1>upon their rights?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

809
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:46.790
<v Speaker 1>But if we just sat down and had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational conversation with someone to </v>

810
00:39:49.501 --> 00:39:51.120
<v Speaker 1>renew a gun license,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

811
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.560
<v Speaker 1>rational conversation with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work for a gun group or anything</v>

812
00:39:55.561 --> 00:40:00.561
<v Speaker 1>to someone who could just give you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable reason why you should be </v>

813
00:40:02.221 --> 00:40:07.221
<v Speaker 1>suspicious about this person having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>firearm or you really don't want to do </v>

814
00:40:07.221 --> 00:40:07.221
<v Speaker 1>that either though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't trust people.</v>

815
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're putting people in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of power to decide who gets the</v>

816
00:40:11.011 --> 00:40:13.590
<v Speaker 1>guns and who doesn't get the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all very,</v>

817
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.740
<v Speaker 1>very fucking terrifying and confusing.</v>

818
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:21.760
<v Speaker 2>That seems like the Ar 15 is the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they need to keep an eye on because</v>

819
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:26.761
<v Speaker 2>all the biggest ones are that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be able to mount our </v>

820
00:40:26.761 --> 00:40:26.761
<v Speaker 2>mode down a lot of people at once.</v>

821
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Semiautomatic rifles are more effective </v>

822
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.010
<v Speaker 1>in those type of mass shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

823
00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:35.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why those guys use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they use them.</v>

824
00:40:35.061 --> 00:40:38.500
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of horrific ways.</v>

825
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:40.000
<v Speaker 1>All we're all around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

826
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

827
00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.450
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they to lethal for a regular person?</v>

828
00:40:45.451 --> 00:40:50.451
<v Speaker 1>Just be carrying around where you'd want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know why a regular person wants to </v>

829
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>carry him around and then you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

830
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:58.950
<v Speaker 1>is that really my right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even ask a regular person why they need </v>

831
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.950
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

832
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean if most of these people are law </v>
<v Speaker 1>abiding gun owners,</v>

833
00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:09.850
<v Speaker 1>when we freak out that one person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>legally bought a gun in this case is a </v>

834
00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.250
<v Speaker 1>kid who legally bought it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>

835
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 1>does this horrific thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good question and it's a </v>

836
00:41:18.381 --> 00:41:23.381
<v Speaker 1>question we often ask ourselves like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times does this happen before </v>

837
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:26.300
<v Speaker 1>something happens and is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the answer arming the schools.</v>

838
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking terrifying answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The putting armed guards at schools,</v>

839
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I saw a story where had held up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>signs,</v>

840
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.340
<v Speaker 1>which it was like a instagram thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was.</v>

841
00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 1>The two signs were which one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>signs would make you feel good if you </v>

842
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 1>were like a killer and it shows no </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>

843
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:53.470
<v Speaker 1>no weapons sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it also shows a sign with an </v>

844
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:58.181
<v Speaker 1>armed guard saying that the staff is </v>
<v Speaker 1>armed and trained and you know,</v>

845
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.820
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at the two of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

846
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want either one of these fucking</v>

847
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:09.761
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't want weapons in the </v>

848
00:42:09.761 --> 00:42:12.240
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want them to need weapons in</v>

849
00:42:12.241 --> 00:42:13.980
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't want it there.</v>

850
00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they.</v>

851
00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.220
<v Speaker 1>When scenes like this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go,</v>

852
00:42:20.221 --> 00:42:21.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is there a way?</v>

853
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:27.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the way is other than </v>

854
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.360
<v Speaker 1>even if you take people's guns away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn you're.</v>

855
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.850
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many of them.</v>

856
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:35.760
<v Speaker 1>The number of guns that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

857
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it outnumbers humans.</v>

858
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I think the number of guns like total in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country outnumber humans insanity.</v>

859
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Even if you are for guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the number of things that can kill </v>

860
00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:58.971
<v Speaker 1>us outnumber us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we overreacting?</v>

861
00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Are we crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we stockpiling for some fucking </v>

862
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.090
<v Speaker 1>terrible collapsed that we're all afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of?</v>

863
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.050
<v Speaker 4>Is that just our thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we're like,</v>

864
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:14.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were like the last country or </v>

865
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:14.450
<v Speaker 4>whatever you think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it like defensive question?</v>

866
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Difficult question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like crazy,</v>

867
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.370
<v Speaker 4>scared country.</v>

868
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

869
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:25.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's different uses for firearms and </v>

870
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.170
<v Speaker 1>who are you to say that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational shooters who are </v>

871
00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:33.520
<v Speaker 1>respectable law abiding people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them out there that are</v>

872
00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:38.621
<v Speaker 1>very good people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just love to shoot pistols at </v>

873
00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:39.980
<v Speaker 1>targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do competitions,</v>

874
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:45.190
<v Speaker 1>they enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like being proficient with a </v>

875
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.310
<v Speaker 1>firearm for their own personal safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there have been cases,</v>

876
00:43:46.311 --> 00:43:51.311
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a case in shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was in Ohio where some </v>

877
00:43:51.311 --> 00:43:56.141
<v Speaker 1>guy was stabbing somebody at a mall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some dude who was a trained shooter at </v>

878
00:43:57.521 --> 00:44:02.521
<v Speaker 1>one of those shooting competition things</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot the guy and killed him when he was </v>

879
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:07.750
<v Speaker 1>running around stabbing people at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mall and it was one of those things </v>

880
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:11.651
<v Speaker 1>where no one wanted to play that up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the media because they thought it was </v>

881
00:44:11.651 --> 00:44:16.271
<v Speaker 1>like irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's irresponsible to play up the idea </v>

882
00:44:16.271 --> 00:44:17.590
<v Speaker 1>of the rogue vigilante with the pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

883
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.690
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a real guy,</v>

884
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 1>like the guys actually like kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

885
00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Like if he was in a Bruce Willis movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be fucking pumped.</v>

886
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy's kind of a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

887
00:44:29.911 --> 00:44:34.911
<v Speaker 1>he was a normal citizen that happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a concealed carry permit.</v>

888
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

889
00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:41.140
<v Speaker 4>Found another similar story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess from what you're describing in </v>

890
00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:41.300
<v Speaker 4>Minnesota was an off duty cop that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped somebody that was established.</v>

891
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

892
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It was an off duty cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the stab ones.</v>

893
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.270
<v Speaker 1>So I got that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was he who was the firearm instructor</v>

894
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:50.280
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

895
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 1>This might have been another similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>story to it might have been,</v>

896
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 1>but there was definitely one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry if I fucked that up.</v>

897
00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was definitely one where the guy </v>

898
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:03.420
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

899
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.760
<v Speaker 1>one of those big NRA shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition type characters.</v>

900
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.540
<v Speaker 1>This is a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible tragedy.</v>

901
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these terrible tragedies seemed to </v>

902
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:15.710
<v Speaker 1>keep happening and we don't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>

903
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

904
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 1>their second amendment rights being </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken away.</v>

905
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are worried about law abiding </v>

906
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:26.660
<v Speaker 1>people who would never do anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

907
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Worried about their guns getting taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

908
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all,</v>

909
00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.230
<v Speaker 1>all of us we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to figure this out.</v>

910
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.320
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this can't just keep going on this way </v>

911
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's causing it,</v>

912
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the way people are raising </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

913
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the way people are treating people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

914
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy mental imbalances that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were not treating in each other,</v>

915
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.880
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's biological,</v>

916
00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:52.040
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that we just can't keep as a,</v>

917
00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.020
<v Speaker 1>as a civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

918
00:45:54.021 --> 00:45:58.120
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing that should in its best times to</v>

919
00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.550
<v Speaker 1>be able to get along great with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

920
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.730
<v Speaker 1>These little aberrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're horrific aberrations,</v>

921
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.440
<v Speaker 1>but they exist frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many of us.</v>

922
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>320 something million people.</v>

923
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.790
<v Speaker 1>This was from 2015 more guns and people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

924
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

925
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

926
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 317 million people in 2013 and </v>

927
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:29.130
<v Speaker 1>$357 million guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

928
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.170
<v Speaker 1>But then the people who are gun nuts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

929
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 1>what are you fucking cure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many guns?</v>

930
00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I have been home a button soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

931
00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I would never do anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

932
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a piece of shit folk.</v>

933
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Him and their right to their right to if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

934
00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:46.770
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't done anything and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would never do anything,</v>

935
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.560
<v Speaker 1>why would you get lumped in with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has.</v>

936
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:54.590
<v Speaker 1>If you have a truck and you would never </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream into plowing into a mall full of </v>

937
00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you get lumped lumped into the</v>

938
00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>same group as a guy who has a truck who </v>
<v Speaker 1>did do that?</v>

939
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Why should you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair,</v>

940
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.110
<v Speaker 1>but we stuffed to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

941
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.410
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with.</v>

942
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Is that many more things that can kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

943
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Then us.</v>

944
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:16.780
<v Speaker 4>If a guy pointed a gun at you from </v>
<v Speaker 4>across the room,</v>

945
00:47:16.781 --> 00:47:18.910
<v Speaker 4>do you have something in your head plan </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you would do?</v>

946
00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would do a bunch of cartwheels and </v>

947
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.300
<v Speaker 4>somersaults.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's always been my plan.</v>

948
00:47:25.301 --> 00:47:27.160
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if I just do weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>movements,</v>

949
00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 4>you could avoid almost nothing you can</v>

950
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.740
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

951
00:47:32.741 --> 00:47:37.741
<v Speaker 1>It's too terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying thing.</v>

952
00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 1>The ability to just end someone's life </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a single movement of your hand</v>

953
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.860
<v Speaker 2>and we learned so early on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember duck hunt as a kid.</v>

954
00:47:46.861 --> 00:47:48.120
<v Speaker 2>The nintendo like tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>

955
00:47:48.121 --> 00:47:48.480
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>

956
00:47:48.481 --> 00:47:48.810
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>

957
00:47:48.811 --> 00:47:50.070
<v Speaker 2>tick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that gun,</v>

958
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we learned so early on,</v>

959
00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:58.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that people value people so </v>

960
00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:02.870
<v Speaker 1>poorly that they would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where we have to find like the </v>

961
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:06.450
<v Speaker 1>root of what that is and that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sounds very philosophical and hippy</v>

962
00:48:06.451 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 1>dippy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

963
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:13.760
<v Speaker 1>we have to examine what could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>be inside someone that would make them </v>

964
00:48:14.821 --> 00:48:18.060
<v Speaker 1>want to do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would that be?</v>

965
00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean how the fuck does that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

966
00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:24.150
<v Speaker 1>How does a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how were there in the same timeline?</v>

967
00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:29.151
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about like primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman days or the vikings or anything </v>

968
00:48:29.151 --> 00:48:31.980
<v Speaker 1>crazy we're talking about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How in the same timeline does a guy like</v>

969
00:48:31.981 --> 00:48:35.490
<v Speaker 1>you exist alongside someone who could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

970
00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.430
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>

971
00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 2>I also think that there's something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be said about like awareness of </v>

972
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.990
<v Speaker 2>depression and psychological disorders </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the older generation.</v>

973
00:48:48.121 --> 00:48:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel like in the future more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are gonna know about it and take it as a</v>

974
00:48:52.621 --> 00:48:54.780
<v Speaker 2>real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still think now there's probably.</v>

975
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:59.330
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely a lot of stubborn </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents out there that ignoring,</v>

976
00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.750
<v Speaker 2>you're not depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get up,</v>

977
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:05.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of this because it's definitely </v>

978
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.830
<v Speaker 2>deep rooted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lack of structure in their lives,</v>

979
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:13.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff's gone wrong and they don't have </v>

980
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.430
<v Speaker 2>anybody to talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything,</v>

981
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely a common thing.</v>

982
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:20.890
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dissatisfaction with their current </v>

983
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.421
<v Speaker 1>state in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their physical health people have all </v>

984
00:49:24.421 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 1>sorts of undiagnosed mental issues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they don't have insurance and they</v>

985
00:49:26.651 --> 00:49:31.651
<v Speaker 1>can't afford treatment or maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just got off of it and they think </v>

986
00:49:31.651 --> 00:49:33.070
<v Speaker 1>they're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we know guys who did that who got</v>

987
00:49:33.071 --> 00:49:34.930
<v Speaker 1>off of stuff that they weren't supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get off of.</v>

988
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:39.931
<v Speaker 1>And then they start getting really </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid and crazy and then someone has </v>

989
00:49:39.931 --> 00:49:39.931
<v Speaker 1>to talk them down.</v>

990
00:49:39.931 --> 00:49:43.200
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed like that is,</v>

991
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like you said,</v>

992
00:49:44.791 --> 00:49:46.980
<v Speaker 2>if they don't have insurance then all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sudden they're like,</v>

993
00:49:46.981 --> 00:49:49.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't have insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little did they know that it's a phone</v>

994
00:49:49.501 --> 00:49:52.020
<v Speaker 2>call away to get like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:57.110
<v Speaker 2>free whatever somehow or help somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also with the depression makes you </v>

996
00:49:58.651 --> 00:50:00.660
<v Speaker 2>not want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you,</v>

997
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.830
<v Speaker 2>it's part of it is you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of find help.</v>

998
00:50:04.831 --> 00:50:05.940
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to reach out.</v>

999
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I find it's interesting.</v>

1000
00:50:09.361 --> 00:50:14.361
<v Speaker 1>That is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think avoidable and then maybe we </v>

1001
00:50:14.361 --> 00:50:14.940
<v Speaker 1>should all like think about this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1002
00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:18.630
<v Speaker 1>There's something that happens whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>something takes place,</v>

1003
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:24.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people like expect a reaction,</v>

1004
00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:29.580
<v Speaker 1>they expect a reaction from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this tendency to get upset </v>

1005
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 1>at people that are not showing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to it.</v>

1006
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Like publicly instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a responsibility to show a </v>

1007
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:45.731
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been thinking about this and I </v>

1008
00:50:45.731 --> 00:50:45.731
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>

1009
00:50:45.731 --> 00:50:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I had put something</v>
<v Speaker 1>up I think on twitter,</v>

1010
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.670
<v Speaker 1>instagram and someone about our show in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bakersfield tonight.</v>

1011
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1012
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:59.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe not a great time to promote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a school shooting just saying </v>

1013
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.190
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about it.</v>

1014
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1015
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe had heard peripherally that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>

1016
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was flipping through Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know the extent of it.</v>

1017
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.460
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1018
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.430
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1019
00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1020
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:28.340
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the worst things people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do to people to like snuff out young </v>

1021
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.100
<v Speaker 1>life for no reason.</v>

1022
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:31.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1023
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

1024
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 4>It's becoming so common.</v>

1025
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1026
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 4>it's like there has to be a way to stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1027
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.680
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1028
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:46.710
<v Speaker 4>a way it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like people have become so </v>

1029
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:50.351
<v Speaker 4>desensitized that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like the new super suicide,</v>

1030
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1031
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:58.090
<v Speaker 1>desensitized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if this had happened 20 years </v>

1032
00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.641
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a gigantic thing that would </v>

1033
00:52:00.641 --> 00:52:03.011
<v Speaker 1>freak people out for days and days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be all anybody's talking </v>

1034
00:52:03.011 --> 00:52:06.431
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in one sense of I did hear about a </v>

1035
00:52:06.431 --> 00:52:09.521
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I'd seen something about </v>

1036
00:52:09.521 --> 00:52:09.830
<v Speaker 1>the school getting shut down or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1037
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

1038
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:11.600
<v Speaker 1>something that happened.</v>

1039
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.270
<v Speaker 1>And then going into it later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I looked into it,</v>

<v Speaker 4>of zone out</v>

1088
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:25.750

1090
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.470
<v Speaker 4>elevator anyway.</v>

1094
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:37.170
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing you could do with that </v>
<v Speaker 7>one dude.</v>

1095
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.320
<v Speaker 7>That's sad.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Elevator accident.</v>

1097
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.660
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's one of the things when you're in </v>

1098
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.460
<v Speaker 7>a place like Manhattan and you're on the</v>
<v Speaker 7>89th floor of a building and you're </v>

1099
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:53.400

<v Speaker 4>climb out and then you've heard of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>like getting to capitated or whatever </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1156
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing about capitalism </v>

1157
00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:50.020
<v Speaker 1>that someone can get that far out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of whack.</v>

1158
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 1>They could ball that heart above all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1159
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.540
<v Speaker 1>What kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do?</v>

1160
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.000
<v Speaker 2>And those are some of my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1161
00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:02.040
<v Speaker 2>some of my favorite crazy stories is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the jinx,</v>

1162
00:58:02.041 --> 00:58:05.590
<v Speaker 2>the Robert Durst one where he came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1163
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:09.690
<v Speaker 2>the family that owns just Manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 2>skyscrapers and.</v>

1164
00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's crazy.</v>

1165
00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:15.510
<v Speaker 2>The dupont guy with the wrestling team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 2>That's another wild one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1167
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.890
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the wildest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a terrifying one.</v>

1169
00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Steve Carell can act as fucking ass off </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny.</v>

1170
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1171
00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:30.580
<v Speaker 1>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing where someone used a </v>

1172
00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:34.271
<v Speaker 1>gun to kill someone that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened by and some sort of a </v>

1173
00:58:34.271 --> 00:58:38.180
<v Speaker 1>masculine way because Dave Schultz was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this super bad ass wrestler.</v>

1174
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just top of him and his brother Mark,</v>

1175
00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:45.680
<v Speaker 1>top of the food chain wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible story.</v>

1176
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I almost went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm pretty sure I almost went to</v>

1177
00:58:48.631 --> 00:58:53.631
<v Speaker 2>the match Schultes Mark Schultz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Schultz wrestling camp back when I </v>

1178
00:58:54.541 --> 00:58:57.060
<v Speaker 2>was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Ohio state one instead.</v>

1179
00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.840
<v Speaker 1>He fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathered big daddy,</v>

1180
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:02.560
<v Speaker 1>big daddy Goodrich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1181
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:07.770
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC way back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was his one and only a mma fight in </v>

1182
00:59:08.561 --> 00:59:13.561
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really interesting because in </v>

1183
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:14.770
<v Speaker 1>the movie that they did with Steve </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carell,</v>

1184
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:17.200
<v Speaker 1>like that's a historical moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1185
00:59:17.201 --> 00:59:21.650
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they made that movie,</v>

1186
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:23.750
<v Speaker 1>the cage fighting par was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1187
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:25.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just fucking fudge this.</v>

1188
00:59:25.371 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I,</v>

1189
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:31.510
<v Speaker 1>why would I believe that anything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie is what really happened when </v>

1190
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I know for sure really </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1191
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 1>You fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:41.240

<v Speaker 1>happen is this guy,</v>

1193
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.630
<v Speaker 1>big daddy goodrich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the food chain wrestler man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And he just took him down at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will he,</v>

1196
00:59:52.421 --> 00:59:55.270
<v Speaker 1>he handled him at will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took show?</v>

1197
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.350
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1200
00:59:57.441 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1201
00:59:58.041 --> 00:59:58.250
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1202
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.470
<v Speaker 1>There'll be none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be none of that.</v>

1203
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Mark Schultz was a go rilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1204
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like I said,</v>

1205
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>top of the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American wrestler.</v>

1206
01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1207
01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.690
<v Speaker 1>And so this is him fighting Gary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Goodrich.</v>

1208
01:00:13.691 --> 01:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Let like very little striking fairy </v>
<v Speaker 1>little striking trade.</v>

1209
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:17.690
<v Speaker 1>He's just looking for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says.</v>

1210
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>And once he gets this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck all loud,</v>

1211
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes him to the ground like he's a sack</v>

1212
01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>of potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beats the shit out of a mountain,</v>

1213
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>does whatever he wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he has him on the ground,</v>

1214
01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>whatever he wants to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a level of grappling that the UFC </v>

1215
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.950
<v Speaker 1>up until then had never seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1216
01:00:33.951 --> 01:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like if a guy like Daniel cormier </v>
<v Speaker 1>entry into the octagon back there,</v>

1217
01:00:37.191 --> 01:00:40.790
<v Speaker 1>same kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just takes everybody's going down,</v>

1218
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not going to be any stuff in </v>

1219
01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>these take downs.</v>

1220
01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:46.890
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named Jordan burroughs out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that I would.</v>

1221
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>What's added to stop that right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was different times,</v>

1222
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fact then.</v>

1223
01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would.</v>

1224
01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:55.880
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know what the fuck they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing half the time.</v>

1225
01:00:55.881 --> 01:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Scott,</v>

1226
01:00:57.141 --> 01:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>no gloves on and Gary's got no gloves </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1227
01:00:59.331 --> 01:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>but back in the day you could wear </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves if you wanted to.</v>

1228
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think he has shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1229
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>He's got wrestling shoes and look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1230
01:01:06.051 --> 01:01:11.051
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean every time he wants to he could </v>

1231
01:01:11.051 --> 01:01:13.931
<v Speaker 1>take him down there in these mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a level of grappling that </v>

1232
01:01:13.931 --> 01:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you just don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting them off.</v>

1233
01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>You stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

1234
01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even understand.</v>

1235
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>This is like a big daddy goodrich I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should just say is a incredibly strong </v>

1236
01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:28.700
<v Speaker 1>guy and an awesome athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening here?</v>

1237
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what happened?</v>

1238
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Big John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1239
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>did he key lock them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he's.</v>

1240
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.640
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I have in my head I had that he </v>

1241
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.060
<v Speaker 1>beat him up and want a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1242
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did that resolve?</v>

1243
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Did submit him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1244
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I remember this wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1245
01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remember just watching.</v>

1246
01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you've got.</v>

1247
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to key lock too much blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1248
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that they just stopped it.</v>

1249
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a stoppage.</v>

1250
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

1251
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.760
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named Jordan burroughs who</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he wrestles,</v>

1252
01:02:12.761 --> 01:02:15.670
<v Speaker 2>he has these the greatest double leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>take down ever.</v>

1253
01:02:15.671 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Just shoot slow drives in his opponents </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now he's going to it.</v>

1254
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.520
<v Speaker 2>He's won multiple gold side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's just a monster and I would </v>

<v Speaker 2>learn some Jujitsu and figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to see because in like almost </v>

<v Speaker 1>Where is that guy going?</v>

1271
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1272
01:03:06.981 --> 01:03:11.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're seeing with Habib </v>

1273
01:03:11.981 --> 01:03:14.111
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go off when you see like the super high </v>

1274
01:03:14.111 --> 01:03:14.111
<v Speaker 1>level striking or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1275
01:03:14.111 --> 01:03:15.540
<v Speaker 1>super high level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grappling it,</v>

1276
01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.080
<v Speaker 1>it shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even like really good grapplers.</v>

1277
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Is this him and time square?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1278
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome.</v>

1279
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Who is he wrestling again?</v>

1280
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Some guy that thought he was about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get points right there.</v>

1281
01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.600
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

1282
01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Who is he wrestling against?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it say,</v>

1283
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:37.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got some rap music on it that'll </v>

1284
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:38.941
<v Speaker 1>get us kicked off youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is all these are like world </v>

1285
01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>championships and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy man.</v>

1286
01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Serious power and technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

1287
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the most important skill </v>
<v Speaker 1>in mma.</v>

1288
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought it and I still do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think these guys can learn </v>

1289
01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:57.480
<v Speaker 1>defense for grappling defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Jujitsu and they can learn </v>

1290
01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.711
<v Speaker 1>submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably even more important </v>

1291
01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>way quicker than a regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so used to squeezing shit </v>

1292
01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:08.431
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're used to like constantly used to </v>

1293
01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>squeezing things in gripping and polling</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unlike Jujitsu with the GE,</v>

1294
01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>which relies a lot of it on grips and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's an entanglement factor that</v>

1295
01:04:14.711 --> 01:04:19.711
<v Speaker 1>you have to really take into account and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can really slow the game down that </v>

1296
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:19.711
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that with wrestling.</v>

1297
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing with wrestling's hip movement </v>

1298
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and hip control and spinning around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy room from hitting a easy reversal </v>

1299
01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:29.300
<v Speaker 2>just from popping down and back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1300
01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't wrestle,</v>

1301
01:04:30.441 --> 01:04:32.150
<v Speaker 2>you're not taking a wrestler down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1302
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:34.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's crazy sometimes watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1303
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:38.060
<v Speaker 2>high level fights and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I don't have,</v>

1304
01:04:38.061 --> 01:04:39.950
<v Speaker 2>obviously when we're a year at a live </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

1305
01:04:39.951 --> 01:04:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the audio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like sometimes I'm seeing what's</v>

1306
01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.000
<v Speaker 2>just a little thing that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
01:04:47.001 --> 01:04:50.390
<v Speaker 2>like for example like in de Asma Gregor </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1308
01:04:50.391 --> 01:04:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I remember a part where Diaz was trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take my.</v>

1309
01:04:53.231 --> 01:04:58.231
<v Speaker 2>Greg are down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his hips were above Mcgregor's who </v>

1310
01:04:58.231 --> 01:04:59.810
<v Speaker 2>had dropped his just lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if Diaz pops down and back up,</v>

1311
01:04:59.811 --> 01:05:01.400
<v Speaker 2>he's got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1312
01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:06.401
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff's happening at once and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can see it with wrestling </v>

1313
01:05:06.401 --> 01:05:10.331
<v Speaker 2>and it's just the difference in a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that sometimes the energy and the </v>

1314
01:05:10.331 --> 01:05:11.060
<v Speaker 2>emotions of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about,</v>

1315
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:12.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just being like,</v>

1316
01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.940
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drop down up and like,</v>

1317
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:14.360
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1318
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1319
01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1320
01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>very technique oriented and that's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that have never done any kind</v>

1321
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>of grappling don't understand when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching someone drive in,</v>

1322
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>when you see a beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go back to like,</v>

1323
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>who's got one of the best power doubles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably may Frankie Edgar's got one of </v>

1324
01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:39.691
<v Speaker 1>my favorite power doubles ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes a lot of motherfuckers down </v>

1325
01:05:39.691 --> 01:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>that'll really tough to take down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you watch as he enters into it,</v>

1326
01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:44.430
<v Speaker 1>there's such a flow to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1327
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>It's an aggressive attacking like George</v>
<v Speaker 1>St Pierre when George was in his prime.</v>

1328
01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do everybody's scared of that takedown </v>

1329
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That power double was coming.</v>

1330
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Josh Koscheck when early on in the sport</v>
<v Speaker 1>will Josh Koscheck had ridiculous power </v>

1331
01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and his in his takedowns just </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

1332
01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:01.750
<v Speaker 1>He would just drive through you.</v>

1333
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 2>It's so technical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one.</v>

1334
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:09.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole thing in wrestling is </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and quickness and all this </v>

1335
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:13.360
<v Speaker 2>stuff is so secondary to some dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll own you doing your own thing.</v>

1336
01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:15.280
<v Speaker 2>He'll wrestle Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1337
01:06:15.281 --> 01:06:20.281
<v Speaker 2>he'll just let you think that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to do something while these moves </v>

1338
01:06:20.281 --> 01:06:20.281
<v Speaker 2>ahead.</v>

1339
01:06:20.281 --> 01:06:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody should know that Yoel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romero is a real human being like that.</v>

1340
01:06:24.751 --> 01:06:27.990
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone should know.</v>

1341
01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Like when it comes to like what's what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>important about wrestling.</v>

1342
01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Yoel Romero is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what happens.</v>

1343
01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That's just what you have when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the elite is a leader.</v>

1344
01:06:37.821 --> 01:06:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Wrestlers you can get in a super athlete</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1345
01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

1346
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

1347
01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:46.020
<v Speaker 1>He decides whether you're going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean if you take them down?</v>

1348
01:06:46.021 --> 01:06:47.190
<v Speaker 1>It's luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1349
01:06:47.191 --> 01:06:52.191
<v Speaker 1>he might've been half ass that takedown </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense because he knows as soon as it </v>

1350
01:06:52.191 --> 01:06:52.950
<v Speaker 1>gets down and just fucking flip you over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stand back up again.</v>

1351
01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:55.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same kind of thing.</v>

1352
01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:01.280
<v Speaker 2>He's just way more athletic than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stronger than you.</v>

1353
01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.810
<v Speaker 2>They need to get into gonoodle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Workout with him,</v>

1354
01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:05.250
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1355
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>when the gun is way too heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately you're dealing with 85 </v>

1356
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>versus heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at 85.</v>

1357
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like trained to train with them.</v>

1358
01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:16.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a big guy to train with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so good.</v>

1359
01:07:16.561 --> 01:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's so good.</v>

1361
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:25.800
<v Speaker 1>He's knocked out with stunning accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke rockhold.</v>

1362
01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm Chris Weidman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1363
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1365
01:07:32.641 --> 01:07:35.670
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the Kennedy fight was marred by</v>

1366
01:07:35.671 --> 01:07:37.890
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can never ignore that.</v>

1367
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.390
<v Speaker 1>He did not come out for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1368
01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:45.410

<v Speaker 1>He did not come out for the for the end </v>

1369
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:48.420
<v Speaker 1>of the round and he was still sitting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stool and a day wasted.</v>

1370
01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:53.100
<v Speaker 1>All this time trying to give him more </v>
<v Speaker 1>chances to recover.</v>

1371
01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.400
<v Speaker 2>You have to be afraid of any guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders stick up like that.</v>

1372
01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.270

<v Speaker 2>It's like a King Cobra.</v>

01:08:01.101 --> 01:08:04.980
<v Speaker 2>How it like warns you with its wings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stopped up.</v>

1381
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.720

<v Speaker 1>Let me look at that again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right there with her and they'll show </v>

1384
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:31.761
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got blood all over his elbow.</v>

1385
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>The just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a crazy.</v>

1386
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.640
<v Speaker 1>His whole face is a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a crazy amount of force this </v>

1387
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>guy can generate and wrestling is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>another level man.</v>

1388
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.980
<v Speaker 1>He could do that to anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he fought Brad Tavares right there </v>

1390
01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.750
<v Speaker 1>and Brad [inaudible] stud and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were nowhere near the same </v>

1391
01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:58.550
<v Speaker 1>weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way you can handle them.</v>

1392
01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:05.490
<v Speaker 1>He's just so fucking powerful and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just shows you what a fucking Stud </v>

1393
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy almost had them.</v>

1394
01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.390
<v Speaker 1>The reason why he didn't come out for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was the third round when it</v>

1395
01:09:12.391 --> 01:09:14.890
<v Speaker 1>came out late was because by the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second,</v>

1396
01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Tim had them in deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep trouble.</v>

1397
01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Tim had caught him with a couple of big </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches and staggered them and so when,</v>

1398
01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:26.930
<v Speaker 1>when he went back to his corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that fucking shot that he lands </v>

1399
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:27.100
<v Speaker 1>when he knocks him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then another one,</v>

1400
01:09:27.610 --> 01:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>he just smashed them at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The craziest thing about Tim Kennedy is </v>

1401
01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:37.360
<v Speaker 1>he does all this and for a big chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his career he was a active military.</v>

1402
01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:40.780
<v Speaker 1>It's still fighting like that.</v>

1403
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all Ramiro is.</v>

1404
01:09:44.431 --> 01:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's him just smashing the ODA.</v>

1405
01:09:46.471 --> 01:09:51.471
<v Speaker 1>Machida he's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to get the next shot at </v>

1406
01:09:51.471 --> 01:09:52.170
<v Speaker 1>the middleweight title after you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked out luke rockhold.</v>

1407
01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe political knocked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing is knocked him </v>

1408
01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:01.641
<v Speaker 1>out like this is the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a guy who's like </v>

1409
01:10:01.641 --> 01:10:02.670
<v Speaker 1>one of the best wrestlers to ever fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>in mma and he's knocking people out,</v>

1410
01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:05.130
<v Speaker 1>standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaping in and crack and you would punch</v>

1411
01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>is hitting you at flying knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking out world champions.</v>

1412
01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Mikaela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Weidman with a flying knee.</v>

1413
01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:11.680
<v Speaker 1>He's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

1414
01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>he's on another level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real fucking monster athlete.</v>

1415
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a pleasure to get to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who has such fantastic technique</v>

1416
01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:30.230
<v Speaker 1>and physical attributes all combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his wrestling technique is just </v>

1417
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:33.370
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His timing's ridiculously good.</v>

1418
01:10:33.371 --> 01:10:36.240
<v Speaker 1>It's explosions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like to watch that,</v>

1419
01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's been around the sport for a </v>

1420
01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:41.540
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

1421
01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.260
<v Speaker 1>When a guy comes out and it just stands </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that hard,</v>

1422
01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1423
01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:47.850
<v Speaker 1>this guy is a real outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physically,</v>

1424
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.120
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make such a good progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn a few years.</v>

1425
01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he does decide to do that,</v>

1426
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:54.840
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would make an amazing one.</v>

1427
01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As he gets older.</v>

1428
01:10:56.970 --> 01:10:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

1429
01:10:57.730 --> 01:10:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Are they stretching them out here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1430
01:10:59.101 --> 01:11:01.590
<v Speaker 1>he's super fucking flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1431
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:06.120
<v Speaker 1>You mean he's a product of the Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling system and if you listen to my</v>

1432
01:11:06.121 --> 01:11:11.121
<v Speaker 1>podcast with Matt Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to plug that one more time </v>

1433
01:11:11.121 --> 01:11:14.601
<v Speaker 1>because I enjoy the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the MMA shows I did last </v>

1434
01:11:14.601 --> 01:11:18.260
<v Speaker 1>week with Matt Brown and he and I were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it and he's um,</v>

1435
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.780
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1436
01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:25.280
<v Speaker 1>he spent an entire six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in Cuba at one of his,</v>

1437
01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:30.281
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his training camps and the way these </v>

1438
01:11:30.281 --> 01:11:32.610
<v Speaker 1>people live and trained like they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are all in man.</v>

1439
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.480
<v Speaker 1>They're all in and there's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of talent over there,</v>

1440
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:41.481
<v Speaker 1>both in boxing and in judo as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

1441
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a big taekwondo team,</v>

1442
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:46.230
<v Speaker 1>like Cuba doesn't fuck around </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletically,</v>

1443
01:11:46.231 --> 01:11:49.110
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just to see a guy like that and</v>

1444
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:50.130
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1445
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:56.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a net 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would that guy have been like </v>

1446
01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 1>when he was 30?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

1447
01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:58.170
<v Speaker 1>He's 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 40.</v>

1448
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would he have been better if we'd </v>

1449
01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.181
<v Speaker 1>been faster now on top of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Whitaker's still beat them with a</v>

1450
01:12:05.611 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Speaker 1>blown out knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1451
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.070
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whitaker,</v>

1452
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shows you how amazing he is.</v>

1453
01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:16.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still managed to take takedowns of </v>

1454
01:12:16.551 --> 01:12:16.551
<v Speaker 1>the compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely blown out knee.</v>

1455
01:12:16.551 --> 01:12:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1456
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Whittaker is no fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a scary guy and he's getting </v>

1457
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:23.100
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Whitaker's is only like 27.</v>

1458
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is Robert Whitaker?</v>

1459
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.800
<v Speaker 1>That sounds about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the younger guys that's a </v>

1460
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.980
<v Speaker 1>world champion currently I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty seven.</v>

1461
01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's still growing and learning,</v>

1462
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:37.620
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy at at 30.</v>

1463
01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a world champion right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>at 30.</v>

1464
01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:41.340
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be better than he is right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1465
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:43.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to keep getting better.</v>

1466
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Another thing is your well didn't show </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the signs of pain from the Shin </v>

1467
01:12:50.151 --> 01:12:52.940
<v Speaker 2>injury that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of it too,</v>

1468
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not letting your opponent know what's</v>

1469
01:12:55.101 --> 01:13:00.101
<v Speaker 2>hurting you because I'm sure if rockhold</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew that he hurt his shin more than he </v>

1470
01:13:00.101 --> 01:13:04.661
<v Speaker 2>heard his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he would have kept picking away at </v>

1471
01:13:04.661 --> 01:13:04.661
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't let him know.</v>

1472
01:13:04.661 --> 01:13:07.160
<v Speaker 2>So it just seemed like he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting them with his leg kicks.</v>

1473
01:13:07.161 --> 01:13:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urls like,</v>

1474
01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does he like?</v>

1475
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful.</v>

1476
01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a super winter.</v>

1477
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:21.350
<v Speaker 1>He's what you would call a super winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1478
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>

1479
01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.440
<v Speaker 1>If you get these Olympic level athletes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had just been competing their whole</v>

1480
01:13:29.961 --> 01:13:32.660
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just not a win.</v>

1481
01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And when he learned at a strike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody just,</v>

1482
01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

1483
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:42.250
<v Speaker 1>You got this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only been a few guys that can </v>

1484
01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:42.250
<v Speaker 1>survive it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been able to survive it,</v>

1485
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:46.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most impressive one,</v>

1486
01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1487
01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:51.500
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

1488
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:54.230
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real wealth of talent right now</v>

1489
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:57.880
<v Speaker 2>going to say it's a very exciting time </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a UFC fan.</v>

1490
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:59.440
<v Speaker 2>It really is labeled bubble</v>

1491
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:04.330
<v Speaker 1>because like Robert Whitaker was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first guy to.</v>

1492
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Is he the first guy to beat in the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he is and I want to say </v>

1493
01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 1>that Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1494
01:14:13.811 --> 01:14:18.811
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of his really early mma fights </v>

1495
01:14:18.811 --> 01:14:21.940
<v Speaker 1>to fazio in strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

1496
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:27.130
<v Speaker 1>How fail content?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1497
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.830
<v Speaker 1>it's strikeforce Barnett versus a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Keratin off surrogate car off.</v>

1498
01:14:31.831 --> 01:14:35.260
<v Speaker 1>So that was like way back in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1499
01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of his first fights.</v>

1500
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 1>He lost that fight and he lost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whitticker so he hadn't lost since that.</v>

1501
01:14:40.661 --> 01:14:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faceoff fight,</v>

1502
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:47.710
<v Speaker 1>almost all knockouts and the only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has an asterisk right next to it is</v>

1503
01:14:47.711 --> 01:14:50.200
<v Speaker 1>the Tim Kennedy fight because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>def.</v>

1504
01:14:50.201 --> 01:14:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Definitely some fuckery there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely some,</v>

1505
01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.600
<v Speaker 1>some cheat and definitely stayed on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stool.</v>

1506
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 1>An extra few seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did they wind up staying on the</v>

1507
01:14:59.021 --> 01:15:04.021
<v Speaker 1>stool for extra?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to guess it was an extra 15 </v>

1508
01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:06.360
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that might be a.</v>

1509
01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.560
<v Speaker 4>What did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just chill for a bit.</v>

1510
01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Might've been less than 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1511
01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.140
<v Speaker 1>he just didn't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sat there.</v>

1512
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:14.100
<v Speaker 1>The end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:15:14.101 --> 01:15:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Dan was around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in there.</v>

1514
01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.210
<v Speaker 1>The corner was leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still sitting on a stool.</v>

1515
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Data oximetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty seconds.</v>

1516
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Thirty seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time.</v>

1517
01:15:21.931 --> 01:15:26.931
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking it was 15 and I was </v>

1518
01:15:26.931 --> 01:15:27.780
<v Speaker 1>thinking I might've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've been wrong.</v>

1519
01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It might have been 10.</v>

1520
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.980
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even try a trick like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>old spill.</v>

1521
01:15:30.981 --> 01:15:32.270
<v Speaker 4>The ice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that classic,</v>

1522
01:15:32.271 --> 01:15:33.440
<v Speaker 4>which I love so much.</v>

1523
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty seconds is a long time for guy to</v>

1524
01:15:36.561 --> 01:15:37.340
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could.</v>

1525
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:40.100
<v Speaker 1>He could have easily been code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have.</v>

1526
01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows because he's such a super </v>

1527
01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:45.190
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might've been able to rebound,</v>

1528
01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:46.910
<v Speaker 1>but he might not have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll never know</v>

1529
01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:51.980
<v Speaker 4>if you're taking 30 seconds you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking it because 20 seconds wasn't </v>

1530
01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:51.980
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

1531
01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's.</v>

1532
01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it would be an minute at that </v>

1533
01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.331
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a minute and 32nd break on top </v>

1534
01:16:00.331 --> 01:16:03.751
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a minute 30 for from the time </v>

1535
01:16:03.751 --> 01:16:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Tim was beating on him until the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>the round ends.</v>

1536
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.170
<v Speaker 1>He goes back to his corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly fucked up,</v>

1537
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.390
<v Speaker 1>and then he sits on the stool for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1538
01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a 100 percent of an and an </v>

1539
01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:15.420
<v Speaker 1>asterisk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asterisk.</v>

1540
01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever say that word right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asterisk asked her.</v>

1541
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It always sounds wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when George Bush used to say </v>

1542
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.550
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would say,</v>

1543
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:26.930
<v Speaker 1>especially the Vaseline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that have anything to do with it?</v>

1544
01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.810
<v Speaker 4>Sit on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they tried to get the trainer in and</v>

1545
01:16:29.811 --> 01:16:31.220
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't understand what they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

1546
01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this and this year.</v>

1547
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:34.830
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1548
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:37.310
<v Speaker 1>but he was sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was sitting there and they didn't.</v>

1549
01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And Tim Kennedy standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rounds over and he's got his arms up</v>

1550
01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:45.001
<v Speaker 1>there and see if you could play that on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You played out or they'll get us kicked </v>

1551
01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:45.001
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to find it.</v>

1552
01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

1553
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1554
01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:51.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next is name.</v>

1555
01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Where are you to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1556
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you know that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one a good can't take on 32nd </v>

1557
01:16:58.450 --> 01:16:58.780
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1558
01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.310
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1559
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.560
<v Speaker 1>and he wound up winning that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is man,</v>

1560
01:17:02.561 --> 01:17:05.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a that there's a major violation </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1561
01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:10.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant like not being ready for the </v>

1562
01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:14.891
<v Speaker 1>start of the next round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have the round starts like you </v>

1563
01:17:14.891 --> 01:17:18.851
<v Speaker 1>don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the referee doesn't want to stop the </v>

1564
01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:20.831
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to give it to your </v>

1565
01:17:20.831 --> 01:17:20.831
<v Speaker 1>opponent because you can't start the </v>
<v Speaker 1>round on time.</v>

1566
01:17:20.831 --> 01:17:23.660
<v Speaker 1>But he's in a terrible situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to fight to continue.</v>

1567
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:28.870
<v Speaker 1>But he also understands that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking unfair advantage here by just </v>

1568
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:29.120
<v Speaker 1>sitting here while you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in a contest.</v>

1569
01:17:29.121 --> 01:17:32.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a specified one minute break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've exceeded your one minute break.</v>

1570
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Therefore I must disqualify you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're stuck.</v>

1571
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:38.240
<v Speaker 1>They're stuck in no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be the party pooper.</v>

1572
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.410
<v Speaker 1>You just get Yowell up real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

1573
01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:44.750
<v Speaker 1>he's just in the 30 seconds later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He finally.</v>

1574
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.130
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

1575
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.370
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one,</v>

1576
01:17:49.371 --> 01:17:50.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was 30 seconds.</v>

1577
01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I really thought it was 15 or less.</v>

1578
01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.300
<v Speaker 1>But take that away because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unfortunate,</v>

1579
01:17:59.301 --> 01:18:04.301
<v Speaker 1>but shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take that away and you're looking at </v>

1580
01:18:04.301 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 1>just a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The freak of freaks to come in.</v>

1581
01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Here he is with Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1582
01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Joe is going to help translate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if everything,</v>

1583
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:20.830
<v Speaker 1>like if everything's going smooth or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he doesn't understand what I'm </v>

1584
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.830
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might turn to Joey and they'll,</v>

1585
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:21.880
<v Speaker 1>we'll abide by law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by law though.</v>

1586
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking throw their hands up.</v>

1587
01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just each other and shit.</v>

1588
01:18:25.221 --> 01:18:30.221
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll be back in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be surprised if you all can get these </v>

1589
01:18:30.221 --> 01:18:32.330
<v Speaker 1>headphones on over his shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

1590
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I know he's a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1591
01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much he wants to talk </v>

1592
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:40.790
<v Speaker 1>about his life in Cuba and what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1593
01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:45.810
<v Speaker 1>like wrestling there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would be utterly fascinated to </v>

1594
01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:45.810
<v Speaker 1>hear about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.160
<v Speaker 1>and to rise to the top of the heap in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that crazy shark tank of athletic talent</v>

1596
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and then go onto metal and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically every wrestling championship </v>

1597
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 1>that he entered into nationally.</v>

1598
01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just one of the freak of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaks.</v>

1599
01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating that those guys exist.</v>

1600
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's so important that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know because everybody has these ideas </v>

1601
01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.170
<v Speaker 1>in their head about like physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations and physical capabilities.</v>

1602
01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And then you see like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Walter Payton and you just go,</v>

1603
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:18.580
<v Speaker 1>oh whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1604
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:22.820
<v Speaker 1>how's this guy or Herschel Walker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Herschel Walker is a great example.</v>

1605
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.040
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see Herschel Walker run and you'd </v>

1606
01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:28.040
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1607
01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.220
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the person too crazy.</v>

1608
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:35.200
<v Speaker 1>How has that guy mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Herschel Walker to this day is super </v>

1609
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.521
<v Speaker 1>jacked and he's in his fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was him in his late forties </v>

1610
01:19:39.521 --> 01:19:39.710

<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1611

<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>

1613
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:47.630
<v Speaker 1>June 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two years ago.</v>

1614
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:49.400
<v Speaker 1>So now he's 56.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wants to fight against.</v>

1615
01:19:49.401 --> 01:19:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Still Open the rampage bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's open to a rampage.</v>

1616
01:19:52.731 --> 01:19:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so crazy.</v>

1617
01:19:54.651 --> 01:19:56.670
<v Speaker 1>He might win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1618
01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Hershel Walker's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another what?</v>

1619
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about another insane level</v>

1620
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.100
<v Speaker 1>of physical talent above and beyond.</v>

1621
01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:10.030
<v Speaker 2>He like all pushups only or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>for awhile</v>

1622
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.730
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of what he did.</v>

1623
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:16.760
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what he did was push ups and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of body weight exercises and he </v>

1624
01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.740
<v Speaker 1>didn't really necessarily lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

1625
01:20:19.741 --> 01:20:21.090
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might be telling the truth,</v>

1626
01:20:21.091 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like he looks like a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who lifts weights,</v>

1627
01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:30.740
<v Speaker 1>so vqv that jacked at 47 or 48 and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>lift weights.</v>

1628
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:35.790
<v Speaker 1>This was 2011 from this photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That picture?</v>

1629
01:20:35.791 --> 01:20:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1630
01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1631
01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:42.810
<v Speaker 1>not a young man and ridiculously ripped </v>
<v Speaker 1>and always has been.</v>

1632
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.140
<v Speaker 1>He's just as severe outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like there's brock lesnar.</v>

1633
01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:46.810

01:20:59.761 --> 01:21:00.760
<v Speaker 2>freshman record this and that led us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a national championship.</v>

1640
01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't even that tall probably.</v>

<v Speaker 2>would just keep running.</v>

1646
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.790
<v Speaker 2>He would just keep his legs moving and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he would run people over.</v>

1647
01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:16.840

01:22:34.071 --> 01:22:37.670
<v Speaker 1>They're playing big time ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a freak that guy,</v>

1676
01:22:37.671 --> 01:22:42.671
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think about him as a ww II guy </v>

1677
01:22:42.671 --> 01:22:43.460
<v Speaker 1>and then they think about him as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1678
01:22:43.461 --> 01:22:47.450
<v Speaker 1>fighting in the UFC and winning some </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and being this bad motherfucker,</v>

1679
01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:50.600
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know when he beat chain </v>
<v Speaker 1>car when.</v>

1680
01:22:50.601 --> 01:22:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a big fucking fight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to choke out Jane,</v>

1681
01:22:53.391 --> 01:22:58.391
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jane Corwin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what people don't realize is like </v>

1682
01:22:58.391 --> 01:23:00.830
<v Speaker 1>when he was an amateur wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a fucking monster.</v>

1683
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just his decision to go into the </v>

1684
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:06.520
<v Speaker 1>UFC late after you'd been doing pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

1685
01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.230
<v Speaker 1>People were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1686
01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

1687
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:14.071

<v Speaker 1>Athletes ever seen his nfl combine </v>

1688

1689
01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Can you see that Shit Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you could google is Shane car </v>

1690
01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:25.051
<v Speaker 1>when versus brock lesnar combine because</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody made a one of those images and </v>

1691
01:23:26.981 --> 01:23:30.250
<v Speaker 1>it showed their numbers similar height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar weight.</v>

1692
01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>PROC was a fucking freak</v>

1693
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:35.090
<v Speaker 2>can it shows in the wwe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1694
01:23:35.091 --> 01:23:35.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

1695
01:23:35.901 --> 01:23:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if it's fake,</v>

1696
01:23:37.821 --> 01:23:42.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because you can see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to all the other athletes,</v>

1697
01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:44.450
<v Speaker 2>some of them that only did that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire lives,</v>

1698
01:23:44.451 --> 01:23:49.451
<v Speaker 2>his hit this number of strides that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes longer and faster and you just see</v>

1699
01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:53.570
<v Speaker 2>him even from seat's far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see,</v>

1700
01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:58.930
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy is big and moving wave Jesus </v>

1701
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:02.500
<v Speaker 2>moving at the same speed as the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crazy luchador Mexican wrestlers </v>

1702
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:06.971
<v Speaker 2>were earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's that size with shoulders like </v>

1703
01:24:06.971 --> 01:24:06.971
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1704
01:24:06.971 --> 01:24:09.790
<v Speaker 1>He had what I would call a fractured mma</v>
<v Speaker 1>training that led him to the heavyweight</v>

1705
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:14.791
<v Speaker 1>champion and I say fractured that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He jumped right into the deep end and </v>

1706
01:24:16.061 --> 01:24:19.630
<v Speaker 1>won and beat guys like Randy coture beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like Frank Mir.</v>

1707
01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:24.631
<v Speaker 1>Shane Carwyn beats him worldclass guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he had started I think earlier in</v>

1708
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:31.050
<v Speaker 1>his life and learn how to strike and </v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

1709
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Got some of that in there first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there wasn't such an alien thing to </v>

1710
01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.481
<v Speaker 1>him when he was fighting in the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>leagues was really unlimited striking </v>

1711
01:24:39.481 --> 01:24:41.761
<v Speaker 1>for a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he learned that a strike from a real </v>

1712
01:24:41.761 --> 01:24:42.550
<v Speaker 1>technical instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was real tactical,</v>

1713
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:45.160
<v Speaker 1>instill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still had that wrestling ability when he</v>

1714
01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:45.850
<v Speaker 1>was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would.</v>

1715
01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck else is like that?</v>

1716
01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Who else is like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we got.</v>

1717
01:24:49.781 --> 01:24:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was in his thirties already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd been doing progress in a long time.</v>

1718
01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:55.330
<v Speaker 1>It beats the shit out of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think it's fake.</v>

1719
01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:00.480
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing fake about when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>flipped over the top rope and landed on </v>

1720
01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:00.550
<v Speaker 1>his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that one.</v>

1721
01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:01.750
<v Speaker 1>That salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1722
01:25:01.751 --> 01:25:03.640
<v Speaker 1>That's not fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try faking that.</v>

1723
01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Your debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are dead from that.</v>

1724
01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He survived and kept going with the </v>

1725
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.490
<v Speaker 1>wrestling moves like this is not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal athlete,</v>

1726
01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:15.340
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then one of those guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes along and if they can,</v>

1727
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:18.160
<v Speaker 1>if they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously brock was very tactical</v>

1728
01:25:18.161 --> 01:25:20.860
<v Speaker 1>when he was in high school and when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a young wrestler,</v>

1729
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:21.700
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>

1730
01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:27.300
<v Speaker 1>If you watch some of the videos of him </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was a younger guy who was </v>

1731
01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:27.490
<v Speaker 1>slightly smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was definitely a smaller guy,</v>

1732
01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:29.860
<v Speaker 1>but he still was a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1733
01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:32.410
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no getting around that genetics,</v>

1734
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's rare that a guy like that at </v>

1735
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:38.650
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1736
01:25:38.651 --> 01:25:43.651
<v Speaker 1>can reach the level where you seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoel Romero because like,</v>

1737
01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:49.450
<v Speaker 1>that's almost like another level even </v>
<v Speaker 1>past what brock's capable of doing.</v>

1738
01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Brock's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find Shane's numbers.</v>

1739
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:55.420
<v Speaker 1>40 yard dash time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four point seven.</v>

1740
01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Vertical jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 five standing long jump.</v>

1741
01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Ten feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1742
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 1>He can stand and jump 10 feet forward.</v>

1743
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.320
<v Speaker 7>And he's 265 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bench press,</v>

1744
01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.730
<v Speaker 7>225 pounds for 30 reps.</v>
<v Speaker 7>40 yard dash time.</v>

1745
01:26:10.731 --> 01:26:11.830
<v Speaker 7>Four point seven.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Vertical jump.</v>

1746
01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 7>What does this was a tune on the wire </v>
<v Speaker 7>repeated.</v>

1747
01:26:14.121 --> 01:26:14.930
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1748
01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:15.770
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I see.</v>

1749
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.930
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's.</v>

1750
01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.470
<v Speaker 7>That was the last APP was the bench </v>
<v Speaker 7>press?</v>

1751
01:26:18.471 --> 01:26:20.720
<v Speaker 7>Two hundred 25 pound bench press for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 7>reps.</v>

1752
01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:22.520
<v Speaker 7>that's a lot of fucking reps,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1753
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.260
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I know there's guys who do more than</v>

1754
01:26:27.261 --> 01:26:32.261
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a similar thing I could find was a </v>

1755
01:26:32.261 --> 01:26:34.630
<v Speaker 7>forum.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It said that Shane did like 43 reps on </v>

1756
01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:34.630
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I couldn't find it.</v>

1757
01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:34.630
<v Speaker 7>Stats.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1758
01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:38.000
<v Speaker 7>so you did more bench press.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is a world record in the combine or</v>

1759
01:26:38.001 --> 01:26:40.070
<v Speaker 7>how many times a guy can bench press?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Two,</v>

1760
01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:42.530
<v Speaker 7>25.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to guess 50.</v>

1761
01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.810
<v Speaker 7>Do you think your guy could do it 50 </v>
<v Speaker 7>times?</v>

1762
01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's probably some like giant 50 </v>

1763
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.110
<v Speaker 4>1:50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold Wow.</v>

1764
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Prices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1765
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:54.800
<v Speaker 4>Who is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't earnest.</v>

1766
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:55.590
<v Speaker 4>Justin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Earnest.</v>

1767
01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.260
<v Speaker 4>That mother fucker wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably some field goal kicker.</v>

1768
01:26:59.290 --> 01:27:02.740
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ just jacked the tits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Want to get it.</v>

1769
01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.450
<v Speaker 4>All I knew is kicked balls and a press </v>
<v Speaker 4>bench.</v>

1770
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:10.710
<v Speaker 7>Imagine if they just made field goal </v>
<v Speaker 7>kickers that are just giant Brock lesnar</v>

1771
01:27:10.711 --> 01:27:13.230
<v Speaker 7>style gorillas to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That'd be fun.</v>

1772
01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:18.740
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why couldn't those guys kicked just as </v>

1773
01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:18.740
<v Speaker 7>good or if not further and faster?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

1774
01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.010
<v Speaker 7>Kickers are always like you're not </v>
<v Speaker 7>supposed to hit them,</v>

1775
01:27:20.011 --> 01:27:20.760
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:26.320
<v Speaker 4>You can't hit the kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems so crazy.</v>

1777
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:28.390
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1778
01:27:28.391 --> 01:27:31.840
<v Speaker 4>You miss a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those guys don't care about you.</v>

1779
01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:34.810
<v Speaker 4>They'll stab you in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they just.</v>

1780
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:39.830
<v Speaker 4>There was no loyalty for the kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rest of the other guys hold each </v>

1781
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:40.900
<v Speaker 4>other up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From what I've read and understand,</v>

1782
01:27:40.901 --> 01:27:43.750
<v Speaker 4>it's like a depressing job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gotTa.</v>

1783
01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Be You don't.</v>

1784
01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.700
<v Speaker 7>You don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not a part of it.</v>

1785
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:48.470
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can't get hit it.</v>

1786
01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:50.960
<v Speaker 7>That's the one thing everybody's afraid </v>
<v Speaker 7>of and you can't get hit</v>

1787
01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:57.140
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The littlest stuff throws them off to </v>

1788
01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.231
<v Speaker 4>like in this last super bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they painted like the 25 yard line with </v>

1789
01:27:59.231 --> 01:28:02.010
<v Speaker 4>a special superbowl emblem and it messed</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys up because it's white,</v>

1790
01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.990
<v Speaker 4>so they're not used to kicking off </v>
<v Speaker 4>green.</v>

1791
01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:07.240
<v Speaker 7>Who was the first kicker?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is the designated kicker.</v>

1792
01:28:07.241 --> 01:28:10.270
<v Speaker 7>Is that always been the rule that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can't hit the guy who was the kicker?</v>

1793
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 4>Am I wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I know what I'm talking about that </v>

1794
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 4>you can't hit them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can definitely hit them.</v>

1795
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:20.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just can't hit them while they're </v>

1796
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:21.330
<v Speaker 4>kicking the ball so you can hit him </v>
<v Speaker 4>after the kick the ball while they're in</v>

1797
01:28:21.331 --> 01:28:26.331
<v Speaker 4>the process of kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't kick their leg unless you're </v>

1798
01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:26.331
<v Speaker 4>about to block it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you hit the ball,</v>

1799
01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:28.170
<v Speaker 4>you can actually then run into them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't block the ball then you</v>

1800
01:28:28.171 --> 01:28:33.171
<v Speaker 4>can't touch them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're reaching for the ball and </v>

1801
01:28:33.171 --> 01:28:33.270
<v Speaker 4>you've got to remember their legs coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>forward at a crazy fast rate,</v>

1802
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:37.140
<v Speaker 4>if you missed the ball and you hit them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by the way the rules crazy.</v>

1803
01:28:37.141 --> 01:28:42.141
<v Speaker 4>And the same goes for the punter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you hit them while their leg is </v>

1804
01:28:42.141 --> 01:28:43.410
<v Speaker 4>basically still in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge penalty.</v>

1805
01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.330
<v Speaker 4>Really huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is afterwards,</v>

1806
01:28:45.331 --> 01:28:47.310
<v Speaker 4>this guy as a punter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is pat McAfee,</v>

1807
01:28:47.311 --> 01:28:49.020
<v Speaker 4>he jacked up the sky on a punt return.</v>

1808
01:28:49.170 --> 01:28:51.990
<v Speaker 4>So like he's not afraid to go hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd fucked him up.</v>

1809
01:28:51.991 --> 01:28:56.991
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's probably out for three years after </v>

1810
01:28:56.991 --> 01:28:56.991
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows what he did illegal,</v>

1811
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not at all.</v>

1812
01:28:57.721 --> 01:28:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1813
01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.450
<v Speaker 4>He's just now part of the team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can go hit them,</v>

1814
01:29:00.451 --> 01:29:02.340
<v Speaker 4>but usually like quarterback,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to try to.</v>

1815
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:05.340
<v Speaker 4>He's the only punter on the team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to protect that guy.</v>

1816
01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.350
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Without a good kicker.</v>

1817
01:29:07.351 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 4>You had to go to somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1818
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.820
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy loved the football,</v>

1819
01:29:11.821 --> 01:29:12.340
<v Speaker 4>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:15.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's a high level chesting to.</v>

1821
01:29:15.121 --> 01:29:20.121
<v Speaker 4>There's 53 guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to break it down and then it's </v>

1822
01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:22.371
<v Speaker 4>all strategy and it's all pre snap </v>
<v Speaker 4>strategy because it's only five seconds </v>

1823
01:29:22.371 --> 01:29:26.451
<v Speaker 4>at a time and it's all setting this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to trick you like it's just </v>

1824
01:29:26.451 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 4>the guys up in the booth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old 50 year old men that think they know</v>

1825
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 4>a lot about football and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually go do it sorta like an mma,</v>

1826
01:29:31.891 --> 01:29:35.370
<v Speaker 4>like a Duke Roufus type guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Call things out.</v>

1827
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:37.790
<v Speaker 4>It's very strategic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very much chest.</v>

1828
01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:42.791
<v Speaker 4>And that's why bill belichick and Tom </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brady make it to the superbowl pretty </v>

1829
01:29:42.791 --> 01:29:43.050
<v Speaker 4>much every year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1830
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like with the UFC,</v>

1831
01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:47.790
<v Speaker 4>we've seen so many fights like any given</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sunday almost,</v>

1832
01:29:47.791 --> 01:29:48.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you made,</v>

1833
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:54.080
<v Speaker 4>made the same match 10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know it's not going to go that way </v>

1834
01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:54.080
<v Speaker 4>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1835
01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.731
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those guys have a way of figuring it </v>

1836
01:29:58.731 --> 01:29:59.640
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's crazy to see</v>

1837
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:05.090
<v Speaker 1>a pro football team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the planning that has to be in </v>

1838
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:09.621
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the monitoring of everybody's </v>

1839
01:30:09.621 --> 01:30:11.451
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the knowing what everyone's capable </v>

1840
01:30:11.451 --> 01:30:14.061
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the different strength and </v>

1841
01:30:14.061 --> 01:30:14.550
<v Speaker 1>conditioning routines must watch these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys perform and drills.</v>

1842
01:30:14.551 --> 01:30:17.220
<v Speaker 1>You must watch these guys complete and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get together.</v>

1843
01:30:17.221 --> 01:30:20.030
<v Speaker 1>All these people were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategize what's the best moves and the</v>

1844
01:30:20.031 --> 01:30:23.070
<v Speaker 1>quarterback's got to figure some shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and call things out in the field.</v>

1845
01:30:23.071 --> 01:30:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's really a fucking nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ganesh</v>

1846
01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:26.770
<v Speaker 4>can't throw money at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can throw money to fix any of those</v>

1847
01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.210
<v Speaker 4>problems they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1848
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:33.310
<v Speaker 4>and when you factor in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the times they're doing things </v>

1849
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:35.810
<v Speaker 4>just to set you up completely to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think like,</v>

1850
01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.980
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we saw them do that.</v>

1851
01:30:36.981 --> 01:30:39.080
<v Speaker 4>When we watched video with him play the </v>
<v Speaker 4>raiders.</v>

1852
01:30:39.081 --> 01:30:44.081
<v Speaker 4>They did this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this next play is gonna be this and </v>

1853
01:30:44.081 --> 01:30:44.081
<v Speaker 4>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

1854
01:30:44.081 --> 01:30:44.081
<v Speaker 4>Gone another touchdown.</v>

1855
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1856
01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:50.871
<v Speaker 1>That's just obviously the issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens to the players when they </v>

1857
01:30:50.871 --> 01:30:51.450
<v Speaker 1>get older?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder to watch it now,</v>

1858
01:30:51.451 --> 01:30:53.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem the same.</v>

1859
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like the same thing to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1860
01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Now it goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1861
01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds fucked up.</v>

1862
01:30:58.981 --> 01:31:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Coming from someone who's seen a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>

1863
01:31:00.481 --> 01:31:05.481
<v Speaker 1>but I just think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>

1864
01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It's all bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all bad to get hit that hard,</v>

1865
01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:12.570
<v Speaker 1>but in a fight there's a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that you could avoid getting</v>

1866
01:31:12.571 --> 01:31:17.571
<v Speaker 1>hit that hard if you're like a mighty </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouse or if you're like a GSP or you are</v>

1867
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:20.520
<v Speaker 1>a top of the food chain athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Jones,</v>

1868
01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.260
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get hit hard too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still getting around</v>

1869
01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:29.330
<v Speaker 4>the sell those tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like biggest hits of the NFL speed </v>

1870
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:32.080
<v Speaker 4>commercials on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a little tough to watch those </v>

1871
01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:32.080
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1872
01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that they're getting hit</v>

1873
01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.130
<v Speaker 1>harder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1874
01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:35.380
<v Speaker 1>They're getting into harder than a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1875
01:31:35.381 --> 01:31:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1876
01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:39.850
<v Speaker 1>the speed is so fast now that faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they were even five,</v>

1877
01:31:39.851 --> 01:31:41.230
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1878
01:31:41.231 --> 01:31:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some of those hits and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to imagine the difference between</v>

1879
01:31:45.131 --> 01:31:50.131
<v Speaker 1>that and like a punch or a kick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple magnitudes of power stronger.</v>

1880
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy's getting launched through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky with these hits.</v>

1881
01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they get launched,</v>

1882
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:58.670
<v Speaker 1>they lift off the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go fly,</v>

1883
01:31:58.671 --> 01:32:00.550
<v Speaker 1>and these 200 pound plus men,</v>

1884
01:32:00.690 --> 01:32:04.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure footballs worse because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's helmet to helmet,</v>

1885
01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:10.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's any Shin to skull </v>
<v Speaker 4>kick that could even compare to that </v>

1886
01:32:10.230 --> 01:32:14.461
<v Speaker 4>because the brain is hitting the inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your skull if you're receiving that </v>

1887
01:32:14.461 --> 01:32:18.271
<v Speaker 4>hit and I don't think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless another guy is wearing a helmet </v>

1888
01:32:18.271 --> 01:32:21.841
<v Speaker 4>running at you at full speed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're running the </v>

1889
01:32:21.841 --> 01:32:22.300
<v Speaker 4>direction that he's in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

1890
01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean it just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like two cars hitting head on.</v>

1891
01:32:25.211 --> 01:32:30.211
<v Speaker 4>If you've seen the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a car accident in a head on car </v>

1892
01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:33.691
<v Speaker 4>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens to the dummy and what </v>

1893
01:32:33.691 --> 01:32:33.691
<v Speaker 4>happens to people like it's night and </v>
<v Speaker 4>day first play.</v>

1894
01:32:33.691 --> 01:32:34.900
<v Speaker 4>Here is the very first play of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest hits.</v>

1895
01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And launch this.</v>

1896
01:32:36.781 --> 01:32:41.370
<v Speaker 4>The Guy Stars Jesus Christ</v>

1897
01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:43.860
<v Speaker 1>probably knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:32:43.861 --> 01:32:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine a lot of guys get </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>

1899
01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1900
01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:52.040
<v Speaker 1>they say that some concussions happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>from getting hit in the chest that we </v>

1901
01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:52.410
<v Speaker 1>always thought about concussions or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

1902
01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.370
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got hit in the head,</v>

1903
01:32:53.371 --> 01:32:55.650
<v Speaker 1>you got a concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know until fairly recently.</v>

1904
01:32:55.651 --> 01:33:00.651
<v Speaker 1>That's how stupid I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that you can get a </v>

1905
01:33:00.651 --> 01:33:02.040
<v Speaker 1>concussion from getting hit to the body </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you get hit in the body,</v>

1906
01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:07.160
<v Speaker 1>your brain jostled around just as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different scene than the </v>

1907
01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.340
<v Speaker 1>hemorrhaging in the brain that you often</v>
<v Speaker 1>get from local trauma.</v>

1908
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:13.380
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1909
01:33:13.670 --> 01:33:18.670
<v Speaker 1>People fall and hit their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just getting kicked to the body </v>

1910
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:20.790
<v Speaker 1>fucks your brain up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's crazy.</v>

1911
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not just hitting right on the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which definitely does it too,</v>

1912
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:30.660
<v Speaker 1>but guys get their brains rattled from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick to the body for sure,</v>

1913
01:33:30.661 --> 01:33:33.600
<v Speaker 1>for a take down for sure for football.</v>

1914
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:36.020
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's had a bad one in a wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>match.</v>

1915
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:41.050
<v Speaker 4>In high school I got stuck like in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>embridge and the guy had me in like a </v>

1916
01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:43.880
<v Speaker 4>head scissors and he snapped it back </v>
<v Speaker 4>real hard and my head hit the mat.</v>

1917
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:46.550
<v Speaker 4>I woke up with Puke on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was still,</v>

1918
01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:51.290
<v Speaker 4>I was still on my back in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mat and night qct like projectile,</v>

1919
01:33:51.291 --> 01:33:54.890
<v Speaker 4>like pop up cold and cold and puked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's dangerous man.</v>

1920
01:33:54.891 --> 01:33:58.160
<v Speaker 4>He could choke on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one time I had to go straight</v>

1921
01:33:58.161 --> 01:34:03.140
<v Speaker 4>to a hospital in the ambulance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Football</v>

1922
01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:07.200
<v Speaker 1>is probably the most impact because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're both running,</v>

1923
01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:10.650
<v Speaker 1>so guys running at you full clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That never happens in wrestling.</v>

1924
01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:12.390
<v Speaker 1>It was never like running at you.</v>

1925
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:15.850
<v Speaker 4>This is the hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This Guy Ryan shazier number 50.</v>

1926
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:20.910
<v Speaker 4>He has a normal tackle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he is just now getting the feeling </v>

1927
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:22.600
<v Speaker 4>back in his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This happened about six months ago.</v>

1928
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1929
01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freak accident and his spine on a normal</v>

1930
01:34:29.771 --> 01:34:31.330
<v Speaker 4>tackle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Normal everyday tasks.</v>

1931
01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:32.270
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.320
<v Speaker 4>This happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like play,</v>

1933
01:34:35.321 --> 01:34:39.790
<v Speaker 4>like that can happen like that on any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any given five seconds of an NFL game,</v>

1934
01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:42.340
<v Speaker 4>a player like that can have his life </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

1935
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:47.430
<v Speaker 4>And that's a net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another freak athlete from the Ohio </v>

1936
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:48.460
<v Speaker 4>State University that's been one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>top line backers every year.</v>

1937
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's um,</v>

1938
01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:54.800
<v Speaker 1>it's super unfortunate that the body so </v>
<v Speaker 1>goddamn brittle,</v>

1939
01:34:55.370 --> 01:35:00.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's also one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes so fascinating when you see what </v>

1940
01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:00.370
<v Speaker 1>these guys capable of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1941
01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:04.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a brief window like the </v>

1942
01:35:04.851 --> 01:35:04.851
<v Speaker 1>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going on right now.</v>

1943
01:35:04.851 --> 01:35:07.880
<v Speaker 1>This is a brief window where someone can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be good as a Michael Phelps,</v>

1944
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:08.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1945
01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:13.710
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many years do you have where you </v>

1946
01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:13.710
<v Speaker 1>could just dominate swimming like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got 10.</v>

1947
01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that real?</v>

1948
01:35:14.781 --> 01:35:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was 15.</v>

1949
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

1950
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.190
<v Speaker 1>How long can you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely can't keep it up forever.</v>

1951
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like when does everything just fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart?</v>

1952
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:26.770
<v Speaker 1>So when you're watching someone who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do crazy shit with their body and then </v>

1953
01:35:26.770 --> 01:35:28.970
<v Speaker 1>you see a tackle like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that leads to a guy being paralyzed,</v>

1954
01:35:28.971 --> 01:35:33.971
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck dude,</v>

1955
01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:36.620
<v Speaker 1>that's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1956
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:41.120
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you want it to change</v>

1957
01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.380
<v Speaker 4>football?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1958
01:35:43.381 --> 01:35:45.660
<v Speaker 4>I think they should have a big balloon </v>
<v Speaker 4>helmets on.</v>

1959
01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Big silly looking super soft bouncy </v>
<v Speaker 4>helmets.</v>

1960
01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Would you want it to change?</v>

1961
01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:58.080
<v Speaker 6>I've been thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's going to change a little </v>

1962
01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:58.080
<v Speaker 6>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean if you were the commissioner.</v>

1963
01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:58.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1964
01:35:58.720 --> 01:35:59.650
<v Speaker 1>said young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

1965
01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you seem to know what the fuck you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1966
01:36:01.451 --> 01:36:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Would you please do us a favor and tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>us how to run this football thing?</v>

1967
01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's things they.</v>

1968
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:10.790
<v Speaker 6>I think they could do to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's stronger helmets they could </v>

1969
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:12.921
<v Speaker 6>probably be using.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if that would have helped </v>

1970
01:36:12.921 --> 01:36:15.141
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could probably have some more </v>

1971
01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:15.141
<v Speaker 6>protection.</v>

1972
01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:15.141
<v Speaker 4>The technology's probably around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>corner.</v>

1973
01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:18.010
<v Speaker 4>It's probably like some type of weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>airbag in a helmet that they're going to</v>

1974
01:36:18.011 --> 01:36:19.780
<v Speaker 4>end up getting or something weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1975
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:21.690
<v Speaker 4>like maybe a decelerator or something.</v>

1976
01:36:21.730 --> 01:36:26.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like that that absorbs the impact </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hit on your head so that it </v>

1977
01:36:26.730 --> 01:36:30.111
<v Speaker 1>doesn't snap you back though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conventional wisdom is that the </v>

1978
01:36:30.111 --> 01:36:34.170
<v Speaker 1>helmets actually make it worse because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can hit each other much harder.</v>

1979
01:36:34.230 --> 01:36:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like they get more damaged than </v>
<v Speaker 1>a rugby player gets rugby players </v>

1980
01:36:39.230 --> 01:36:42.981
<v Speaker 1>because they know there's no padding </v>
<v Speaker 1>there not doing the same kind of crazy </v>

1981
01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:45.861
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires different techniques if you </v>

1982
01:36:45.861 --> 01:36:48.561
<v Speaker 1>want to have a career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just mean in rugby's obviously </v>

1983
01:36:48.561 --> 01:36:50.010
<v Speaker 1>they get down and dirty and it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tough game,</v>

1984
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.890
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1985
01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do a totally different thing</v>

1986
01:36:54.061 --> 01:36:59.061
<v Speaker 1>when you're not padded up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you watch their scrims and </v>

1987
01:36:59.061 --> 01:37:00.270
<v Speaker 1>you watch some of the crazy physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>altercations they have,</v>

1988
01:37:00.271 --> 01:37:02.370
<v Speaker 1>it looks more like running and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

1989
01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.100
<v Speaker 1>There's like a lot of wrestling involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a football,</v>

1990
01:37:05.101 --> 01:37:10.101
<v Speaker 1>it's just this like fucking chaos of </v>
<v Speaker 1>colliding bodies and people fucking </v>

1991
01:37:10.101 --> 01:37:12.480
<v Speaker 1>smashing into people and jumping over </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and</v>

1992
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:18.170
<v Speaker 6>I just feel listened to that NPR episode</v>
<v Speaker 6>about football and how it started and </v>

1993
01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:21.741
<v Speaker 6>that's how football used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It used to just be two people or two </v>

1994
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:24.801
<v Speaker 6>teams would line up and they just run </v>
<v Speaker 6>into each other and scrum and just </v>

1995
01:37:24.801 --> 01:37:24.870
<v Speaker 6>slowly move the ball down the field </v>
<v Speaker 6>slowly,</v>

1996
01:37:24.871 --> 01:37:25.560
<v Speaker 6>slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>slowly.</v>

1997
01:37:25.561 --> 01:37:29.040
<v Speaker 6>And then eventually as time went by,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they started adding the past and things.</v>

1998
01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:34.041
<v Speaker 6>And now it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The NFL is literally just passed the </v>

1999
01:37:34.041 --> 01:37:34.041
<v Speaker 6>ball for as many touchdowns as you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>get.</v>

2000
01:37:34.050 --> 01:37:39.050
<v Speaker 6>Hopefully nobody gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ian Edwards is trying to turn me into a </v>

2001
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:39.050
<v Speaker 6>soccer fan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it just didn't take.</v>

2002
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:39.050
<v Speaker 6>Ha Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ha ha.</v>

2003
01:37:40.650 --> 01:37:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Me and him at a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He showed me like some super important </v>

2004
01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:48.201
<v Speaker 1>game and I'm just mocking him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking him and making fun of the whole </v>

2005
01:37:48.201 --> 01:37:48.201
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2006
01:37:48.201 --> 01:37:52.230
<v Speaker 4>I could see you being a pro wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>fan before being a soccer fan for sure.</v>

2007
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:53.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2008
01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I've stated numerous occasions.</v>

2009
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.630
<v Speaker 9>I'm a huge ric flair fan.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2010
01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I love that.</v>

2011
01:37:59.270 --> 01:38:01.370
<v Speaker 9>If any of their babies,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm a huge.</v>

2012
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.230
<v Speaker 9>I love the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think the rock is awesome.</v>

2013
01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:08.310
<v Speaker 9>I go to see all his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to see Jumanji twice.</v>

2014
01:38:08.410 --> 01:38:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I got star struck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2015
01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.970
<v Speaker 2>I met Ric Flair at the airport after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>royal rumble.</v>

2016
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 2>It was so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our flight had just gotten delayed on </v>

2017
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:19.060
<v Speaker 2>the tarmac and then canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get deep boarded.</v>

2018
01:38:19.690 --> 01:38:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else is waiting at the desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2019
01:38:21.761 --> 01:38:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to the customer service </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of this airline.</v>

2020
01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I know how this crap works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a long line,</v>

2021
01:38:27.551 --> 01:38:32.551
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to the customer service </v>

2022
01:38:32.551 --> 01:38:34.471
<v Speaker 2>and I'm walking by myself and there he </v>
<v Speaker 2>is walking straight at me by himself and</v>

2023
01:38:36.731 --> 01:38:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I literally like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm getting closer,</v>

2024
01:38:39.101 --> 01:38:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not flair.</v>

2025
01:38:39.970 --> 01:38:44.350
<v Speaker 2>That's not very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's out of my face comes nature boy.</v>

2026
01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:46.180
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man.</v>

2027
01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2028
01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:50.530
<v Speaker 9>hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I follow him on instagram.</v>

2029
01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:56.670
<v Speaker 9>I follow him on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if I do follow on good </v>

2030
01:38:56.670 --> 01:38:56.670
<v Speaker 9>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I follow him on instagram.</v>

2031
01:38:56.670 --> 01:38:58.360
<v Speaker 9>Best Man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just a legend.</v>

2032
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:59.980
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

2033
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.730
<v Speaker 9>it's like stuff like that that I enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 9>about pro wrestling.</v>

2034
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:06.160
<v Speaker 9>That's what I enjoyed the most </v>
<v Speaker 9>ridiculous aspects of it.</v>

2035
01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:11.190
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like I was a big fan of Jimmy superfly </v>

2036
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:13.441
<v Speaker 9>snuck back in the day because it was </v>
<v Speaker 9>just so ridiculous that he would always </v>

2037
01:39:13.441 --> 01:39:16.681
<v Speaker 9>wind up on the top rope,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what some guy unconscious underneath </v>

2038
01:39:16.681 --> 01:39:17.620
<v Speaker 9>them and he would fly through the air </v>
<v Speaker 9>land dot.</v>

2039
01:39:17.621 --> 01:39:19.060
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and we were always pumped about it.</v>

2040
01:39:19.630 --> 01:39:22.090
<v Speaker 9>So silly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's a lot of fun stuff happening.</v>

2041
01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:25.210
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the man,</v>

2042
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:28.420
<v Speaker 9>the natch,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the nature.</v>

2043
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:34.540
<v Speaker 9>I used to be a fan of Bob backlund.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You remember Bob Course.</v>

2044
01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.310
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he's a no nonsense guy,</v>

2045
01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:39.700
<v Speaker 9>a no nonsense guy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's how I felt about him.</v>

2046
01:39:39.701 --> 01:39:44.701
<v Speaker 9>I felt he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to me like what embodied and actual </v>

2047
01:39:44.701 --> 01:39:48.121
<v Speaker 9>wrestler versus like the progress </v>
<v Speaker 9>underneath stuck out like a sore thumb </v>

2048
01:39:48.121 --> 01:39:49.510
<v Speaker 9>because he did like the progress </v>
<v Speaker 9>something but not really.</v>

2049
01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:54.660
<v Speaker 9>What he basically did is just engulf you</v>
<v Speaker 9>on the ground and hit you with some </v>

2050
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:59.101
<v Speaker 9>ridiculous real wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then you're not really prepared for is </v>

2051
01:39:59.101 --> 01:39:59.101
<v Speaker 9>finished.</v>

2052
01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Move fucking hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cross face chicken wing.</v>

2053
01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 9>See?</v>
<v Speaker 9>He was just,</v>

2054
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:07.380
<v Speaker 9>for whatever reason he did wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 9>appreciated and it hurts.</v>

2055
01:40:07.381 --> 01:40:09.840
<v Speaker 9>He was two normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Didn't appreciate him enough.</v>

2056
01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:14.040
<v Speaker 9>The figure four hertz in real life too.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They figure four leg lock.</v>

2057
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.710
<v Speaker 9>Is that a real thing?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's a little flare.</v>

2058
01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:17.700
<v Speaker 9>Invented it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

2059
01:40:17.701 --> 01:40:18.450
<v Speaker 9>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I'm saying.</v>

2060
01:40:18.451 --> 01:40:19.500
<v Speaker 9>Is it a real submission?</v>

2061
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.520
<v Speaker 2>It look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the only catch.</v>

2062
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:26.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a real submission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the person has to basically let you </v>

2063
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.550
<v Speaker 2>put them in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see</v>

2064
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:28.650
<v Speaker 9>it or do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 9>They have to be completely unconscious,</v>

2065
01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:32.940
<v Speaker 9>but Bob Backlund,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I had you back buddy back in high school</v>

2066
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:38.390
<v Speaker 9>when all the other kids were.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They only liked the superfly and then </v>

2067
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.790
<v Speaker 9>hulk Hogan or it is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Here it is.</v>

2068
01:40:38.791 --> 01:40:41.340
<v Speaker 9>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 9>See you after all the way around.</v>

2069
01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.300
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let me see this.</v>

2070
01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:43.920
<v Speaker 9>See,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is the part they have to be like,</v>

2071
01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:46.830
<v Speaker 9>what are you doing on?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let me see this drops.</v>

2072
01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.570
<v Speaker 9>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's totally legit.</v>

2073
01:40:48.650 --> 01:40:49.230
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>dude,</v>

2074
01:40:49.231 --> 01:40:51.330
<v Speaker 9>if you can get a guy into that position,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that shit will hurt.</v>

2075
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 9>If you get a guy like Gordon Ryan puts </v>
<v Speaker 9>you in something</v>

2076
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.120
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for fun.</v>

2077
01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck your legs up,</v>

2078
01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:59.410
<v Speaker 1>but here's a go back to it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a good position for a</v>

2079
01:40:59.411 --> 01:41:02.230
<v Speaker 1>couple reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like right there.</v>

2080
01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It's good if you can get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can get to that,</v>

2081
01:41:05.291 --> 01:41:09.130
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the catch dop in him.</v>

2082
01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what's stopping him from </v>
<v Speaker 1>scooting his butt towards that guy's </v>

2083
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.350
<v Speaker 1>right leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the catch is that if you can roll</v>

2084
01:41:17.351 --> 01:41:19.270
<v Speaker 1>over while you're in the figure four leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>lock,</v>

2085
01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it completely reverses the polars of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2086
01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:24.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the earth.</v>

2087
01:41:24.730 --> 01:41:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Pain of the pain ric flair with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2088
01:41:29.591 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 1>let me see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2089
01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.430
<v Speaker 1>that's also true in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tested that.</v>

2090
01:41:33.610 --> 01:41:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is like the position </v>

2091
01:41:38.610 --> 01:41:38.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

2092
01:41:38.610 --> 01:41:43.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a natural way to defend it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like the guys defending </v>

2093
01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:43.230
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2094
01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:43.240
<v Speaker 1>That's why like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

2095
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to keep them from putting it</v>

2096
01:41:45.101 --> 01:41:45.520
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2097
01:41:45.521 --> 01:41:47.710
<v Speaker 1>he stepped on his dick because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepping on his deck a little bit.</v>

2098
01:41:47.770 --> 01:41:49.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the undertaker allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to.</v>

2099
01:41:49.451 --> 01:41:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a short legs down.</v>

2100
01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a heel hook.</v>

2101
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy.</v>

2102
01:41:54.630 --> 01:41:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's the why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so fucking stupid.</v>

2103
01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The guy who's getting his leg kranked is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the guy who's in the best </v>

2104
01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in a heel hook position.</v>

2105
01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could just grab his leg.</v>

2106
01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:09.691
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who's supposed to be getting hurt </v>

2107
01:42:09.691 --> 01:42:09.691
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually the guy in black.</v>

2108
01:42:09.691 --> 01:42:10.330
<v Speaker 1>The guy in black is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2109
01:42:10.331 --> 01:42:12.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy in the better position,</v>

2110
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:17.500
<v Speaker 1>all he has to do is reach back with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>right arm and hook time at elbow onto </v>

2111
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:17.620
<v Speaker 1>the ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2112
01:42:17.621 --> 01:42:18.780

<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

2113
01:42:18.781 --> 01:42:20.440
<v Speaker 1>This is not a figure four leg lock.</v>

2114
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:22.180
<v Speaker 1>This is embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a heel hook.</v>

2115
01:42:22.181 --> 01:42:24.760
<v Speaker 1>He's given them a heel hook and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other guys pretending he's in pain.</v>

2116
01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:27.190
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't even a figure.</v>

2117
01:42:27.191 --> 01:42:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Four leg lock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what this is?</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's got a fucking heel hook.</v>

2121
01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Take the look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

2122
01:42:36.101 --> 01:42:41.101
<v Speaker 1>You go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You clap your hands together and the </v>

2123
01:42:41.101 --> 01:42:43.261
<v Speaker 1>match is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's 100 percent over in real </v>

2124
01:42:43.261 --> 01:42:43.261
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2125
01:42:43.261 --> 01:42:43.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are they doing that?</v>

2126
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:46.120
<v Speaker 1>What did they do at winners or losers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets a trophy.</v>

2127
01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You show in a terrible position.</v>

2128
01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:51.550
<v Speaker 1>The guy in white isn't trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

2129
01:42:52.730 --> 01:42:54.340
<v Speaker 1>What was the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2130
01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I broke up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2131
01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:57.910
<v Speaker 1>the other guys doing it wrong for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole fucking time.</v>

2132
01:42:58.190 --> 01:43:01.190
<v Speaker 1>This finger for here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one maybe.</v>

2133
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one steps over.</v>

2134
01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

2135
01:43:04.361 --> 01:43:06.250
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of work to get someone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

2136
01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2137
01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what that is.</v>

2138
01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks painful.</v>

2139
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:13.390
<v Speaker 1>To go back to that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say that again.</v>

2140
01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same thing.</v>

2141
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Go back the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2142
01:43:18.650 --> 01:43:18.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2143
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:21.070
<v Speaker 1>One a little bit further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little bit further back.</v>

2144
01:43:21.071 --> 01:43:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta see the setup.</v>

2145
01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I got to see the setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2146
01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Steps over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guy is basically triangling </v>

2147
01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:32.491
<v Speaker 1>his lower leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy in the bottoms in a better </v>

2148
01:43:32.491 --> 01:43:32.491
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is nonsense.</v>

2149
01:43:32.491 --> 01:43:33.040
<v Speaker 1>The guy in the bottom fed his leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the center,</v>

2150
01:43:33.041 --> 01:43:34.720
<v Speaker 1>which is the worst thing he could've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done right there.</v>

2151
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.060
<v Speaker 1>He had a triangle on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have fed it.</v>

2152
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:42.510
<v Speaker 1>He should have tried to go through the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have fucking swept that guy </v>

2153
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.510
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me say it one more time.</v>

2154
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:45.820
<v Speaker 1>One more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See this guy stepping over and then this</v>

2155
01:43:45.821 --> 01:43:47.860
<v Speaker 1>guy could just triangle that leg right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2156
01:43:47.861 --> 01:43:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Why is he doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He let him put it in the center.</v>

2157
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Even if you let them put it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

2158
01:43:52.650 --> 01:43:56.210
<v Speaker 5>he supposed to move as soon as that guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>spins and then you're free.</v>

2159
01:43:57.110 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 5>He should have wound up on top there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2160
01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:02.090
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a true figure is John.</v>

2161
01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.130
<v Speaker 5>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

2162
01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.590
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might hurt.</v>

2163
01:44:07.050 --> 01:44:08.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd probably hurt if a guy,</v>

2164
01:44:08.691 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 5>a big gorilla like John Cena got you in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that shit,</v>

2165
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.810
<v Speaker 5>but you have to be almost dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2166
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:18.260
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To be able to do all that shit.</v>

2167
01:44:18.261 --> 01:44:19.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might be able to do it to me.</v>

2168
01:44:19.521 --> 01:44:20.980
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2169
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:22.670
<v Speaker 5>If size,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2170
01:44:22.671 --> 01:44:26.060
<v Speaker 5>if anybody ever hit a figure four leg </v>
<v Speaker 5>lock in a real fight,</v>

2171
01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:29.570
<v Speaker 5>like that would be the most watched </v>
<v Speaker 5>worldstar video ever.</v>

2172
01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.390
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is today,</v>

2173
01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.100
<v Speaker 5>well Johnson have reversed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 5>that's actual real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's real as fuck.</v>

2175
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.100
<v Speaker 5>That hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like hell.</v>

2176
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:42.310
<v Speaker 5>What he's doing is he's fucking that </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy's knee up and he's cranking on his </v>

2177
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:43.190
<v Speaker 5>neck at the same time and and under his </v>
<v Speaker 5>nose.</v>

2178
01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:45.800
<v Speaker 5>The inside of this row.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can tap now.</v>

2179
01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:47.360
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've always been able to tap.</v>

2180
01:44:47.361 --> 01:44:49.550
<v Speaker 5>That's the whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how ric flair beats people.</v>

2181
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:54.610

<v Speaker 5>he thought that you can count it out </v>

2182
01:44:54.610 --> 01:44:54.880
<v Speaker 5>when you pin the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one way that submission,</v>

2183
01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.950
<v Speaker 5>it's a new thing counts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long have they been?</v>

2184
01:44:57.690 --> 01:45:02.690
<v Speaker 5>There's disqualification coutts tap outs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if the ref hits the mat three times </v>

2185
01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:09.011
<v Speaker 5>with his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long have they been tapping out </v>

2186
01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:09.011
<v Speaker 5>forever?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For the beginning.</v>

2187
01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:10.670
<v Speaker 5>Bob Backlund who you mentioned?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2188
01:45:10.690 --> 01:45:15.690
<v Speaker 5>it's cross faced chicken length.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If submission only matches like run for </v>

2189
01:45:15.690 --> 01:45:19.110
<v Speaker 5>45,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did they have them back in the superfly </v>

2190
01:45:19.110 --> 01:45:19.110
<v Speaker 5>days with the iron sheik?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2191

<v Speaker 5>Camel Clutch hurts in real life too.</v>

2193
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:26.490
<v Speaker 5>I blocked that out of my memory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mandible calls one of the best.</v>

2194
01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:28.010
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird thing to block out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your memory,</v>

2195
01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:30.080
<v Speaker 5>like why did I block out the tap outs?</v>

2196
01:45:30.110 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 5>Because you have not wanted to be a pro </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling fan.</v>

2197
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:36.410
<v Speaker 5>You have been in denial of your love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

2198
01:45:36.411 --> 01:45:41.411
<v Speaker 5>This is the mandible cloth from mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man Puts a sock on his hand and then </v>

2199
01:45:41.411 --> 01:45:45.550
<v Speaker 5>shoves his two fingers underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 5>underneath your tongue and then squeezes</v>

2200
01:45:46.821 --> 01:45:51.040
<v Speaker 5>his thumb underneath your chin in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>space and tries to connect.</v>

2201
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:53.630
<v Speaker 5>What do they call that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The mandible claw.</v>

2202
01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.890
<v Speaker 5>But at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2203
01:45:56.010 --> 01:45:59.540
<v Speaker 5>it was a Mr Soco when he was working </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a rock and they had the rock.</v>

2204
01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:01.950
<v Speaker 5>You're fucking wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2205
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:04.310
<v Speaker 5>So he's got a sock puppet on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He stuffs it in your mouth.</v>

2206
01:46:04.311 --> 01:46:07.040
<v Speaker 5>He keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he keeps the sock in his underwear until</v>

2207
01:46:07.041 --> 01:46:09.670
<v Speaker 5>it's time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when he gets you down,</v>

2208
01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:13.350
<v Speaker 5>the crowd goes crazy and he's pulling </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2209
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:17.390
<v Speaker 5>Boss pulls the sock out and lifts it up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that crowd goes insane.</v>

2210
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:22.550
<v Speaker 5>That is the dumbest and most awesome </v>
<v Speaker 5>Diaz at the same time,</v>

2211
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:25.610
<v Speaker 5>the dumbest and most awesome thing at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same time.</v>

2212
01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:27.230
<v Speaker 5>Heck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That kind of shit.</v>

2213
01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.820
<v Speaker 5>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2214
01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:30.290
<v Speaker 5>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

2215
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:32.660
<v Speaker 5>But the thing about pro wrestling is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that a lot of people,</v>

2216
01:46:32.661 --> 01:46:35.150
<v Speaker 5>myself included,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want to enjoy it.</v>

2217
01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:38.090
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to let go for something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

2218
01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:41.180
<v Speaker 5>I think you were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you were like perhaps weeks away</v>

<v Speaker 5>issues.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2242
01:47:42.301 --> 01:47:44.220
<v Speaker 4>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They give you just like UFC.</v>

2243
01:47:44.221 --> 01:47:48.120
<v Speaker 4>They give you a little breakdown before </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have their own Joe Rogan type who's</v>

2244
01:47:48.150 --> 01:47:48.760
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2245
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.740
<v Speaker 4>doing the voiceover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's why this person's like this.</v>

2246
01:47:52.050 --> 01:47:54.480
<v Speaker 4>The technical side of things like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>do a cool like,</v>

2247
01:47:54.481 --> 01:47:59.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little background and explanation </v>

2248
01:47:59.481 --> 01:47:59.481
<v Speaker 4>before so you can catch up quick and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden,</v>

2249
01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're watching.</v>

2250
01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:06.660
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that seems interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the possibility of that is that it</v>

2251
01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:12.730
<v Speaker 1>to me is I'm an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've overdosed on reality.</v>

2252
01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's pawn shows or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is that's on tv,</v>

2253
01:48:18.701 --> 01:48:22.720
<v Speaker 1>swamp people or people making moonshine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

2254
01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any desire to watch anymore</v>

2255
01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:29.660
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who Brunstrom in is?</v>

2256
01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:30.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was going to say,</v>

2257
01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather watch like a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>

2258
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:40.830
<v Speaker 1>like something that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some show something that's written in </v>

2259
01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:42.730
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's going to be good.</v>

2260
01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

2261
01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Not every now and then the guy tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth fuck a dude with a sock on his </v>

2262
01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:49.140
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2263
01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Funny that it's kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the kind of time to </v>

2264
01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:55.951
<v Speaker 1>wait for that to generate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when I hear about Saturday </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's fucking amazing.</v>

2267
01:48:58.471 --> 01:49:03.390

<v Speaker 4>night live,</v>

2270
01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:04.880

<v Speaker 1>They get good ones.</v>

2271

2277
01:49:23.921 --> 01:49:25.960
<v Speaker 4>I tried to make a reference there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't work</v>

2278
01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:28.440
<v Speaker 1>as in 30 rock.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You need to take a break from puns</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

2283
01:49:42.090 --> 01:49:44.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm really surprised that you didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>any puns after</v>

2284
01:49:44.590 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>you rattled off three or four really </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones right before</v>

2285
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.190
<v Speaker 7>this show started.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I try to hold back.</v>

2286
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:55.380
<v Speaker 7>I wanted the whole Jane Goodall thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't think I wanted to say </v>

2287
01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:55.750
<v Speaker 7>chimpanzee and easy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wanted to,</v>

2288
01:49:55.810 --> 01:49:57.640
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why didn't you say it?</v>

2289
01:49:58.020 --> 01:49:59.970
<v Speaker 7>Because I don't want to be known as the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Pun guy.</v>

2290
01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:00.790
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>

2291
01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:03.560

<v Speaker 7>but that's it.</v>

2292
01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:07.750
<v Speaker 7>You are trying to be insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let your let your talents shine.</v>

2293
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:12.250
<v Speaker 7>You're very funny with puns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to show my full balance.</v>

2294
01:50:12.251 --> 01:50:13.470
<v Speaker 7>You have that too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In rain.</v>

2295
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:16.240
<v Speaker 7>Don't hold your puns back when you know </v>
<v Speaker 7>that they're natural.</v>

2296
01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.600
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got them right there.</v>

2297
01:50:18.601 --> 01:50:23.601
<v Speaker 7>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're popping in your fucking crazy </v>

2298
01:50:23.601 --> 01:50:23.601
<v Speaker 7>head here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2299
01:50:23.601 --> 01:50:23.601
<v Speaker 7>Let him free.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>

2300
01:50:23.601 --> 01:50:23.620
<v Speaker 7>Let them free.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

2301
01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:26.050
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That those fuckers free.</v>

2302
01:50:26.051 --> 01:50:27.600
<v Speaker 7>Let them free.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Woo.</v>

2303
01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.830
<v Speaker 7>Punted it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2304
01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:30.790
<v Speaker 7>We're nice people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so no,</v>

2305
01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 7>we're not going to repeat what we said </v>
<v Speaker 7>before the show started where you were </v>

2306
01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:37.420
<v Speaker 7>rattling off all those puns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember them.</v>

2307
01:50:38.210 --> 01:50:43.210
<v Speaker 7>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is there ever been a time in your life </v>

2308
01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:50.100
<v Speaker 7>whether it was something that you now </v>
<v Speaker 7>think is really fucking stupid but you </v>

2309
01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:53.830
<v Speaker 7>believed in then like ghosts or anything</v>
<v Speaker 7>goofy like that?</v>

2310
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:54.230
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2311
01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a slight chance that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw something one day at the comedy </v>

2312
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.070
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's silly,</v>

2313
01:51:01.190 --> 01:51:02.660
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>

2314
01:51:02.661 --> 01:51:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I was borderline about to pass </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2315
01:51:05.091 --> 01:51:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was like a low blood sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack,</v>

2316
01:51:07.071 --> 01:51:12.071
<v Speaker 2>but I saw something weird one day out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the days that I worked there for </v>

2317
01:51:12.071 --> 01:51:16.421
<v Speaker 2>years in the middle of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day I was working the phones on the </v>

2318
01:51:16.671 --> 01:51:21.671
<v Speaker 2>second floor in the phone room where </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the bookers room is now and I was </v>

2319
01:51:21.741 --> 01:51:26.741
<v Speaker 2>going outside to the belly room to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke a joint or smoke a cigarette or </v>

2320
01:51:26.871 --> 01:51:28.700
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a dark room.</v>

2321
01:51:28.701 --> 01:51:32.000
<v Speaker 2>And I was walking through there and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was walking through there,</v>

2322
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:37.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped and felt like something.</v>

2323
01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:42.460
<v Speaker 2>It just felt weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something in my gut felt weird and </v>

2324
01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:42.460
<v Speaker 2>then sort of stopped and I looked to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2325
01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:47.380
<v Speaker 2>right where that other door is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're walking into the belly </v>

2326
01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:50.021
<v Speaker 2>room from the belly room greener and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the green hallway and you </v>

2327
01:51:50.021 --> 01:51:52.871
<v Speaker 2>finally come across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're right in front of the men's </v>

2328
01:51:52.871 --> 01:51:52.871
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll write to your right.</v>

2329
01:51:52.871 --> 01:51:55.190
<v Speaker 2>There's that other door that leads down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like the back bar in the back.</v>

2330
01:51:55.191 --> 01:52:00.191
<v Speaker 2>Gullet whole everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those two doorways are right next to </v>

2331
01:52:00.191 --> 01:52:01.310
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I stopped there and I saw some weird</v>

2332
01:52:01.311 --> 01:52:06.311
<v Speaker 2>white silver floaty looking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was like years ago,</v>

2333
01:52:08.130 --> 01:52:13.130
<v Speaker 7>cigarette smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone was smoking cigarettes over </v>

2334
01:52:13.130 --> 01:52:13.130
<v Speaker 7>there and they blew.</v>

2335
01:52:13.130 --> 01:52:13.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was indoors.</v>

2336
01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody was smoking cigarettes indoors.</v>

2337
01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:18.300
<v Speaker 2>This is back when nobody was at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store.</v>

2338
01:52:18.810 --> 01:52:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Smoke cigarettes indoors this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more glowing than smoke,</v>

2340
01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.730
<v Speaker 2>like it had its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it spooky smoke?</v>

2341
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:33.170
<v Speaker 2>It could have been perhaps a reflection </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of headshot.</v>

2342
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:36.650
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there was nothing on that side.</v>

2343
01:52:36.651 --> 01:52:41.651
<v Speaker 7>It was an empty bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 7>May I suggest that this was during the </v>

2344
01:52:41.651 --> 01:52:41.651
<v Speaker 7>day?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

2345
01:52:41.651 --> 01:52:45.880
<v Speaker 7>And the dust in the comedy store is </v>
<v Speaker 7>world world class.</v>

2346
01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:52.060
<v Speaker 7>The last time they run a motherfucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>vacuum cleaner over those stairs is the </v>

2347
01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:55.100
<v Speaker 7>first time they run a motherfucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>vacuum cleaner over those days as you're</v>

2348
01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:57.830
<v Speaker 7>walking up there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just kidding.</v>

2349
01:52:57.831 --> 01:52:58.730
<v Speaker 7>Now they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

2350
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:03.940
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty clean now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's how it used to be for the </v>

2351
01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:03.940
<v Speaker 7>longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

2352
01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:06.290
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to see when the wind like a</v>

2353
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.630
<v Speaker 7>windows open and the sunlight's coming </v>
<v Speaker 7>through,</v>

2354
01:53:08.631 --> 01:53:12.050
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that glint if there's so much dust there</v>

2355
01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:15.680
<v Speaker 7>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you could see it in those little beams.</v>

2356
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:17.540
<v Speaker 7>Like you could see it floating in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>air.</v>

2357
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.460
<v Speaker 7>He'd be walking by going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh great,</v>

2358
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:24.530
<v Speaker 7>I'm breathing in that scary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the kicker is old buildings are like</v>

2359
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:24.880
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2360
01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:29.890
<v Speaker 7>Kicker with this one was that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>tell anybody about it because I was </v>

2361
01:53:29.890 --> 01:53:31.820
<v Speaker 7>obviously like a whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it freaked me out.</v>

2362
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:36.880
<v Speaker 7>I didn't end up smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember I slowly turned around and </v>

2363
01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:37.820
<v Speaker 7>walked back to the phones ring because I</v>
<v Speaker 7>was freaked out.</v>

2364
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:40.160
<v Speaker 7>I'd interrupted you to try to be funny </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I failed.</v>

2365
01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:42.830
<v Speaker 7>So could you just explain it one more </v>
<v Speaker 7>time?</v>

2366
01:53:43.190 --> 01:53:44.900
<v Speaker 7>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're walking,</v>

2367
01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:47.090
<v Speaker 7>you see this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do you see?</v>

2368
01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:49.430
<v Speaker 7>Describe it to me it's sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 7>human height,</v>

2369
01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:54.380
<v Speaker 7>but like glowy sort of look like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I would say like a jelly fish.</v>

2370
01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:58.040
<v Speaker 7>It's shaped like a human sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sort of a little bit.</v>

2371
01:53:58.070 --> 01:54:01.130
<v Speaker 7>Like it seemed like it had like casper </v>
<v Speaker 7>sort of.</v>

2372
01:54:01.131 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As cheesy as that sounds.</v>

2373
01:54:03.591 --> 01:54:05.900
<v Speaker 7>It's sort of did like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it was more,</v>

2374
01:54:05.901 --> 01:54:08.990
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't like a solid white.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like here's a question.</v>

2375
01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:14.020
<v Speaker 7>This is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like why were Goso is depicted as being </v>

2376
01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:17.180
<v Speaker 7>like wispy was always ghosts were always</v>
<v Speaker 7>wispy and flying through the air.</v>

2377
01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:19.670
<v Speaker 7>And the creepy thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that's what this sort of felt like.</v>

2378
01:54:19.671 --> 01:54:23.300
<v Speaker 7>It felt whispery like on the sides,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like there was sorta like a,</v>

2379
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:24.920
<v Speaker 7>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

2380
01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:28.520
<v Speaker 7>like sorta like how you see that with </v>
<v Speaker 7>like a fish or something like that where</v>

2381
01:54:28.530 --> 01:54:30.980
<v Speaker 7>I like little tentacles or something </v>
<v Speaker 7>moving into the air.</v>

2382
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:34.000
<v Speaker 7>I know this sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's what I saw it.</v>

2383
01:54:34.050 --> 01:54:36.110
<v Speaker 7>Now look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it does sound ridiculous,</v>

2384
01:54:36.111 --> 01:54:38.420
<v Speaker 7>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so to people,</v>

2385
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:43.870
<v Speaker 7>people sound ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if we weren't a real thing and you </v>

2386
01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:47.111
<v Speaker 7>had to think about like if there was no </v>
<v Speaker 7>life form that change the environment </v>

2387
01:54:47.690 --> 01:54:49.360
<v Speaker 7>around it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>none the war.</v>

2388
01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:54.400
<v Speaker 7>The biggest thing would be like a permit</v>
<v Speaker 7>crab or something like that steals a </v>

2389
01:54:54.411 --> 01:54:55.640
<v Speaker 7>shell and lives inside of it.</v>

2390
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:58.970
<v Speaker 7>If that was how most of nature was like </v>
<v Speaker 7>bear den,</v>

2391
01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:00.770
<v Speaker 7>other bear dug a hole in the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>hill.</v>

2392
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:05.990
<v Speaker 7>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It does the extent of people and </v>

2393
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:08.140
<v Speaker 7>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>birds make nests and then all of a </v>

2394
01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:08.140
<v Speaker 7>sudden you went to a new place and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>saw a Manhattan,</v>

2395
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:13.160
<v Speaker 7>you would.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You would be so fucking freaked out.</v>

2396
01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.030
<v Speaker 7>You wouldn't be able to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 7>this one organism is capable of altering</v>

2397
01:55:17.031 --> 01:55:20.600
<v Speaker 7>the environment around it so radically </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's the only thing like it.</v>

2398
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:25.790
<v Speaker 7>The only thing like it by far crazy </v>
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

2399
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:29.810
<v Speaker 7>What we are is very crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2400
01:55:29.811 --> 01:55:31.340
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think people are awesome.</v>

2401
01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:34.370
<v Speaker 7>I enjoy talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love what we do.</v>

2402
01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:37.740
<v Speaker 7>I love to be able to podcasts and do </v>
<v Speaker 7>stand up and have fun and,</v>

2403
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:43.510
<v Speaker 7>but just what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just what the human race is is a weird </v>

2404
01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.230
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>

2482
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:07.910
<v Speaker 1>The first one is a little slow sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting it up at,</v>

2483
01:59:07.911 --> 01:59:09.240
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2484
01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:14.370
<v Speaker 1>because they're setting everything up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to over a long period of </v>

2485
01:59:14.370 --> 01:59:14.370
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to get about episode four,</v>

<v Speaker 1>historically accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't a history channel.</v>

2489
01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:26.350
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vikings were crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they thought would be cool.</v>

2511
02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:23.560
<v Speaker 1>It would happen mostly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 9>sides.</v>

2606
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:34.780
<v Speaker 9>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 9>white people making a big deal.</v>

2607
02:04:34.781 --> 02:04:36.040
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 9>Shouldn't just be all good people like,</v>

2610
02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:44.880
<v Speaker 9>of course this is the way the story was </v>
<v Speaker 9>and this is the way they want to promote</v>

2611
02:04:44.881 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 9>it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why do you care?</v>

2612
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:48.150
<v Speaker 9>Like it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't care.</v>

2613
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:53.300
<v Speaker 9>But then it goes the other way and I do </v>
<v Speaker 9>care where I've seen crazy liberal </v>

2614
02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:58.071
<v Speaker 9>psychos and there were white people in </v>
<v Speaker 9>fact saying white people stay the fuck </v>

2615
02:04:58.071 --> 02:05:00.450
<v Speaker 9>out of the theater while,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 9>don't steal their joy with your white </v>

2617
02:05:06.541 --> 02:05:08.100
<v Speaker 9>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh my God.</v>

2618
02:05:08.101 --> 02:05:10.740
<v Speaker 9>I literally saw something along those </v>
<v Speaker 9>lines.</v>

2619
02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:16.280
<v Speaker 9>I saw a couple of those,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one of them where a woman was asking </v>

2620
02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:19.560
<v Speaker 9>when it was appropriate to see it and </v>
<v Speaker 9>she didn't.</v>

2621
02:05:19.590 --> 02:05:21.630
<v Speaker 9>She didn't want to ruin it with her </v>
<v Speaker 9>whiteness.</v>

2622
02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:25.440
<v Speaker 9>She was totally serious,</v>
<v Speaker 9>totally serious,</v>

2623
02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:26.670
<v Speaker 9>and those people,</v>

2624
02:05:26.670 --> 02:05:28.380
<v Speaker 1>real people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think that that's.</v>

2625
02:05:28.410 --> 02:05:30.690
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like God damn it.</v>

2626
02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>When when shaft was out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think white people couldn't go </v>

2627
02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:36.420
<v Speaker 1>see shaft when blade came out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety eight.</v>

2628
02:05:36.421 --> 02:05:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Did White people stay home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are we doing?</v>

2629
02:05:38.281 --> 02:05:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Are we more divided now than we ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>were before?</v>

2630
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.610
<v Speaker 1>We so silly that you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go see Black Panther because I</v>

2631
02:05:44.611 --> 02:05:47.460
<v Speaker 1>like fucking superhero movies and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks cool.</v>

2632
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:51.420
<v Speaker 1>The fact that anybody would give a shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>one way or the other,</v>

2633
02:05:51.421 --> 02:05:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you're a black kid or a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy was like,</v>

2634
02:05:54.121 --> 02:05:59.121
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gives all of us hope that there's </v>

2635
02:05:59.121 --> 02:05:59.121
<v Speaker 1>more opportunity for movies to be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2636
02:05:59.121 --> 02:06:03.411
<v Speaker 1>that people aren't really racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can embrace a black superhero the </v>

2637
02:06:03.411 --> 02:06:05.760
<v Speaker 1>same way that it can embrace the Hawk or</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought if the movie's really good and I</v>

2638
02:06:05.761 --> 02:06:08.310
<v Speaker 1>hope the movie's really good and I hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happens,</v>

2639
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>but how the fuck did it changed so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one blade was around because when </v>

2640
02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>blade was around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2641
02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:16.470
<v Speaker 1>nobody even thought about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a black superhero movie.</v>

2642
02:06:16.650 --> 02:06:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess some people did,</v>

2643
02:06:18.210 --> 02:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>but the emphasis was the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wesley Snipes was blade and it looked </v>

2644
02:06:23.821 --> 02:06:27.480
<v Speaker 1>good and he was doing karate and chop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and vampires up,</v>

2645
02:06:27.481 --> 02:06:30.120
<v Speaker 1>but swords and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucking bad ass movie.</v>

2646
02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:33.480
<v Speaker 1>That movie was super successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did two sequels,</v>

2647
02:06:34.530 --> 02:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>so like what's changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck is it changed from then </v>

2648
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:42.981
<v Speaker 1>until now with likewise now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it a big deer if there's a black </v>

2649
02:06:42.981 --> 02:06:46.461
<v Speaker 1>superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a big deal then like are </v>

2650
02:06:46.461 --> 02:06:48.180
<v Speaker 1>we deteriorating or is it just more </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise because of social media?</v>

2651
02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you get a more distorted sense of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country actually feels?</v>

2652
02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Because the people that are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclined to chime in regularly and </v>

2653
02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:01.840
<v Speaker 1>vehemently are oftentimes not the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are calculated and you know,</v>

2654
02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:06.890
<v Speaker 1>assessing thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're maybe a little bit more </v>

2655
02:07:06.890 --> 02:07:07.920
<v Speaker 1>aggressive shooting off the cuff.</v>

2656
02:07:08.070 --> 02:07:13.070
<v Speaker 1>So what you're getting is not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate representation of how people </v>

2657
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:13.070
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you start defending it as if it</v>

2658
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:17.451
<v Speaker 1>is accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then people start telling people </v>

2659
02:07:17.451 --> 02:07:20.200
<v Speaker 1>to stay the fuck home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got craziness and you've got </v>

2660
02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:22.500
<v Speaker 1>craziness because of the fringe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fringe on both sides,</v>

2661
02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people like hope it's a cool movie.</v>

2662
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine if you had a friend </v>

2663
02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>and you were gone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to go see,</v>

2664
02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:30.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Black Panther movie?</v>

2665
02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Nah Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking these uppity black dudes are </v>

2666
02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>just really getting into this movie too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2667
02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:37.510
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would.</v>

2668
02:07:37.570 --> 02:07:42.570
<v Speaker 1>You would immediately stop hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that guy and you'd probably tell </v>

2669
02:07:42.570 --> 02:07:42.820
<v Speaker 1>all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what that fucking guy said,</v>

2670
02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:45.700
<v Speaker 1>and we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the call?</v>

2671
02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:49.260
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff is disgusting.</v>

2672
02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.640
<v Speaker 1>All of it's disgusting.</v>

2673
02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:57.780
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like anytime you're prejudice </v>

2674
02:07:57.780 --> 02:07:59.890
<v Speaker 1>against white people or even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical about yourself being white,</v>

2675
02:07:59.891 --> 02:08:02.800
<v Speaker 1>that you should stay the fuck away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>places that is crazy.</v>

2676
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Not talking about intruding on cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals.</v>

2677
02:08:06.191 --> 02:08:09.130
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about an awesome movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who can buy a ticket,</v>

2678
02:08:09.131 --> 02:08:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you buy a ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will make the movie more successful.</v>

2679
02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:16.620
<v Speaker 1>You want giant opening weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really love this movie and you </v>

2680
02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:20.011
<v Speaker 1>want movies like this to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be promoting it for </v>

2681
02:08:20.011 --> 02:08:20.011
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White people,</v>

2682
02:08:20.011 --> 02:08:20.890
<v Speaker 1>black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian people who gives a fuck.</v>

2683
02:08:21.190 --> 02:08:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Go see the superhero movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be fun.</v>

2684
02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:28.590
<v Speaker 1>He's got a pendant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns into a fucking bulletproof </v>

2685
02:08:28.590 --> 02:08:28.590
<v Speaker 1>outfit and he fucks people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shoot them.</v>

2686
02:08:28.590 --> 02:08:30.100
<v Speaker 1>He gets more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

2687
02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Go watch like who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's.</v>

2688
02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I get the people that take pride in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like something's happening for</v>

2689
02:08:37.061 --> 02:08:42.061
<v Speaker 1>them that it's a black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that are white that have </v>

2690
02:08:42.061 --> 02:08:42.061
<v Speaker 1>an issue with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2691
02:08:42.061 --> 02:08:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you got to let some shit go.</v>

2692
02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:47.610
<v Speaker 1>You just got to let the noise go by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let it bounce around inside your </v>

2693
02:08:47.610 --> 02:08:47.760
<v Speaker 1>head and come up with a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not rushing water.</v>

2694
02:08:47.770 --> 02:08:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Why have good shoved in my face and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got to meet in the middle.</v>

2695
02:08:53.230 --> 02:08:55.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got to meet in the middle.</v>

2696
02:08:55.301 --> 02:09:00.301
<v Speaker 1>There's way less tension and conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>than is being verbalized.</v>

2697
02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:06.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if people just realized that a </v>

2698
02:09:06.150 --> 02:09:09.361
<v Speaker 1>lot of the shit that we're claiming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>has just some ways we've been thinking </v>

2699
02:09:09.361 --> 02:09:14.311
<v Speaker 1>and behaving for a long time and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can all just fucking communicate with </v>

2700
02:09:14.311 --> 02:09:14.311
<v Speaker 1>each other just a little bit better.</v>

2701
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that racism has gotten </v>

2702
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:24.651
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it absolutely has gotten worse </v>

2703
02:09:24.651 --> 02:09:27.291
<v Speaker 1>in some places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's places where racism </v>

2704
02:09:27.291 --> 02:09:31.101
<v Speaker 1>exists and I think those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you have young kids that </v>

2705
02:09:31.101 --> 02:09:34.161
<v Speaker 1>are raised with racism and family </v>
<v Speaker 1>members that are raised at racism in a </v>

2706
02:09:34.161 --> 02:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>community that embraces racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has existed in the past,</v>

2707
02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>we don't even have to talk about today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the past it was most certainly </v>

2708
02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:44.300
<v Speaker 1>really racist neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Italian neighborhoods in New York </v>

2709
02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:47.361
<v Speaker 1>where black people moved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were treated terribly and horrible </v>

2710
02:09:47.361 --> 02:09:50.421
<v Speaker 1>shit happened in a lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't even allowed to move in in </v>

2711
02:09:50.421 --> 02:09:50.421
<v Speaker 1>the first place and there's always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

2712
02:09:52.230 --> 02:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>So if there's always been stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2713
02:09:53.911 --> 02:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a natural human inclination that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to iron out.</v>

2714
02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:01.580
<v Speaker 1>We can't just eliminate it by making it </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal or eliminated by prosecuting </v>

2715
02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:05.481
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure out why people think </v>

2716
02:10:05.481 --> 02:10:05.481
<v Speaker 1>like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scary way to think.</v>

2717
02:10:05.481 --> 02:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Scary to think that any one speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2718
02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:09.690
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us,</v>

2719
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:14.750
<v Speaker 1>all of us and almost anyone listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this in comparison to someone like Elon </v>

2720
02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Musk is basically a chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2721
02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:24.740
<v Speaker 1>so you want to be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be racist against this </v>

2722
02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:24.750
<v Speaker 1>African guy that's smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2723
02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a real African guy from </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa.</v>

2724
02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Elan Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2725
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2726
02:10:33.650 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a</v>

2727
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.970
<v Speaker 7>real African American.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2728
02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:41.020
<v Speaker 7>Like legitimately.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But obviously there's different stream </v>

2729
02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:43.490
<v Speaker 7>black African and I believe it was the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Dutch that originally settled that area,</v>

2730
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:45.050
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's,</v>

2731
02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:48.380
<v Speaker 7>he's the descendants of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But my point is like,</v>

2732
02:10:48.381 --> 02:10:51.230
<v Speaker 7>we're all dumb asses compared to that </v>
<v Speaker 7>guy.</v>

2733
02:10:51.231 --> 02:10:53.750
<v Speaker 7>So stop getting all uppity about why </v>
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

2734
02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:58.800
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>having better GPA and whatever other </v>

2735
02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:01.901
<v Speaker 7>race you're comparing us to because your</v>
<v Speaker 7>stupid compared to that one African </v>

2736
02:11:02.631 --> 02:11:05.030
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you're dumb for sure.</v>

2737
02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:10.180
<v Speaker 7>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like there's no way you see your vote </v>

2738
02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:11.060
<v Speaker 7>should count more than his.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2739
02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:11.680
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2740
02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:14.220
<v Speaker 4>Mine personally or most anybody's years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>personally,</v>

2741
02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:15.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2742
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:19.830
<v Speaker 7>This idea that there's one race is </v>
<v Speaker 7>better than the other race.</v>

2743
02:11:19.831 --> 02:11:24.831
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The people that are really clinging to </v>

2744
02:11:24.831 --> 02:11:24.831
<v Speaker 7>it usually don't have shit going on </v>
<v Speaker 7>other than that.</v>

2745
02:11:24.831 --> 02:11:28.550
<v Speaker 7>That's the problem with racism.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It puts people in a camp of winters when</v>

2746
02:11:28.551 --> 02:11:30.440
<v Speaker 7>they really don't have to do shit to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>into,</v>

2747
02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:32.690
<v Speaker 7>get into the team.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2748
02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:35.870
<v Speaker 7>the entrance is instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just,</v>

2749

2751
02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:41.420
<v Speaker 7>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a ridiculous team.</v>

2752
02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:44.150
<v Speaker 7>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's one of the main problems with,</v>

2753
02:11:44.410 --> 02:11:49.410
<v Speaker 7>with the ridiculous nature of racism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially organized racism that you </v>

2754
02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:52.190
<v Speaker 7>just got to take everybody that looks </v>
<v Speaker 7>like you.</v>

2755
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:53.030
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's all.</v>

2756
02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:54.410
<v Speaker 7>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not how they think,</v>

2757
02:11:54.411 --> 02:11:56.900
<v Speaker 7>not what they've read,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not their life experiences,</v>

2758
02:11:56.930 --> 02:11:58.730
<v Speaker 7>not how you feel when you're hanging </v>
<v Speaker 7>around with them.</v>

2759
02:11:58.731 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 7>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How they make you laugh.</v>

2760
02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:05.320
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You want to make sure that they have </v>

2761
02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:06.410
<v Speaker 7>blood from a certain patch of dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2762
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:09.410
<v Speaker 7>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's so stupid.</v>

2763
02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:12.380
<v Speaker 7>And they moved the goalpost too because </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a white guy now,</v>

2764
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:15.920
<v Speaker 7>but when my grandparents came here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were dirty guineas.</v>

2765
02:12:16.190 --> 02:12:17.090
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2766
02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:18.220
<v Speaker 7>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2767
02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:21.260
<v Speaker 7>they were thought of the way a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>people think about Mexicans,</v>

2768
02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:25.730
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>same kind of thing that's changed now.</v>

2769
02:12:25.731 --> 02:12:27.310
<v Speaker 7>The Italians are full on white.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

2770
02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:33.160
<v Speaker 7>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We almost lost our distinction with </v>

2771
02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:33.160
<v Speaker 7>Jersey shore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We almost lost it.</v>

2772
02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:36.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We came real close to losing it close.</v>

2773
02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:38.720
<v Speaker 7>But we're regular white now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Again.</v>

2774
02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:40.490
<v Speaker 7>Feel pretty good about regular white.</v>

2775
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:47.360
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're whole family is Italian,</v>

2776
02:12:47.361 --> 02:12:47.990
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

2777
02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:51.430
<v Speaker 4>Crazy Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>

2778
02:12:51.431 --> 02:12:52.800
<v Speaker 4>East Coast at times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy Times.</v>

2779
02:12:52.801 --> 02:12:54.080
<v Speaker 4>It's almost redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2780
02:12:54.430 --> 02:12:55.240
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2781
02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.040
<v Speaker 4>My East Coast Italians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Different animal.</v>

2782
02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:00.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Dad has an Italian restaurant though,</v>

2783
02:13:00.031 --> 02:13:05.031
<v Speaker 4>so it's a little bit like amped up </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the family will go there on his </v>

2784
02:13:05.031 --> 02:13:06.520
<v Speaker 4>side and my mom makes crazy spaghetti </v>
<v Speaker 4>sauce,</v>

2785
02:13:06.521 --> 02:13:09.520
<v Speaker 4>so that's what everybody wants for every</v>
<v Speaker 4>holiday and everything,</v>

2786
02:13:09.521 --> 02:13:13.120
<v Speaker 4>so everybody's always trying to get like</v>
<v Speaker 4>red sauce in their stomach.</v>

2787
02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:16.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's one side or the other.</v>

2788
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:17.380
<v Speaker 4>The family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2789
02:13:17.381 --> 02:13:22.030
<v Speaker 4>what's really interesting is that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of style of cooking is not the</v>

2790
02:13:22.031 --> 02:13:27.031
<v Speaker 4>same out here at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally last night for Valentine's </v>

2791
02:13:27.031 --> 02:13:27.970
<v Speaker 4>Day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife and I thought out a container of</v>

2792
02:13:27.971 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 4>my mom's sauce that she sent out in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>frozen and had that</v>

2793
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.980
<v Speaker 2>instead of going to some fancy dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we wanted and it was </v>

2794
02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:40.790
<v Speaker 2>priceless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even then in our every bite you're </v>

2795
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2796
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:45.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like a New York Bagel or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that to where it's just different,</v>

2797
02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:48.990
<v Speaker 2>like 70 percent better than what you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>find here in la.</v>

2798
02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:54.140
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's difference in the bread for </v>

2799
02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:56.001
<v Speaker 9>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's no doubt about it and most </v>

2800
02:13:56.001 --> 02:13:56.310
<v Speaker 9>people smarter than me attributed to the</v>
<v Speaker 9>water.</v>

2801
02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:58.230
<v Speaker 9>You think that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 9>different.</v>

2802
02:13:58.231 --> 02:14:00.300
<v Speaker 9>The water in the east coast like New </v>
<v Speaker 9>York and Boston,</v>

2803
02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:02.370
<v Speaker 9>that when they make bread,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's just a different flavor to it.</v>

2804
02:14:02.450 --> 02:14:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I also think that there's something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the humidity in the air.</v>

2805
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:10.790
<v Speaker 2>They're actually being there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we forget we live in a desert </v>

2806
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:11.480
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't feel like a desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a desert to bread.</v>

2807
02:14:11.481 --> 02:14:12.110
<v Speaker 2>It's desert.</v>

2808
02:14:12.170 --> 02:14:13.100
<v Speaker 9>That's a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

2809
02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:14.480
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's a real good point.</v>

2810
02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:20.590
<v Speaker 9>Pasta taste better.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Their pizza definitely tastes better </v>

2811
02:14:20.590 --> 02:14:22.280
<v Speaker 9>there and bagels tastes better there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They have a different thing.</v>

2812
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:24.050
<v Speaker 9>They feel different when they go in your</v>
<v Speaker 9>mouth full.</v>

2813
02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:25.820
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>totally.</v>

2814
02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:27.140
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're just better.</v>

<v Speaker 9>Some guys are getting really close.</v>

2816
02:14:31.390 --> 02:14:33.520
<v Speaker 9>We really want to go cheat it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They try,</v>

2820
02:14:42.181 --> 02:14:44.520

2822
02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:50.230
<v Speaker 9>Middle Eastern food trucks like as in </v>
<v Speaker 9>New York,</v>

2823
02:14:50.231 --> 02:14:55.231
<v Speaker 9>New York.</v>

02:16:28.781 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 9>It's fucking awesome.</v>

2865
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really good to weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>texture.</v>

2866
02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Cow Tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

2867
02:16:34.930 --> 02:16:37.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a legit place though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go to the.</v>

2868
02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:40.960
<v Speaker 1>They always have a real legit place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have those little aluminum,</v>

2869
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:46.150
<v Speaker 1>a chrome looking containers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're filled with Jalapenos and </v>

2870
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:48.400
<v Speaker 1>peppers and onions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2871
02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:53.670
<v Speaker 1>And you scoop that fucking those debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big clump of death out of there.</v>

2872
02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Those Jalapenos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2873
02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:58.420
<v Speaker 1>there's always this creepy carrots for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason.</v>

2874
02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Some people like those carrots take you </v>
<v Speaker 1>off those Jalapenos.</v>

2875
02:17:01.091 --> 02:17:05.350
<v Speaker 1>But those Jalapenos kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You use Jalapenos,</v>

2876
02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Jalapenos you find and those little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishes at Mexican restaurants when you </v>

2877
02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:11.110
<v Speaker 1>bite into them and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

2878
02:17:11.430 --> 02:17:13.690
<v Speaker 1>because all seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck taken those seeds out.</v>

2879
02:17:14.530 --> 02:17:19.530
<v Speaker 6>Just thinking that that place had a vibe</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you gotta Kinda know what you're </v>

2880
02:17:19.530 --> 02:17:21.420
<v Speaker 6>doing when you go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Similar to that place you took me in New</v>

2881
02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:22.200
<v Speaker 6>York.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a famous deli,</v>

2882
02:17:22.201 --> 02:17:23.940
<v Speaker 6>but I can't remember the name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that where we went?</v>

2883
02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:25.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2884
02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:26.100
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2885
02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:28.800
<v Speaker 6>We got to know what the fuck's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or you got to know where the fuck you're</v>

2886
02:17:28.801 --> 02:17:31.920
<v Speaker 6>ordering and then where you pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not cut and dry.</v>

2887
02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:34.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But how legitimate that unique place.</v>

2888
02:17:34.771 --> 02:17:39.771
<v Speaker 6>I just think very unique to the coast </v>
<v Speaker 6>because like in Ohio we have our own </v>

2889
02:17:39.771 --> 02:17:40.650
<v Speaker 6>unique restaurants and food and all that</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of stuff,</v>

2890
02:17:40.651 --> 02:17:45.651
<v Speaker 6>but there aren't places like that where </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's unique to that place.</v>

2891
02:17:45.871 --> 02:17:48.300
<v Speaker 6>Unique to Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are few places like that,</v>

2892
02:17:48.301 --> 02:17:52.110
<v Speaker 6>but it's not a similar style of </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience and is always packed.</v>

2893
02:17:52.590 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 6>Always packed because the food's so </v>
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>

2894
02:17:54.761 --> 02:17:57.720
<v Speaker 6>Don't lose your ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How about that for an and how's that for</v>

2895
02:17:57.721 --> 02:17:59.570
<v Speaker 6>an interesting restaurant?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2896
02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:02.070
<v Speaker 6>it has this weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lose your ticket and try to walk out.</v>

2897
02:18:02.071 --> 02:18:03.150
<v Speaker 6>They charge you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2898
02:18:03.151 --> 02:18:06.030
<v Speaker 6>This Mexican joint doesn't do like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the way Katz has it.</v>

2899
02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Never been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katz Deli in New York has been around </v>

2900
02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:12.500
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who got it?</v>

2901
02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:16.040
<v Speaker 1>It's I want to say more than 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old I think,</v>

2902

<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

2903
02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:20.900

2909
02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:37.060
<v Speaker 1>they give you a a ticket and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk up to the counters and then this </v>

<v Speaker 1>there's no</v>

2931
02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:33.610
<v Speaker 7>doubting in my mind at least,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that there's something special about a </v>

2932
02:19:33.610 --> 02:19:35.000
<v Speaker 7>place that's been used for the same </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing for a long time.</v>

2933
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:40.450
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a place where you go and you feel </v>

2934
02:19:40.450 --> 02:19:41.210
<v Speaker 7>like this place like Madison Square </v>
<v Speaker 7>Garden,</v>

2935
02:19:41.211 --> 02:19:43.370
<v Speaker 7>like walking around and Madison Square </v>
<v Speaker 7>Garden.</v>

2936
02:19:43.371 --> 02:19:45.410

<v Speaker 7>whoa.</v>

2938
02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:50.690
<v Speaker 7>Like this place feels different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it's got a,</v>

2939
02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:55.370
<v Speaker 7>a resonance to it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like maybe it's just my mind being aware</v>

2940
02:19:55.550 --> 02:20:00.550
<v Speaker 7>of what an incredible building that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>and all the incredible stars that are </v>

2941
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:01.100

3000
02:22:37.591 --> 02:22:42.591
<v Speaker 9>A theory is like his buddy laughing </v>
<v Speaker 9>Adam.</v>

<v Speaker 9>You know what man,</v>

3004
02:22:48.771 --> 02:22:53.771
<v Speaker 9>if people find out that they can get </v>
<v Speaker 9>attention from saying that you have </v>

3005
02:22:53.771 --> 02:22:53.771
<v Speaker 9>photos are real,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that they saw them,</v>

3006
02:22:53.771 --> 02:22:56.120
<v Speaker 9>they'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know it from firsthand experience.</v>

3007
02:22:56.121 --> 02:22:58.580
<v Speaker 9>I've told this story before,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I don't know if ever told it to you.</v>

3008
02:22:59.450 --> 02:23:01.850
<v Speaker 9>I was doing a show for CBS called gang </v>
<v Speaker 9>show in my head.</v>

3009
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:05.300
<v Speaker 9>And what would they had was they had a </v>
<v Speaker 9>setup where,</v>

3010
02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:10.310
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I had an earpiece in and the person who </v>

3011
02:23:10.310 --> 02:23:11.810
<v Speaker 9>was a contestant on the show had an </v>
<v Speaker 9>earpiece in and we would set them out in</v>

3012
02:23:11.811 --> 02:23:16.811
<v Speaker 9>the middle of somewhere and then start </v>
<v Speaker 9>asking them questions and telling them </v>

3013
02:23:16.811 --> 02:23:17.930
<v Speaker 9>what they were they were going to have </v>
<v Speaker 9>to do.</v>

3014
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:19.100
<v Speaker 9>We'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>are you ready?</v>

3015
02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:20.300
<v Speaker 9>You ready to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>

3016
02:23:20.301 --> 02:23:24.800
<v Speaker 9>here is what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I told this guy you are a news caster.</v>

3017
02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:30.280
<v Speaker 9>Now you showed up to do a story about a </v>
<v Speaker 9>guy who was taken aboard a Ufo,</v>

3018
02:23:30.861 --> 02:23:33.920
<v Speaker 9>a person who's taken aboard a Ufo,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but this person's gone.</v>

3019
02:23:33.921 --> 02:23:37.220
<v Speaker 9>So you have to find a random stranger to</v>
<v Speaker 9>pretend it was them.</v>

3020
02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:42.460
<v Speaker 9>And then tell you a story about getting </v>
<v Speaker 9>taken aboard the spaceship and getting </v>

3021
02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:44.300
<v Speaker 9>probed.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And Dude,</v>

3022
02:23:44.301 --> 02:23:47.620

<v Speaker 9>So here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So this is the young man and this young </v>

<v Speaker 9>explains it to me.</v>

3032

<v Speaker 9>being abducted by aliens.</v>

3048
02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:01.880
<v Speaker 9>The thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it was so easy to get when people know </v>

3049
02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:03.720
<v Speaker 9>that they're going to be on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they,</v>

3050
02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:06.660
<v Speaker 9>they get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like the idea of being on cameras,</v>

3051
02:25:06.661 --> 02:25:11.661
<v Speaker 9>like I'll just fucking make some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 9>shit up and then all of us sit back or </v>

3052
02:25:11.661 --> 02:25:15.531
<v Speaker 9>like Jane Goodall's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like I talked to native Americans and </v>

3053
02:25:15.531 --> 02:25:18.240
<v Speaker 9>they told me they were probably given </v>
<v Speaker 9>her why.</v>

3054
02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:20.660
<v Speaker 9>Try and try and get freaky with her.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3055
02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:25.740
<v Speaker 9>Seen bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know where he lives getting high and </v>

3056
02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:26.740

<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3057
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.550
<v Speaker 9>maybe.</v>

3058
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:29.290
<v Speaker 9>But for real,</v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe bigfoot exists.</v>

3059
02:25:29.291 --> 02:25:31.570
<v Speaker 9>If you take peyote and go in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe you could see him.</v>

3060
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:36.750
<v Speaker 9>Maybe you only see glimpse of him.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Maybe bigfoot's a ghost that you only </v>

3061
02:25:36.750 --> 02:25:36.750
<v Speaker 9>see when you're on pod.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think,</v>

3062
02:25:36.750 --> 02:25:39.310
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if I'm doing pod in the woods,</v>

3063
02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:43.630
<v Speaker 9>I'm definitely seeing big foot on top of</v>
<v Speaker 9>many other things.</v>

3064
02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:46.030
<v Speaker 9>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you were,</v>

3065
02:25:47.890 --> 02:25:51.490
<v Speaker 9>if you could say with 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 9>certainty,</v>

3066
02:25:51.491 --> 02:25:53.620
<v Speaker 9>like what if you had like a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 9>dollars to gamble?</v>

3067
02:25:54.250 --> 02:25:59.250
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you think you saw a ghost or do you </v>

3068
02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:02.281
<v Speaker 9>think you just playing tricks on </v>
<v Speaker 9>yourself and then the more you think </v>

3069
02:26:02.281 --> 02:26:06.241
<v Speaker 9>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the more you've added stuff to the </v>

3070
02:26:06.241 --> 02:26:06.241
<v Speaker 9>memory and fuck with that memory in your</v>
<v Speaker 9>head?</v>

3071
02:26:06.241 --> 02:26:07.160
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a little bit scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be honest with you.</v>

3072
02:26:07.161 --> 02:26:11.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit scarier than I even </v>
<v Speaker 2>told you because get this.</v>

3073

02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:17.580
<v Speaker 9>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's the spot that freaks me out the </v>

3093
02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:17.580
<v Speaker 9>most.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And by the way,</v>

3094
02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:17.580
<v Speaker 9>because it's really contained.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3095
02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:18.970
<v Speaker 9>What not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not being honest.</v>

3096
02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:21.190
<v Speaker 9>The main room when it's dark freaks me </v>
<v Speaker 9>out the most.</v>

3097
02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:22.760
<v Speaker 9>The main rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Freaky when it started.</v>

3098
02:27:22.770 --> 02:27:25.340
<v Speaker 9>I don't even like him being in the back </v>
<v Speaker 9>of the main room when it's dark there</v>

3099
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:27.590
<v Speaker 2>part of every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you work the phones there,</v>

3100
02:27:27.591 --> 02:27:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you have to walk through that when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitch black,</v>

3101
02:27:30.261 --> 02:27:35.261
<v Speaker 2>dark to go turn on the lights to turn on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power breaker for the whole Marquis </v>

3102
02:27:35.261 --> 02:27:36.440
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to go out there like five or</v>

3103
02:27:36.441 --> 02:27:38.110
<v Speaker 2>six before it gets dark because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mark,</v>

3104
02:27:38.111 --> 02:27:38.620
<v Speaker 2>he has to</v>

3105
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:43.630
<v Speaker 9>go on.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Before that I had one of them tactical </v>

3106
02:27:43.630 --> 02:27:43.730
<v Speaker 9>flashlights,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like the Rockwood and many of his action</v>

3107
02:27:43.731 --> 02:27:47.000
<v Speaker 9>films Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You hold it up here.</v>

3108
02:27:47.001 --> 02:27:48.980
<v Speaker 9>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like it's a bramble knife and shit.</v>

3109
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.820
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

3110
02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:51.860

<v Speaker 9>Scary.</v>

3111

<v Speaker 9>Jamie's got one right there.</v>

3112
02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:56.960

3113
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:58.490

<v Speaker 2>Buildings freaky and that belly arms got</v>
<v Speaker 2>something because it is.</v>

3116
02:28:03.181 --> 02:28:07.140
<v Speaker 2>It's contained and you got Mitsis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unopened,</v>

3117
02:28:07.141 --> 02:28:11.820
<v Speaker 2>sealed off office to the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that power.</v>

3118
02:28:14.390 --> 02:28:16.340
<v Speaker 9>That's where it's all around Xyz.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yup.</v>

3119
02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:20.450
<v Speaker 9>Sean's ring.</v>
<v Speaker 9>People don't even know about that.</v>

3120
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:25.690
<v Speaker 9>That's like.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Think about all the powerful decisions </v>

3121
02:28:25.690 --> 02:28:26.600
<v Speaker 9>took place in that one office.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3122
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:31.750
<v Speaker 9>All the different comedy that revolves </v>
<v Speaker 9>around that one woman running that one </v>

3123
02:28:32.421 --> 02:28:33.380
<v Speaker 9>club.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3124
02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:34.920
<v Speaker 9>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3125
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:40.150
<v Speaker 9>If you really stop and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what are the odds of that even being a </v>

3126
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:43.151
<v Speaker 9>thing like how does one person who </v>
<v Speaker 9>really knows how to run a comedy club </v>

3127
02:28:43.151 --> 02:28:45.350
<v Speaker 9>the way she did,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how they exist when no one else,</v>

3128
02:28:45.470 --> 02:28:50.470
<v Speaker 9>no one does it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I'm not saying there's anything </v>

3129
02:28:50.470 --> 02:28:50.470
<v Speaker 9>wrong with the way the other people do </v>
<v Speaker 9>it and some of those other people I love</v>

3130
02:28:50.470 --> 02:28:52.850
<v Speaker 9>dearly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like I love Bob at the ice house dearly.</v>

3131
02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:55.040
<v Speaker 9>He runs a different lot of people run a </v>
<v Speaker 9>different.</v>

3132
02:28:55.610 --> 02:28:59.330
<v Speaker 9>What I'm saying is that she did </v>
<v Speaker 9>something that was like,</v>

3133
02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:03.110
<v Speaker 9>that's a crazy way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let the inmates run the asylum.</v>

3134
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Like even that one when she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She made an adjustment to put him in the</v>

3135
02:29:07.611 --> 02:29:10.430
<v Speaker 2>15 year anniversary instead of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>other guy.</v>

3136
02:29:10.450 --> 02:29:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3137
02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:16.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's what got him the next thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that got them the next thing that made </v>

3138
02:29:17.511 --> 02:29:19.220
<v Speaker 2>him one of the biggest comedy actors </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

3139
02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:20.820
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

3140
02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:21.560
<v Speaker 9>It's</v>

3141
02:29:21.890 --> 02:29:25.100
<v Speaker 2>obviously everything was prior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robin Williams,</v>

3142
02:29:25.101 --> 02:29:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Andy Kaufman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah,</v>

3143
02:29:26.061 --> 02:29:26.510
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

3144
02:29:26.511 --> 02:29:27.260
<v Speaker 2>It goes on and on.</v>

3145
02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:32.340
<v Speaker 9>It's stunning to think of how much </v>
<v Speaker 9>comedy comes from the acts of one </v>

3146
02:29:32.591 --> 02:29:34.420
<v Speaker 9>person.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The actions of one person.</v>

3147
02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:36.610
<v Speaker 9>Look at that ring.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>

3148
02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:39.100
<v Speaker 9>You and arranged or something.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Look at that.</v>

3149
02:29:39.130 --> 02:29:41.230
<v Speaker 9>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a gigantic black.</v>

3150
02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:46.380
<v Speaker 9>What do you think it is?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know how it's black and white </v>

3151
02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:46.380
<v Speaker 9>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You think it's Ruby?</v>

3152
02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:46.850
<v Speaker 9>Maybe that's something you can never </v>
<v Speaker 9>wear right here.</v>

3153
02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:50.700
<v Speaker 9>Think that we would get progressive </v>
<v Speaker 9>enough where you could.</v>

3154
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:55.710
<v Speaker 9>Where Ruby's kit,</v>
<v Speaker 9>where Ruby rings.</v>

3155
02:29:57.490 --> 02:30:02.490
<v Speaker 9>How many dudes or any,</v>
<v Speaker 9>any rappers like ultra super floss and </v>

3156
02:30:02.490 --> 02:30:05.471
<v Speaker 9>wearing rubies,</v>
<v Speaker 9>rubies whenever we are going to read.</v>

3157
02:30:07.250 --> 02:30:08.590
<v Speaker 9>So I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to be a new wrapper.</v>

3158
02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:11.050
<v Speaker 9>That's my name.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My name is all about rubies,</v>

3159
02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:12.910
<v Speaker 9>rubies,</v>
<v Speaker 9>rubies.</v>

3160
02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:17.620
<v Speaker 9>Them seems like cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'll just say all about Ruby's dem,</v>

3161
02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:22.460
<v Speaker 9>dem dem.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Remove this.</v>

3162
02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:25.320
<v Speaker 9>Reminds me of the lipstick challenge </v>
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>

3163
02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:26.470
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the lipstick challenge.</v>

3164
02:30:26.470 --> 02:30:31.470
<v Speaker 9>One of my favorite things were high as </v>
<v Speaker 9>fuck at the comedy store and we were </v>

3165
02:30:31.470 --> 02:30:32.170
<v Speaker 9>trying to figure out some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 9>challenge.</v>

3166
02:30:32.171 --> 02:30:34.960
<v Speaker 9>And the loser would have to wear </v>
<v Speaker 9>lipstick on stage for a year.</v>

3167
02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:41.600
<v Speaker 9>Are you going to have to wear it?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You'd have to wear it for the first 15 </v>

3168
02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:42.280
<v Speaker 9>minutes of your set.</v>
<v Speaker 9>After that,</v>

3169
02:30:42.281 --> 02:30:44.130
<v Speaker 9>you could wipe it off just for the fear </v>
<v Speaker 9>off.</v>

3170
02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:46.780
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>For the first 15 minutes you're set.</v>

3171
02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:48.650
<v Speaker 9>You'd have to have like a thing about </v>
<v Speaker 9>wipes,</v>

3172
02:30:48.651 --> 02:30:50.350
<v Speaker 9>like sitting there on your,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

3173
02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:52.060

3174
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:57.070
<v Speaker 9>d,</v>
<v Speaker 9>15 minutes of your act with Ruby Red </v>

3175
02:30:57.070 --> 02:30:57.070
<v Speaker 9>Lips like Miranda sings.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you know Miranda sings?</v>

3176
02:30:57.070 --> 02:30:57.220
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3180
02:31:07.630 --> 02:31:12.630

<v Speaker 9>You're going to have to do your lips </v>

3181
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.630
<v Speaker 9>like that.</v>

3182
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.630
<v Speaker 9>Go to a more attractive one right next </v>

<v Speaker 9>See what we're going to do just over </v>

3187
02:31:22.651 --> 02:31:24.360
<v Speaker 9>accentuate the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Clearly go above the actual shape of the</v>

3188
02:31:24.361 --> 02:31:29.361
<v Speaker 9>lip.</v>
<v Speaker 9>One year old man and you should do a </v>

3189
02:31:29.361 --> 02:31:31.440
<v Speaker 9>special about it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You should do a special say.</v>

3190
02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:36.540
<v Speaker 9>This is all my lipstick material that </v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to burn off now because my </v>

3191
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:39.210
<v Speaker 9>curse has been lifted one year wearing </v>
<v Speaker 9>lipstick.</v>

3192
02:31:39.211 --> 02:31:43.140
<v Speaker 9>Is he wearing Ruby's rappers wearing </v>
<v Speaker 9>Gucci Mane Boi.</v>

3193
02:31:43.141 --> 02:31:45.250
<v Speaker 9>Gucci Mane looks so much better now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's all finished.</v>

3194
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:47.550
<v Speaker 9>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's kind of interesting.</v>

3195
02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:51.270
<v Speaker 9>Like he's always smiling too.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like that dude looks happy as fuck.</v>

3196
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:53.040
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he's out of jail.</v>

3197
02:31:53.041 --> 02:31:55.170
<v Speaker 9>But also just looks like he's smiling a </v>
<v Speaker 9>lot.</v>

<v Speaker 9>it's interesting.</v>

3199
02:31:57.361 --> 02:32:02.361

<v Speaker 9>all these pictures and he's just kinda </v>

3200
02:32:02.361 --> 02:32:04.200
<v Speaker 9>like mean mugging,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'd have this one thought about him,</v>

3201
02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:07.740
<v Speaker 9>but instead I see Gucci and all these </v>
<v Speaker 9>pictures now and he's always smiling,</v>

3202
02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:10.780
<v Speaker 9>but I bet that guy's a friendly guy,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3203
02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:16.650

<v Speaker 9>and he's killing it now.</v>

3204
02:32:16.650 --> 02:32:17.520
<v Speaker 9>Out of jail,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:18.770
<v Speaker 9>Isn't he like.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3206
02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:21.730
<v Speaker 9>See even I know he's killing it in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>rap game back.</v>

3207
02:32:21.740 --> 02:32:24.270
<v Speaker 9>He just released a new album.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Has got to throw you in jail.</v>

3208
02:32:27.060 --> 02:32:29.550
<v Speaker 4>You ever listen to Migos?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3209
02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:32.580
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's Migos?</v>

3210
02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:37.700
<v Speaker 4>Migos is like a new suit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a rap group with three guys </v>

3211
02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:37.890
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3212
02:32:38.180 --> 02:32:42.060
<v Speaker 4>remember the ganging twins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're like the yanging twins,</v>

3213
02:32:42.061 --> 02:32:44.760
<v Speaker 4>but better than like with an extra </v>
<v Speaker 4>member.</v>

3214
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:46.890
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Powerful.</v>

3215
02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:49.350
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he would like it.</v>

3216
02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:54.660
<v Speaker 4>Migos rings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just got and they're like </v>

3217
02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:54.870
<v Speaker 4>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the funniest interviews</v>

3218
02:32:55.390 --> 02:32:57.730
<v Speaker 9>showing those rings again.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Go,</v>

3219
02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:00.310
<v Speaker 9>go big with that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That picture with the FIS.</v>

3220
02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:04.240
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Am I looking at it like a half a million</v>

3221
02:33:04.240 --> 02:33:05.340
<v Speaker 9>dollars in diamonds?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>

3222
02:33:05.980 --> 02:33:06.780
<v Speaker 9>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3223
02:33:07.900 --> 02:33:12.900
<v Speaker 9>That seems crazy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't seem crazy to be walking </v>

3224
02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:13.150
<v Speaker 9>around with a half a million dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 9>diamonds.</v>

3225
02:33:14.670 --> 02:33:15.030
<v Speaker 9>Hey,</v>

3226
02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:20.930
<v Speaker 4>better to be invested in diamonds than a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin or something like that.</v>

3227
02:33:20.931 --> 02:33:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3228
02:33:21.860 --> 02:33:24.040
<v Speaker 9>No Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that bitcoin shit.</v>

3229
02:33:24.041 --> 02:33:26.690
<v Speaker 9>My pop the fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And you'll be sitting here Hayden.</v>

3230
02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:28.600
<v Speaker 9>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You don't even know.</v>

3231
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:31.180
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I do know one thing about bitcoin.</v>

3232
02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:36.480
<v Speaker 9>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think bitcoin stupid people want fuck </v>

3233
02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:36.480
<v Speaker 9>you up.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3234
02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:37.730
<v Speaker 9>If you could talk some shit on bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They,</v>

3235
02:33:37.810 --> 02:33:39.640
<v Speaker 9>those bitcoin fanatics,</v>
<v Speaker 9>their rabbit.</v>

3236
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:42.250
<v Speaker 9>It's like a little bit of religion just </v>
<v Speaker 9>to touch.</v>

3237
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:43.780
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just a sprinkle.</v>

3238
02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:48.870
<v Speaker 9>I think it is right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It has to sprinkle and not necessarily </v>

3239
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:52.081
<v Speaker 9>just bitcoin either,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but there's a bunch of other crypto </v>

3240
02:33:52.081 --> 02:33:53.560
<v Speaker 9>coins which I fully support.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I have no a dog in the fight.</v>

3241
02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:54.070
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>me too.</v>

3242
02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:56.430
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And um,</v>

3243
02:33:57.420 --> 02:34:02.420
<v Speaker 9>and we keep five of it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is all dedicated to justin wren </v>

3244
02:34:02.420 --> 02:34:05.281
<v Speaker 9>and anytime he wants he can cash out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is all a from when Antonopoulos </v>

3245
02:34:05.281 --> 02:34:09.541
<v Speaker 9>isn't in there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I don't really have a stake in it </v>

3246
02:34:09.541 --> 02:34:11.671
<v Speaker 9>because that's all justin runs money,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but real investment in Bitcoin is very </v>

3247
02:34:13.721 --> 02:34:18.721
<v Speaker 9>fascinating to me because if more people</v>
<v Speaker 9>were interested in doing and it </v>

3248
02:34:18.721 --> 02:34:19.770
<v Speaker 9>eventually spread through the entire </v>
<v Speaker 9>contract,</v>

3249
02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:24.780
<v Speaker 9>everybody's decided to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 9>everybody figured out how to make it as </v>

3250
02:34:25.121 --> 02:34:28.240
<v Speaker 9>secure as regular money is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is not that secure.</v>

3251
02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:31.900
<v Speaker 9>I mean people steal regular money too.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think figuring out how to make it more</v>

3252
02:34:31.901 --> 02:34:36.070
<v Speaker 9>secure and better than it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which just seems like they would be able</v>

3253
02:34:36.071 --> 02:34:41.071
<v Speaker 9>to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You never know like who's going to be </v>

3254
02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:41.440
<v Speaker 9>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the hackers or the programmers.</v>

3255
02:34:42.010 --> 02:34:47.010
<v Speaker 9>It seems like only one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What was the one coin that someone stole</v>

3256
02:34:47.381 --> 02:34:52.381
<v Speaker 9>a Shitload of recently?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You were just telling me about 17 </v>

3257
02:34:52.381 --> 02:34:55.150
<v Speaker 9>million nano was stolen off of an </v>
<v Speaker 9>exchange.</v>

3258
02:34:55.470 --> 02:34:57.250
<v Speaker 9>Now what's a nano?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a different critic.</v>

3259
02:34:57.460 --> 02:34:58.960
<v Speaker 9>That's another critical coin.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3260
02:34:59.290 --> 02:35:02.530
<v Speaker 9>So what is the biggest one is bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3261
02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:04.270
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What's the second biggest one?</v>

3262
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:06.910
<v Speaker 9>Off of notoriety?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Probably a theory.</v>

3263
02:35:06.911 --> 02:35:08.500
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to be the second biggest I </v>
<v Speaker 9>would say.</v>

3264
02:35:08.570 --> 02:35:13.570
<v Speaker 9>Do you think it's possible that one day </v>
<v Speaker 9>artists will invent their own crypto </v>

3265
02:35:15.101 --> 02:35:20.101
<v Speaker 9>coins and that's how they buy and trade </v>
<v Speaker 9>tickets to shows and goods from the </v>

3266
02:35:21.221 --> 02:35:22.480
<v Speaker 9>people that support them.</v>

3267
02:35:23.690 --> 02:35:27.580
<v Speaker 9>Like think about this golden pony </v>
<v Speaker 9>dollars,</v>

3268
02:35:28.390 --> 02:35:30.850
<v Speaker 9>golden pony dogs is how people pay for </v>
<v Speaker 9>your shows.</v>

3269
02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:34.450
<v Speaker 9>You set up like a bank of Golden Polo </v>
<v Speaker 9>Pony Dot Crypto Bank.</v>

3270
02:35:34.451 --> 02:35:39.451
<v Speaker 9>I don't know how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You do some blockchain voodoo magic </v>

3271
02:35:39.451 --> 02:35:39.760
<v Speaker 9>programmer type shit figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 9>do that.</v>

3272
02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:44.820
<v Speaker 9>Then once you set that up,</v>
<v Speaker 9>people by that Golden Pony money in </v>

3273
02:35:45.371 --> 02:35:49.060
<v Speaker 9>order to be able to pay you golden pony </v>
<v Speaker 9>money for things,</v>

3274
02:35:49.210 --> 02:35:54.210
<v Speaker 9>but you only accept golden pony money </v>
<v Speaker 9>and only you can only spend golden pony </v>

3275
02:35:54.210 --> 02:35:59.101
<v Speaker 9>money.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So the only people that accept your </v>

3276
02:35:59.101 --> 02:36:01.380
<v Speaker 9>money,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the people that accept you if you want </v>

3277
02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:01.380
<v Speaker 9>to buy a washing machine,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I'd like to buy it.</v>

3278
02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:01.780
<v Speaker 9>Wasn't Golden Tony Dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're like,</v>

3279
02:36:01.850 --> 02:36:03.070
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

3280
02:36:03.090 --> 02:36:06.160
<v Speaker 9>like you have to like you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They'd go,</v>

3281
02:36:06.161 --> 02:36:06.610
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Tony,</v>

3282
02:36:06.611 --> 02:36:08.020
<v Speaker 9>you're a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're funny.</v>

3283
02:36:08.170 --> 02:36:11.800
<v Speaker 9>I Really Love Yon Killed Tony and you </v>
<v Speaker 9>stand up special on Netflix was a hoot.</v>

3284
02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:15.250
<v Speaker 9>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we'll let you pay it golden pony dollars</v>

3285
02:36:15.610 --> 02:36:19.060
<v Speaker 9>and then you could buy a washing machine</v>
<v Speaker 9>with golden pony dollars and that golden</v>

3286
02:36:19.061 --> 02:36:23.830
<v Speaker 9>pony dollars will be traded exclusively </v>
<v Speaker 9>through golden pony fans and so like you</v>

3287
02:36:23.831 --> 02:36:27.010
<v Speaker 9>really are reliant upon your fans in a </v>
<v Speaker 9>way different way,</v>

3288
02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:30.730
<v Speaker 9>like you're only getting paid by your </v>
<v Speaker 9>fans and when they want out they're like</v>

3289
02:36:30.731 --> 02:36:34.000
<v Speaker 9>fuck this golden pony money.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to give me some of that.</v>

3290
02:36:34.001 --> 02:36:37.330
<v Speaker 9>Sinbad dollars go on some sinbad </v>
<v Speaker 9>shekels,</v>

3291
02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:40.210
<v Speaker 9>but they still would have to cash out </v>
<v Speaker 9>with me,</v>

3292
02:36:40.211 --> 02:36:41.380
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

3293
02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:42.940
<v Speaker 9>no.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They don't have to cash out with you the</v>

3294
02:36:42.941 --> 02:36:44.380
<v Speaker 9>cash out with somebody else's in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>group,</v>

3295
02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:49.680
<v Speaker 9>like a certain amount of money to stays </v>
<v Speaker 9>in the group just like they do with </v>

3296
02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:50.320
<v Speaker 9>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like there's a certain amount of bitcoin</v>

3297
02:36:50.321 --> 02:36:53.440
<v Speaker 9>that exists and the price of bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 9>will go up and down,</v>

3298
02:36:53.441 --> 02:36:54.760
<v Speaker 9>but the number will not change.</v>

3299
02:36:55.390 --> 02:37:00.390
<v Speaker 9>And so that's their remedy against the </v>
<v Speaker 9>modern system that we have with </v>

3300
02:37:00.390 --> 02:37:01.630
<v Speaker 9>inflation and printing new money and all</v>
<v Speaker 9>that shit.</v>

3301
02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:03.300
<v Speaker 9>So there's only a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 9>bitcoin.</v>

3302
02:37:03.310 --> 02:37:04.840
<v Speaker 9>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If I'm butchering this,</v>

3303
02:37:04.841 --> 02:37:06.550
<v Speaker 9>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not smart.</v>

3304
02:37:07.330 --> 02:37:12.330
<v Speaker 9>I have a little variations we appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 9>and so if you did that with golden pony </v>

3305
02:37:13.241 --> 02:37:18.241
<v Speaker 9>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you would set up like a golden pony </v>

3306
02:37:18.241 --> 02:37:18.241
<v Speaker 9>fund.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like this is,</v>

3307
02:37:18.241 --> 02:37:18.241
<v Speaker 9>this is the bit coin that I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3308
02:37:18.290 --> 02:37:23.290
<v Speaker 9>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've calculated this out with a current </v>

3309
02:37:23.290 --> 02:37:27.551
<v Speaker 9>bitcoin prices.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If I charge you guys 20 bucks for this </v>

3310
02:37:27.551 --> 02:37:27.650
<v Speaker 9>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

3311
02:37:27.651 --> 02:37:29.540
<v Speaker 9>then whatever you call the number,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the name,</v>

3312
02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:34.680
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what you'll be able to do is you'll be </v>

3313
02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:37.541
<v Speaker 9>able to pay for my shows only using that</v>
<v Speaker 9>dissolve I'm going to accept now.</v>

3314
02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:41.330
<v Speaker 9>And then I want to be able to use that </v>
<v Speaker 9>to buy things from your store.</v>

3315
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:47.710
<v Speaker 9>Sounds confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to let people keep using </v>

3316
02:37:47.710 --> 02:37:47.710
<v Speaker 9>normal money.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's very confusing.</v>

3317
02:37:47.710 --> 02:37:49.460
<v Speaker 9>It's very confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But the idea would be like,</v>

3318
02:37:49.461 --> 02:37:51.590
<v Speaker 9>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you have some golden pony dollars.</v>

3319
02:37:51.591 --> 02:37:54.110
<v Speaker 9>You got some George Lopez dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3320
02:37:54.111 --> 02:37:59.111
<v Speaker 9>like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there could be a bunch of people with </v>

3321
02:37:59.111 --> 02:38:01.961
<v Speaker 9>their own exchanges and it could be </v>
<v Speaker 9>worth something to you worth more or </v>

3322
02:38:01.961 --> 02:38:03.650
<v Speaker 9>less depending on how my other killing </v>
<v Speaker 9>it right now.</v>

3323
02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:07.130
<v Speaker 9>It's very confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's super confusing.</v>

3324
02:38:07.850 --> 02:38:12.850
<v Speaker 9>What I'm saying is it's entirely </v>
<v Speaker 9>possible that someone like snoop Dogg </v>

3325
02:38:13.310 --> 02:38:15.080
<v Speaker 9>who's going to come up with his own </v>
<v Speaker 9>bitcoin,</v>

3326
02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:20.540
<v Speaker 9>I could see would have to be someone </v>
<v Speaker 9>super baller that everybody would want </v>

3327
02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:20.540
<v Speaker 9>their,</v>
<v Speaker 9>their coin,</v>

3328
02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:25.360
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>would have to be someone like Kendrick </v>

3329
02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:25.360
<v Speaker 9>Lamar dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3330
02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:27.800
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>See if Kendrick Lamar puts out a bitcoin</v>

3331
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:30.320
<v Speaker 9>or cryptocurrency and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 9>hey fans,</v>

3332
02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:34.490
<v Speaker 9>this is the only way you could buy </v>
<v Speaker 9>tickets to my shows when I buy shit.</v>

3333
02:38:34.490 --> 02:38:37.250
<v Speaker 9>I want to buy shit only with this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's real money.</v>

3334
02:38:37.430 --> 02:38:42.430
<v Speaker 9>So if I want to buy a Ferrari with </v>
<v Speaker 9>Kendrick Lamar money better sell it to </v>

3335
02:38:42.430 --> 02:38:42.430
<v Speaker 9>me,</v>
<v Speaker 9>bitch,</v>

3336
02:38:42.430 --> 02:38:47.141
<v Speaker 9>because that's Kendrick Lamar.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Money is worth gold to all the Kendrick </v>

3337
02:38:47.141 --> 02:38:50.380
<v Speaker 9>Lamar fans.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It would have to be somewhat of like a </v>

3338
02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:52.841
<v Speaker 9>super,</v>
<v Speaker 9>super high profile to do something like </v>

3339
02:38:52.841 --> 02:38:52.841
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Some interesting stuff.</v>

3340
02:38:52.841 --> 02:38:53.540
<v Speaker 9>It's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You look at your falling asleep.</v>

3341
02:38:54.050 --> 02:38:55.370
<v Speaker 9>He's barely staying awake.</v>
<v Speaker 9>For me,</v>

3342
02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:59.610
<v Speaker 9>this is sort of sort of describing one </v>
<v Speaker 9>cryptocurrency.</v>

3343
02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:04.630
<v Speaker 9>This is called steam or steemit,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is the website that you can look </v>

3344
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:05.840
<v Speaker 9>at sort of brand.</v>
<v Speaker 9>None of us the way like dig.com.</v>

3345
02:39:05.841 --> 02:39:09.260
<v Speaker 9>Look very similar to this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's like how that started and so here,</v>

3346
02:39:09.261 --> 02:39:11.010
<v Speaker 9>what would happen,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how you,</v>

3347
02:39:11.011 --> 02:39:16.011
<v Speaker 9>you would have to exchange some money or</v>
<v Speaker 9>another cryptocurrency to get some </v>

3348
02:39:16.011 --> 02:39:16.011
<v Speaker 9>actual esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but here is the,</v>

3349
02:39:16.011 --> 02:39:20.861
<v Speaker 9>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 9>have you have a person put up a really </v>

3350
02:39:20.861 --> 02:39:21.980
<v Speaker 9>good article or a piece of content if </v>
<v Speaker 9>you will,</v>

3351
02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:27.400
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you upvote it and then that person gets </v>

3352
02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:30.070
<v Speaker 9>a coin,</v>
<v Speaker 9>are money from you essentially gets </v>

3353
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.070
<v Speaker 9>esteem coin.</v>

3354
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:33.470
<v Speaker 9>You upvoted with a coin and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 9>very early or primitive way I guess </v>

3355
02:39:34.371 --> 02:39:37.100
<v Speaker 9>describing what you would do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So like a PR person creates content,</v>

3356
02:39:37.101 --> 02:39:42.101
<v Speaker 9>puts it online,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and then the viewers than exchange a </v>

3357
02:39:42.101 --> 02:39:44.060
<v Speaker 9>currency for currency only exists in </v>
<v Speaker 9>this,</v>

3358
02:39:44.210 --> 02:39:46.130
<v Speaker 9>in this platform,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but yet had then you can exchange.</v>

3359
02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:49.460
<v Speaker 9>Then if another exchange anywhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 9>world wants to start up and say like,</v>

3360
02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:54.560
<v Speaker 9>I deem your currency valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can exchange it for my currency or </v>

3361
02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:58.790
<v Speaker 9>in another currency.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's where that value comes to </v>

3362
02:39:58.790 --> 02:39:58.790
<v Speaker 9>see.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now that makes sense.</v>

3363
02:39:58.790 --> 02:40:03.101
<v Speaker 9>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 9>especially if people are paying for </v>

3364
02:40:03.101 --> 02:40:05.051
<v Speaker 9>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like if you're writing things or making </v>

3365
02:40:05.051 --> 02:40:05.051
<v Speaker 9>videos or something like that and then </v>
<v Speaker 9>people are paying for that,</v>

3366
02:40:05.051 --> 02:40:06.110
<v Speaker 9>that's a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3367
02:40:06.111 --> 02:40:11.111
<v Speaker 9>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're trapped in this idea of this </v>

3368
02:40:11.111 --> 02:40:13.600
<v Speaker 9>system that we have now as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 9>producers of television shows and movies</v>

3369
02:40:13.741 --> 02:40:18.741
<v Speaker 9>and things like that that this is like </v>
<v Speaker 9>how you get a job in show business that </v>

3370
02:40:18.741 --> 02:40:22.221
<v Speaker 9>seems like how you get a job at show </v>
<v Speaker 9>business if you can make videos and </v>

3371
02:40:22.221 --> 02:40:23.900
<v Speaker 9>people will give you money for those </v>
<v Speaker 9>videos.</v>

3372
02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:26.180
<v Speaker 6>Kind of what youtube is and lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people have made money off youtube.</v>

3373
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:29.490
<v Speaker 6>We're dealing in dollars and in the old </v>
<v Speaker 6>system,</v>

3374
02:40:29.491 --> 02:40:34.491
<v Speaker 6>but this seems like more next level </v>
<v Speaker 6>could be the new system might take over </v>

3375
02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:34.491
<v Speaker 6>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Paul.</v>

3376
02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:35.550
<v Speaker 6>Fascinating too because it could be a </v>
<v Speaker 6>blog,</v>

3377
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:37.410
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It could be a video.</v>

3378
02:40:37.470 --> 02:40:39.060
<v Speaker 6>What else could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This could be anything.</v>

3379
02:40:39.061 --> 02:40:41.820
<v Speaker 6>This is literally just linked so they </v>
<v Speaker 6>haven't.</v>

3380
02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:46.900
<v Speaker 6>I don't think this platform is opened up</v>
<v Speaker 6>to having like its own video hosting or </v>

3381
02:40:46.900 --> 02:40:48.190
<v Speaker 6>music being hosted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that would be amazing if you could.</v>

3382
02:40:48.191 --> 02:40:48.430
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3383
02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:53.640
<v Speaker 9>Like cool ass articles and people could </v>
<v Speaker 9>pay you base on the article that might </v>

3384
02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:54.500
<v Speaker 9>bring articles back,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

3385
02:40:55.370 --> 02:41:00.370
<v Speaker 9>I mean not that articles are gone away,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but there's a weird thing right now </v>

3386
02:41:00.370 --> 02:41:03.311
<v Speaker 9>where it's hard for people to get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Doing digital stuff is much as most </v>

3387
02:41:05.481 --> 02:41:10.481
<v Speaker 9>people don't want to subscribe to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I shouldn't say it's hard for people to </v>

3388
02:41:10.481 --> 02:41:14.351
<v Speaker 9>get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's hard for people to get people to </v>

3389
02:41:14.351 --> 02:41:15.260
<v Speaker 9>pay for digital stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I like to subscribe to an online website</v>

3390
02:41:15.261 --> 02:41:17.540
<v Speaker 9>or something done that's a tough sell.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know?</v>

3391
02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:23.620
<v Speaker 6>Medium.com</v>
<v Speaker 6>is sort of filled that hole a little </v>

3392
02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:25.901
<v Speaker 6>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you don't get directly paid from </v>

3393
02:41:25.901 --> 02:41:26.480
<v Speaker 6>posting on there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe people can get.</v>

3394
02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:30.230
<v Speaker 6>Make a medium post that had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has then gone viral and gotten them paid</v>

3395
02:41:30.231 --> 02:41:33.350
<v Speaker 6>in other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like explaining how they do a particular</v>

3396
02:41:33.351 --> 02:41:38.351
<v Speaker 6>thing and then that leads to their store</v>
<v Speaker 6>or they can sell some merge that way or </v>

3397
02:41:38.351 --> 02:41:39.220
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They might make a video that's in there.</v>

3398
02:41:39.250 --> 02:41:41.000
<v Speaker 6>Then they get you to money off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a.</v>

3399
02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:42.730
<v Speaker 6>it's also new,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that,</v>

3400
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:45.410
<v Speaker 6>that what you're describing could take </v>
<v Speaker 6>off from here.</v>

3401
02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:50.820
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it seems like if everybody decides to </v>

3402
02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:50.820
<v Speaker 9>accept that currency,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then it seems like it would take off.</v>

3403
02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:55.380
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>If everybody decided to accept that </v>

3404
02:41:55.380 --> 02:41:55.380
<v Speaker 9>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it just seems to me that there's,</v>

3405
02:41:55.380 --> 02:41:56.420
<v Speaker 9>if,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if bit.</v>

3406
02:41:56.590 --> 02:41:58.060
<v Speaker 9>There's a few tests,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

3407
02:41:58.061 --> 02:41:59.980
<v Speaker 9>There's bid corn,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's light coin is,</v>

3408
02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:03.220
<v Speaker 9>was that doggy coin,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Doge coin,</v>

3409
02:42:03.250 --> 02:42:08.250
<v Speaker 9>Doge coin.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's a few of those that are still </v>

3410
02:42:08.250 --> 02:42:10.441
<v Speaker 9>like volatile and still hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I saw some article recently about these </v>

3411
02:42:10.441 --> 02:42:12.310
<v Speaker 9>young guys that were multimillionaires </v>
<v Speaker 9>from cryptocurrency,</v>

3412
02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:14.140
<v Speaker 9>like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

3413
02:42:14.850 --> 02:42:15.120
<v Speaker 9>real</v>

3414
02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:17.510
<v Speaker 6>the millionaire or multimillionaire and </v>
<v Speaker 6>cryptocurrency.</v>

3415
02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:22.530
<v Speaker 6>Like what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Same as a stock person because they </v>

3416
02:42:22.530 --> 02:42:22.530
<v Speaker 6>might have a bunch of money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then it's,</v>

3417
02:42:22.530 --> 02:42:23.180
<v Speaker 6>some of it's also in stock,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3418
02:42:23.210 --> 02:42:25.640
<v Speaker 6>Could they win?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How quickly could they liquidate?</v>

3419
02:42:25.650 --> 02:42:27.830
<v Speaker 6>It?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somewhat depends on exchanges.</v>

3420
02:42:27.831 --> 02:42:30.210
<v Speaker 6>Some of it's 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of it's a couple days.</v>

3421
02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:33.620
<v Speaker 6>It depends on the actual coin and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way the blockchain works.</v>

3422
02:42:33.930 --> 02:42:35.860
<v Speaker 9>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Crazy.</v>

3423
02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:38.700
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's very crazy.</v>

3424
02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:40.680
<v Speaker 9>It's very crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>

3425
02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:41.520
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to be.</v>

3426
02:42:41.521 --> 02:42:42.600
<v Speaker 9>When I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>

3427
02:42:42.601 --> 02:42:47.601
<v Speaker 9>I always wonder how long it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 9>take before we shake ourselves of this </v>

3428
02:42:47.601 --> 02:42:51.630
<v Speaker 9>system because this system is good as it</v>
<v Speaker 9>is and it's definitely good.</v>

3429
02:42:51.930 --> 02:42:56.820
<v Speaker 9>It's still super complicated and flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's very confusing.</v>

3430
02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:00.930
<v Speaker 9>What's legal and what's illegal and why </v>
<v Speaker 9>you have to pay taxes in one place,</v>

3431
02:43:00.931 --> 02:43:04.290
<v Speaker 9>but you crossed the line and the taxes </v>
<v Speaker 9>are way less.</v>

3432
02:43:04.291 --> 02:43:07.350
<v Speaker 9>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like over here,</v>

3433
02:43:07.351 --> 02:43:11.830
<v Speaker 9>you don't pay state taxes at all,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but over there you do what?</v>

3434
02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Like a lot of this stuff</v>

3435
02:43:13.570 --> 02:43:18.570
<v Speaker 9>that we operate,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a lot of the system that we have is </v>

3436
02:43:18.570 --> 02:43:18.570
<v Speaker 9>fucking won.</v>

3437
02:43:18.570 --> 02:43:19.780
<v Speaker 5>He Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The tax system is just one of them,</v>

3438
02:43:19.781 --> 02:43:20.920
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3439
02:43:21.130 --> 02:43:23.650
<v Speaker 5>It's all messed up and then a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3440
02:43:23.651 --> 02:43:25.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just whatever,</v>

3441
02:43:25.450 --> 02:43:28.900
<v Speaker 5>build a account overseas and avoid it </v>
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>

3442
02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:29.950
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me that</v>

3443
02:43:29.980 --> 02:43:34.980
<v Speaker 9>what I was gonna say is that if </v>
<v Speaker 9>something like a crypto currency can </v>

3444
02:43:34.980 --> 02:43:35.620
<v Speaker 9>really take off and just get fully </v>
<v Speaker 9>accepted,</v>

3445
02:43:35.621 --> 02:43:39.490
<v Speaker 9>you switch to a more accepted now than </v>
<v Speaker 9>it was a few years ago when Antonopoulos</v>

3446
02:43:39.491 --> 02:43:43.630
<v Speaker 9>first started coming on here and I think</v>
<v Speaker 9>you could sort of extrapolate that five,</v>

3447
02:43:43.631 --> 02:43:46.060
<v Speaker 9>maybe even 10 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It might be like really commonplace.</v>

3448
02:43:46.210 --> 02:43:48.010
<v Speaker 9>There's a lot of things you buy with </v>
<v Speaker 9>bitcoin now.</v>

3449
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:53.070
<v Speaker 9>A lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's really kind of interesting in that </v>

3450
02:43:53.070 --> 02:43:53.070
<v Speaker 9>way.</v>

3451
02:43:53.070 --> 02:43:53.100
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>

3452
02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:56.090
<v Speaker 9>If that works out and crypto coins </v>
<v Speaker 9>become a real thing,</v>

3453
02:43:56.091 --> 02:43:58.700
<v Speaker 9>crypto currency becomes a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's totally possible that can move into</v>

3454
02:43:58.701 --> 02:44:03.701
<v Speaker 9>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That kind of thinking of organizing and </v>

3455
02:44:03.701 --> 02:44:07.691
<v Speaker 9>like setting up a party and deciding on </v>
<v Speaker 9>important issues that all could happen </v>

3456
02:44:08.330 --> 02:44:12.140
<v Speaker 9>the same way that all could happen </v>
<v Speaker 9>through some sort of an online app where</v>

3457
02:44:12.141 --> 02:44:13.880
<v Speaker 9>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>fuck all this voting shit.</v>

3458
02:44:14.210 --> 02:44:16.350
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we have this new super secure thing that</v>

3459
02:44:16.351 --> 02:44:20.030
<v Speaker 9>elan musk figured it out and now </v>
<v Speaker 9>everybody,</v>

3460
02:44:20.031 --> 02:44:25.031
<v Speaker 9>all they have to do is have a cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 9>number and they take a photo of </v>

3461
02:44:25.031 --> 02:44:27.320
<v Speaker 9>themselves as they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So it's biometric,</v>

3462
02:44:27.321 --> 02:44:29.210
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So you know that someone's not cheating.</v>

3463
02:44:29.810 --> 02:44:33.220
<v Speaker 9>You can take a photo of you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you put in your vote and you do.</v>

3464
02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:38.530
<v Speaker 9>You have little videos for each issue.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Can Watch little videos on your phone </v>

3465
02:44:38.530 --> 02:44:39.500
<v Speaker 9>tells you exactly what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 9>these gestures here.</v>

3466
02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:44.560
<v Speaker 9>People who are pro it here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>people are content and it's like one of </v>

3467
02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:44.560
<v Speaker 9>those things where like if you ever </v>
<v Speaker 9>test,</v>

3468
02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:44.780
<v Speaker 9>take a test online,</v>

3469
02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:46.470
<v Speaker 5>have you ever done one of them?</v>

3470
02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:49.980
<v Speaker 9>The end press send and you press it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know all the results,</v>

3471
02:44:49.981 --> 02:44:53.010
<v Speaker 9>all you got 90 percent right,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and so you move on.</v>

3472
02:44:53.970 --> 02:44:55.590
<v Speaker 5>That could be the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3473
02:44:55.591 --> 02:44:58.320
<v Speaker 5>it could be something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those things are so easily beatable.</v>

3474
02:44:58.321 --> 02:45:03.321
<v Speaker 5>I decided to do that for traffic school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get out of a ticket a couple of weeks </v>

3475
02:45:03.321 --> 02:45:03.321
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so ridiculous.</v>

3476
02:45:03.321 --> 02:45:05.700
<v Speaker 5>It tells you which ones are wrong on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes or no,</v>

3477
02:45:05.701 --> 02:45:07.650
<v Speaker 5>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to try it again?</v>

3478
02:45:08.130 --> 02:45:08.820
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3479
02:45:08.821 --> 02:45:13.110
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think everyone's smart.</v>

3480
02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:16.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I finished a fun fact.</v>

3481
02:45:16.171 --> 02:45:19.350
<v Speaker 5>I finished traffic school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's supposed to be this huge test?</v>

3482
02:45:19.351 --> 02:45:20.070
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3483
02:45:20.190 --> 02:45:21.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe nine minutes.</v>

3484
02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:24.600
<v Speaker 5>Just next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next,</v>

3487
02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.800
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then fix the answers.</v>

3488
02:45:28.801 --> 02:45:31.530
<v Speaker 5>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could do that with voting.</v>

3489
02:45:32.490 --> 02:45:34.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could totally do that with voting.</v>

3490
02:45:34.380 --> 02:45:36.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hundred percent.</v>

3491
02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:38.490
<v Speaker 9>They don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Didn't want it to be that easy.</v>

3492
02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:41.730
<v Speaker 9>And that's when there's going to be real</v>
<v Speaker 9>weird shit were like Logan.</v>

3493
02:45:41.731 --> 02:45:45.360
<v Speaker 9>Paul manipulates the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3494
02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:48.270
<v Speaker 9>Like I don't mean it illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean like saying,</v>

<v Speaker 5>a cartoon character becoming the leader.</v>

3499
02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:02.810
<v Speaker 5>Black mayor always has the best ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always late to the party.</v>

3500
02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:08.440
<v Speaker 5>I think it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Kanye could do it in 20 slash </v>

3501
02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:08.440
<v Speaker 5>20.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he runs,</v>

3502
02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:09.260
<v Speaker 5>he'll fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't do well under that of</v>

3503
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.750
<v Speaker 4>falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could get you the role.</v>

3504
02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:13.050
<v Speaker 9>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's not that guy.</v>

3505
02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:16.500
<v Speaker 9>He's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Trump guy trump let's that shit roll off</v>

3506
02:46:16.501 --> 02:46:21.501
<v Speaker 9>his back.</v>
<v Speaker 9>For most people that stuff devastating </v>

3507
02:46:21.501 --> 02:46:23.930
<v Speaker 9>like I don't think it's a coincidence </v>
<v Speaker 9>that Kanye had that event where he </v>

3508
02:46:23.930 --> 02:46:24.990
<v Speaker 9>talked about supporting trump that he </v>
<v Speaker 9>would've voted on trump.</v>

3509
02:46:24.991 --> 02:46:28.470
<v Speaker 9>That's what he said it and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 9>went crazy and then he went crazy and he</v>

3510
02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:33.240
<v Speaker 9>checked himself into a eight days for </v>
<v Speaker 9>eight days in the hospital.</v>

3511
02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:35.180
<v Speaker 9>Like it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

3512
02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:36.990
<v Speaker 9>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's not a person who's good,</v>

3513
02:46:37.170 --> 02:46:39.360
<v Speaker 9>who knows what the fuck was going on </v>
<v Speaker 9>outside of that.</v>

3514
02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:43.680
<v Speaker 9>But the scrutiny it compounded it with </v>
<v Speaker 9>no question at all.</v>

3515
02:46:43.710 --> 02:46:48.710
<v Speaker 9>When a bunch of people are mad at you </v>
<v Speaker 9>and all your fans are mad at you and </v>

3516
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.710
<v Speaker 9>then you wind up canceling the whole </v>
<v Speaker 9>tour.</v>

3517
02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:50.970
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3518
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:52.410

<v Speaker 9>that guy.</v>

3519
02:46:52.411 --> 02:46:55.650
<v Speaker 9>Shouldn't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>obviously shouldn't be president,</v>

3520
02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:57.270
<v Speaker 9>but I don't even think she's try.</v>

3521
02:46:57.570 --> 02:47:02.570
<v Speaker 9>I just don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just seems like a lot of pressure for </v>

3522
02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:05.181
<v Speaker 9>them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And these fucking great musician make </v>

3523
02:47:05.181 --> 02:47:07.440

3524
02:47:07.690 --> 02:47:09.720
<v Speaker 9>Like when do you think we're ever going </v>
<v Speaker 9>to get off of this?</v>

3525
02:47:09.721 --> 02:47:10.620
<v Speaker 9>Like people keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3526
02:47:10.621 --> 02:47:15.621
<v Speaker 9>Alec Baldwin,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can actually run and win for the </v>

3527
02:47:15.621 --> 02:47:15.870
<v Speaker 9>Democrats came.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Maybe could you might be right.</v>

3528
02:47:15.871 --> 02:47:20.010
<v Speaker 9>He might be able to totally put when.</v>
<v Speaker 9>When do we say,</v>

3529
02:47:20.011 --> 02:47:20.760
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we need.</v>

3530
02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:22.920
<v Speaker 9>We need to rethink this whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 9>system.</v>

3531
02:47:23.310 --> 02:47:25.890
<v Speaker 9>We can't keep letting popular people run</v>
<v Speaker 9>the country.</v>

3532
02:47:26.130 --> 02:47:28.440
<v Speaker 9>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I have to do is to be popular.</v>

3533
02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:29.610
<v Speaker 9>I like him more.</v>

3534
02:47:30.290 --> 02:47:32.510
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's been the thing forever.</v>

3535
02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:35.780
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

3536
02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:41.220
<v Speaker 9>Shouldn't you have to take a test?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And we find out who would be best at </v>

3537
02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:41.220
<v Speaker 9>running the country.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like shouldn't it be a test?</v>

3538
02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:46.051
<v Speaker 9>Like there's a test for the driver's </v>
<v Speaker 9>license for graphics test for traveling </v>

3539
02:47:46.051 --> 02:47:47.920
<v Speaker 9>school.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why is there a test for president?</v>

3540
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:49.240
<v Speaker 9>Shouldn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You'd be like,</v>

3541
02:47:49.810 --> 02:47:54.810
<v Speaker 9>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You have to have some good answers to </v>

3542
02:47:54.810 --> 02:47:54.810
<v Speaker 9>some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They pose it you.</v>

3543
02:47:54.810 --> 02:47:55.180
<v Speaker 9>It's the most ridiculous job ever </v>
<v Speaker 9>because it was.</v>

3544
02:47:55.510 --> 02:48:00.400
<v Speaker 9>It was created so long ago that has so </v>
<v Speaker 9>many holes in the idea behind it.</v>

3545
02:48:00.850 --> 02:48:04.660
<v Speaker 9>Like you don't have to eat at least know</v>
<v Speaker 9>how to run the country like Pe.</v>

3546
02:48:04.690 --> 02:48:06.610
<v Speaker 9>Shouldn't.</v>

3574
02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:31.750
<v Speaker 9>Probably a different LLC or something.</v>

<v Speaker 9>go multiple lawsuits.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is what this guy lives for.</v>

3587
02:50:08.811 --> 02:50:12.060
<v Speaker 4>He lives for watching the news and </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing him on it every day.</v>

3588
02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Is that what they think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll show them that this whole thing.</v>

3589
02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:20.800
<v Speaker 4>It's so real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything from the insight and </v>

3590
02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:20.800
<v Speaker 4>everything I've ever heard about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy says that,</v>

3591
02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:21.680
<v Speaker 4>that he's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3592
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:23.890
<v Speaker 9>how much longer do you think you could </v>
<v Speaker 9>do it?</v>

<v Speaker 9>At what age do you start to get worn out</v>
<v Speaker 9>by all this shit?</v>

3594
02:50:28.300 --> 02:50:33.300
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We think of the kind of hate Kanye got </v>

3595
02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:36.600
<v Speaker 9>for supporting trump.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now think of the kind of hate trump </v>

02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:37.660
<v Speaker 9>gets.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It is some next level stuff.</v>

3597
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:43.190
<v Speaker 9>I mean the you have to have some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 9>resolve to be able to absorb that kind </v>

3598
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.190

<v Speaker 9>some of it though,</v>

3600
02:50:44.170 --> 02:50:47.020
<v Speaker 9>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But they might hide him from some of it,</v>

3601
02:50:47.050 --> 02:50:49.090
<v Speaker 9>but some of it they actually project on </v>
<v Speaker 9>his building.</v>

3602
02:50:50.410 --> 02:50:52.780
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they project it on his building.</v>

3603
02:50:52.990 --> 02:50:55.000

3618
02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:32.470

3619
02:51:32.471 --> 02:51:35.890
<v Speaker 4>is because stone cold was so raw and a </v>

<v Speaker 5>I read a thing recently about how the </v>

3662
02:53:12.670 --> 02:53:16.201
<v Speaker 5>peoples elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which became his big finishing move and </v>

3663
02:53:16.201 --> 02:53:18.841
<v Speaker 5>it was sort of a joke that worked so </v>
<v Speaker 5>well with the crowd that they all just </v>

3664
02:53:18.841 --> 02:53:20.710
<v Speaker 5>laughed about it backstage and it just </v>
<v Speaker 5>became this fucking.</v>

3665
02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:21.850
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you something.</v>

3666
02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:23.970
<v Speaker 5>If this guy did this to actually do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>suit,</v>

3667
02:53:23.971 --> 02:53:25.990
<v Speaker 5>it would not feel good to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

3668
02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:28.810
<v Speaker 5>this is not a real finishing move per </v>
<v Speaker 5>se,</v>

3669
02:53:29.050 --> 02:53:31.390
<v Speaker 5>but that could fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially a big strong guy.</v>

3670
02:53:31.391 --> 02:53:33.280
<v Speaker 5>Like you're not that one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that one,</v>

3671
02:53:33.820 --> 02:53:36.100
<v Speaker 5>but some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because what he's doing is he's grabbing</v>

3672
02:53:36.101 --> 02:53:40.510
<v Speaker 5>the back of your head and slamming his </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoulder into your chin.</v>

3673
02:53:40.540 --> 02:53:41.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3674
02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:45.070
<v Speaker 5>that's semi legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I would not recommend doing it that</v>

3675
02:53:45.071 --> 02:53:47.710
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll look at the rock by laughing.</v>

3676
02:53:48.290 --> 02:53:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Stood up after he got some.</v>

3677
02:53:52.980 --> 02:53:55.060
<v Speaker 5>Uh Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at this.</v>

3678
02:53:55.061 --> 02:54:00.061
<v Speaker 5>That's Shane Mcmahon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we play that one again.</v>

3679
02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:01.450
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3680
02:54:01.451 --> 02:54:05.680
<v Speaker 5>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Classic Mcmahon thing to oversell like a</v>

3681
02:54:05.730 --> 02:54:08.170
<v Speaker 5>stunner like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Vince does it the best.</v>

3682
02:54:08.171 --> 02:54:12.280
<v Speaker 5>He convulses and shakes afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely have that though.</v>

3683
02:54:12.281 --> 02:54:13.690
<v Speaker 5>Because you're given the guy you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

3684
02:54:13.770 --> 02:54:15.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't recommend that at all.</v>

3685
02:54:15.790 --> 02:54:18.550
<v Speaker 5>That move now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could probably do it to me.</v>

3686
02:54:18.850 --> 02:54:20.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that would hurt.</v>

3687
02:54:20.350 --> 02:54:22.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the best move in the world.</v>

3688
02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:25.240
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not 100 percent legitimate.</v>

3689
02:54:25.930 --> 02:54:26.770
<v Speaker 5>There's brock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

3690
02:54:26.771 --> 02:54:28.660
<v Speaker 5>This is Shane Mcmahon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is actually.</v>

3691
02:54:28.810 --> 02:54:31.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really insane thing that this guy did.</v>

3692
02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:35.110
<v Speaker 5>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know Shane right now is probably.</v>

3693
02:54:35.111 --> 02:54:39.310
<v Speaker 5>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd say a 47.</v>

3694
02:54:39.460 --> 02:54:42.580
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not jumping off about 30 feet.</v>

3695
02:54:42.581 --> 02:54:45.520
<v Speaker 5>Thirty five feet up at least probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they actually say,</v>

3696
02:54:45.521 --> 02:54:48.640
<v Speaker 5>but get the fuck out of Shane Mcmahon </v>
<v Speaker 5>always does this.</v>

3697
02:54:48.641 --> 02:54:49.720
<v Speaker 5>He is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

3698
02:54:49.750 --> 02:54:50.620
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

3699
02:54:50.621 --> 02:54:53.950
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute onto a table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on a real table.</v>

3700
02:54:53.980 --> 02:54:55.870
<v Speaker 5>The undertakers about don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either way.</v>

3701
02:54:55.871 --> 02:55:00.871
<v Speaker 5>It's not a pad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The undertakers like,</v>

3702
02:55:00.971 --> 02:55:01.840
<v Speaker 5>don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

3703
02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:03.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to show it to you.</v>

3704
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:05.050
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I see.</v>

3705
02:55:05.051 --> 02:55:05.380
<v Speaker 9>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

3706
02:55:05.381 --> 02:55:07.360
<v Speaker 9>don't show it on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So he lands on that thing,</v>

3707
02:55:07.361 --> 02:55:08.920
<v Speaker 9>so it's a giant spring underneath them.</v>

3708
02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that thing?</v>

3709
02:55:11.300 --> 02:55:14.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just a breakaway table at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine.</v>

3710
02:55:14.300 --> 02:55:19.300
<v Speaker 2>It hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane that he did that and we </v>

3711
02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:19.300
<v Speaker 2>all thought he was pretty messed up </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

3712
02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:20.940
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's insane.</v>

3713
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:24.900
<v Speaker 7>Why did he do that Shit for the show?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

3714
02:55:24.901 --> 02:55:27.270
<v Speaker 7>That guy had to get really hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you get knocked out,</v>

3715
02:55:28.340 --> 02:55:29.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might be.</v>

3716
02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Might be coming out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

3717
02:55:31.590 --> 02:55:36.590
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the crazy things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just never know what's real and </v>

3718
02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:36.590
<v Speaker 2>what's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why got it?</v>

3719
02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mankind did that.</v>

3720
02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Mick Foley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who does the mandible claw,</v>

3721
02:55:38.430 --> 02:55:42.630
<v Speaker 2>he did that to the undertaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once he had a tooth go through his lip.</v>

3722
02:55:42.750 --> 02:55:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone does something like that,</v>

3723
02:55:44.911 --> 02:55:48.390
<v Speaker 2>like did they plan that out to the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they practice it or they just wait</v>

3724
02:55:48.391 --> 02:55:52.170
<v Speaker 2>to the moment and then do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that seems like a.</v>

3725
02:55:52.171 --> 02:55:57.171
<v Speaker 2>If you practice it and it hurt that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they might practice it maybe </v>

3726
02:55:57.171 --> 02:56:01.910
<v Speaker 2>with some type of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they practice it with </v>

3727
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:03.630
<v Speaker 2>a breakaway table and these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting on top of the roof.</v>

3728
02:56:03.780 --> 02:56:07.470
<v Speaker 2>This is the craziest one ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Helen is sell 1998.</v>

3729
02:56:07.471 --> 02:56:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Mankind is the undertaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

3730
02:56:11.191 --> 02:56:16.191
<v Speaker 2>Undertaker ends up choking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slamming him through the whole thing </v>

3731
02:56:16.191 --> 02:56:16.191
<v Speaker 2>into the ring from the top.</v>

3732
02:56:16.191 --> 02:56:19.160
<v Speaker 9>But you think you know more about pro </v>
<v Speaker 9>wrestling than I know about boxing.</v>

3733
02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

3734
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:26.910
<v Speaker 2>it's a wide field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's more in wrestling </v>

3735
02:56:26.910 --> 02:56:26.910
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to realize wrestling.</v>

3736
02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Wrestling's been a weekly sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most watched program on cable every </v>

3737
02:56:32.060 --> 02:56:35.791
<v Speaker 2>Monday since I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot more stuff that's </v>

3738
02:56:35.791 --> 02:56:35.791
<v Speaker 2>happened in pro wrestling.</v>

3739
02:56:35.791 --> 02:56:37.410
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But you know results,</v>

3740
02:56:37.411 --> 02:56:38.490
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3741
02:56:38.700 --> 02:56:42.470
<v Speaker 9>Like if I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

3742
02:56:42.510 --> 02:56:45.690
<v Speaker 9>do you know any results from boxing a </v>
<v Speaker 9>little bit?</v>

3743
02:56:45.770 --> 02:56:50.770
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>way more about this than you know about </v>

3744
02:56:50.770 --> 02:56:50.770
<v Speaker 9>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

3745
02:56:50.770 --> 02:56:50.770
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3746
02:56:50.770 --> 02:56:51.690
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You find that weird.</v>

3747
02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:53.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty big boxing fan.</v>

3748
02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I probably had more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Threw them off the top.</v>

3749
02:56:57.121 --> 02:56:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go.</v>

3750
02:56:57.930 --> 02:56:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3751
02:56:59.410 --> 02:57:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Where's he throw them onto?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

3752
02:57:00.751 --> 02:57:02.890
<v Speaker 2>that's the first time anything like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever happened.</v>

3753
02:57:02.891 --> 02:57:04.690
<v Speaker 2>So that crowd is literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3754
02:57:04.810 --> 02:57:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

3755
02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:07.150
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go fucked up.</v>

3756
02:57:07.190 --> 02:57:09.730
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like he got fucked up for real.</v>

3757
02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:13.750
<v Speaker 7>I don't think you can fall that far.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Knock fucked up unless you're in falling</v>

3758
02:57:13.751 --> 02:57:16.060
<v Speaker 7>into a giant pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These guys aren't falling.</v>

3759
02:57:16.090 --> 02:57:16.990
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

3760
02:57:18.110 --> 02:57:21.370
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mick Foley has like broken every bone in</v>

3761
02:57:21.740 --> 02:57:23.720
<v Speaker 2>every injury you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3762
02:57:23.721 --> 02:57:24.350
<v Speaker 2>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

3763
02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:27.040
<v Speaker 7>seemed to do a back flip and land right </v>
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

3764
02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:28.990
<v Speaker 7>Fuck that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3765
02:57:28.991 --> 02:57:31.780
<v Speaker 7>water's good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's a good move.</v>

3766
02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:34.510
<v Speaker 7>So they're doing it like that Ninja </v>
<v Speaker 7>show.</v>

3767
02:57:35.570 --> 02:57:37.270
<v Speaker 7>That's obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was on boxes.</v>

3768
02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:39.940
<v Speaker 7>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's protected.</v>

3769
02:57:40.180 --> 02:57:45.180
<v Speaker 9>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The whole dramatic thing that girls are </v>

3770
02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:45.180
<v Speaker 9>going,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh my God.</v>

3771
02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:45.180
<v Speaker 9>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the guys.</v>

3772
02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:45.900
<v Speaker 9>They're macho.</v>

3773
02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:49.110
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just felt fucking cage.</v>

3774
02:57:49.410 --> 02:57:50.980
<v Speaker 7>It fell through this gauge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

3775
02:57:50.981 --> 02:57:53.290
<v Speaker 7>Is that supposed to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was that an accident?</v>

3776
02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:54.940
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

3777
02:57:56.110 --> 02:57:59.390
<v Speaker 7>That may be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was supposed to happen the way it falls.</v>

3778
02:57:59.410 --> 02:58:04.410
<v Speaker 7>He fell into the center.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bet it was to happen because see how </v>

3779
02:58:04.410 --> 02:58:06.240
<v Speaker 7>the center sort of gave in now how would</v>
<v Speaker 7>they engineer something like that.</v>

3780
02:58:06.300 --> 02:58:09.540
<v Speaker 7>How will they make sure that they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>okay?</v>

3781
02:58:09.541 --> 02:58:11.310
<v Speaker 7>Like this is like a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

3782
02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:13.020
<v Speaker 7>I broke her leg.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did he?</v>

3783
02:58:13.170 --> 02:58:14.070
<v Speaker 7>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3784
02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:16.850
<v Speaker 7>don't show me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This show is canceled.</v>

3785
02:58:17.350 --> 02:58:21.530
<v Speaker 7>Can't watch somebody breaking their leg </v>
<v Speaker 7>for a play as essentially a play magic.</v>

3786
02:58:21.550 --> 02:58:24.030
<v Speaker 7>There's a play where you break your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3787
02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:25.890
<v Speaker 7>remember when people were criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 7>Spiderman,</v>

3788
02:58:26.970 --> 02:58:28.140
<v Speaker 7>spiderman,</v>
<v Speaker 7>musical people,</v>

02:58:28.141 --> 02:58:31.860

<v Speaker 7>slamming into the crowd or something.</v>

3790
02:58:33.090 --> 02:58:35.700
<v Speaker 7>I think somebody might have died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

3791
02:58:35.790 --> 02:58:37.920
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Because that's.</v>

3793
02:58:40.531 --> 02:58:45.531
<v Speaker 7>I think they got it wired though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Think they figured it out or don't show </v>
