00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the most uncomfortable moments in my life was me sitting next to Kareem</v>

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Abdul Jabbar.</v>

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.661
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

6
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I had to wildly uncomfortable moments that involved Kareem Abdul Jabbar.</v>

7
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

8
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>he just sat down on my radio show and I was like,</v>

9
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>you never see any,</v>

11
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>any guys in their seventies that are over six,</v>

12
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>seven or six,</v>

13
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

14
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I,</v>

15
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to bring you down you literally,</v>

17
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>but is there some syndrome or have you talked to somebody or how does it work?</v>

18
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Cause you just don't see seven footers that are 80 years old but yet you seem</v>

19
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>like you're in perfect health and I don't know how it works and if there's</v>

20
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>something that I'm not aware of.</v>

21
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

22
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

23
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.163
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

24
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>you know how you don't see a lot of old guys?</v>

25
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>They're like over six,</v>

26
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:50.971
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

27
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>They seem to go a little earlier in life.</v>

28
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>So my affect,</v>

29
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>the little short Jewish guys,</v>

30
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>the ones that go on forever,</v>

31
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>is there some connection correlation between the height and the short longevity?</v>

32
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.114
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

33
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about it.</v>

34
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

35
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

36
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.081
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

37
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

38
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>now I am this kind of comfortable.</v>

40
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>

41
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.301
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

42
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>but I need to bring this up.</v>

43
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

44
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:16.801
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>he did that to me.</v>

46
00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And then we're like dodger all star game or something,</v>

47
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:21.871
<v Speaker 1>celebrity game.</v>

48
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>And we're sitting next to each other waiting for the real dodger game to end in</v>

49
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

50
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>the time it was Sorta,</v>

52
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>dug out eating hot wings or something like this up on the Lowe's level.</v>

54
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>And some kid came by and said,</v>

55
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>could you sign my baseball?</v>

56
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And I signed this baseball.</v>

57
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>And then he handed it to Kareem Abdul Jabbar and he said,</v>

58
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>could you sign my baseball?</v>

59
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

60
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61

<v Speaker 1>He goes.</v>

151
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending the guy,</v>

152
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>but that guy has probably been bugged for autographs.</v>
