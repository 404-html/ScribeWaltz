00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.573
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen,</v>

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>but there's always going to be good people that do.</v>

4
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>They're always have bins from Amelia Earhart to fill in the blank.</v>

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>All throughout history has always been women that have figured out a way to</v>

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>achieve and do things that they really,</v>

7
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>truly enjoy doing.</v>

8
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Like our flight attendant,</v>

9
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>we got hijacked for the longest time I've ever been hijacked as an adult.</v>

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Tommy and I were having a fun little conversation and we ordered a little glass</v>

12
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>of wine because were gentlemen and we're on a business trip.</v>

13
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>We decided to have a little wine and we're sitting there,</v>

14
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.151
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and the woman came over and she made a joke about the temperature of the wine</v>

16
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.080
<v Speaker 1>and I made the mistake of going,</v>

17
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.030
<v Speaker 1>is it like you're apologizing?</v>

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.661
<v Speaker 1>It's too cold.</v>

20
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:50.111
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

21
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anybody apologize of wine.</v>

22
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:52.421
<v Speaker 1>It's too cold.</v>

23
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:52.601
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

24
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

25
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>if you remember the scene from sideways,</v>

27
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

28
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I've never really been much into one.</v>

29
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 1>The only time I drink wine is in church,</v>

30
00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>but there's a funny thing about wine.</v>

31
00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I knew a guy and the guy was a wine connoisseur and they brought him a bottle of</v>

32
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:06.221
<v Speaker 1>wine and said,</v>

33
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>should we put this in the refrigerator?</v>

34
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:08.521
<v Speaker 1>You strict,</v>

35
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>don't you touch it and put it in the refrigerator.</v>

36
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't you put a hand on that wine and bringing their voice?</v>

37
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was so funny,</v>

38
00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 1>but of course I don't drink.</v>

39
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>The only time I drink it a drunk.</v>

40
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>And he went on and on and on.</v>

41
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.853
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

42
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Speaker 1>To the point where I was lucky because I was in the window.</v>

43
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So I just abandoned Tommy.</v>

44
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I lifted up the window and I put my face to the glass and then I reached into my</v>

45
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 2>lap,</v>

46
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>talk bad.</v>

47
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>But I pulled up,</v>

48
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>pulled out my notepad and I started writing down and I wrote in my note pad,</v>

49
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>the flight attendant won't shut the fuck up.</v>

50
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I wrote that in my notes.</v>

52
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 2>I started writing it in front of her too.</v>

53
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

54
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

55
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:49.341

57
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:50.961
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

58
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 2>do you want something to drink?</v>

59
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.851
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

60
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

61

<v Speaker 2>this has to be addressed.</v>

68
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 2>When I said,</v>

78
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we got red or white.</v>

85
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.201

<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

87

<v Speaker 2>red.</v>

88
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 2>And then when she came back,</v>

89
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.690
<v Speaker 2>it was sideways.</v>

90
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Speaker 2>It was the summer.</v>

91
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.341
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

92
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 2>At Macy's,</v>

93
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 2>who when I worked at the hospital,</v>

94
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 2>they brought him the wine and he said,</v>

95
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:30.734
<v Speaker 2>should I chill this?</v>

96
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.930
<v Speaker 2>And we're talking about the most boring sentences.</v>

97
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.513
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

98
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.031
<v Speaker 2>these were,</v>

99
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:39.950
<v Speaker 2>these were incredibly boring census.</v>

100
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:40.784
<v Speaker 2>The worst.</v>

101
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.893
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

102
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 2>When she left,</v>

103
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 2>when she left and we go like,</v>

104
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck was that?</v>

105
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.373
<v Speaker 2>She left,</v>

106
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 2>she came back and I just made,</v>

107
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I just looked up.</v>

108
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

109
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 2>did you ever see the movie Simon [inaudible]?</v>

110
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.163
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

111
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 2>my favorite scene and that has a wine scene.</v>

112
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.123
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

113
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.731
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

114
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>She goes and I,</v>

115
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>this is when I zoned out,</v>

116
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>she was like Bruce Willis and [inaudible] and she was like not all right,</v>

117
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.490
<v Speaker 1>all the wine fall.</v>

118
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a great scene.</v>

119
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

120
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.993
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't stop.</v>

121
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know what's really fascinating before this happened,</v>

122
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>before this happened,</v>

123
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Tommy nailed her personality cause we may or may not have had</v>

124
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>before we got on that plane.</v>

125
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And so we were uh,</v>

126
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>it was just starting to kick in and mid flight and he goes,</v>

127
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:28.864
<v Speaker 1>you know when I think,</v>

128
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that they put her on this small plane because she can't work well with</v>

129
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>others and that the other students is don't like working with her.</v>

130
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>So they stick her on these small planes cause she doesn't,</v>

131
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't want to be around anybody.</v>

132
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>She's probably been doing this a long time and they know that she doesn't work</v>

133
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:43.924
<v Speaker 1>well with others.</v>

134
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>And then she came over and just right away gave us the ferocious ERBD.</v>

135
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

136
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>it was an ear beating was also,</v>

137
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>she gave us an ear beating on church,</v>

138
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>shutting off the phones to like everything else about her phone pressing this</v>

139
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:01.640
<v Speaker 1>button and we didn't have our phones on.</v>

140
00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we were resisting,</v>

141
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:03.641
<v Speaker 1>we shut our phones off,</v>

142
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>but she did it for the whole thing.</v>

143
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Like this is what I want you to do,</v>

144
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

145
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>You see this button?</v>

146
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I want you to press this button,</v>

147
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>not an airplane mode folks,</v>

148
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>not an airplane mode.</v>

149
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I want you to shut this button.</v>

150
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:15.574
<v Speaker 1>If you have an iPhone,</v>

151
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I want you to slide that over the to shut it off.</v>

152
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.593
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

153
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>she's going on and on and on it taking a long ass time.</v>

154
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And if you wanted to read a book or if you wanted to,</v>

155
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>listen to your Ipod,</v>

157
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

158
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>that's not happening.</v>

159
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.111
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

160
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with this nonsense you're dealing with and you can't even fight</v>

161
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>against that nonsense because if you argue at all about anything,</v>

162
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>they kick you off the plane.</v>

163
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

164
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.703
<v Speaker 1>She's got the power.</v>

165
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend that kicked off the plane because he was upset that they didn't</v>

166
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>find a seat for his son next to him.</v>

167
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't find anybody that was willing to move.</v>

168
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It was an hour and a half flight from San Francisco to Seattle.</v>

169
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a quick ass flight and they,</v>

170
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

172
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>

173
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>is it possible?</v>

174
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.431
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

175
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

176
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>we've tried.</v>

177
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.741
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing we can do.</v>

178
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:56.981
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

179
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I have a five year old though.</v>

180
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.811
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

181
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 1>why did you guys sell me a ticket?</v>

182
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I told you it was five years old.</v>

183
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a five year old sit by himself.</v>

184
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:03.800
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

185
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>he's terrified of flying in the first choice.</v>

186
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Like all I'm asking is someone,</v>

187
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 1>if you ask if someone could switch seats,</v>

188
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>and she said,</v>

189
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

190
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.161
<v Speaker 1>I've tried.</v>

191
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing we can do.</v>

192
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Please take your seat.</v>

193
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.071
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

194
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>you guys are the most unfathomably friendly airline.</v>

195
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys are horrible.</v>

196
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you're doing this.</v>

197
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's all he says.</v>

198
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>He goes and sits down and the fucking captain comes up to him,</v>

199
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:24.410
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

200
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

201
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.680
<v Speaker 1>you going to have to come off the same.</v>

202
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>They say you're aggressive and you're,</v>

203
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.481
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

204
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:29.314
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

205
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.681
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

206
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:30.041
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be,</v>

207
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:30.874
<v Speaker 1>you must be joking.</v>

208
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.271
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

209
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 1>all I asked is if they could find a seat for my son.</v>

210
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>I didn't use profanity.</v>

211
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I didn't raise my voice.</v>

212
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

213
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 1>you guys are the most unfairly friendly airline that I've ever seen.</v>

214
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.861
<v Speaker 1>That's all I said,</v>

215
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>because you weren't even willing to look for someone.</v>

216
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And they kicked him off the plane and he was like,</v>

217
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:47.381
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this.</v>

218
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:47.591
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

219
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aggressive.</v>

220
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.110
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

221
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>but we saw that was it.</v>

222
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>You and I that saw that?</v>

223
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Who did we see?</v>

224
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

225
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>we on a plane,</v>

226
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:55.950
<v Speaker 1>we saw two guys arguing about the,</v>

227
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:56.784
<v Speaker 1>the been,</v>

228
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.393
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

229
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know with me on that one,</v>

230
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.300
<v Speaker 2>people kicked out.</v>

231
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.133
<v Speaker 2>It might've been Ra.</v>

232
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lady to get kicked off or having attitude,</v>

233
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

234
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 2>about like her whole day.</v>

235
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.530
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

236
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

237
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 2>you put me later on this shit.</v>

238
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 2>And now me and him talking about it and she was just complaining,</v>

239
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:11.391
<v Speaker 2>complaining,</v>

240
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:11.811
<v Speaker 2>complaining,</v>

241
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

242
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 2>she was I think aggressive speaking to them.</v>

243
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Boom boot.</v>

244
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.070
<v Speaker 2>And I saw one who got kicked her whole family off and she had small children.</v>

245
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 2>She was breastfeeding one of them.</v>

246
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

247
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 2>we're going to taxi now and you need to,</v>

248
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

249
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 2>why did she get kicked off?</v>

250
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.660
<v Speaker 2>She gave the lady attitude about the flight attendant attitude when the flight</v>

251
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:35.744
<v Speaker 2>attendant asked her,</v>

252
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.613
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

253
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she asked her to stop breastfeeding while we were going to taxi,</v>

254
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>but she told her like,</v>

255
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just worry about the drinks while I'm breastfeeding?</v>

257
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.963
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

258
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

259
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 2>And then we stopped and they actually,</v>

260
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:50.121
<v Speaker 2>that one,</v>

261
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 2>they had police come out to the,</v>

262
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.051
<v Speaker 2>to the point,</v>

264
00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:53.760
<v Speaker 2>he didn't go back.</v>

265
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.460
<v Speaker 2>The police came out,</v>

266
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 2>they opened the door.</v>

267
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.660
<v Speaker 2>They just get off on the power is absolutely.</v>

268
00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.950
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes,</v>

269
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

270
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes they,</v>

271
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely want to protect themselves and they have to,</v>

272
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 2>you can't have somebody who's a,</v>

274
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 2>an actual threat right.</v>

275
00:07:10.141 --> 00:07:10.974
<v Speaker 2>The flight,</v>

276
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

277
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I think there's definitely a thrill and knowing that if somebody gives you kind</v>

278
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 2>of a little jab,</v>

279
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 2>kind of a little attitude,</v>

280
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 2>you can be like,</v>

281
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 2>I could fuck up your day right now.</v>

282
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

283
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>

284
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 2>pretty badly and I can justify it.</v>

285
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking about that,</v>

286
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>that this ability to hijack you.</v>

287
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the same thing because in a normal scenario,</v>

288
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to listen to this person.</v>

289
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>You're not stuck in a chair,</v>

290
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 1>literally strapped in with a fucking belt.</v>

291
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.990
<v Speaker 1>But you have to listen and then they can just hover over you and just shit in</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't feel right about it,</v>

330
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.980
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think it's an inability to read social cues?</v>

331
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

332

335
00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:45.011
<v Speaker 1>Arrow ability.</v>

336
00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:46.570
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't good at it or she didn't care.</v>

337
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:47.440
<v Speaker 1>She just wanted to talk.</v>

338
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:48.881
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

339
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:49.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

340
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.770
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people by the way,</v>

341
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.380
<v Speaker 1>are a little pilled up and they don't even know that.</v>

342
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them to talk to you like there's some every piece.</v>

343
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going to be okay folks.</v>

344
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Here's a few of those people that are an antidepressant.</v>

345
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.073
<v Speaker 1>The fuck up,</v>

346
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>super duper common.</v>

347
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the number of prescriptions sold,</v>

348
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>the number of anti a antidepressant prescriptions that are sold in this country</v>

349
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:12.630
<v Speaker 1>every year,</v>

350
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 1>it's staggering.</v>

351
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's like 30 million,</v>

352
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.720
<v Speaker 1>30 million people in it.</v>

353
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

354
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how many people are on antidepressants?</v>

355
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:20.491
<v Speaker 1>Let's just guess.</v>

356
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's about 30 million.</v>

361
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.780

408
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.230
<v Speaker 1>so they're not aware that they're being weird.</v>
