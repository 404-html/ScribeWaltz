00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.013
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>And we're live with Justin Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin,</v>

5
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very upset that gave you such a</v>

6
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>small badge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up with that?</v>

7
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's nice and tiny.</v>

8
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>They're not law enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So seems like you should have like,</v>

9
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 1>like you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some badge there.</v>

10
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>The summit forcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it doesn't it?</v>

12
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No law enforcement on my end.</v>

13
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And just the biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:28.480
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

15
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I read about your work in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>an online article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember where it was,</v>

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>but about coyotes in the urban area all</v>
<v Speaker 1>around Los Angeles and I've been</v>

18
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by this since I moved to La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I saw a coyote was in</v>

19
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>1994 when I first moved here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Burbank and uh,</v>

20
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I had an apartment and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>

21
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those uh,</v>

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>pre furnished Oakwood's gardens</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment on all of the street,</v>

23
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that is not the top of my head,</v>

24
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's where people always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they transitioned to La,</v>

25
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>they get one of these pre furnished</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartments.</v>

26
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

27
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm driving up olive and I saw these</v>

28
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>coyotes and is the first time I'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen a coyote and I was like,</v>

29
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is in Burbank,</v>

30
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>this is in a residential area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were just hanging out and I</v>

31
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>pulled over and I stopped and I rolled</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the window and I,</v>

32
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staring at them and they're staring at</v>

33
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:25.611
<v Speaker 1>me and they didn't give a shit about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were so calm and they didn't run</v>

34
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>and I just remember thinking this is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

35
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>He's like wild dogs that live like right</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst us.</v>

36
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>And then from then on I've had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters.</v>

37
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I had a coyote steal a chicken for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard.</v>

38
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I watched him hop the fence with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken in his mouth if quite a few</v>

39
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>encounters with coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

40
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely fascinated by them.</v>

41
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been amazing.</v>

42
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I've been working with them now for</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 15 years,</v>

43
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>actually a little bit more than that</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

44
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen him do some amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

45
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're able to live in some of the most</v>

46
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>urban environments we can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm tracking them right next to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know where the West</v>

48
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Lake neighborhood is in downtown la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if a coyote running that</v>

49
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which when I first drove through there,</v>

50
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>so I worked in Chicago for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were tracking coyotes and some</v>

51
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>incredibly urban areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

52
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>right along the lake shore drive in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago and,</v>

53
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>but in Chicago there's some green spots</v>
<v Speaker 1>where when you get down in La,</v>

54
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of open spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacant lots and stuff.</v>

55
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I tracked this coyote for about nine</v>

56
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>months down there in that area and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just amazing.</v>

57
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Like she was running the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kinda hang out in these little</v>

58
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>vacant lots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was even more amazing is that</v>

59
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>no one was really complaining about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually talked to people and some of</v>

60
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>the houses and stuff they were actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated to see on versus being like</v>

61
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>they're in my backyard where they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

62
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>People have always had a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with coyotes.</v>

63
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Dan Flores on the podcast last month</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the author of Coyote America.</v>

65
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

66
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife historian and it has just some</v>

67
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>amazing insight until like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to cody's had way back with</v>

68
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>the native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>they thought they were gods and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

70
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually listen to your podcast with</v>

71
00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:58.434
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

72
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Dan's some pretty interesting facts just</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his book in general,</v>

73
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>things I didn't actually know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

74
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of Nice to have a historian</v>
<v Speaker 1>tie in some of the facts I could get</v>

75
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask lots of questions about where the</v>

76
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>coyotes came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they're moving around.</v>

77
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's nice to have something like</v>

78
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Dan's book to kind of reference people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

79
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I think most people in the downtown La</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably welcomed something like caio</v>

80
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.790
<v Speaker 1>because it's kind of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and have this thing I can't get around</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you don't have a dog or a cat</v>

82
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>that it's snatches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's definitely the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think it's cool,</v>

84
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>but they do cause problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually dealing with one in Silver</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lake neighborhood that keeps going up to</v>

86
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>people walking their dogs and trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a den in somebody's backyard is</v>

87
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>actually deneen under their deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the decks open and she put our seven</v>

88
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>pups underneath this den.</v>

89
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty crazy.</v>

90
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she would basically,</v>

91
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>but he gets closed with a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She comes out and tries to run them off.</v>

92
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>And this is pretty common during pupping</v>
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>

93
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>This is the time when most people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues with coyotes because they're</v>

94
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>trying to protect their dens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're all obviously protective of</v>

95
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>our offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they think that the dog is going to</v>

96
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>find the pups and kill them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

97
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't really know why they're</v>

98
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We assume that's probably the case.</v>

99
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>They come up and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the attacks have been where they</v>

100
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>just come up behind the dog and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to like nip it.</v>

101
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>It's back and the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people move on,</v>

102
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.830
<v Speaker 1>people freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

103
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.760
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been anywhere that I would</v>

104
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>actually like draw blood on the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's almost more like,</v>

105
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like get the hell Outta here.</v>

106
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're just scaring them.</v>

107
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not actually being predators.</v>

108
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what it seems like for the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

109
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean they definitely do kill a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>

110
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Many occasionally end up fighting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>big dogs as well,</v>

111
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 1>but that's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

112
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they eating?</v>

113
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Like especially the one in downtown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

115
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've actually been doing this study</v>

116
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with a bunch of citizen</v>

117
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>scientists and I don't know if that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story you read or not,</v>

118
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 1>but we're basically having people</v>
<v Speaker 1>collect coyote scat from around downtown</v>

119
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>La and they were actually breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coyotes got up to look what's in it</v>

120
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>and we're seeing a huge variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

121
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of fruits and stuff.</v>

122
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>They were actually big time into</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetation,</v>

123
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>vegetation type stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fruits and an urban</v>

124
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we got peaches and plums and</v>

125
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of crazy fruity and stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take advantage of,</v>

126
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>but they're also eating rats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrels,</v>

127
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

128
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>insects.</v>

129
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>We see things like earwigs and those big</v>
<v Speaker 1>old potato bugs we'll see eating almost</v>

130
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>anything you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're taking advantage of human trash.</v>

131
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

132
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I've had him in my yard for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that surprised me</v>

133
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>is how much coyote scad that I find with</v>
<v Speaker 1>berries in it,</v>

134
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't know that there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>omnivores.</v>

135
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>They really are omnivores then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a,</v>

136
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>like a dog or a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they pretty much everything.</v>

137
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean coyotes can take advantage and</v>

138
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>that's why they're able to live amongst</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

139
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even when there's not a lot of</v>

140
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 1>prey available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did,</v>

141
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're able to take advantage of these</v>

142
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>different fruiting trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking with a friend about it and</v>

144
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that he hates them and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to kill them all and all this</v>

145
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

146
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

147
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>but ever noticed that you don't see any</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>

148
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>like we hardly have any rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's so rare that you see a rat or</v>

149
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>a mouse in my area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a big part of that is</v>

150
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>because you hear coyotes all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think they're eating them all.</v>

151
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean they definitely take advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

152
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's other predators to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure where you live exactly.</v>

153
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>The owls and hawks and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats and all those different things.</v>

154
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Definitely have of those praise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

155
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.731
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes,</v>

156
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are really are fascinating animals.</v>

157
00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one that got to downtown La,</v>

158
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when it arrived,</v>

159
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when it arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

160
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I kind of drove through there looking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see where I might be able to call her a</v>

161
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>few animals so we could kind of see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on and how these animals</v>

162
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>are persisting down there and actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

163
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I see of where they're possessed</v>

164
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.211
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

165
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:42.021
<v Speaker 1>how do I call her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

166
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>so first we have to capture them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll put out traps will capture them</v>

167
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>and then once I get them in a trap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go out with a poll,</v>

168
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll pin them to the ground and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hold him down.</v>

169
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

170
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll put a muzzle on them and hold their</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet together and then we'll throw a</v>

171
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 1>collar on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll take blood to look for disease.</v>

172
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't triangles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't tranquilize them.</v>

173
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

174
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually go very docile.</v>

175
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 1>They're a lot like a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you kind of show them that you're</v>

176
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>the dominant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of just lay over and you start</v>

177
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they can turn and bite you if</v>

178
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you don't muzzle them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But usually once you get them down that</v>

179
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>first time they usually just lay there</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you're done.</v>

180
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it usually takes me somewhere 35,</v>

181
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes to do the whole thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just lay there.</v>

182
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>They're not fighting me anything to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

183
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I do.</v>

184
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a trip.</v>

185
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I would think that there'd be like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild cat.</v>

186
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had a feral cat before and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had her when she was a kitten or he</v>

187
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 1>rather when he was a kitten and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a spazz,</v>

188
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>like you couldn't even hold onto him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would freak out and climb the</v>

189
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>curtains and Hisson sputter at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's like a little domestic cat</v>

190
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>that was born outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

191
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>We do drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of our cats we catch.</v>

192
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>So we catch a bobcat's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another study that we're doing a</v>

193
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 1>lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

194
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>we've actually had a bobcat project</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on since 1996.</v>

195
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>And so we've been calling those guys for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

196
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>They're not docile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not docile.</v>

197
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 1>We don't trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raccoons are another species.</v>

198
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't handle those guys on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

199
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine they'll make you pay the</v>
<v Speaker 1>price and that crazy.</v>

200
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raccoons are predators.</v>

201
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they're,</v>

202
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely omnivores.</v>

203
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Like just like the coyotes are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually had a lot of fruit and</v>

204
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:19.960
<v Speaker 1>stuff they take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

205
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Speaker 1>part of them living in an urban</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is they're just taking</v>

206
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>massive advantage of our garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

207
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've,</v>

208
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I've seen amazing photos of like 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 raccoons in one garbage can all</v>

209
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>feasting down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have chickens in my backyard and this</v>

210
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>one raccoon was by my chicken coop the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other day and I flashed a light on him</v>

211
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>and he walked towards the light.</v>

212
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this cocky bitch.</v>

213
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>He just started walking at me and I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous.</v>

214
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a weapon on me or nothing.</v>

215
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 1>I thought a flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

216
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get outta here.</v>

217
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>He's just looking right at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight,</v>

218
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:52.870
<v Speaker 1>walking towards me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>trying to get to the chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you'd be amazed how many people feed</v>

220
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>them because they're so dang cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

221
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Big Old mask on when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

222
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>they're starving out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't find their own food,</v>

223
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>and so they feel like they need feet on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same thing with coyotes to.</v>

224
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It's people feel like these animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't fend for themselves,</v>

225
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>which is ridiculous because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to make it there because we're</v>

226
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>feeding them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making it because there's</v>

227
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>resources for them to take advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

228
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine they probably play.</v>

229
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

230
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I think in my neighborhood they do play</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important part of keeping the rodent</v>

231
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>population down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in downtown there's got to be a ton</v>

232
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>of rodents as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean downtown for people that don't</v>

233
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>know is like the only area in all of La</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really looks like a city.</v>

234
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

235
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

236
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I drove through there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean after track and coyotes in</v>

237
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think they'd be in some areas</v>

238
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>they are in la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There seemed to be.</v>

239
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere I look I get photos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes on our cameras or get people</v>

240
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>reporting them to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one that's in downtown,</v>

241
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it's just a single caio by herself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

242
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:55.170
<v Speaker 1>actually she's got a whole pack so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>call her and then within a couple she</v>

243
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>was actually lactating when I caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

244
00:09:56.671 --> 00:10:01.671
<v Speaker 1>so I know she had pups and then we ended</v>
<v Speaker 1>up seeing her with five pops probably a</v>

245
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 1>week later and there was actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ambulance that drove by and she just</v>

246
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:10.890
<v Speaker 1>started howling and all the pups are out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there yipping and this is all like in</v>

247
00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 1>this little vacant lot between two</v>
<v Speaker 1>houses.</v>

248
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just find these areas where</v>

249
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 1>And so before we call it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I always heard is oh,</v>

251
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>the coyotes are coming in from griffith</v>
<v Speaker 1>park or they're coming in from Elysian</v>

252
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 1>park and coming into our communities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just here for a night or two</v>

253
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:29.270
<v Speaker 1>night causing problems and leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not what we're seeing.</v>

254
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we do these colors on these animals</v>

255
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

256
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>they've got pretty small home ranges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of living just in the urban</v>

257
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:37.680
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going back and forth while</v>

258
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>living with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you feel like it's a good thing or</v>

259
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 1>a bad thing to have them around or just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing?</v>

260
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it depends on your perspective.</v>

261
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bad when people think we</v>

262
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 1>need to feed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do these things,</v>

263
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>like to encourage them and make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>more comfortable with us.</v>

264
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>when bites and that kind of stuff</v>

265
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to the coyotes and</v>

266
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in these urban environments,</v>

267
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 1>it's really all about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more about managing people,</v>

268
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 1>getting people to quit feeding them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>

269
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I encourage people to do scare</v>

270
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>the stupid coyote off like because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of people that have little</v>

271
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>issues that occur with the coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cats get taken or the coyote</v>

272
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.490
<v Speaker 1>start just sitting there watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had somebody complained recently</v>

273
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:22.950
<v Speaker 1>because the that was sitting behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>their yard looking at their wife in the</v>

274
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Jacuzzi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

275
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:26.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

276
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

277
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>come on like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

278
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:31.000
<v Speaker 1>he has to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he really doesn't want it there,</v>

279
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.290
<v Speaker 1>go back there and turn the thing off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you that a coyote is staring at</v>

280
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 1>their wife.</v>

281
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be amazed.</v>

282
00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:39.210
<v Speaker 1>The calls we get about coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just.</v>

283
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.800
<v Speaker 1>People are still not comfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them being there even though they've</v>

284
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.190
<v Speaker 1>been there for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just people cannot get comfortable.</v>

285
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 1>The idea of there being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a medium sized Predator in these urban</v>

286
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 1>environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like the perfect size to almost</v>

287
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:53.100
<v Speaker 1>get away with it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

288
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a wolf.</v>

289
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Like if a wolf was around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody be freaking out.</v>

290
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Like it's too big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is like know 40 pounds,</v>

291
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:02.040
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>

292
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a big coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a small one?</v>

293
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our average is around 25 to 27</v>

294
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.171
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

295
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're really small.</v>

296
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I'm always like when</v>

297
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:12.330
<v Speaker 1>people are so scared of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

298
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that big of an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of small dogs are</v>

299
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:16.414
<v Speaker 1>bigger than that.</v>

300
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.280
<v Speaker 1>They're smart though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

301
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 1>They're really clever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>

302
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 1>He or she essentially what you would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

303
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dog and tricked my dog into a.</v>

304
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 1>do you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

305
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>what it's like when a chicken molts they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have chickens as well.</v>

306
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

307
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

308
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my chicken was molting so I had a</v>

309
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:38.770
<v Speaker 1>separate her from the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken so she wasn't in a nesting box</v>

310
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 1>and I put her in a cage by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you let them sit in a cage for a few</v>

311
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figure out that they don't really</v>

312
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 1>have an egg and then they go back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their normal behavior.</v>

313
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

314
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 1>this coyote was too small to knock over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cage,</v>

315
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.140
<v Speaker 1>but my massive is big enough to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she literally tricked my massive into</v>

316
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 1>coming out with her towards where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens are.</v>

317
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.330
<v Speaker 1>He knocks over the cage.</v>

318
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 1>She steals the chicken and hops over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fence.</v>

319
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see all this happen.</v>

320
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:14.310
<v Speaker 1>I caught him with another chicken in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth and uh,</v>

321
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you motherfucker.</v>

322
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 1>And then I see the coyote jumped over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fence with the chicken,</v>

323
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>like he was with the coyote right next</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

324
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was treating the kyle like,</v>

325
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 1>this is my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's cool.</v>

326
00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:31.060
<v Speaker 1>We hang out together and she tricked him</v>
<v Speaker 1>into knocking over this small pen</v>

327
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 1>because he's like 140 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just smashed that thing and broke it</v>

328
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 1>open and she grabbed the chicken thanks</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro oil and hopped over the fence.</v>

329
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 1>And I watched her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there,</v>

330
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I was playing like monopoly or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my wife and my kids are sitting in</v>

331
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>the living room and I see the coyote</v>
<v Speaker 1>running across the backyard with the</v>

332
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 1>chicken in its mouth and hopped over</v>
<v Speaker 1>this five foot fence.</v>

333
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Like it didn't even exist just just</v>
<v Speaker 1>right over the top of it.</v>

334
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

335
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're girly smart.</v>

336
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean heck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living downtown,</v>

337
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 1>they've got to be like crossing roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

338
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched them walk up to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>busy roads,</v>

339
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 1>they stop about 10 feet shy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of sit there listening.</v>

340
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll peek around the corner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look both ways and then they'll run</v>

341
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:13.380
<v Speaker 1>across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

342
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that they understand traffic</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>

343
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article I read yesterday</v>

344
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.700
<v Speaker 1>about coyotes and traffic lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's real evidence that coyotes</v>

345
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:25.810
<v Speaker 1>understand when that beep beep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that sound that they use for a</v>

346
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 1>blind people that coyotes understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that means the cars aren't allowed</v>

347
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.200
<v Speaker 1>to go and that's when they walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

348
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

349
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there.</v>

350
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible watching them move</v>
<v Speaker 1>around this urban environment and just</v>

351
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>dealing with us and dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic.</v>

352
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Like they get around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'll come out in the street</v>

353
00:14:42.371 --> 00:14:45.100
<v Speaker 1>all suddenly somebody will peak out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street to go into the car and</v>

354
00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:49.150
<v Speaker 1>they'll cut between the cars and go down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sidewalk like they figured out our</v>

355
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:51.130
<v Speaker 1>movements and how to avoid us pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

356
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 1>How many do you think there are in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater la area?</v>

357
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get asked that question a lot and it's</v>

358
00:14:56.661 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 1>a hard one to answer because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know because they are pack animals so</v>

359
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you could end up with easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be just two animals in an area</v>

360
00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:09.191
<v Speaker 1>or it could be two adults with seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>young or it could even be five,</v>

361
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:10.311
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

362
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 1>10 adults together with with a pack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>young as well,</v>

363
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of times the young from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year before may not disperse.</v>

364
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:19.970
<v Speaker 1>If there's enough food available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll keep hanging in there until they</v>

365
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>are able to find their own territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whenever someone would give an</v>

366
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really just a rough guess.</v>

367
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a very rough guest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times what they'll do is</v>

368
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>they'll just try to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

369
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:32.660
<v Speaker 1>this is how big of an area caio uses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then be like,</v>

370
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:35.630
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this much area in La and throw a</v>

371
00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:38.330
<v Speaker 1>number out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of variables that come</v>

372
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:41.480
<v Speaker 1>in and it has the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like the numbers increased</v>

373
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 1>over the past few years or?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not over the last few years.</v>

374
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 1>It's possible over the long run because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there are some reports of places</v>

375
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 1>that there weren't coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Baldwin hills,</v>

376
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>there was some work done where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify it,</v>

377
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 1>all the different animals there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes worn in their list.</v>

378
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 1>So they use trail cams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what did they use to identify the</v>

379
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 1>animals back then I think they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a lot of tracks surveys and just</v>

380
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:04.950
<v Speaker 1>going out there into the field and</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for them.</v>

381
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 1>A track service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning like looking at the ground.</v>

382
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

383
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>And with coyotes they leave enough scat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different places.</v>

384
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Like if they were looking hard for them</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would've found them.</v>

385
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 1>How can you tell the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>cat and dogs?</v>

386
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually,</v>

387
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 1>so dogs get is almost always just dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

388
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't.</v>

389
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.760
<v Speaker 1>These coyote scats ended up getting more</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiraled inside and so there'll be</v>

390
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>really tapered on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ends were dogs get can be tapered,</v>

391
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's usually just drastically</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

392
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it tapered?</v>

393
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.200
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's partially just the way their</v>

394
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:39.020
<v Speaker 1>digestive system works and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting all this hair in there because</v>

395
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:41.870
<v Speaker 1>they're eating these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it gets more and more spiraled as</v>

396
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 1>it comes out and we can tell them apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>from like bobcat,</v>

397
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>because bobcats kind of get this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more almost,</v>

398
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call it a pellet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're smaller segmented and</v>

399
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of just one side's concave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one side's convicts of each pellet and</v>

400
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:56.630
<v Speaker 1>so you can tell them apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually can be more difficult</v>

401
00:16:56.631 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 1>for some people than the dog.</v>

402
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And the coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found some mountain lions,</v>

403
00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 1>shit wants to Santa Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in Santa Monica,</v>

404
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:04.280
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Barbara.</v>

405
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And it was very disturbing because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a rope,</v>

406
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.310
<v Speaker 1>like a fat rope of hairy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

407
00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 1>what is this from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sent it to a friend of mine who is</v>

408
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very knowledgeable about animals.</v>

409
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:18.320
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost definitely a mountain lion.</v>

410
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

411
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.240
<v Speaker 1>somebody's got got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

412
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty thick rope,</v>

413
00:17:23.991 --> 00:17:26.470
<v Speaker 1>like a human sys log with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

414
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this hair in it.</v>

415
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>We actually have alliance study going in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mountains too.</v>

416
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:31.940
<v Speaker 1>We've been calling them outlines for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

417
00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard of [inaudible] in</v>

418
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Griffith Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

419
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.730
<v Speaker 1>That's actually an animal that one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues collared.</v>

420
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the famous photo of the Hollywood</v>

421
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:42.050
<v Speaker 1>hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

422
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>That is an amazing photo of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous cat.</v>

423
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Would that collar on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

424
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 1>that was Steve Winters with National</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geographic.</v>

425
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Got that photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

426
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worked hard between him and my</v>

427
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 1>colleague Jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a lot of work to get that</v>

428
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 1>photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jamie says,</v>

429
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>go and pull that photo up when you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a look at it.</v>

430
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Now that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an iconic photograph,</v>

431
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

432
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I think we should have that photo in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new studio.</v>

433
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:06.650
<v Speaker 1>We should get a print of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we buy a print of that?</v>

434
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in Silica bioprinted that um,</v>

435
00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I believe you can get it from Steve</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winters.</v>

436
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.911
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

437
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:15.660
<v Speaker 1>make a note of whoever's gentlemen is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if he sells that because dad is</v>

438
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems so crazy.</v>

439
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look like a real photo</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Hollywood sign is so perfect</v>

440
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:25.430
<v Speaker 1>in the background and the cat is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>

441
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 1>You know what's amazing about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood sign?</v>

442
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:30.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no lights on the Hollywood sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got that photo because he was able to</v>

443
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:33.510
<v Speaker 1>do enough camera work that he made the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood sign Claire Out.</v>

444
00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:36.110
<v Speaker 1>That's just from lights from the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

445
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the Hollywood sign at</v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

446
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not lit up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

447
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Look at the forearm on them thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

448
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like a thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.960
<v Speaker 1>So it's a huge cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

450
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 1>How big do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big male.</v>

451
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I think the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've captured him three or four</v>

452
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:59.391
<v Speaker 1>times now and I think the last time he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about 101 20.</v>

453
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.261
<v Speaker 1>One 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

454
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:03.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not positive of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's somewhere in that area.</v>

455
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good size cat.</v>

456
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's amazing?</v>

457
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:09.510
<v Speaker 1>He's running in Griffith Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd never leaves the Griffith Park</v>

458
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>General area because he's blocked by</v>
<v Speaker 1>freeways and yet there hasn't been any</v>

459
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:15.690
<v Speaker 1>conflicts with him and people besides</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time he got underneath that guy's</v>

460
00:19:15.691 --> 00:19:18.070
<v Speaker 1>house living of him.</v>

461
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>But Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

462
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:23.770
<v Speaker 1>So joggers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one gets interrupted by him.</v>

463
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Interrupt is a funny word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack is a better word.</v>

464
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.210
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mess with people at all.</v>

465
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get sightings everywhere where people</v>

466
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:32.791
<v Speaker 1>report it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

467
00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 1>we haven't had anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any conflicts with them,</v>

468
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.620
<v Speaker 1>which has been amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's four.</v>

469
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:40.350
<v Speaker 1>He's got the smallest home range of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion,</v>

470
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.020
<v Speaker 1>male mountain lion that we've know of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

471
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.540
<v Speaker 1>So what is like a square mile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he just the park?</v>

472
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.100
<v Speaker 1>He's just the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he goes,</v>

473
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 1>he's been up by like universal studios</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in there once or twice.</v>

474
00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Like in some green strip through there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

475
00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just hanging out in the park and</v>

476
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 1>dwp property next to the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big is the park?</v>

477
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could call that number off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of my head.</v>

478
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Just roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to guess who?</v>

479
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good with that.</v>

480
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 4,300 acres or something like that.</v>

481
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the biggest in America or maybe the</v>

482
00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:12.060
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Urban Park.</v>

483
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty big park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

484
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 1>But when you compare that to mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions,</v>

485
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>that our main mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we usually think to mountain lions can</v>

486
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 1>live in the Santa Monica mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about 150,000 acres.</v>

487
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.890
<v Speaker 1>So his range is pretty small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4,300 compared to about 75,000 acres.</v>

488
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.520
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's mostly eating deer heat,</v>

489
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 1>some coyotes and raccoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's almost most of the,</v>

490
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.220
<v Speaker 1>most of all of our mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their diets,</v>

491
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 1>dear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

492
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:41.850
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why there's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>few deer in California.</v>

493
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I hear that when we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know if that's truly what's</v>

494
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 1>going a mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do kind of self regulate.</v>

495
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 1>So the big males usually killed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller mills and so they do kind of</v>

496
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 1>control their own populations of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

497
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

498
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 1>So the competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill competent.</v>

499
00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Did Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not cannibals though.</v>

500
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe they eat them.</v>

501
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.710
<v Speaker 1>They usually just kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

502
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.610
<v Speaker 1>So do they kill them to bring the</v>
<v Speaker 1>females to Asteris or they'd do them</v>

503
00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 1>just because their competition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We believe it's just because it's</v>

504
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 1>competition because they're usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing those yearling.</v>

505
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Males killing them once they were</v>

506
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 1>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

507
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.271
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

508
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 1>and they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have had them kill a female lion as</v>

509
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really it's not that simple.</v>

510
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.343
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

511
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is this in the park?</v>

512
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:27.550
<v Speaker 1>You found this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

513
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you find a dead mountain line in the</v>

514
00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:31.630
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have radio collars on them,</v>

515
00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:36.270
<v Speaker 1>so we kind of know what's going on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any concern,</v>

516
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.430
<v Speaker 1>like does anybody make the argument that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be there?</v>

517
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody ever say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

518
00:21:40.811 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where I live.</v>

519
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this cat here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you guys let this thing is a</v>

520
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 1>giant Predator wandering around our</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood?</v>

521
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we definitely hear that but we</v>

522
00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 1>also get the other side as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot where they want to protect every</v>

523
00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:54.580
<v Speaker 1>lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

524
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 1>same thing with coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't want the coyotes.</v>

525
00:21:56.771 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 1>They're coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even more tricky because we've tried to</v>

526
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:03.790
<v Speaker 1>kill coyotes for a long time to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them out of areas and we have not</v>

527
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:04.840
<v Speaker 1>been successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

528
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.320
<v Speaker 1>places like Chicago with coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'll go through and do</v>

529
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 1>removals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the landowners will do</v>

530
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 1>removals and the coyotes has come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly.</v>

531
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.411
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though.</v>

532
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It's really not that effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me start trying to remove these</v>

533
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

534
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Especially coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

535
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.230
<v Speaker 1>They're so crafty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

536
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I've read a really disturbing article</v>
<v Speaker 1>about mountain lions where they were</v>

537
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:29.200
<v Speaker 1>talking about the number of mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions that are killed every year by.</v>

538
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:34.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professional mountain lion hunters</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government hires because</v>

539
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:38.890
<v Speaker 1>they're preying on cats and dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they said that 50 percent of these</v>

540
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:41.380
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was around the San Francisco area,</v>

541
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 1>that 50 percent of their diet was</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic animals.</v>

542
00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Like domestic cats and dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

543
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not familiar with that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we definitely haven't seen that with</v>

544
00:22:50.921 --> 00:22:53.420
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this one is just got a good supply of</v>

545
00:22:53.421 --> 00:22:56.230
<v Speaker 1>deer and that's just what it's eating on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular basis.</v>

546
00:22:56.231 --> 00:22:57.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

547
00:22:57.281 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 1>even Griffith Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're focused on.</v>

548
00:22:59.441 --> 00:22:59.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

549
00:22:59.891 --> 00:23:02.200
<v Speaker 1>they also killed the coyotes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>raccoons and stuff as well.</v>

550
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 1>But sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the other thing that was really</v>

551
00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:07.400
<v Speaker 1>disturbing about that article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was the,</v>

552
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 1>the author was trying to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between missing children,</v>

553
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about,</v>

554
00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:14.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several cases over the years where</v>

555
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 1>children were missing and never found</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

556
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And these are the same areas where these</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions roaming and they were</v>

557
00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>wondering whether or not that had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

558
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 1>That makes you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

559
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:24.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

560
00:23:24.201 --> 00:23:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably more likely human</v>
<v Speaker 1>caused then wildlife caused.</v>

561
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're,</v>

562
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>we're way creepier than these animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

563
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.360
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you remember about two years ago,</v>

564
00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:36.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a case in Cupertino right near</v>

565
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>the apple campus where a mountain lion</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack to kid.</v>

566
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:40.811
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

567
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 1>the father had a fight the mountain lion</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

568
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stories definitely pop up every</v>

569
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 1>once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also have lots of places where</v>

570
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:48.940
<v Speaker 1>there's lions and there's no issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

571
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Our mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't had a light,</v>

572
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 1>a human lion issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

573
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 1>we've had livestock taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's about it.</v>

574
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And we're talking our park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gets huge amount of visitors.</v>

575
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Griffin lion will griffith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the whole Santa Monica</v>

576
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 1>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're part of the Santa Monica</v>

577
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Mountains National Recreation area and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got at any given time we could</v>

578
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 1>have 12 to 15 lions in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

579
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:14.351
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've never had a human lion issue</v>

580
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 1>besides the livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the big issue when they do</v>

581
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:20.660
<v Speaker 1>attack people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's always like someone either</v>

582
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 1>running or on a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it they think that the person is</v>

583
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:26.630
<v Speaker 1>trying to get away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like a cat thing,</v>

584
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 1>like a regular kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

585
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 1>like if you roll a ball of yarn in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a cat that just jumped on it.</v>

586
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we really have a full</v>

587
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it probably has something to do with</v>

588
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:39.641
<v Speaker 1>the prey drive because I've read a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mountain lion attacks on people that</v>

589
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:43.020
<v Speaker 1>had to do with mountain bikes and I was.</v>

590
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like why would they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to attack someone on a bike?</v>

591
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.000
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a bike would be scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

592
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an ambush Predator and they're</v>

593
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 1>big animals so they're not used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>having anything bigger than them take</v>

594
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 1>them on so they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not fearful of most things.</v>

595
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of times when people see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lions,</v>

596
00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't run and so people freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's actually not that uncommon</v>

597
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 1>for them just to kind of sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you and judge the situation,</v>

598
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.200
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out what they can do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

599
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 1>They should eat you hope that's not what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking,</v>

600
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:13.550
<v Speaker 1>but most likely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely not like what are the</v>

601
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:16.900
<v Speaker 1>numbers of attacks on people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know if you had a.</v>

602
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to talk to my colleague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not the lion guy in our</v>

603
00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:20.090
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

604
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Some much more focused on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the last time you heard</v>

605
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 1>of a lion attack on people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now and I've taught my head.</v>

606
00:25:27.351 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might've been at apple thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there was.</v>

607
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.220
<v Speaker 1>There was attack in Orange County quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while back,</v>

608
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.860
<v Speaker 1>but that's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that common.</v>

609
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a magic number of lions that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

610
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.310
<v Speaker 1>This is a mountain lion in San Juan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capistrano that's been attacking this</v>

611
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:45.110
<v Speaker 1>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A buddy of mine,</v>

612
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Ian Mccall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a UFC fighter,</v>

613
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 1>has a friend who owns this farm and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion has been hitting this farm</v>

614
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:57.350
<v Speaker 1>every now and again and the other day it</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed 37 ducks in a goat,</v>

615
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.400
<v Speaker 1>just goes on a rampage and doesn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat them.</v>

616
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Just fucks them up and leaves and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we usually see with them is,</v>

617
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean because they almost always eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they kill.</v>

618
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just when they kill something in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>farm,</v>

619
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 1>they usually end up being uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards because we come in,</v>

620
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:14.810
<v Speaker 1>we see the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things change and so they don't come</v>

621
00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:17.270
<v Speaker 1>back because they'll feed on a deer for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week or more.</v>

622
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.531
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

623
00:26:18.531 --> 00:26:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more of a factor when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave those things.</v>

624
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:21.770
<v Speaker 1>It's more that they just all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

625
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.240
<v Speaker 1>oh crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do,</v>

626
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they killed 37.</v>

627
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Then it just prey drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they can't help themselves.</v>

628
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.860
<v Speaker 1>They get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's times when they get in pins with</v>

629
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:34.130
<v Speaker 1>bigger animals to things like llamas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff where they'll end up killing</v>

630
00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:37.570
<v Speaker 1>multiple animals just because they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this pan and all.</v>

631
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly they're jumping around making</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these noises and so then the animals</v>

632
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 1>get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made it just like dog dogs are getting</v>

633
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:44.460
<v Speaker 1>after chickens.</v>

634
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 1>All the sudden the dog goes in and kills</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole flock of chickens.</v>

635
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same type of deal.</v>

636
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.130
<v Speaker 1>They just can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.490
<v Speaker 1>There's that one that's in the Santa</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monica Mountains.</v>

638
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:54.720
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>P 52.</v>

639
00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Is that the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>P 45,</v>

640
00:26:56.661 --> 00:26:58.110
<v Speaker 1>45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing if that's what you're</v>

641
00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:00.660
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that killed a bunch of llamas</v>

642
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:04.560
<v Speaker 1>and the woman got a depredation permit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill the mountain lion.</v>

643
00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Then people freaked out and started</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending her death threats.</v>

644
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a little out of control.</v>

645
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was really creepy listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this woman's position because she</v>

646
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:14.420
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what to do because she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 1>she lives there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got this farm and this big old cat</v>

648
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps coming in and fucking up like 10</v>

649
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 1>llamas in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a setting.</v>

650
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So us and National Wildlife Federation</v>

651
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 1>actually started working with her to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help pin or animals that better</v>

652
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:30.990
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of it just comes to making</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure your animals a secure at night.</v>

653
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to figure out a way to</v>

654
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.500
<v Speaker 1>close the areas of the mountain lion</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get into exactly what did she</v>

655
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.710
<v Speaker 1>take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that complicated.</v>

656
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:41.370
<v Speaker 1>We actually held a workshop for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the local vicinity and we'll be</v>

657
00:27:41.371 --> 00:27:44.900
<v Speaker 1>holding more to teach livestock owners</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to secure their animals so that</v>

658
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.680
<v Speaker 1>stuff doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way they can,</v>

659
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something that like a emits a sound</v>

660
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 1>or something that scares them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some devices out there that</v>

661
00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:57.210
<v Speaker 1>are being tested and being used in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>vicinities,</v>

662
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 1>but nothing's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with a lot of devices,</v>

663
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.520
<v Speaker 1>you've got livestock moving around so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be triggering the</v>

664
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 1>devices all night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

665
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a tough situation.</v>

666
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:10.260
<v Speaker 1>The best thing is to try to pin the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals up so you have to put something</v>

667
00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 1>with a roof on it.</v>

668
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 1>So the mountain lion can't get in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the top.</v>

669
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're talking about an animal</v>

670
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:17.320
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they,</v>

671
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they capture them and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they move them to a new area.</v>

672
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

673
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.670
<v Speaker 1>that is very rare to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really?</v>

674
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when we kept our animals,</v>

675
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:31.770
<v Speaker 1>we don't move anybody just let them go</v>
<v Speaker 1>right back to where they are and we call</v>

676
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.000
<v Speaker 1>our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take blood,</v>

677
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 1>we do what we need to do to them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we just let them go right there.</v>

678
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So it was the idea like mess with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>as little as possible.</v>

679
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

680
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have to capture them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't capture them.</v>

681
00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:43.740
<v Speaker 1>We would just throw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a way to get a color on the</v>

682
00:28:43.741 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 1>animal without touching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would do that like maybe a dark that</v>

683
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:48.840
<v Speaker 1>shoots a gps unit in him or something.</v>

684
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the technology is,</v>

685
00:28:50.551 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 1>if it ever comes up that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most wildlife people would prefer</v>

686
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 1>because the least we have to do it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more we're going to understand their</v>

687
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.820
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

688
00:28:56.821 --> 00:28:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine this cat and Griffith</v>
<v Speaker 1>Park.</v>

689
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.720
<v Speaker 1>You said it's been captured three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

690
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:02.850
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This can be for.</v>

691
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:03.571
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

692
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the guy that does all the lion</v>

693
00:29:05.101 --> 00:29:06.150
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just help out.</v>

694
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.730
<v Speaker 1>The cat must be like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they got me again,</v>

695
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Speaker 1>like it's probably like I'm so tired of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing the stupid jewelry they keep</v>

696
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Speaker 1>putting on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

697
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:14.941
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

698
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:16.700
<v Speaker 1>You might've saw the pictures to where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got.</v>

699
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.960
<v Speaker 1>He was really sick with mange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

700
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

701
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 1>And so they got a medication and so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught him and we have a topical</v>

702
00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:25.980
<v Speaker 1>medication that we can give animals.</v>

703
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 1>We do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bobcats and stuff.</v>

704
00:29:27.301 --> 00:29:32.301
<v Speaker 1>So what we found with this mange disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's caused by a rodenticides.</v>

705
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.870
<v Speaker 1>So all these rat poisons we put out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there basically ends up getting into the</v>

706
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:38.880
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions and bobcats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the coyotes,</v>

707
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.820
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between those poisons and</v>

708
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:44.500
<v Speaker 1>why these animals get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

709
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 1>is that him right there with mange?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

710
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.423
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

711
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a real issue with people</v>

712
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:51.390
<v Speaker 1>poisoning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

713
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.910
<v Speaker 1>these animals so that it also affects</v>
<v Speaker 1>owls.</v>

714
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Apparently that rat poison is causing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop in the owl population because our</v>

715
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.020
<v Speaker 1>are getting ahold of these rats are sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

716
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.011
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

717
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:03.970
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

718
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:04.691
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

719
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:06.470
<v Speaker 1>to think of a mountain lion getting rat</v>
<v Speaker 1>poison.</v>

720
00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're out there hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>

721
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's because they're killing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes,</v>

722
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 1>the thinner that are eating the rats</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are sick.</v>

723
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening.</v>

724
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.700
<v Speaker 1>So we're a mountain lion would need a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat.</v>

725
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for them to eat enough rats,</v>

726
00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:19.620
<v Speaker 1>they're not just sitting there focusing</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

727
00:30:19.621 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's really a great source for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

728
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely focusing more on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes and the bigger prey.</v>

729
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe there's that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions in the Santa Monica</v>

730
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

731
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are colored mountain lions,</v>

732
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:35.230
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all of them.</v>

733
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.410
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are uncolored we can only get what we</v>

734
00:30:38.411 --> 00:30:39.650
<v Speaker 1>can capture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

735
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And so like when you make an estimate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

736
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:42.371
<v Speaker 1>what'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

737
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we think that's our upper size</v>

738
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:46.510
<v Speaker 1>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of them are collared?</v>

739
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think right now we're at around eight</v>

740
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 1>or nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

741
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish jeff was in here.</v>

742
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:54.970
<v Speaker 1>He can answer these questions a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than me because like I said,</v>

743
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll get jeff in here next time.</v>

744
00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

745
00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:02.290
<v Speaker 1>it's so fascinating because California</v>
<v Speaker 1>is such a unique area in that we are</v>

746
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.970
<v Speaker 1>very urban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

747
00:31:03.971 --> 00:31:08.971
<v Speaker 1>but we're real spread out and we've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Santa Monica mountains right there,</v>

748
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.430
<v Speaker 1>like in Topanga right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to pay.</v>

749
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy lives in Topanga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go in his backyard,</v>

750
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you would swear to God you were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado or something.</v>

751
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

752
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.270
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the wilderness,</v>

753
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountains are amazing.</v>

754
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's 155,000 acres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

755
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's got a map he pulled up of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountain lions.</v>

756
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get them all.</v>

757
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously the Santa Monica mountains</v>

758
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:31.850
<v Speaker 1>are just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're south of the one.</v>

759
00:31:31.851 --> 00:31:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh one basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the park is basically from the</v>

760
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood hills out the point Magoo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then incorporates most of Malibu and</v>

761
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 1>then it goes a little bit up into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hills,</v>

762
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.450
<v Speaker 1>but the mountains themselves are mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>south of [inaudible].</v>

763
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 1>This is such a unique place to live that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were so sort of surrounded by nature and</v>

764
00:31:49.361 --> 00:31:52.840
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways and there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different places like you could go to</v>

765
00:31:52.841 --> 00:31:56.740
<v Speaker 1>big bear and an hour and a half and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the woods.</v>

766
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean you are literally in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wilderness.</v>

767
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a great thing about La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

768
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I like living here and it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>

769
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:08.581
<v Speaker 1>But people are super uncomfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that this wildlife sort of</v>

770
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>interfaces with our urban environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where guys like you come in,</v>

771
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:14.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

772
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're hoping to help reduce some of</v>

773
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 1>these conflicts and a lot of it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do.</v>

774
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much with animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean with coyotes,</v>

775
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.000
<v Speaker 1>a huge amount of the issues are because</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody next door to use feeding them</v>

776
00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:26.160
<v Speaker 1>and so the coyotes hanging around.</v>

777
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.720
<v Speaker 1>It's really common like the people leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>out food.</v>

778
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's intentional.</v>

779
00:32:30.131 --> 00:32:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's not like feeding your dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

780
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.560
<v Speaker 1>It's never a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having fruit trees in your backyard that</v>

781
00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:38.440
<v Speaker 1>are just dropping fruit constantly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's picking it up or cleaning it</v>

782
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's attract and so it's all bringing</v>

783
00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 1>in coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raccoons,</v>

784
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 1>possums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skunks,</v>

785
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 1>all these animals are coming in and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of that stuff.</v>

786
00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>So do you think they eat olives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have we seen all lives?</v>

787
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Probably would take advantage of him</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and there,</v>

788
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:54.250
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's like a super big</v>
<v Speaker 1>food source forum.</v>

789
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen any spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've been doing this diet study for</v>

790
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 1>a little while now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Olives or not one that pops up</v>

791
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:01.890
<v Speaker 1>regularly because my dogs eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm asking.</v>

792
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 1>My Dog's catch them when they fall out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trees and it's the same yard.</v>

793
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we're the coyotes had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>visiting.</v>

794
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wouldn't rule it out,</v>

795
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 1>but definitely if you have anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>figs,</v>

796
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.280
<v Speaker 1>we find tons of figs and the scat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

797
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 1>so they really liked figs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do and figs fruit twice a year.</v>

798
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:21.260
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the varieties of figs and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there a lot so the coyotes just</v>

799
00:33:21.261 --> 00:33:22.800
<v Speaker 1>kind of learned to key in on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

800
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.230
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And probably a lot of calories.</v>

801
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:25.790
<v Speaker 1>There are two former.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

802
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 1>What are those little tiny red berries</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they like to eat?</v>

803
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.620
<v Speaker 1>A pirate Kantha maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

804
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not even edible.</v>

805
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:33.134
<v Speaker 1>The humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

806
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so,</v>

807
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.960
<v Speaker 1>but Kyle is Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

808
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean whether it's edible to us or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we would want to eat a different</v>

809
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.700
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

810
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot grind in.</v>

811
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're eating a lot of things that we</v>

812
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:45.224
<v Speaker 1>would not touch.</v>

813
00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no kidding.</v>

814
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go pick stuff up off the road and</v>

815
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.950
<v Speaker 1>nasty little it looks like just putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road.</v>

816
00:33:51.951 --> 00:33:53.960
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them grab stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

817
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I seen coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>

818
00:33:55.281 --> 00:33:56.061
<v Speaker 1>they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

819
00:33:56.061 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of these talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katie's going after cats and all that</v>

820
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:00.800
<v Speaker 1>and there's no question that eat cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them.</v>

821
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.940
<v Speaker 1>One of our collared animals was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating a cat in to have his pack mates</v>

822
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:07.130
<v Speaker 1>were sitting there just eating this cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>in somebody's front yard,</v>

823
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.860
<v Speaker 1>which I'd never seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew they.</v>

824
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that video of the coyote</v>

825
00:34:11.641 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 1>eaten the cat that someone captured in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles?</v>

826
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.493
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

827
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a great video because this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people from their car or film in</v>

828
00:34:19.281 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 1>this coyote that's right there on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street in busy la and it just staring at</v>

829
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:25.120
<v Speaker 1>people chewing on this cat that.</v>

830
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like Jesus Christ.</v>

831
00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 1>We played it for Dan Flores and Dan has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opinion,</v>

832
00:34:30.081 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 1>he's of the opinion that a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats that are getting killed by these</v>

833
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.640
<v Speaker 1>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here's some coyotes just wandering</v>

834
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:38.480
<v Speaker 1>across the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

835
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:42.320
<v Speaker 1>this is really crazy because this is as</v>
<v Speaker 1>urban as it gets.</v>

836
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busy street and this kyle is just</v>

837
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:49.220
<v Speaker 1>hanging out and so these people followed</v>
<v Speaker 1>this coyote all around the street.</v>

838
00:34:49.221 --> 00:34:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Does it look like that as a collar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I say?</v>

839
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no color,</v>

840
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan thinks that the coyotes are eating</v>

841
00:34:57.051 --> 00:34:59.420
<v Speaker 1>the cats because they're competitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>

842
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that has definitely been seen with</v>

843
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 1>things like fog of areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just chilling,</v>

844
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 1>eating the cat right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

845
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy that they actually see it.</v>

846
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing they didn't see it actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch the.</v>

847
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the cat is stiff.</v>

848
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That cat is that cat.</v>

849
00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:19.910
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's been dead for quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>

850
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but he's just chewing on that cat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of everybody that coyote actually</v>

851
00:35:23.961 --> 00:35:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you see how it's face looks kind of bald</v>
<v Speaker 1>headed may actually have.</v>

852
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And you think that could be from rat</v>
<v Speaker 1>poison?</v>

853
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the coyotes.</v>

854
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:31.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a little more complicated than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

855
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think it's a different type of Maine</v>

856
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.100
<v Speaker 1>they get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't think that's directly tied</v>

857
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Speaker 1>rat poisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be still,</v>

858
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:40.680
<v Speaker 1>but where does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of uncertain with those guys.</v>

859
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 1>And some of it is because of bugs as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

860
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Maine is actually caused by a mite.</v>

861
00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just irritates their skin and</v>

862
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:48.870
<v Speaker 1>they end up scratching their own for</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

863
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.913
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

864
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

865
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it just felt like it.</v>

866
00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 1>That one cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

867
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my friend a dude.</v>

868
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 1>That cat is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just sitting there watching this</v>

869
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:00.790
<v Speaker 1>coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

870
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.180
<v Speaker 1>So what a dumb cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

871
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I saw a cat in the middle of a street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A coyote was walking down the street.</v>

872
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a bag of garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about 100 yards away and I was</v>

873
00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 1>sitting here watching this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to it.</v>

874
00:36:10.861 --> 00:36:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

875
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.790
<v Speaker 1>was going to get into this garbage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next thing I know there's coyotes</v>

876
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 1>circles at three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walks off also.</v>

877
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Anything jumps up and walks away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

878
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.340
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I just see that?</v>

879
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot believe it because even like,</v>

880
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I know it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

881
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.750
<v Speaker 1>that was a pretty easy prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have just grabbed it.</v>

882
00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:30.990
<v Speaker 1>So coyote is much faster than cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

883
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:31.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an area.</v>

884
00:36:31.861 --> 00:36:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have to be faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cat was just laying there like it</v>

885
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 1>could have grabbed it at any point and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder why the cat felt calm enough to</v>

886
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

887
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

888
00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:41.730
<v Speaker 1>And why they didn't go after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

889
00:36:41.731 --> 00:36:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not that simple that they go</v>

890
00:36:44.011 --> 00:36:45.790
<v Speaker 1>after every single cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

891
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Well they obviously don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

892
00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you.</v>

893
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Speaker 1>So you say that it is fairly common that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people feed them.</v>

894
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>

895
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:56.220
<v Speaker 1>with tracking these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to a bunch of places where</v>

896
00:36:56.221 --> 00:36:59.310
<v Speaker 1>people feel like they need to put dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>food or cat food out on the street just</v>

897
00:36:59.311 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 1>for the coyotes are the skunks or</v>
<v Speaker 1>raccoons or whatever.</v>

898
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 1>They're feeding something intentionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and then the coyotes are</v>

899
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 1>taking advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you talk to these people?</v>

900
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I will occasionally.</v>

901
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Usually I just tell animal services</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and they'll talk to them or if</v>

902
00:37:13.441 --> 00:37:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it's somebody I'm like already having</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of communication with,</v>

903
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll definitely be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

904
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:18.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't really need to feed these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

905
00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 1>They're doing fine on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

906
00:37:20.641 --> 00:37:22.410
<v Speaker 1>All you're doing is encouraging them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come here.</v>

907
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Do they get that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do deal with some nutty animal people</v>

908
00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:27.060
<v Speaker 1>that don't get that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

909
00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 1>we definitely deal with some people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand.</v>

910
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.480
<v Speaker 1>They feel like these animals are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to starve to death or die of dehydration</v>

911
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:35.070
<v Speaker 1>if they don't put that bowl of water out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

912
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.250
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

913
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Dan Flores had a woman who came to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was doing a documentary on saving</v>

914
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 1>the coyote and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you understand,</v>

915
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:50.360
<v Speaker 1>like they're doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've expanded their range incredibly.</v>

916
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Like they're living in every big city</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

917
00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean from New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

918
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all saying.</v>

919
00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

920
00:37:58.861 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

921
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:04.450
<v Speaker 1>They literally are in every state in</v>
<v Speaker 1>every city in the entire country except</v>

922
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 1>for Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except why puts what that is so bizarre</v>

923
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:10.040
<v Speaker 1>that the think that are in Queens during</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

924
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.960
<v Speaker 1>they've found them in the bronx was</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

925
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 1>They've expanded their range over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly short time span to.</v>

926
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really just since Europeans had</v>

927
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 1>been here that they've been able to kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of expand out and do that and that's</v>

928
00:38:20.311 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 1>through all this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was trying to kill him and all that</v>

929
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.400
<v Speaker 1>and so I get a lot of people that want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to remove coyotes from urban</v>

930
00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:27.211
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

931
00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:29.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been trying to do that for a long</v>

932
00:38:29.041 --> 00:38:31.950
<v Speaker 1>time and it's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the solution then?</v>

933
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:35.320
<v Speaker 1>The solution is just to sort of mitigate</v>
<v Speaker 1>their impact on us.</v>

934
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.240
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to change what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

935
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's about not making sure we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have food out there.</v>

936
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean if the more food they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been shown.</v>

937
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes can increase their litter sizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they produce more coyotes and so</v>

938
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 1>it's really about trying to reduce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of food that we are responsible</v>

939
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:53.390
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also what I read in Dan Flores is</v>

940
00:38:53.391 --> 00:38:58.300
<v Speaker 1>book that the more we impact the coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as like people trying to push</v>

941
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:03.301
<v Speaker 1>them out and pressure them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more they produce extra babies like</v>

942
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they do that roll call</v>

943
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 1>thing when they scream out in the night</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you hear him,</v>

944
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:10.030
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is one of my favorite things about</v>

945
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:10.864
<v Speaker 1>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

946
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.890
<v Speaker 1>when I'm out at night and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:39:12.891 --> 00:39:15.390
<v Speaker 1>like you're sitting on the deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like having a cup of coffee or something</v>

948
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.233
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

949
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

950
00:39:18.911 --> 00:39:22.870
<v Speaker 1>this is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they are really out here like</v>

951
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 1>grinding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel you're actually out in</v>

952
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:26.130
<v Speaker 1>the wild a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

953
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though like you're sitting on your</v>

954
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 1>deck sound into music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

955
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Tie it to going off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

956
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Drinking a nice cup of coffee or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

957
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

958
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:41.430
<v Speaker 1>it's such a unique relationship that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have with that one Predator where it's</v>

959
00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:43.510
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked them around,</v>

960
00:39:43.511 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 1>like I would be really weird if that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

961
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other kind of like scary Predator,</v>

962
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 1>but coyotes are kind of cool to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

963
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

964
00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same way a lot of people may</v>

965
00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:59.110
<v Speaker 1>not feel quite the same when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting in their backyard,</v>

966
00:39:59.111 --> 00:40:01.110
<v Speaker 1>but I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

967
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

969
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm a dog lover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got chickens,</v>

970
00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I've got all these things that coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 1>could effect me as well,</v>

971
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:12.070
<v Speaker 1>but I also realize that there's things I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do to make sure that they're not</v>

972
00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:15.130
<v Speaker 1>going to get to my chickens are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're knocking on my dogs.</v>

973
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a puppy right now and that's my,</v>

974
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.440
<v Speaker 1>my big fear is because I have a golden</v>
<v Speaker 1>retriever puppy and he is like golden</v>

975
00:40:22.601 --> 00:40:24.680
<v Speaker 1>retrievers under if you ever had one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The early,</v>

976
00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the most non dog dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they don't bark at anybody.</v>

977
00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:32.320
<v Speaker 1>They're terrible watchdogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love everybody and they just have</v>

978
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.530
<v Speaker 1>zero killer instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like zero.</v>

979
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.640
<v Speaker 1>They're just sweethearts and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried that he's going to get jacked.</v>

980
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would definitely keep them</v>

981
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.680
<v Speaker 1>secure until it gets up to that 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 pound range right there.</v>

982
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.480
<v Speaker 1>They're generally pretty safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

983
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.720
<v Speaker 1>So now they do sometimes ambush them</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

984
00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:51.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

985
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 1>It's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually most of the attacks are smaller</v>

986
00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

987
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>there are definitely cases where they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone even after something as big as your</v>

988
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:00.520
<v Speaker 1>master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's crazy.</v>

989
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty rare that happens.</v>

990
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole coyote dog things complicated.</v>

991
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I bet you if you googled dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes playing on Youtube,</v>

992
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:12.820
<v Speaker 1>you would find a dozen videos very</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly because we've actually looked at</v>

993
00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 1>some of that and it's just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that relationship's not as simple as</v>

994
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:18.730
<v Speaker 1>just like they're going to go after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs know they play around together,</v>

995
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.580
<v Speaker 1>but then they'll kill them and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

996
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.370
<v Speaker 1>what kind of relationship do we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

997
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't know how often they</v>

998
00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:29.230
<v Speaker 1>actually eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think sometimes they just kill them</v>

999
00:41:29.231 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and carry them off because that same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing they do with foxes.</v>

1000
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.561
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:41:32.561 --> 00:41:34.970
<v Speaker 1>So like gray and red foxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coyotes will kill them,</v>

1002
00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:37.220
<v Speaker 1>but they generally don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which really when you started thinking</v>

1003
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 1>ecologically it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1004
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Like they're so related that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of diseases they could be</v>

1005
00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 1>transmitted between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a risk.</v>

1006
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Any time you eat something that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>closely related to you.</v>

1007
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>

1008
00:41:48.831 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So essentially the same thing as like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad cow disease.</v>

1009
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which has comes from the prions,</v>

1010
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 1>which is we feed cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cow material and then they get that.</v>

1011
00:41:58.521 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob's Krogh.</v>

1012
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Spelled disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1013
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is the same disease that they find</v>

1014
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 1>in cannibals in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1015
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what country is it that they find that</v>

1016
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:16.940
<v Speaker 1>in Indonesia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget where it is,</v>

1017
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the same thing.</v>

1018
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean anytime you start and that's just</v>

1020
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:26.090
<v Speaker 1>one disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of parasites and</v>

1021
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:30.380
<v Speaker 1>stuff too that if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they transferred between similarly</v>

1022
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:34.430
<v Speaker 1>related species much easier than it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say between a cat and a dog.</v>

1023
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean there's a lot of spillover and</v>

1024
00:42:38.001 --> 00:42:41.360
<v Speaker 1>zoonotic diseases between wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic animals.</v>

1025
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Luckily we have lots of vaccinations for</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I'm sure you've heard of,</v>

1026
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:48.060
<v Speaker 1>like Parvo and distemper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's,</v>

1027
00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.660
<v Speaker 1>there's vaccinations we can give our</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals to take care of that.</v>

1028
00:42:50.661 --> 00:42:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Obviously these wild animals just have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with it.</v>

1029
00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:54.350
<v Speaker 1>You had distemper is very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1030
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.460
<v Speaker 1>I had a dog down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.720
<v Speaker 1>But in Parvos it's also deadly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppies.</v>

1032
00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get that exactly.</v>

1033
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:04.820
<v Speaker 1>A Parvo is very common in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually not just right down the</v>

1034
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:07.040
<v Speaker 1>street here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lost some pups to Parvo.</v>

1035
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:11.330
<v Speaker 1>And is this something that's transmitted</v>
<v Speaker 1>through wildlife as well?</v>

1036
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.720
<v Speaker 1>It can be a so we're not exactly sure if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only wildlife to domestic,</v>

1037
00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 1>it's probably both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably being moved between the</v>

1038
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:23.300
<v Speaker 1>different populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean luckily if we vaccinate well</v>

1039
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:27.560
<v Speaker 1>we can reduce that spread but people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be good about vaccinating their</v>

1040
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:28.100
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

1041
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:33.100
<v Speaker 1>So do you guys have a mandate like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to studying a coyotes and when</v>

1042
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it comes to dealing with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is the overall emphasis on,</v>

1043
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:40.820
<v Speaker 1>is it on just understanding their range</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they are or is it,</v>

1044
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:45.140
<v Speaker 1>do you try to do something with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our role is to try to help protect</v>

1045
00:43:45.141 --> 00:43:50.141
<v Speaker 1>wildlife within national park areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we try to do is we try to</v>

1046
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:54.380
<v Speaker 1>get as most understanding we can so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can help reduce conflicts,</v>

1047
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:56.570
<v Speaker 1>help reduce disease transmissions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>

1048
00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 1>just basically help the whole ecology of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals to make sure there's not</v>

1049
00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:03.820
<v Speaker 1>things coming into our populations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1050
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 1>are going to end up affecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because,</v>

1051
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think like when people start cutting</v>

1052
00:44:10.401 --> 00:44:13.310
<v Speaker 1>budgets and they start looking for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1053
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where can we reduce spending?</v>

1054
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Like there might be a few people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>come along and go,</v>

1055
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:19.010
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we give a shit about these</v>

1056
00:44:19.011 --> 00:44:20.390
<v Speaker 1>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1057
00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:21.440
<v Speaker 1>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that come up?</v>

1058
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that always comes up anytime budgets or</v>

1059
00:44:23.811 --> 00:44:26.570
<v Speaker 1>dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for us,</v>

1060
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:30.230
<v Speaker 1>for an important thing for us is just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that we do everything we can</v>

1061
00:44:30.231 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 1>to protect our resources within our</v>
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>

1062
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.310
<v Speaker 1>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have identified that this is a</v>

1063
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:39.330
<v Speaker 1>potential risk for our local wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why we've started studying</v>

1064
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:40.950
<v Speaker 1>the things like the mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bobcat's.</v>

1065
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 1>So our park is completely surrounded by</v>
<v Speaker 1>urbanization.</v>

1066
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have lots of influences.</v>

1067
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean our mountains are about 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of it is privately owned and so</v>

1068
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:52.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of chances for</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

1069
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 1>so it's important for us to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>how development is affecting the</v>

1070
00:44:56.731 --> 00:44:59.190
<v Speaker 1>wildlife so we can help try to mitigate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the future.</v>

1071
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you are dealing with these</v>

1072
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 1>animals and you're collecting data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

1073
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.670
<v Speaker 1>do you guys share it with people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a other peers that you have that</v>

1074
00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 1>work in much larger areas and do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>find like similar patterns and similar</v>

1075
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.590
<v Speaker 1>similar results?</v>

1076
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 1>So we generally share it through</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific publications is usually how</v>

1077
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:21.470
<v Speaker 1>stuff is shared between us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1078
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.730
<v Speaker 1>that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely talked to other parks like</v>

1079
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just recently went there to help them</v>

1080
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:27.270
<v Speaker 1>do some raccoons stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1081
00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:29.910
<v Speaker 1>and so we will definitely share</v>
<v Speaker 1>information to try to help deal with</v>

1082
00:45:29.911 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 1>similar issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was up there for about three or</v>

1083
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:36.030
<v Speaker 1>four days and we talked about lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1084
00:45:36.031 --> 00:45:39.230
<v Speaker 1>but one things they've had with coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 1>is people feeding them out of the car.</v>

1085
00:45:39.231 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 1>So like people will drive through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take food because the coyotes</v>

1086
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.640
<v Speaker 1>hanging off nearby and they'll throw it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the car to the coyote.</v>

1087
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:48.240
<v Speaker 1>The coyote got so habituated to that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just be coming up to every car and</v>

1088
00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:51.030
<v Speaker 1>start jumping up on cars low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're like,</v>

1089
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.770
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ended up having to remove the</v>

1090
00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:55.590
<v Speaker 1>animal because all these people just</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up feeding it.</v>

1091
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.650
<v Speaker 1>They would go up and scare the thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

1092
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I think they even tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they said they tried to paint</v>

1093
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:01.980
<v Speaker 1>ball at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1094
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:06.600
<v Speaker 1>but it ended up learning who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they learned their cars that</v>

1095
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:08.520
<v Speaker 1>learned who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time they would come up the</v>

1096
00:46:08.521 --> 00:46:10.320
<v Speaker 1>kite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would disappear back into the bushes,</v>

1097
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.410
<v Speaker 1>even if they tried it in their own cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would still do it to their own</v>

1098
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.120
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coyote recognize them now.</v>

1099
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Over time it ended up learning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize the people.</v>

1100
00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.250
<v Speaker 1>They're too smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

1101
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so interesting now.</v>

1102
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.010
<v Speaker 1>And I definitely noticed that even with</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapping and stuff and we're trying to</v>

1103
00:46:26.011 --> 00:46:27.840
<v Speaker 1>capture these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's times when they</v>

1104
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:31.020
<v Speaker 1>definitely kind of avoid the area</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some of these animals had been</v>

1105
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 1>on the air for years and so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we try to capture them as many times as</v>

1106
00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:35.550
<v Speaker 1>we can to keep them on there.</v>

1107
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:38.310
<v Speaker 1>So our callers only generally last</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between a year and three years</v>

1108
00:46:38.311 --> 00:46:39.720
<v Speaker 1>depending on what kind of color we put</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them.</v>

1109
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of times we want to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>them on long term so we actually</v>

1110
00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:44.700
<v Speaker 1>understand the whole life cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

1111
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we'll go in and try to capture</v>

1112
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:48.670
<v Speaker 1>them again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>

1113
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.820
<v Speaker 1>They're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of learned to avoid once I</v>

1114
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 1>start going into an area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well coordinated.</v>

1115
00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:57.831
<v Speaker 1>Dan is a big part of their cleverness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also their adaptability comes from</v>

1116
00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:02.340
<v Speaker 1>them being preyed upon by gray wolves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their relationship with gray wolves</v>

1117
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:05.400
<v Speaker 1>and gray wolves had left and then come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to North America.</v>

1118
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes kind of thrived.</v>

1119
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.220
<v Speaker 1>And when they came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a period of thousands of years</v>

1120
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.710
<v Speaker 1>of them being preyed upon by these gray</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>

1121
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.910
<v Speaker 1>So they've adapted all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of mechanisms in order to stay</v>

1122
00:47:17.911 --> 00:47:21.180
<v Speaker 1>alive and to avoid predation.</v>

1123
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.850
<v Speaker 1>And one of them being that they expand</v>
<v Speaker 1>their range.</v>

1124
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:27.990
<v Speaker 1>So as we've tried to kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Dan was saying is</v>

1125
00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 1>that when they do that roll thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's missing the female will</v>

1126
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 1>actually have larger litters and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll expand the range.</v>

1127
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.890
<v Speaker 1>So when you shoot one you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1128
00:47:37.891 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 1>we're keeping the coyote population</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1129
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:42.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably raised it up by like 10,</v>

1130
00:47:42.311 --> 00:47:45.700
<v Speaker 1>15 percent and expanded the range by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few miles.</v>

1131
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's just based off the</v>

1132
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:50.380
<v Speaker 1>calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that before and there's some</v>

1133
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:52.600
<v Speaker 1>dispute about whether that's the full</v>
<v Speaker 1>case or not,</v>

1134
00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:54.370
<v Speaker 1>but definitely because there's lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

1135
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:57.610
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely more food resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>available and so it makes sense that</v>

1136
00:47:57.611 --> 00:48:00.070
<v Speaker 1>they would read then reproduce more</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we definitely know if food</v>

1137
00:48:00.071 --> 00:48:02.350
<v Speaker 1>resources go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes can increase their numbers.</v>

1138
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:02.891
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1139
00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:06.190
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a direct result of them being</v>

1140
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:06.990
<v Speaker 1>preyed upon you.</v>

1141
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's probably in dispute?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1142
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.980
<v Speaker 1>the preyed upon hot or killed or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1143
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.340
<v Speaker 1>removed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean truthfully doesn't matter how the</v>

1144
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:17.950
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the population decreases and the</v>

1145
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 1>fact is that it's down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then pray numbers go up and so then</v>

1146
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:26.410
<v Speaker 1>there's more prey and so then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce more because Dan was implying</v>

1147
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:30.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a direct correlation between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a physiological event that</v>

1148
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:34.870
<v Speaker 1>happens inside the female that when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population grows smaller,</v>

1149
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.010
<v Speaker 1>their litters grow larger in response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population being smaller,</v>

1150
00:48:39.011 --> 00:48:41.770
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily in response to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase of food supply.</v>

1151
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>

1152
00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:46.480
<v Speaker 1>the only things I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually Dave associated somehow</v>

1153
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 1>with food supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was probably,</v>

1154
00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:51.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe a combination of those factors are</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well could be.</v>

1155
00:48:51.371 --> 00:48:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated,</v>

1156
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are crazy with what they can do.</v>

1157
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely fascinating how</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptable they are though.</v>

1158
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything like them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1159
00:49:02.081 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you start thinking of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crows,</v>

1160
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:07.390
<v Speaker 1>they can be pretty adaptable to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can live in a wide variety of areas</v>

1161
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.150
<v Speaker 1>that through three d space they moved to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

1162
00:49:10.151 --> 00:49:12.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a different sort of bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1163
00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:13.240
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the coyotes,</v>

1164
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 1>they definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not any of has pieces the move</v>

1165
00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:20.140
<v Speaker 1>around the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have a very able to live in</v>

1166
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 1>the most urban environments we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

1167
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean places that people generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of maybe raccoon and be able to</v>

1168
00:49:24.821 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know in Chicago they've gone into</v>

1169
00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:30.370
<v Speaker 1>areas where they have coyotes living and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did not have raccoons living in</v>

1170
00:49:30.371 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 1>those same locations or if there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were recommends were very rare and</v>

1171
00:49:34.151 --> 00:49:35.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coyote seen to be able to persist,</v>

1172
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing for an animal that</v>
<v Speaker 1>size.</v>

1173
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just shows how intelligent they are</v>

1174
00:49:39.731 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 1>to be able to move around us and be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take advantage of us.</v>

1175
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Is it because they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've run faster,</v>

1176
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:46.570
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a combination of things.</v>

1177
00:49:46.571 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>They learn how to deal with roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1178
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:49.330
<v Speaker 1>anytime you get these urban</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments,</v>

1179
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:52.240
<v Speaker 1>like one thing I always like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like the West Lake neighborhood,</v>

1180
00:49:52.241 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods for pedestrians.</v>

1181
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Yet this coyotes running this</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood all the time and it didn't</v>

1182
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:01.000
<v Speaker 1>have any signs of ever been struck by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1183
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the smartest coyote is</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than the dumbest person?</v>

1184
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1185
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.593
<v Speaker 1>that's deep.</v>

1186
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean they live in places that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if I could live there.</v>

1188
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what city has,</v>

1189
00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.790
<v Speaker 1>is there any city in the country that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually has a legitimate problem with</v>

1190
00:50:21.791 --> 00:50:23.970
<v Speaker 1>coyote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends who you talk to.</v>

1191
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>

1192
00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>we definitely have our issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean been bites.</v>

1193
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:30.410
<v Speaker 1>There's been other situations been</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitten.</v>

1194
00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1195
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Elysian park had some bites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bites down in Orange County or</v>

1196
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.780
<v Speaker 1>mine had some bites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they biting homeless people?</v>

1197
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Are they biting people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take naps.</v>

1198
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.020
<v Speaker 1>What are the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all over the board usually it seems</v>

1199
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:45.500
<v Speaker 1>to be tied to people been feeding it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's almost coming up and biting like</v>

1200
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 1>people on the hands or people on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>leg.</v>

1201
00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any of them know.</v>

1202
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 1>The ones I've heard had been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're trying to take the person</v>

1203
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 1>down real type thing.</v>

1204
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Speaker 1>They've all been more like where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up and none of them,</v>

1205
00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.040
<v Speaker 1>none of them have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1206
00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you heard about the woman who was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>folk singer in Canada that got killed a</v>

1207
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 1>couple of years back by coyotes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I actually went up there a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years after that.</v>

1209
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 1>They actually got a study going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes up there.</v>

1210
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:10.820
<v Speaker 1>They radio collared a bunch and I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>up there and helped him capture the</v>

1211
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:12.800
<v Speaker 1>first couple of animals to kind of see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

1212
00:51:12.801 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a crazy scenario up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1213
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 1>It's way different than what we see down</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1214
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:18.280
<v Speaker 1>The coyotes first or there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern coyotes,</v>

1215
00:51:18.281 --> 00:51:21.230
<v Speaker 1>so they're a little bit bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also,</v>

1216
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.930
<v Speaker 1>they kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's very few food sources up there.</v>

1217
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.050
<v Speaker 1>They're dealing with snowshoe hares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which their cycles kind of fluctuate up</v>

1218
00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 1>and down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes there could be tons of</v>

1219
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 1>food and other times there can be almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>none,</v>

1220
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.070
<v Speaker 1>but they've learned that they can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of Moose during the winter and</v>

1221
00:51:34.071 --> 00:51:36.650
<v Speaker 1>they're actually killing Moose in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>snow,</v>

1222
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.220
<v Speaker 1>which you think of this little 40 inch</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound animal.</v>

1223
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Take it on this huge Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're seeing it.</v>

1224
00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:46.460
<v Speaker 1>They do these snow surveys and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding these dead moose that were very</v>

1225
00:51:46.461 --> 00:51:48.440
<v Speaker 1>clearly killed by coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1226
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:50.440
<v Speaker 1>So a full grown moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.290
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:55.190
<v Speaker 1>A full grown moose is like more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand pounds.</v>

1229
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1231
00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.350
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1232
00:51:57.351 --> 00:52:00.620
<v Speaker 1>obviously these moose in the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snow gets deep right there.</v>

1233
00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.650
<v Speaker 1>They're definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can get stuck in things.</v>

1234
00:52:03.651 --> 00:52:06.290
<v Speaker 1>And that type of scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they know that it's coyotes have</v>

1235
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:08.630
<v Speaker 1>killed him in a wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no wolves there.</v>

1236
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1237
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that a coyote could kill</v>

1238
00:52:14.511 --> 00:52:17.030
<v Speaker 1>a fucking moose will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had them radio collared.</v>

1239
00:52:17.031 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 1>So they were able to see the coyotes at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carcasses and stuff too.</v>

1240
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they have the radio collar,</v>

1241
00:52:22.371 --> 00:52:25.610
<v Speaker 1>how much information are they getting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they get like a full,</v>

1242
00:52:25.611 --> 00:52:28.370
<v Speaker 1>like if you could see a map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you see like the trail,</v>

1243
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:29.330
<v Speaker 1>like everywhere they go?</v>

1244
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>

1245
00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:33.260
<v Speaker 1>So the colors have different settings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so their gps units,</v>

1246
00:52:33.261 --> 00:52:37.940
<v Speaker 1>so there's always a trade off between</v>
<v Speaker 1>battery life and the number of locations</v>

1247
00:52:37.941 --> 00:52:39.950
<v Speaker 1>you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could,</v>

1248
00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.550
<v Speaker 1>if you only cared about a two week span,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have that GPS unit take a</v>

1249
00:52:43.551 --> 00:52:47.930
<v Speaker 1>location every 30 seconds and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>map it out.</v>

1250
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.200
<v Speaker 1>But generally we're interested in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader timeframe.</v>

1251
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.210
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times we're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the Lions,</v>

1252
00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:55.940
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times it's about eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>locations a day and that's a pretty good</v>

1253
00:52:55.941 --> 00:53:00.941
<v Speaker 1>size color on the coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually do somewhere around six and</v>

1254
00:53:01.101 --> 00:53:04.370
<v Speaker 1>then I'll do these little bouts where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do 20 minute locations a day and so</v>

1255
00:53:04.371 --> 00:53:07.670
<v Speaker 1>then I'll get more intensity to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I can map out like where they</v>

1256
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:10.790
<v Speaker 1>come up to roads or where they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things where they're feeding.</v>

1257
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.051
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1258
00:53:12.051 --> 00:53:14.630
<v Speaker 1>you can get some pretty detailed data on</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they're moving.</v>

1259
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:19.040
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of a battery source are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>using on these colors that you can get</v>

1260
00:53:19.041 --> 00:53:21.380
<v Speaker 1>such a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how long does it like if you</v>

1261
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:23.570
<v Speaker 1>stretch it out the longest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long can they last?</v>

1262
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 1>So there's different sides of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collars and so like the lion callers</v>

1263
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be two d cell batteries in them</v>

1264
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:32.780
<v Speaker 1>which are just Lithium d cell batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1265
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.760
<v Speaker 1>and those go about two years with a two</v>
<v Speaker 1>D cell battery.</v>

1266
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1267
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 1>you can put them on tiny little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people have done not what gp s</v>

1268
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:41.941
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe,</v>

1269
00:53:41.941 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but they've even done like little bugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they've put the.</v>

1270
00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:46.980
<v Speaker 1>So the colors have to different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a gps and they have a vhf</v>

1271
00:53:46.981 --> 00:53:48.810
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vhf allows us to actually go out and</v>

1272
00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:49.500
<v Speaker 1>track the animals.</v>

1273
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.900
<v Speaker 1>So when you see the biologists out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those antanas,</v>

1274
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.120
<v Speaker 1>so you literally know where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

1275
00:53:54.121 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how like all of these</v>

1276
00:53:55.471 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 1>observations I've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I see them.</v>

1277
00:53:57.661 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's because they have that little</v>
<v Speaker 1>beacon that goes off in a color and so I</v>

1278
00:54:00.391 --> 00:54:04.020
<v Speaker 1>can track them with that antenna and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they are and get pretty close to</v>

1279
00:54:04.021 --> 00:54:04.980
<v Speaker 1>them and see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>

1280
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:06.200
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1281
00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally the last two years with</v>

1282
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:09.460
<v Speaker 1>two D cell batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1283
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And then when the two years are up that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where he is exactly the</v>

1284
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's amazing about the lions is that</v>

1285
00:54:15.751 --> 00:54:18.300
<v Speaker 1>we can recapture them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have really good success rate getting</v>

1286
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:20.280
<v Speaker 1>those guys back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so jeff's been amazing.</v>

1287
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's been able to get these</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals time after time after time.</v>

1288
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's why like a p 22 has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>captured so many times because we have</v>

1289
00:54:25.891 --> 00:54:28.930
<v Speaker 1>to replace the collar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's usually about every two years we</v>

1290
00:54:28.931 --> 00:54:30.970
<v Speaker 1>had to replace the collar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it.</v>

1291
00:54:30.971 --> 00:54:33.870
<v Speaker 1>So how are they tracking that cat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1292
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done multiple things.</v>

1293
00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 1>We've gotten lucky one time and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually down in a hole and me and jeff</v>

1294
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:43.800
<v Speaker 1>were actually there and we darted the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and it just fell asleep in the</v>

1295
00:54:43.801 --> 00:54:45.510
<v Speaker 1>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty sweet.</v>

1296
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.360
<v Speaker 1>So you saw in a whole like a hole in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

1297
00:54:48.361 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drainage channel was kind of eroded</v>

1298
00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:55.170
<v Speaker 1>away and he was kind of down in this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of brush covering it and</v>

1299
00:54:55.171 --> 00:54:59.640
<v Speaker 1>so he felt pretty comfortable I guess</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just stayed there and so we were</v>

1300
00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:03.660
<v Speaker 1>hiking into don't know if we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a kill or if we were just</v>

1301
00:55:03.661 --> 00:55:04.200
<v Speaker 1>checking on him.</v>

1302
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what we were doing but</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1303
00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:08.940
<v Speaker 1>We saw him and so we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's try to Darden.</v>

1304
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And so I stood there and waited for jeff</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go get the stuff and jeff was able to</v>

1305
00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:16.280
<v Speaker 1>darden when he came back and the cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>just laid there like we put a dart in</v>

1306
00:55:16.281 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He growled out us.</v>

1307
00:55:17.191 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 1>He laid back down and fell asleep and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were able to process them.</v>

1308
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:22.520
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that when a cat growls at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

1309
00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually pretty freaking cool</v>

1310
00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.810
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing being that close to</v>

1311
00:55:28.811 --> 00:55:31.270
<v Speaker 1>such a big animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just how far away were you?</v>

1312
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Probably from me to your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1313
00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.730
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

1314
00:55:36.731 --> 00:55:38.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1315
00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a backup gun or a Taser or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We carry person America Shield.</v>

1316
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Get them out there in the captain</v>
<v Speaker 1>America Shield.</v>

1317
00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:48.183
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

1318
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I would think that would actually be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good move for a cap.</v>

1319
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a big Ole like gladiator shield.</v>

1320
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably be confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd tried to Jack you run into the</v>

1321
00:55:59.501 --> 00:56:00.700
<v Speaker 1>shield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is he?</v>

1322
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:01.631
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:56:01.631 --> 00:56:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I want to carry that</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the brush though.</v>

1324
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1325
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.480
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do carry bear spray.</v>

1326
00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we haven't had to use it.</v>

1327
00:56:09.611 --> 00:56:12.310
<v Speaker 1>So retail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just use it once and tell me.</v>

1328
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Because I was thinking like I run</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the hills.</v>

1329
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1330
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an area where I run where it's</v>

1331
00:56:18.881 --> 00:56:21.350
<v Speaker 1>really desolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one out there and I know this</v>

1332
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 1>bobcat's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1333
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.670
<v Speaker 1>but I also now know that there's a mount</v>
<v Speaker 1>line there because a buddy of mine saw a</v>

1334
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:32.671
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion there and it had a collar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he heard about a mountain lion</v>

1335
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:38.011
<v Speaker 1>that got killed on the five freeway and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he checked a website.</v>

1336
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Is there a website that shows you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>track,</v>

1337
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.670
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were where the animal has been?</v>

1338
00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are that we can see.</v>

1339
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:48.400
<v Speaker 1>We don't share that with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder how he found out he,</v>

1340
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:51.210
<v Speaker 1>he knows a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he asked somebody but,</v>

1341
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:55.120
<v Speaker 1>but found out that it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the was the mountain lion that he saw in</v>

1342
00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:57.250
<v Speaker 1>his neighborhood and he lives pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the five.</v>

1343
00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1344
00:56:58.571 --> 00:56:59.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1345
00:56:59.231 --> 00:57:00.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining that,</v>

1346
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:01.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he saw it.</v>

1347
00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1348
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 1>we don't have any cats that are up there</v>
<v Speaker 1>near the five.</v>

1349
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:07.000
<v Speaker 1>So probably he could have probably just</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at that map that you guys put up</v>

1350
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:08.620
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even it could have easily been one of</v>

1351
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:12.400
<v Speaker 1>those because there's just not many up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that area that we have collared,</v>

1352
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 1>but they do occasionally get hit by</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

1353
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:14.681
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:16.450
<v Speaker 1>That's actually one of our biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>causes.</v>

1355
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Mortality these days is them getting hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>by cars.</v>

1356
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we work a lot with Caltrans to try to</v>

1357
00:57:20.921 --> 00:57:24.880
<v Speaker 1>improve permeability of the roadways for</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife and protect them from being hit</v>

1358
00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:27.400
<v Speaker 1>by cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there was a ramp that was being</v>

1359
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 1>proposed that they were going to put a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ramp over the highway.</v>

1360
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.211
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1361
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:35.020
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caltrans proposes wildlife overpass on</v>

1362
00:57:35.021 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now where were they?</v>

1363
00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Kind of try to put that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is supposed to be near Liberty</v>

1364
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1365
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.410
<v Speaker 1>where's Liberty Kenyon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1366
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:45.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just a little bit west of here near</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Gora Oh,</v>

1367
00:57:45.911 --> 00:57:46.790
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1368
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:48.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>

1369
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.860
<v Speaker 1>this overpass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be big from outlines,</v>

1370
00:57:50.861 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 1>but also lots of other wildlife in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

1371
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:58.450
<v Speaker 1>So we have seen that the 101 freeway is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major barrier to gene flow.</v>

1372
00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:00.130
<v Speaker 1>And so things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even coyotes,</v>

1373
00:58:00.131 --> 00:58:02.470
<v Speaker 1>even though they are able to live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this super urban environment,</v>

1374
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:03.490
<v Speaker 1>not one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh one.</v>

1375
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.520
<v Speaker 1>And the development along one-on-one is</v>
<v Speaker 1>serving as a barrier that they're not</v>

1376
00:58:06.521 --> 00:58:10.420
<v Speaker 1>getting across regularly enough to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population genetics up.</v>

1377
00:58:10.421 --> 00:58:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So genetic diversity south of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>freeway is a lot lower than genetic</v>

1378
00:58:14.111 --> 00:58:15.590
<v Speaker 1>diversity north to the freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1379
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for Bobcats,</v>

1380
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:22.220
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions and coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who works at the tone</v>

1381
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.890
<v Speaker 1>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know where that is?</v>

1382
00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy that works there too.</v>

1383
00:58:24.921 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually just there this weekend</v>

1384
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:30.730
<v Speaker 1>and they were explaining to me that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a camera trap on one of the</v>

1385
00:58:30.731 --> 00:58:34.150
<v Speaker 1>waterholes and they saw 16 different</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions.</v>

1386
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got 16 photos of 16 different</v>

1387
00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:39.370
<v Speaker 1>cats that are on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A huge ranch,</v>

1388
00:58:39.371 --> 00:58:41.740
<v Speaker 1>270,000 acres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enormous ranch.</v>

1389
00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:58:42.761 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1391
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they could identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>each individual lion.</v>

1392
00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:48.460
<v Speaker 1>That's my first question is how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

1393
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1394
00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.000
<v Speaker 1>the mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be quite a few of them.</v>

1395
00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times with mountain lions will</v>

1396
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:55.180
<v Speaker 1>come back obviously with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with something like a water</v>

1397
00:58:55.181 --> 00:58:56.740
<v Speaker 1>source there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1398
00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 1>so I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would question whether it was</v>

1399
00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:00.220
<v Speaker 1>different or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1400
00:59:00.221 --> 00:59:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a place like the hone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1401
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:02.201
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1402
00:59:02.201 --> 00:59:07.201
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different prey animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're from elk to deer to a special</v>

1403
00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:08.920
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1404
00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.920
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just mean everything.</v>

1405
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 1>The wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flowers,</v>

1406
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.150
<v Speaker 1>the pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's just a crazy,</v>

1407
00:59:16.151 --> 00:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>crazy place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1408
00:59:17.531 --> 00:59:18.780
<v Speaker 1>So many pigs there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1409
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:23.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a nutty farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutty ranch and it's so large.</v>

1410
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:25.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my buddy's like cowboy up there and</v>

1411
00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:28.170
<v Speaker 1>so he took me for a tour to kind of see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ranch and it's,</v>

1412
00:59:28.171 --> 00:59:29.070
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Well it's the biggest ranch in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

1414
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.770
<v Speaker 1>270,000 acres.</v>

1415
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:36.230
<v Speaker 1>It's almost hard to wrap your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>around how big it is,</v>

1416
00:59:36.231 --> 00:59:38.810
<v Speaker 1>but when you're there and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far does it go?</v>

1417
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:40.670
<v Speaker 1>And then you go see that third mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>

1418
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 1>We go to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1419
00:59:41.571 --> 00:59:42.404
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1420
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.560
<v Speaker 1>over to the desert over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1421
00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.900
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the water for Los Angeles goes</v>

1422
00:59:47.901 --> 00:59:50.450
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see that gigantic water pipe that</v>

1423
00:59:50.451 --> 00:59:51.440
<v Speaker 1>goes through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1424
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:52.740
<v Speaker 1>your iphone ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1425
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

1426
00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:55.220
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the water goes.</v>

1427
00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 1>It goes through this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1428
00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.420
<v Speaker 1>it's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1429
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1430
01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 1>it's weird that we have a place that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour and a half outside of La that</v>

1431
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>has elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this like,</v>

1432
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.700
<v Speaker 1>we're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

1433
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:11.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a unique spot a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1434
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1435
01:00:12.231 --> 01:00:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be tons of elk here,</v>

1436
01:00:13.941 --> 01:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all the Tuli elk,</v>

1437
01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>they used to cover the whole area at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories of Tulio pick out in the San</v>

1438
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Joaquin Valley.</v>

1439
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:23.150
<v Speaker 1>They're just amazing numbers of elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1440
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>we'll also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly bears and grizzlies.</v>

1441
01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:26.404
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1442
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1443
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:33.191
<v Speaker 1>there's a town up near to home that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>named after the last guy that got killed</v>

1444
01:00:33.261 --> 01:00:36.680
<v Speaker 1>by a grizzly bear in California before</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wiped them out.</v>

1445
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.110
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember.</v>

1446
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember the town's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dammit.</v>

1447
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.320
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1448
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:49.670
<v Speaker 1>it's been confirmed that he was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually exude his body and found</v>

1449
01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>it broken up into pieces and one of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs was chewed off like,</v>

1450
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you really did get jacked by a</v>

1451
01:00:55.841 --> 01:00:58.850
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently we had enormous coastal bears</v>

1452
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's why they wiped them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like when the settlers came</v>

1453
01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:02.481
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1454
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

1455
01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>We've got to kill these goddamn things</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were like,</v>

1456
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kodiak sized enormous bears,</v>

1457
01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:12.380
<v Speaker 1>but obviously they did a good job since</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a single grizzly left in</v>

1458
01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

1459
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one animal.</v>

1460
01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Lubeck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1461
01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Beck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1462
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>that's one animal where people are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>clamoring for reintroduction.</v>

1463
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1464
01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>like let's truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no area left for them,</v>

1465
01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>like the area that grizzlies occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've developed,</v>

1466
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:30.050
<v Speaker 1>turned in agriculture and urbanization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bringing grizzlies back.</v>

1467
01:01:30.051 --> 01:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear it every once in a while</v>

1468
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>somebody say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

1469
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>they're too big and they need too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>food and too much of that food is living</v>

1470
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>animals and that would be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1471
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>even if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1472
01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>even all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is no habitat,</v>

1473
01:01:45.021 --> 01:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>where did you put on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not sure they're not going</v>

1474
01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>to live up in the high mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we have.</v>

1475
01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Say That's what we have protected is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sierras and those types of things.</v>

1476
01:01:51.511 --> 01:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>That's not grizzly habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we do have quite a bit of black</v>

1477
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1478
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can live up in the mountain.</v>

1479
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>They do much better in that scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating to me how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing is sort of like a,</v>

1481
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>a balanced system and they all sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep each other in check.</v>

1482
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California is a good example of that</v>

1483
01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:16.130
<v Speaker 1>because it's one of the few states that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a large healthy mountain lion</v>

1484
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't allow hunting of mountain</v>

1485
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of that you have less dear</v>

1486
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people will complain about that</v>

1487
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because of that you have less</v>

1488
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>car accidents with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1489
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Like if you live in like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy lives in Iowa.</v>

1490
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>You have to drive slow because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking deer just jumping out in front</v>

1491
01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>of the road every 50 to 100 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1492
01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially during the Rut when they're</v>

1493
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>breeding and they get silly.</v>

1494
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>See just dead deer every couple miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had dead deer on the side of the</v>

1495
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:44.780
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1496
01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're a lot different obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the midwest like you're talking</v>

1497
01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>about too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot less vegetation or a lot</v>

1498
01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>more lawless rains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot less of that good quality</v>

1499
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>vegetation for the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our deer numbers are also going to be</v>

1500
01:02:54.331 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>in check partially just because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the highest quality habitat for</v>

1501
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:01.230
<v Speaker 1>deer and most of our areas is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they?</v>

1502
01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Just eating grass and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1503
01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they either date?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of.</v>

1504
01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Browse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of brush sage,</v>

1505
01:03:05.591 --> 01:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

1506
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.220
<v Speaker 1>a lot of sage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can definitely eat sage.</v>

1507
01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:12.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like deer brush and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lots of variety of types of broaden</v>

1508
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>and you walk through there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tons of different varieties that</v>

1509
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>they eat.</v>

1510
01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually have a couple of deer radio</v>

1511
01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:18.900
<v Speaker 1>collared right now that we're following</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

1512
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:21.930
<v Speaker 1>they're always browsing on something</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see them usually something</v>

1513
01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Speaker 1>taller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you capture them?</v>

1514
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:26.520
<v Speaker 1>We dart them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do,</v>

1515
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 1>do you set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you trap them?</v>

1516
01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:30.510
<v Speaker 1>And then Darden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we freed artem.</v>

1517
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you do that?</v>

1518
01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically just try to find where</v>

1519
01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>they're at and he's basically hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically hunting with a rifle.</v>

1520
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:41.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot like archery basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're ringing just to be like</v>

1521
01:03:41.671 --> 01:03:42.540
<v Speaker 1>really short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1522
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody really good with the dart</v>

1523
01:03:44.941 --> 01:03:47.490
<v Speaker 1>rifle and probably get up to 70 meters</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so.</v>

1524
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that person.</v>

1525
01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm about 30 meters with mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many deer have you darted?</v>

1526
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I've only started to here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1527
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.820
<v Speaker 1>but we're hoping that we still have four</v>
<v Speaker 1>more we need to do.</v>

1528
01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So is it an air rifle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1529
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:01.890
<v Speaker 1>so there's two different types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one that's basically powered off</v>

1530
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:05.340
<v Speaker 1>of a 22 shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's another one that's powered</v>

1531
01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:06.810
<v Speaker 1>off CEO to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1532
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And so do you practice with this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get good at it?</v>

1533
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:11.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you practiced.</v>

1534
01:04:11.651 --> 01:04:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a rifle.</v>

1535
01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:14.370
<v Speaker 1>You got a scope and all that so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

1536
01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>you get it all it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ballistics must be terrible.</v>

1537
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh they're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's even more complicated because</v>

1538
01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:23.190
<v Speaker 1>you want it to arch really lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to hit the end of the soft as</v>

1539
01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>possible because if you hit them hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to run and the drug,</v>

1540
01:04:26.131 --> 01:04:27.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the drug takes them down</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

1541
01:04:27.901 --> 01:04:30.330
<v Speaker 1>We usually have about 10 minutes for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal to go down and.</v>

1542
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never find them.</v>

1543
01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:32.634
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1544
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:36.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's really about like arching that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot in there really softly hit them as</v>

1545
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:39.210
<v Speaker 1>soft as possible and then lot of times</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't go very far.</v>

1546
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what's the feet per second of</v>

1547
01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:43.850
<v Speaker 1>the dark?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1548
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't,</v>

1549
01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.420
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the chronology or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a radar thing that you shoot</v>

1550
01:04:48.421 --> 01:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>it through and we don't want to borrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

1551
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1552
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1553
01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:54.660
<v Speaker 1>because I think that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1554
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Like [inaudible] you must have like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drop must be huge.</v>

1555
01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>It is like how do you cite in a scope</v>
<v Speaker 1>for something for people to know what</v>

1556
01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:04.800
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you shoot a rifle,</v>

1557
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:07.620
<v Speaker 1>rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bullet goes very fast so you could</v>

1558
01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>shoot out into a 100 yards and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially is going to go exactly where</v>

1559
01:05:11.581 --> 01:05:14.490
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when you go to 200 yards it</v>

1560
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>gets a little tricky and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust your scope because it'll a little</v>

1561
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1562
01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>You get to 300 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll drop a little bit more.</v>

1563
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred yards in oud is where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets really weird.</v>

1564
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Like you're dealing with wind drift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with drop.</v>

1565
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So I would imagine that a dart is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going very fast so it probably drops</v>

1566
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does and it's heavy.</v>

1567
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.430
<v Speaker 1>They're fairly long there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many grains is it?</v>

1568
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Half inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many grains they are.</v>

1569
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.220
<v Speaker 1>They don't come those measurements and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never weighed once.</v>

1570
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously because they are going so</v>

1571
01:05:46.811 --> 01:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with wind drift at.</v>

1572
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five meters,</v>

1573
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>then you can start doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not aerodynamic either.</v>

1574
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not horrible.</v>

1575
01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's basically looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>syringe with a needle on the end and we</v>

1576
01:05:58.751 --> 01:06:00.460
<v Speaker 1>have some feathers on the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1577
01:06:00.461 --> 01:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>so you have like flushings to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it fletcher genes.</v>

1578
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like.</v>

1579
01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:06.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1580
01:06:06.011 --> 01:06:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty ml air for 10 point.</v>

1581
01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ml dart was at me.</v>

1582
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put 20 milliliters of air for</v>

1583
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:17.950
<v Speaker 1>the tin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dark.</v>

1584
01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:20.410
<v Speaker 1>That's holds 10 milliliters of drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1585
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not the exact drug we use.</v>

1586
01:06:22.901 --> 01:06:24.750
<v Speaker 1>We use one called a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's a nude art.</v>

1587
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:26.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually has a.</v>

1588
01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>So ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the ones we use for the deer,</v>

1589
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:32.680
<v Speaker 1>we use these types as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the deer we use ones that have a</v>

1590
01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>little charge and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when it hits it discharges basically</v>

1591
01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:40.210
<v Speaker 1>by like a shell would gunpowder in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trigger triggers off Jesus Christ.</v>

1592
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to sneak up on these deer</v>

1593
01:06:43.901 --> 01:06:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and then do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:47.310
<v Speaker 1>So what I was going to tell you what</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

1595
01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>how we adjust for that distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the last question you</v>

1596
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:50.440
<v Speaker 1>were asking.</v>

1597
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.140
<v Speaker 1>So the nice thing about our rifles</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus a regular rifle.</v>

1598
01:06:53.141 --> 01:06:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So you get one chill and that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go with us because it's air powered,</v>

1599
01:06:56.831 --> 01:07:01.210
<v Speaker 1>we can adjust our pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to account for that distance,</v>

1600
01:07:01.211 --> 01:07:06.211
<v Speaker 1>we know at 20 yards we do two bars of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure at 30 yards we do three bars of</v>

1601
01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:08.740
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that type of thing.</v>

1602
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a little bit more</v>

1603
01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:13.270
<v Speaker 1>adjustability than typical rifle would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you walking around with a range</v>

1604
01:07:13.271 --> 01:07:17.290
<v Speaker 1>finder and then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're changing it on your rifle as you</v>

1605
01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:18.850
<v Speaker 1>go along?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:07:18.851 --> 01:07:22.060
<v Speaker 1>As we make our decision we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't like we don't walk with</v>

1607
01:07:22.061 --> 01:07:23.050
<v Speaker 1>it charged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1608
01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean our darts in there ready to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't fire.</v>

1609
01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't have our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our pressure up until we know what deer</v>

1610
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:34.210
<v Speaker 1>we're taking in the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Are you aiming for center mass?</v>

1611
01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hip?</v>

1612
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why hip?</v>

1613
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Because that's where the biggest muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1614
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1615
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the DA,</v>

1616
01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>the drugs enact intramuscularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you accidentally hit the ribs,</v>

1617
01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:50.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not great.</v>

1618
01:07:50.321 --> 01:07:52.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still will probably put them to</v>

1619
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:56.290
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The needles aren't long enough that it</v>

1620
01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:58.800
<v Speaker 1>should do much damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna hit a vital right.</v>

1621
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can never say never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1622
01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:02.590
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to kill him.</v>

1623
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1624
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.840
<v Speaker 1>and that we practice a lot to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hit where we want to hit.</v>

1625
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.450
<v Speaker 1>How do you practice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a rubber deer that you shoot</v>

1626
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:13.090
<v Speaker 1>at a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have archery targets that we shoot</v>

1627
01:08:13.091 --> 01:08:13.540
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1629
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 1>And do you use a regular rifle scope or</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have like a scope specifically</v>

1630
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>designed for darts now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a regular rifle scope.</v>

1631
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:24.590
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1632
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>So how often do you practice in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1633
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.480
<v Speaker 1>before we do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I practice quite a few times.</v>

1634
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I go out like I don't practice daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you do with the archery,</v>

1635
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>but I practice pretty regularly when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before I was starting,</v>

1636
01:08:36.531 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>these last two were kind of taking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>break right now because they're falling</v>

1637
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:41.900
<v Speaker 1>and so we don't want to dart them while</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1638
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm dragging and dropping</v>
<v Speaker 1>fonds we weren't until fonts a little</v>

1639
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1640
01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever missed one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1641
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I haven't taken that many shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I miss any of my shots?</v>

1642
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>How many of you darted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the two.</v>

1643
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.263
<v Speaker 1>Just to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1644
01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is our first time doing dear stuff.</v>

1645
01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:02.240
<v Speaker 1>So fish and game came out and helped us</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these guys and which was great.</v>

1646
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.670
<v Speaker 1>And you have to dart to Moore's that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just said for more.</v>

1647
01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.593
<v Speaker 1>For more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1648
01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:08.420
<v Speaker 1>And why six?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that just like you just want a good</v>

1649
01:09:08.421 --> 01:09:12.170
<v Speaker 1>study number that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're looking at roadways and trying</v>

1650
01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:15.440
<v Speaker 1>to identify crossing points for what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean we're not just doing dear,</v>

1651
01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:18.740
<v Speaker 1>we're doing other species as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're trying to identify where we</v>

1652
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:20.000
<v Speaker 1>can make improvements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

1653
01:09:20.001 --> 01:09:25.001
<v Speaker 1>Wildlife overpass in other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why we're doing that and so</v>

1654
01:09:25.101 --> 01:09:27.920
<v Speaker 1>we're just trying to get a sample size</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can kind of work with and the</v>

1655
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:30.980
<v Speaker 1>colors aren't cheap so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about resources and what we have</v>

1656
01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:34.970
<v Speaker 1>that we can use towards the project and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what and what are you trying to gather?</v>

1657
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1658
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:38.600
<v Speaker 1>what data?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all movement based data.</v>

1659
01:09:38.601 --> 01:09:40.700
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are gps collars,</v>

1660
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:44.730
<v Speaker 1>they transmit us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be anywhere from I think the color</v>

1661
01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.410
<v Speaker 1>60 points a day down to I think my</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowest eight points a day.</v>

1662
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it'll tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll give me an idea of where the deer</v>

1663
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:55.190
<v Speaker 1>are approaching the roadways and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're moving relative to the roadway</v>

1664
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 1>so we can help come up with mitigation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to improve their ability to get across.</v>

1665
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.691
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1666
01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:03.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's all about their migration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're moving around and keeping</v>

1667
01:10:03.561 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 1>them away from danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1668
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:06.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wouldn't quite call it</v>
<v Speaker 1>migration,</v>

1669
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea is just to help them</v>

1670
01:10:08.781 --> 01:10:09.620
<v Speaker 1>build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get across.</v>

1671
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they Columbia blacktail?</v>

1672
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.560
<v Speaker 1>These are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are mule deer in our mouth.</v>

1673
01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1674
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Kenny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And are they like a pure mule deer?</v>

1675
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I believe so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1676
01:10:21.831 --> 01:10:23.480
<v Speaker 1>The black start a little bit north of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1677
01:10:23.481 --> 01:10:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly where the cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>off line is.</v>

1678
01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:29.120
<v Speaker 1>But so like right around here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the hills and like encino and</v>

1679
01:10:29.121 --> 01:10:29.690
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1680
01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Those are mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mule deer.</v>

1681
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1682
01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:33.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1683
01:10:33.261 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that too because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've deer hunted for years and I've</v>

1684
01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>always thought blocked hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1685
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 1>once I got here and started working with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them I was like,</v>

1686
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:40.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are on mule deer.</v>

1687
01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they make the differentiation,</v>

1688
01:10:42.801 --> 01:10:45.840
<v Speaker 1>how they understand that there's some</v>
<v Speaker 1>just physical characteristic differences</v>

1689
01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:50.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's been some genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>work done as well because traditionally</v>

1690
01:10:50.091 --> 01:10:53.330
<v Speaker 1>when you think of mule deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of a large deer with a big</v>

1691
01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:56.120
<v Speaker 1>rack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like mule deer have enormous racks.</v>

1692
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Like that deer right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a mule deer.</v>

1693
01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you saw one of those around</v>

1694
01:11:00.651 --> 01:11:01.221
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

1695
01:11:01.221 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you never see a deer that big</v>

1696
01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 1>around here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1697
01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some decent deer in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

1698
01:11:07.311 --> 01:11:08.190
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1699
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mule,</v>

1700
01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:11.810
<v Speaker 1>not all mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that big course where there's mule deer</v>

1701
01:11:11.811 --> 01:11:13.070
<v Speaker 1>that are still quite small.</v>

1702
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.260
<v Speaker 1>That's just what we're dealing with here</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the smaller end.</v>

1703
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>

1704
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 1>like they never really get a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that big because there's the</v>

1705
01:11:19.711 --> 01:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>populations are pretty small or is it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic issue?</v>

1706
01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:26.250
<v Speaker 1>We think it's a genetic issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>

1707
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>this population's been kind of isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time from others,</v>

1708
01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:33.000
<v Speaker 1>but California generally is not thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>of to have monster box even though</v>

1709
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of mule deer in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

1710
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 1>so it's more just the factor of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and so north of us is where the</v>

1711
01:11:40.351 --> 01:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>blacktail are and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did that,</v>

1712
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>what does that range begin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could.</v>

1713
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure off the top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inner breeding,</v>

1714
01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:48.870
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there is.</v>

1715
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're viable.</v>

1716
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Are they hybrids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume they're viable,</v>

1717
01:11:52.381 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 1>but I am not positive.</v>

1718
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1719
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not fully up on all the</v>

1720
01:11:56.551 --> 01:11:59.460
<v Speaker 1>deer literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what other animals are you guys</v>

1721
01:11:59.461 --> 01:12:00.790
<v Speaker 1>concerned with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like their,</v>

1722
01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.420
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their safety and populations.</v>

1723
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:05.730
<v Speaker 1>So I mean we're worried about the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1724
01:12:05.731 --> 01:12:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do things with frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salamanders,</v>

1725
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.670
<v Speaker 1>we do surveys for snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1726
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.040
<v Speaker 1>we actually have a red legged frog</v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduction.</v>

1727
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Reintroduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 1>So there's people complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not enough red legged frogs.</v>

1729
01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Well there used to be here and we had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we don't really know why they</v>

1730
01:12:22.351 --> 01:12:26.520
<v Speaker 1>disappeared but they disappeared 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago or so and they were left in</v>

1731
01:12:26.521 --> 01:12:30.510
<v Speaker 1>one little pool in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're just trying to help them</v>

1732
01:12:30.511 --> 01:12:31.540
<v Speaker 1>get reestablished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1733
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't let Donald Trump find out about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cut funding frog what we need that</v>

1734
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>money to go to bankers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just seems fascinating to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we do have these programs to like</v>

1736
01:12:43.171 --> 01:12:44.670
<v Speaker 1>help out like a frog.</v>

1737
01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all better but man hours,</v>

1738
01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:48.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1739
01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.610
<v Speaker 1>it takes some but it's not huge amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May.</v>

1740
01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:53.880
<v Speaker 1>It's one person going out and doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>these projects and it's not like that's</v>

1741
01:12:53.881 --> 01:12:55.650
<v Speaker 1>their only job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have lots of different things they</v>

1742
01:12:55.651 --> 01:12:57.870
<v Speaker 1>did right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just one small part of their</v>

1743
01:12:57.871 --> 01:12:59.490
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just bring like a bucket of</v>

1744
01:12:59.491 --> 01:13:03.930
<v Speaker 1>frogs and thrown into the bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite that simple.</v>

1745
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:06.270
<v Speaker 1>They have to move egg masses basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what they do.</v>

1746
01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.270
<v Speaker 1>What they do when they move the egg</v>
<v Speaker 1>masses.</v>

1747
01:13:09.271 --> 01:13:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Do they move the mom as well and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>

1748
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frogs just develop independently and</v>

1749
01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:15.010
<v Speaker 1>the new area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1750
01:13:15.011 --> 01:13:16.890
<v Speaker 1>they develop independently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would even do that in their own</v>

1751
01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:19.020
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mom doesn't care for their frogs or</v>

1752
01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 1>any of that to bitches bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they do that,</v>

1753
01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:24.570
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1754
01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:27.150
<v Speaker 1>when you drop off these egg masses in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place,</v>

1755
01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 1>so this frog will be born or hatch in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this area rather.</v>

1756
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And they just assume this is where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>live?</v>

1757
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's interesting.</v>

1758
01:13:34.951 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 1>So if you took a fully developed frog</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put it there,</v>

1759
01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:40.560
<v Speaker 1>probably wouldn't know what to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the area because it would be a new area</v>

1760
01:13:40.561 --> 01:13:41.161
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>

1761
01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:42.570
<v Speaker 1>why am I here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1762
01:13:42.571 --> 01:13:45.990
<v Speaker 1>This isn't my project either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not 100 percent on it,</v>

1763
01:13:45.991 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 1>but from my understanding is that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>will try to move back towards their</v>

1764
01:13:49.501 --> 01:13:51.840
<v Speaker 1>native range and then they don't end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it,</v>

1765
01:13:51.841 --> 01:13:56.430
<v Speaker 1>so it's better to do the tadpoles or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs and then they'll hopefully stay</v>

1766
01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:57.600
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1767
01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:00.660
<v Speaker 1>So what is the benefit of having these</v>
<v Speaker 1>red legged frogs around?</v>

1768
01:14:00.661 --> 01:14:04.030
<v Speaker 1>They're just a part of the ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think it's a good idea to exactly it.</v>

1769
01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to protect the overall</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>

1770
01:14:05.761 --> 01:14:09.240
<v Speaker 1>We don't really understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we like to think we understand</v>

1771
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:11.420
<v Speaker 1>all this ecology and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

1772
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:12.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated,</v>

1773
01:14:12.371 --> 01:14:12.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1774
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.320
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the interaction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these species.</v>

1775
01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of it's just trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that our full suite of species is</v>

1776
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:20.860
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our ecosystems healthy as possible.</v>

1777
01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So when you reintroduce the red frog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will there then be subsequent studies</v>

1778
01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>about the impact of the reintroduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Red Frog red legged frog?</v>

1779
01:14:28.871 --> 01:14:31.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard to know at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all based off funding,</v>

1780
01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>like there's potential there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now we don't really know.</v>

1781
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.971
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

1782
01:14:36.971 --> 01:14:38.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>propose this to you.</v>

1783
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>What if you had an unlimited budget?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I made Justin Brown king of the</v>

1784
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:43.930
<v Speaker 1>world and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen dude,</v>

1785
01:14:43.931 --> 01:14:46.640
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever the fuck you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the all this money and what,</v>

1786
01:14:46.641 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 1>what would you do if you make any</v>
<v Speaker 1>promises here?</v>

1787
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could.</v>

1788
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I don't have that kind of</v>

1789
01:14:51.401 --> 01:14:53.320
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course if I did though,</v>

1790
01:14:53.321 --> 01:14:54.430
<v Speaker 1>if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

1791
01:14:54.431 --> 01:14:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you an unlimited</v>
<v Speaker 1>budget to take care of this wildlife as</v>

1792
01:14:57.491 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 1>you would see fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you like to have done?</v>

1793
01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things would be that</v>

1794
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:03.700
<v Speaker 1>wildlife overpass you see for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>

1795
01:15:03.701 --> 01:15:07.570
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about doing things for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's good for the local ecology here,</v>

1796
01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:10.540
<v Speaker 1>that would be probably the highest thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my priority list because that is</v>

1797
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:12.820
<v Speaker 1>something that's not just affecting one</v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

1798
01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:15.400
<v Speaker 1>It's affecting everything that's within</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mountain range,</v>

1799
01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.870
<v Speaker 1>which is fairly large hundred 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>acres that there's just completely being</v>

1800
01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:23.680
<v Speaker 1>disconnected from other wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me that that's our number one</v>

1801
01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:24.850
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is,</v>

1802
01:15:24.851 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 1>so we have lots of issues with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>poisons there.</v>

1803
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I would try to find alternatives to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these poisons that are being spread</v>

1804
01:15:31.721 --> 01:15:34.330
<v Speaker 1>throughout the environment because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a major issue for our wildlife.</v>

1805
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a giant issue when you see the</v>

1806
01:15:37.091 --> 01:15:40.460
<v Speaker 1>main on that cat and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that all comes somehow or</v>

1807
01:15:40.461 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 1>another from rat poison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever that happened to rat</v>

1808
01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:43.780
<v Speaker 1>traps.</v>

1809
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I will just use a trap and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like to see blood.</v>

1810
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my best assumption because</v>

1811
01:15:49.151 --> 01:15:50.890
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to recommend traps and they just</v>

1812
01:15:50.891 --> 01:15:53.080
<v Speaker 1>won't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's such a trickle down though</v>

1813
01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.030
<v Speaker 1>when you're using those toxins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1814
01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 1>it sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's frightening to me because that</v>

1815
01:15:57.311 --> 01:15:59.440
<v Speaker 1>gets to people in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

1816
01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:00.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1817
01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1818
01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:03.850
<v Speaker 1>that's my worry as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also leaks into the ground.</v>

1819
01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of weird effects that</v>

1820
01:16:06.331 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 1>you can get from poisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1821
01:16:08.141 --> 01:16:10.960
<v Speaker 1>and we don't even understand the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put tons of toxicants out there that</v>

1822
01:16:10.961 --> 01:16:15.961
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea the actual longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects or how it's gonna change things.</v>

1823
01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these rat poisons,</v>

1824
01:16:17.151 --> 01:16:18.940
<v Speaker 1>there was a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said it wouldn't move up the food</v>

1825
01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:20.860
<v Speaker 1>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are quite clearly seeing it move</v>

1826
01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:23.800
<v Speaker 1>up the food chain to have a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion die of rat poison.</v>

1827
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.870
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dive in.</v>

1828
01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had three mountain lions dive rat</v>

1829
01:16:28.211 --> 01:16:29.230
<v Speaker 1>poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1830
01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And you believe it's from coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we think.</v>

1831
01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of them,</v>

1832
01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:36.880
<v Speaker 1>they went back to a few kills that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>made right before it died.</v>

1833
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And they found that it killed a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes.</v>

1834
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1835
01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1836
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.770
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't kill the coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1837
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coyotes could have been really sick</v>

1838
01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:47.260
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's how the mountain lion</v>

1839
01:16:47.261 --> 01:16:48.670
<v Speaker 1>got it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1840
01:16:48.671 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 1>So because with these poisons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times these animals don't die</v>

1841
01:16:51.491 --> 01:16:54.310
<v Speaker 1>for four to 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1842
01:16:54.311 --> 01:16:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So they're walking in circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever seen like</v>

1843
01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:58.510
<v Speaker 1>wrath walking circles that are running</v>
<v Speaker 1>into buildings,</v>

1844
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.180
<v Speaker 1>like I've seen it a couple times about</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around and that's generally what</v>

1845
01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:02.050
<v Speaker 1>they're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dying,</v>

1846
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.840
<v Speaker 1>they're dying of dehydration basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're just bleeding out</v>

1847
01:17:04.841 --> 01:17:05.674
<v Speaker 1>internally.</v>

1848
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was actually in Dan Flores,</v>

1849
01:17:08.871 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 1>his book is that they had developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain types of coyote poisons that</v>

1850
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:17.780
<v Speaker 1>were slow acting so that they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>trick these coyotes into eating this</v>

1851
01:17:17.781 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 1>stuff and the other coyotes wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know where the caio got sick from</v>

1852
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.310
<v Speaker 1>because it took so long for them to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like strychnine where you eat</v>

1853
01:17:25.311 --> 01:17:27.790
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watched the other one die and that</v>

1854
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:31.460
<v Speaker 1>that's also what rats do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that documentary on</v>

1855
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Netflix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard you mentioned it,</v>

1856
01:17:32.511 --> 01:17:34.660
<v Speaker 1>but I still haven't seen it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to watch it.</v>

1857
01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.100
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It freaked me out.</v>

1858
01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.790
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when when they show the amount of</v>

1859
01:17:40.791 --> 01:17:45.080
<v Speaker 1>rats that are in New York City and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>show all the people dealing with them</v>

1860
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:47.330
<v Speaker 1>and they show them in the sewer system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything,</v>

1861
01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.360
<v Speaker 1>it's mind boggling and then they talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how the rats will literally send a</v>

1862
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:57.920
<v Speaker 1>young dumb rat over to the poison and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want that rat eat the poison and</v>

1863
01:17:57.921 --> 01:17:59.030
<v Speaker 1>died and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

1864
01:17:59.031 --> 01:17:59.480
<v Speaker 1>we're out here.</v>

1865
01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 1>And they all take off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they've got a whole system for</v>

1866
01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:03.740
<v Speaker 1>dealing with poisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they did the same thing with rat</v>

1868
01:18:04.911 --> 01:18:06.220
<v Speaker 1>poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my understanding they,</v>

1869
01:18:06.221 --> 01:18:09.920
<v Speaker 1>they kind of come through different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more for the poisoned to try to make</v>

1870
01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:11.850
<v Speaker 1>them last a little longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the [inaudible],</v>

1871
01:18:11.851 --> 01:18:14.900
<v Speaker 1>the rats will do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coyotes do not to eat it.</v>

1872
01:18:14.901 --> 01:18:16.790
<v Speaker 1>So that didn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saw that documentary.</v>

1873
01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to mitigate the problem</v>

1874
01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:20.360
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1875
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.820
<v Speaker 1>the rat population is so large in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York City.</v>

1876
01:18:22.821 --> 01:18:26.060
<v Speaker 1>They think there's many rats as there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people or more.</v>

1877
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

1878
01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in little intersections down</v>

1879
01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:34.100
<v Speaker 1>in la at night and just rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like the ground is moving at</v>

1880
01:18:34.101 --> 01:18:36.650
<v Speaker 1>times and these crazy locations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most of the places you go,</v>

1881
01:18:36.651 --> 01:18:38.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't see that many rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then all of a sudden you'll hit this</v>

1882
01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.530
<v Speaker 1>called a honey hole for frats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just be like,</v>

1883
01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what the hell's going on here.</v>

1884
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York City way back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1885
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 1>It was so long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was payphones and uh,</v>

1886
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to make phone call and I was getting</v>

1887
01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:56.390
<v Speaker 1>gas so I pulled up this gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the pump in,</v>

1888
01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 1>filling up my car and I go over to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>payphone to make a call and as I mean in</v>

1889
01:19:01.311 --> 01:19:05.030
<v Speaker 1>the time it took me to walk from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pump to the payphone,</v>

1890
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching rats jumped onto the wheels</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my car,</v>

1891
01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Speaker 1>like they're jumping on the wheel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>crawling up and down to like,</v>

1892
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're looking for food</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're looking to get into the</v>

1893
01:19:16.401 --> 01:19:20.300
<v Speaker 1>engine for warmth or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently people have a real issue</v>

1894
01:19:20.301 --> 01:19:25.301
<v Speaker 1>with rats getting inside the hood of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their car and like nesting there,</v>

1895
01:19:25.871 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 1>like climb in there for the heat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stay warm inside the hood of your</v>

1896
01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:30.890
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1897
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're so adaptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they instantaneously did it.</v>

1899
01:19:35.451 --> 01:19:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled the car up,</v>

1900
01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.330
<v Speaker 1>put the pump in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked,</v>

1901
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:40.100
<v Speaker 1>turned around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1902
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about like one rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking five,</v>

1903
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:44.630
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven rats just hopping up.</v>

1904
01:19:44.631 --> 01:19:46.670
<v Speaker 1>And another one would hop up and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>would hop down.</v>

1905
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.070
<v Speaker 1>It was terrifying because I was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>

1906
01:19:49.071 --> 01:19:50.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I going to be driving,</v>

1907
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:53.240
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a rat on the floor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to hit the gas</v>

1908
01:19:53.241 --> 01:19:55.220
<v Speaker 1>instead of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to freak out like a little</v>

1909
01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:56.510
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1910
01:19:56.511 --> 01:19:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1911
01:19:57.531 --> 01:20:00.290
<v Speaker 1>that would be creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's just so adaptable.</v>

1912
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1913
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:04.370
<v Speaker 1>it's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially we don't like to think of</v>

1914
01:20:04.371 --> 01:20:08.400
<v Speaker 1>them as a wild animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a rat is a wild that lives in this</v>

1915
01:20:08.401 --> 01:20:12.120
<v Speaker 1>weird symbiotic relationship with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in urban environments.</v>

1916
01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing there.</v>

1917
01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:16.230
<v Speaker 1>That is the one species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more adapted to us than</v>

1918
01:20:16.231 --> 01:20:20.400
<v Speaker 1>the coyotes are obviously because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are able to live in almost everywhere</v>

1919
01:20:20.401 --> 01:20:21.510
<v Speaker 1>that we live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1920
01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1921
01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.140
<v Speaker 1>they serve a purpose in some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird way.</v>

1922
01:20:25.141 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they were removed,</v>

1923
01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the impact would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1924
01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we'd probably have more nesting</v>

1925
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:34.500
<v Speaker 1>birds and some of that kind of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know that rats definitely</v>

1926
01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:36.680
<v Speaker 1>impact bird species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1927
01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.460
<v Speaker 1>and who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may not be,</v>

1928
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 1>if there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't rats,</v>

1929
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.900
<v Speaker 1>whether coyotes or some of these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>small predators would be around the</v>

1930
01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:45.490
<v Speaker 1>urban areas because they're obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>another prey source know.</v>

1931
01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 1>But trying to get rid of rats is a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>nother ballgame.</v>

1932
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1933
01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1934
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:51.780
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that's probably harder in</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes,</v>

1935
01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:53.160
<v Speaker 1>theaters and nuke that city.</v>

1936
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:57.140
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to get everybody to agree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'd probably move back in within</v>

1937
01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.230
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1938
01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1939
01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:04.230
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this proposed bridge across the 101,</v>

1940
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.330
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a roadblocks as it a funding</v>

1941
01:21:06.331 --> 01:21:09.150
<v Speaker 1>issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anybody that is against it?</v>

1942
01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:12.120
<v Speaker 1>As far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not anybody really against that.</v>

1943
01:21:12.121 --> 01:21:14.580
<v Speaker 1>There might be a few people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearby community that's worried about</v>

1944
01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:16.200
<v Speaker 1>more mountain lions come in or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1945
01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:20.880
<v Speaker 1>but we don't think that's a realistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because that holding capacity from</v>

1946
01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:24.180
<v Speaker 1>as far as we understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't think that's going to be a</v>

1947
01:21:24.181 --> 01:21:25.350
<v Speaker 1>major issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1948
01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's really about funding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to.</v>

1949
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:31.320
<v Speaker 1>National Wildlife Federation is leading</v>
<v Speaker 1>the charge to try to raise,</v>

1950
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I think the cost is over $50,000,000 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>

1951
01:21:34.471 --> 01:21:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1952
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a big price tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1953
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:38.490
<v Speaker 1>the bridge is going to be quite wide.</v>

1954
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be natural covered and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to ask to go over the road</v>

1955
01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:45.600
<v Speaker 1>and the one on one both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

1956
01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a big bridge.</v>

1957
01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:51.490
<v Speaker 1>So I hope wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that who I wish I could call that off</v>

1958
01:21:51.491 --> 01:21:52.630
<v Speaker 1>the top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1959
01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:53.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1960
01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:55.550
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably on that thing he</v>

1961
01:21:55.551 --> 01:21:58.470
<v Speaker 1>had up earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you probably deal with a few hundred</v>

1962
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:59.340
<v Speaker 1>yards or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1963
01:21:59.341 --> 01:22:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost as wide as it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

1964
01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1965
01:22:02.701 --> 01:22:04.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna also how it's going to be</v>

1966
01:22:04.681 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 1>used for hiking during the day as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just for wildlife so people</v>

1967
01:22:09.241 --> 01:22:10.860
<v Speaker 1>can go across it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1968
01:22:10.861 --> 01:22:15.861
<v Speaker 1>Because currently there's no easy way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go from the Santa Monica is in the south</v>

1969
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 1>to the cme Hilton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the north,</v>

1970
01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:19.800
<v Speaker 1>which are all public property.</v>

1971
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.500
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way to get across there so</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can hide,</v>

1972
01:22:22.501 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 1>they have to go down on the Liberty</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canyon road and cut across there,</v>

1973
01:22:26.851 --> 01:22:30.150
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of sucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does one raise money for</v>

1974
01:22:30.151 --> 01:22:33.240
<v Speaker 1>something like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they try to have like a go fund me or</v>

1975
01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:36.870
<v Speaker 1>do they just rely on the state budget?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1976
01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:40.260
<v Speaker 1>it's all they're doing fundraising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get people to kick in.</v>

1977
01:22:40.261 --> 01:22:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I believe the Annenberg has already</v>
<v Speaker 1>offered to donate a million dollars</v>

1978
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 1>matching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they've got to raise another million</v>

1979
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:51.150
<v Speaker 1>to get that amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all for the most part,</v>

1980
01:22:51.151 --> 01:22:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's all from either</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation agencies or from private</v>

1981
01:22:54.931 --> 01:22:56.610
<v Speaker 1>donations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were king of the world,</v>

1982
01:22:56.611 --> 01:22:59.160
<v Speaker 1>that would be the first thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would work on.</v>

1983
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:03.120
<v Speaker 1>As far as wildlife in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely for our region,</v>

1984
01:23:03.121 --> 01:23:04.380
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about other issues?</v>

1985
01:23:04.670 --> 01:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Other issues?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean habitat protections just</v>

1986
01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 1>obviously incredibly important.</v>

1987
01:23:08.170 --> 01:23:12.850
<v Speaker 1>If we want to keep all of our species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so protecting more land is is always a</v>

1988
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:15.130
<v Speaker 1>valuable thing to make sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least to make sure what</v>

1989
01:23:15.131 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>development we do is done in a proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1990
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Now when you say protect more land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that be like buying up available</v>

1991
01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:24.640
<v Speaker 1>private land when it comes for sale and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then turning it into public land?</v>

1992
01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some level I would consider that.</v>

1993
01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that would be my</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate goal.</v>

1994
01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:33.430
<v Speaker 1>To me it's more important to lock it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's natural versus public versus</v>

1995
01:23:33.431 --> 01:23:34.151
<v Speaker 1>private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1996
01:23:34.151 --> 01:23:38.140
<v Speaker 1>So like to stop a development stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major developments from coming in and</v>

1997
01:23:38.141 --> 01:23:41.470
<v Speaker 1>putting things right in places that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be major blockages to wildlife</v>

1998
01:23:41.471 --> 01:23:43.660
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boulder's kind of interesting in that</v>

1999
01:23:43.661 --> 01:23:47.530
<v Speaker 1>way where they buy up all the available</v>
<v Speaker 1>property and then turn into open space.</v>

2000
01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.140
<v Speaker 1>So you can't develop on it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2001
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.170
<v Speaker 1>They're really smart with that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2002
01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I think boulder is an amazing place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've really recognized that they</v>

2003
01:23:56.021 --> 01:24:01.021
<v Speaker 1>have this incredible sort of beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>little community that's surrounded by</v>

2004
01:24:01.631 --> 01:24:04.570
<v Speaker 1>this inescapable beauty of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains,</v>

2005
01:24:04.571 --> 01:24:07.240
<v Speaker 1>the rockies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get much more beautiful place</v>

2006
01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:08.950
<v Speaker 1>in around boulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

2007
01:24:08.951 --> 01:24:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to keep your communities the</v>

2008
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:12.310
<v Speaker 1>way they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to protect some of the</v>

2009
01:24:12.311 --> 01:24:13.061
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2010
01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:14.850
<v Speaker 1>They're not into anybody developing</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2011
01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:15.693
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2012
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not do that.</v>

2013
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a really wise of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing that they've a managed</v>

2014
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:24.550
<v Speaker 1>rather to go so long without being co</v>
<v Speaker 1>opted by.</v>

2015
01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2016
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's kind of the name of the</v>

2017
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:28.660
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2018
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.900
<v Speaker 1>obviously we need developments because</v>
<v Speaker 1>our populations keep growing.</v>

2019
01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:35.980
<v Speaker 1>So to me it's not always realistic to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say we need to protect every piece of</v>

2020
01:24:35.981 --> 01:24:36.160
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

2021
01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.180
<v Speaker 1>We can protect what development we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to do it smart and make sure</v>

2022
01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:42.520
<v Speaker 1>that things are protected in the proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

2023
01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Is there any other wildlife issues in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and around this area that,</v>

2024
01:24:46.661 --> 01:24:48.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are being addressed right now?</v>

2025
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

2026
01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:54.730
<v Speaker 1>that those are the two biggest things</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on that we're,</v>

2027
01:24:54.731 --> 01:24:55.211
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2028
01:24:55.211 --> 01:24:57.160
<v Speaker 1>we're actively trying to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2029
01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of too many.</v>

2030
01:24:59.651 --> 01:25:01.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's always the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuisance issues that everybody's trying</v>

2031
01:25:01.961 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 1>to deal with where a coyote is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebodies yard or going after dogs or</v>

2032
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:08.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever that we try to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those are the two major ones would</v>

2033
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:10.230
<v Speaker 1>be connectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2034
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:13.270
<v Speaker 1>habitat loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then just poisons.</v>

2035
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And are there a lot of raccoons in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>area?</v>

2036
01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

2037
01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends what you're comparing.</v>

2038
01:25:21.401 --> 01:25:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Healthy population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:25:22.721 --> 01:25:24.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a decent number of raccoons if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're comparing it to somewhere like</v>

2040
01:25:24.761 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>

2041
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:26.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have goggles.</v>

2042
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Larger population records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just much more adept there.</v>

2043
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:34.420
<v Speaker 1>They're just the way the landscape is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more mature trees,</v>

2044
01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:36.160
<v Speaker 1>mature forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what raccoons,</v>

2045
01:25:36.161 --> 01:25:38.080
<v Speaker 1>like a lot more water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2046
01:25:38.081 --> 01:25:41.020
<v Speaker 1>which are all things that attract</v>
<v Speaker 1>raccoons where we're a lot drier.</v>

2047
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Raccoons can occur within like our</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains,</v>

2048
01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.760
<v Speaker 1>but they do seem to be more focused near</v>
<v Speaker 1>roadways and some of that stuff taken</v>

2049
01:25:48.761 --> 01:25:51.070
<v Speaker 1>advantage of whatever resources are</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2050
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big garbage hunters too,</v>

2051
01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:54.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely take advantage of</v>

2052
01:25:54.011 --> 01:25:56.080
<v Speaker 1>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll also eat lots of fruits and</v>

2053
01:25:56.081 --> 01:25:57.730
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of the scats you see in your</v>

2054
01:25:57.731 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 1>yard that you think are coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could be raccoon as well.</v>

2055
01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat a lot of berries and stuff.</v>

2056
01:26:02.530 --> 01:26:04.580
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found some skunk poop.</v>

2057
01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.631
<v Speaker 1>Real friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2058
01:26:05.631 --> 01:26:08.180
<v Speaker 1>My friend who recognized the a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion poop.</v>

2059
01:26:08.181 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I sent him some stuff and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

2060
01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:13.460
<v Speaker 1>He said that skunk poop skunks are</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

2061
01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I started tracking these coyotes</v>

2062
01:26:15.981 --> 01:26:18.350
<v Speaker 1>and downtown La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have never thought skunks could</v>

2063
01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:20.570
<v Speaker 1>be down in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a decent number of</v>

2064
01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:22.130
<v Speaker 1>skunks like in that West Lake</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

2065
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I could not believe how many skunks that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smelled.</v>

2066
01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Skunk and Hollywood last night I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving through.</v>

2067
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It could have been strong weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it was.</v>

2068
01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was an actual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott was leaving the comedy store and</v>

2069
01:26:32.631 --> 01:26:36.470
<v Speaker 1>it just stunk of skunk and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how weird that these animals have</v>

2070
01:26:36.471 --> 01:26:40.280
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to live right here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right near sunset.</v>

2071
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:40.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2072
01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:43.790
<v Speaker 1>And they're little short legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Super Mobile,</v>

2073
01:26:43.791 --> 01:26:46.910
<v Speaker 1>but yet these stripes gunk seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have figured it out.</v>

2074
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2075
01:26:47.490 --> 01:26:49.210
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going after my chickens to the</v>

2076
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.300
<v Speaker 1>little creeps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2077
01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2078
01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Dare there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they like to eat chickens.</v>

2079
01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.740
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2080
01:26:54.741 --> 01:26:57.020
<v Speaker 1>One night I actually had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were sitting in the house,</v>

2081
01:26:57.021 --> 01:26:59.210
<v Speaker 1>me and my wife just hanging out and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden I hear my chickens going</v>

2082
01:26:59.211 --> 01:27:02.140
<v Speaker 1>crazy out there and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both got up and took off running and</v>

2083
01:27:02.141 --> 01:27:04.550
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of feral cats around our</v>
<v Speaker 1>house and I was like,</v>

2084
01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:05.840
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing cats are in there.</v>

2085
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:08.300
<v Speaker 1>We go looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our chickens are flying all over the</v>

2086
01:27:08.301 --> 01:27:11.000
<v Speaker 1>yard because we hadn't gotten out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>closed the door yet because my chickens</v>

2087
01:27:11.001 --> 01:27:13.310
<v Speaker 1>can kind of free range my yard and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking around.</v>

2088
01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:15.680
<v Speaker 1>We don't see anything else and I open up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coop door and there's a big old</v>

2089
01:27:15.681 --> 01:27:17.180
<v Speaker 1>paths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sitting there grinning at me</v>

2090
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.110
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't get anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't affect,</v>

2091
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.720
<v Speaker 1>didn't grab one of my chickens even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though one of my chickens was just</v>

2092
01:27:23.721 --> 01:27:25.520
<v Speaker 1>sitting there like looking at it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>squawking.</v>

2093
01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:28.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like you should be doing trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying,</v>

2094
01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:31.160
<v Speaker 1>but he just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not very fast.</v>

2095
01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:32.000
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2096
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.870
<v Speaker 1>they're with possums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like for me there another species.</v>

2097
01:27:35.871 --> 01:27:39.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a drug to handle agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just you can just grab them up by the</v>

2098
01:27:39.051 --> 01:27:39.860
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually in.</v>

2099
01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on to them.</v>

2100
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2101
01:27:41.730 --> 01:27:43.310
<v Speaker 1>you can just run up to them and grab</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2102
01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.200
<v Speaker 1>People do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely.</v>

2103
01:27:45.201 --> 01:27:48.860
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy doing his masters work</v>
<v Speaker 1>on possums and he would drive around</v>

2104
01:27:48.861 --> 01:27:52.250
<v Speaker 1>town and when he saw what he had jumped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of his car,</v>

2105
01:27:52.251 --> 01:27:53.540
<v Speaker 1>he'd be out hanging out with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

2106
01:27:53.541 --> 01:27:56.270
<v Speaker 1>You'd see a possum jump out and grab it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cram it in his trunk.</v>

2107
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ throat.</v>

2108
01:27:58.810 --> 01:27:59.840
<v Speaker 1>It is trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:03.610
<v Speaker 1>That's dedication right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he do with it once you got it</v>

2110
01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:04.800
<v Speaker 1>in his trunk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was colored.</v>

2111
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:08.270
<v Speaker 1>He's doing kind of like what we do here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to identify their movements and</v>

2112
01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:10.160
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they find out?</v>

2113
01:28:10.161 --> 01:28:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Anything unusual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2114
01:28:11.361 --> 01:28:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I've never saw his talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't like.</v>

2115
01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I ran into him at a conference one time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we got chatting about what he did</v>

2116
01:28:16.281 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty hilarious.</v>

2117
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:20.660
<v Speaker 1>It is really weird how many animals we</v>
<v Speaker 1>live around.</v>

2118
01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird.</v>

2119
01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:25.820
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different and such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide variety,</v>

2120
01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:27.950
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2121
01:28:27.951 --> 01:28:30.630
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I see a lot of is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2122
01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of hawks in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and we did this thing in</v>

2123
01:28:32.991 --> 01:28:37.670
<v Speaker 1>our backyard where we had a a wrought</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron fence and we changed part of it and</v>

2124
01:28:37.671 --> 01:28:42.650
<v Speaker 1>put a glass fence and these hawks hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured it out and they would swoop down</v>

2125
01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and slammed into the fence headfirst.</v>

2126
01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:47.880
<v Speaker 1>We got quite a few of these poor hawks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2127
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2128
01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's just amazing how many you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and how many predators and</v>

2129
01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.630
<v Speaker 1>there's the occasional golden eagle in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this area too,</v>

2130
01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get reports of them coming through</v>

2131
01:28:58.761 --> 01:28:59.900
<v Speaker 1>every once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2132
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:03.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not rare by any means are super</v>
<v Speaker 1>common by any means,</v>

2133
01:29:03.181 --> 01:29:05.460
<v Speaker 1>but they come through now and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2134
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.400
<v Speaker 1>how would one know whether or not you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at a Golden Eagle?</v>

2135
01:29:08.401 --> 01:29:10.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just because it's really big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really big.</v>

2136
01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:12.540
<v Speaker 1>There's some other little</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that I'm not as good</v>

2137
01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:14.400
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're significantly larger than</v>

2138
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:16.530
<v Speaker 1>like the red tills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the one you'd be most</v>

2139
01:29:16.531 --> 01:29:18.720
<v Speaker 1>likely to confuse it with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2140
01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 1>just the wide variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>raptors and these.</v>

2141
01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2142
01:29:24.411 --> 01:29:26.630
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean red shouldered hawks once smile</v>

2143
01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:28.980
<v Speaker 1>will be traveling for bobcat and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch a red shouldered hawk on our</v>

2144
01:29:28.981 --> 01:29:29.814
<v Speaker 1>traps.</v>

2145
01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:30.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2146
01:29:30.781 --> 01:29:32.850
<v Speaker 1>this is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've even caught a great horned owl</v>

2147
01:29:32.851 --> 01:29:36.450
<v Speaker 1>once and so it's pretty neat seeing some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these animals up close.</v>

2148
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried that the owls in my</v>

2149
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:42.420
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood had been poisoned because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to have quite a few of them and</v>

2150
01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:46.440
<v Speaker 1>used to hear them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to hear them hooting all the</v>

2151
01:29:46.441 --> 01:29:49.800
<v Speaker 1>time and one time I went out on my back</v>
<v Speaker 1>porch and there was one sitting on the</v>

2152
01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:53.940
<v Speaker 1>fence and it was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know how big it really</v>

2153
01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:55.800
<v Speaker 1>was because I'm sure it was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaked out by it,</v>

2154
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked.</v>

2155
01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It was at least two feet tall and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sitting on his back.</v>

2156
01:30:00.710 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that tall.</v>

2157
01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no exaggeration,</v>

2158
01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but it looked like it was like four feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>tall.</v>

2159
01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:06.870
<v Speaker 1>It looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked.</v>

2160
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe how big it looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great personalities are huge.</v>

2161
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2162
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I think they can carry away foxes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>study in Bakersfield that they've</v>

2163
01:30:15.871 --> 01:30:19.050
<v Speaker 1>documented and house coming down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbing the kit boxes and carrying them</v>

2164
01:30:19.051 --> 01:30:21.900
<v Speaker 1>up to their nest sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a video on instagram.</v>

2165
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It's still up there that I got online of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2166
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.310
<v Speaker 1>A owl swooping down and jacking a hawk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's next.</v>

2167
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:30.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that?</v>

2168
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard about it.</v>

2169
01:30:32.461 --> 01:30:37.461
<v Speaker 1>My one of my coworkers actually as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>falconer and he when he released or what</v>

2170
01:30:37.621 --> 01:30:40.290
<v Speaker 1>did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of his Hawk's got away from him and</v>

2171
01:30:40.291 --> 01:30:42.600
<v Speaker 1>he said the tree was as being swarmed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade horns.</v>

2172
01:30:42.601 --> 01:30:44.250
<v Speaker 1>He stayed there all night trying to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2173
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Trying to help his hawk stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

2174
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Now he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Owls eat hawks.</v>

2175
01:30:50.191 --> 01:30:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that until he was telling</v>

2176
01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:52.470
<v Speaker 1>me that.</v>

2177
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2178
01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great horns are huge though.</v>

2179
01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Check out this video because it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>

2180
01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how long I was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legs,</v>

2181
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.200
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never seen that before that.</v>

2182
01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:06.780
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard to find something even close to it,</v>

2183
01:31:06.781 --> 01:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2184
01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:10.620
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a,</v>

2185
01:31:10.621 --> 01:31:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I worked at cal State Bakersfield in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2186
01:31:12.751 --> 01:31:14.860
<v Speaker 1>They had a raptor rehab thing and I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the handle.</v>

2187
01:31:14.861 --> 01:31:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Great horned owls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When those guys flap their wings,</v>

2188
01:31:16.921 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

2189
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I comparable to the the Golden Eagle,</v>

2190
01:31:21.631 --> 01:31:23.490
<v Speaker 1>the Golden Eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely more powerful,</v>

2191
01:31:23.491 --> 01:31:27.440
<v Speaker 1>but the goal of the long or the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>horned owls were pretty amazing.</v>

2192
01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Our perception of them is so interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're a serious predator,</v>

2193
01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:34.830
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't think of an owl as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a predator.</v>

2194
01:31:34.831 --> 01:31:39.831
<v Speaker 1>They just think of them as some wise</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest creature that gives advice on</v>

2195
01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:42.810
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're obviously not a threat to you or</v>

2196
01:31:42.811 --> 01:31:45.000
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously your cat,</v>

2197
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.780
<v Speaker 1>they could potentially grow 100 percent.</v>

2198
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who knows?</v>

2199
01:31:48.761 --> 01:31:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Those people get smaller and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dog.</v>

2200
01:31:50.851 --> 01:31:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Watch this because you see the eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distance.</v>

2201
01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:55.710
<v Speaker 1>See the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

2202
01:31:56.610 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I love this video being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2203
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 1>the other arc doesn't even know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

2204
01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:03.693
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

2205
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.680
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's was that when a man.</v>

2206
01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Is that a juvenile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know.</v>

2207
01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look a little fuzzy.</v>

2208
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do a little bit right.</v>

2209
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Especially the one in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that gets jacked act.</v>

2210
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the way it gets jacked,</v>

2211
01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:17.411
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

2212
01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:19.420
<v Speaker 1>that thing's dead before it leaves the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nest.</v>

2213
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Those claws and towns are so gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

2214
01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.000
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of why we want them around.</v>

2215
01:32:25.010 --> 01:32:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rabbits and rats and everything else and</v>

2216
01:32:28.890 --> 01:32:30.510
<v Speaker 1>also because they're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2217
01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean now I think that's a big thing</v>

2218
01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:36.730
<v Speaker 1>about coyotes too and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish some of these short sided folks</v>

2219
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.790
<v Speaker 1>that don't want them around because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worried that they're going to</v>

2220
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:41.740
<v Speaker 1>get their dog and all this different</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2221
01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2222
01:32:42.671 --> 01:32:45.850
<v Speaker 1>we're really lucky that we can see these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2223
01:32:45.851 --> 01:32:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is cool.</v>

2224
01:32:47.831 --> 01:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2225
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:51.640
<v Speaker 1>well that's amazing now being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown La,</v>

2226
01:32:51.641 --> 01:32:52.960
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of these people that live down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2227
01:32:52.961 --> 01:32:55.090
<v Speaker 1>they don't ever get to see wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

2228
01:32:55.091 --> 01:32:57.310
<v Speaker 1>All of A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly there's this medium sized</v>

2229
01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:59.530
<v Speaker 1>carnivore running around their</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods that they get to see and</v>

2230
01:32:59.531 --> 01:33:00.500
<v Speaker 1>some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2231
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:03.150
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to one person that's like</v>

2232
01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:05.830
<v Speaker 1>scared to death of this thing and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next person's like,</v>

2233
01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:07.570
<v Speaker 1>it's the coolest thing they've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their life.</v>

2234
01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always that balancing act.</v>

2235
01:33:09.611 --> 01:33:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

2236
01:33:10.511 --> 01:33:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I've always been pretty fascinated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2237
01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I identify more with the people think</v>

<v Speaker 1>we're talking about,</v>

2240
01:33:18.101 --> 01:33:22.540

<v Speaker 1>unique area in that we have this big</v>

2241
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:25.510
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge city and then just outside of it we</v>

<v Speaker 1>wilderness in an hour.</v>
