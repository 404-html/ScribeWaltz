<v Speaker 1>He'll probably have some thing.</v>

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie didn't do anything.</v>

51
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.270
<v Speaker 3>The government doesn't want Charlie out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and talking about nine slash 11.</v>

52
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.940

<v Speaker 1>The weed that they have here in </v>

55
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>California is just too goddamn strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies.</v>

<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

58
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Should is outrageous</v>

59
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 3>and it's train wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>

60
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.730
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of the best scores you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can get.</v>

61
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how you guys are looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>down at me.</v>

62
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Makes for uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish we're looking eye to eye on the </v>

63
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.720
<v Speaker 1>same level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to set this up so that</v>

64
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:48.810
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels weird looking time.</v>

65
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart monitor.</v>

66
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 3>I can trade you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're so nice.</v>

67
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

68
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the Rogan board.</v>

69
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:05.340
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go to two forums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot Joe Rogan.to</v>

70
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:10.341
<v Speaker 1>the official 12 slash 29 ustream ustream</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast thread where the questions are </v>

71
00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>not limited to a gay 140 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's ridiculous.</v>

72
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there will be one world </v>
<v Speaker 1>government in our life or do you think </v>

73
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>it will act and and how do you think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>will actually affect us?</v>

74
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible if they can get the </v>

75
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.321
<v Speaker 1>money sorted out between all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking scumbags at Ronnie's world </v>

76
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:28.321
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>They would all agree to one gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system of government.</v>

78
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 1>The problem with one gigantic system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government it is though,</v>

79
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>even though it would be harder for </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>

80
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also harder to keep people in line </v>

81
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>because you have to have enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have like,</v>

82
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Turks hate the fucking Iranians hate</v>

83
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>the hate the Vac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have that conflict,</v>

84
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to keep people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

85
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we were all the United States of </v>

86
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we started arguing about money.</v>

87
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.720
<v Speaker 1>We started arguing about taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started,</v>

88
00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're all one thing,</v>

89
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>it makes it very difficult to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like giant international </v>

90
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.711
<v Speaker 1>banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might already be in cahoots or </v>

91
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:07.501
<v Speaker 1>close enough to one world government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there might be a few that are </v>

92
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>really pulling the strings and running </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

93
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

94
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the future,</v>

95
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.520
<v Speaker 3>if that government was just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>

96
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.580
<v Speaker 3>so if we can be wanting to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like going on a message </v>

97
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.760
<v Speaker 3>board in voting like hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have legal insurance vote now.</v>

98
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 3>That would be critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

99
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.630
<v Speaker 3>That'd be like for the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then people would hack it.</v>

100
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

101
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.810
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all good on paper.</v>

102
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:29.811
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that you do on the Internet </v>

103
00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:29.811
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two to play poker,</v>

104
00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 3>you never know if you're playing poker </v>
<v Speaker 3>against a real dude,</v>

105
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could easily be playing poker.</v>

106
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

107
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs they run,</v>

108
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:38.370
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to me like at this point in</v>
<v Speaker 3>time people can hack just about anything</v>

109
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 3>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

110
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 3>there's programs like that's the problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>with these drones.</v>

111
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.040
<v Speaker 3>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard about this,</v>

112
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.160
<v Speaker 3>those drones can actually hacking into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the drones.</v>

113
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Like the airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This drones.</v>

114
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.420
<v Speaker 3>I checked the borders and stuff there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

115
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Well they don't just check borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They launched missiles.</v>

116
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.290
<v Speaker 3>They have these fucking things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these drones that shoot these called </v>

117
00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Hellfire</v>

118
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.060
<v Speaker 4>missiles and they use them in Pakistan </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all these places where we're not </v>

119
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 4>really supposed to bake and they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>fly in and Jack People.</v>

120

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 5>that they use just to hack our videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you ask questions.</v>

00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:30.041
<v Speaker 5>I'll be asking questions from here to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is a toilet in his office.</v>

129
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 5>What is your opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

130
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

131
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:42.761
<v Speaker 5>at twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe doesn't make the extract listerine </v>

132
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:54.280
<v Speaker 5>packages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually one of the products that's</v>

133
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:59.281
<v Speaker 5>sold here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you have a medical marijuana </v>

134
00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:02.351
<v Speaker 5>license,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can go to a store and they saw the </v>

135
00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 5>listerine at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it looks like listerine strips a.</v>

136
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.180
<v Speaker 5>So now he doesn't make them himself.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and we're supposed to see it this week.</v>

138
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.570
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not being the last one to see it.</v>

139
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.300

<v Speaker 5>The government man,</v>

141
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.660

<v Speaker 1>system is.</v>

144
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.300

145
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>the whole world grinds to a halt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

146
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.010
<v Speaker 1>It takes five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.090
<v Speaker 5>you guys probably didn't hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he thinks it's pretty ridiculous how</v>

148
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 5>one guy did all of that and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad our security is and now our shit's </v>

181
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>twitter tweet deck.</v>

182
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.160
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't get to refresh it and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the API thing against.</v>

183
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.730
<v Speaker 5>You may want to close that and use the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ustream one only.</v>

184
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.930
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see it's not closed yet.</v>

185
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.600

186
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.460
<v Speaker 1>right twitter on ustream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with the questions here.</v>

187
00:11:27.461 --> 00:11:32.461
<v Speaker 1>Bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I back in Ireland.</v>

188
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be back in Ireland </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the UFC back in Ireland.</v>

189
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not financially feasible for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make those trips without the UFC to the </v>

190
00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:43.550
<v Speaker 1>UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every time I'm there,</v>

191
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Speaker 1>if there's a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're going,</v>

192
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.470
<v Speaker 1>if we're doing a UFC in Ireland for sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be doing standup comedy there.</v>

193
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 1>They could hear the flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear me?</v>

194
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Did you want me to take it down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so strong I couldn't resist it.</v>

195
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I knew I had to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to.</v>

196
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be able to just man up and </v>

197
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 1>push through the whole use dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

198
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a bad job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does I'm just be thinking about this </v>

199
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.870
<v Speaker 1>dump I have to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was,</v>

200
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.030
<v Speaker 1>what were we talking about before I took</v>
<v Speaker 1>off?</v>

201
00:12:17.031 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Because it was kind of important stuff.</v>

202
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.350
<v Speaker 6>Uh Huh.</v>

203
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I think the one road thing is the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you talked.</v>

204
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the first question.</v>

205
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.910
<v Speaker 1>The one world government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our lifetimes,</v>

206
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

207
00:12:32.431 --> 00:12:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot more faith before Obama got </v>
<v Speaker 1>elected.</v>

208
00:12:34.981 --> 00:12:39.981
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that I thought that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we had was a corrupt situation and </v>

209
00:12:39.981 --> 00:12:41.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bush and Cheney were corrupt in that</v>

210
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.280
<v Speaker 1>if we got somebody else in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they could straighten everything </v>

211
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:46.280
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after Obama got elected,</v>

212
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.751
<v Speaker 1>man it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became pretty clear to me that </v>

213
00:12:50.751 --> 00:12:52.080
<v Speaker 1>someone else besides the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously is pulling the strings.</v>

214
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Obama didn't want to send more troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama didn't want to go to Afghanistan </v>

215
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.380
<v Speaker 1>to bring more people to Afghanistan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to pull out a Guantanamo Bay,</v>

216
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.060
<v Speaker 1>close Guantanamo Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't all that shit,</v>

217
00:13:03.061 --> 00:13:08.061
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he gets to say what the </v>

218
00:13:08.061 --> 00:13:09.900
<v Speaker 1>fuck they do or he was just saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shit to get elected.</v>

219
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

220
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.140
<v Speaker 1>the old Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe comes to mind.</v>

221
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.870
<v Speaker 1>You know that American politics is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I like the puppet on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

223
00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I find the puppet to the left to be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my liking.</v>

224
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

<v Speaker 1>puppets.</v>

<v Speaker 5>out and uh,</v>

236
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.420
<v Speaker 5>do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always had,</v>

237
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:53.421
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend that said that he could </v>
<v Speaker 5>hack into the library and like get rid </v>

238
00:13:53.421 --> 00:13:53.760
<v Speaker 5>of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do fees and stuff like that.</v>

239
00:13:53.761 --> 00:13:54.720
<v Speaker 5>I always wondered if that was real</v>

240
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.700
<v Speaker 1>for my Lego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

241
00:13:56.701 --> 00:14:01.701
<v Speaker 1>definitely there were some systems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hack into if you were a </v>

242
00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:01.701
<v Speaker 1>wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

243
00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:04.470
<v Speaker 1>isn't that what nick did a lot of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like phone calls.</v>

244
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did like get information from people.</v>

245
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't even that he was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>great hacker was just.</v>

246
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.580
<v Speaker 1>She was kind of like a con man.</v>

247
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.920
<v Speaker 5>Tighter way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you read that?</v>

248
00:14:12.921 --> 00:14:17.921
<v Speaker 5>They just hacked the like a 21 year old </v>
<v Speaker 5>code that a ramp that scrambles or phone</v>

249
00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:23.510
<v Speaker 5>calls on cell phones so now and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

250
00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:26.090
<v Speaker 5>the hackers put it on the Internet so </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyone could have it.</v>

251
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.000
<v Speaker 5>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean of course it's probably not going</v>

252
00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:34.001
<v Speaker 5>to happen to us anytime soon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now there's actually people that </v>

253
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:37.691
<v Speaker 5>have the code to that they can listen to</v>
<v Speaker 5>your phone and listen to your phone </v>

254
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:37.730
<v Speaker 5>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

255
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.930
<v Speaker 5>Twenty one year old code,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a 64 bit code.</v>

256
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.440
<v Speaker 5>I think that's where the</v>

257
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.750
<v Speaker 1>just headed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where I think that's the </v>

258
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.721
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future is there's not going to be </v>

259
00:14:51.721 --> 00:14:51.760
<v Speaker 1>any private information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're seeing with like this</v>

260
00:14:51.761 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>tiger</v>

261
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.130
<v Speaker 4>woods thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're seeing the future of </v>

262
00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:57.130
<v Speaker 4>things to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean with him,</v>

263
00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.540
<v Speaker 4>it's obviously that he's a celebrity and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

264
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.180
<v Speaker 4>But the way that everybody is swarming </v>
<v Speaker 4>after this information.</v>

265
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 4>Me Too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

266
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:08.170
<v Speaker 4>I can't fucking put down and US weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I see an US weekly at the market and </v>

267
00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 4>there's some new tiger woods information</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grabbed that I can't fucking help it.</v>

268
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will I think eventually there's not </v>

269
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 4>gonna be any secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think eventually we're going to get to</v>

270
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 4>a point where the way information is </v>
<v Speaker 4>being distributed,</v>

271
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 4>it's changing the way we feel about </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

272
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a weird with celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing,</v>

273
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at it like,</v>

274
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 4>well these are famous people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like they give up that right once,</v>

275
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.850
<v Speaker 4>once you start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

276
00:15:32.851 --> 00:15:35.510
<v Speaker 4>putting yourself in the public eye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you give up that right to privacy.</v>

277
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Well eventually that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's happening with facebook </v>

278
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.751
<v Speaker 4>accounts to like girls are doing stupid </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit in their facebook accounts and he </v>

279
00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:44.810
<v Speaker 4>gets all the internet and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know she gave up her right when</v>

280
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 4>she put it on facebook.</v>

281
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.360
<v Speaker 5>It's like that new google goggles where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just take a photo of anything </v>

282
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.370
<v Speaker 5>and it figures out what it is and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>search is it for you.</v>

283
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.610
<v Speaker 5>So you can now like go to a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a VC,</v>

284
00:15:57.611 --> 00:16:01.120
<v Speaker 5>like a can of pop can take a picture of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and knows what it is.</v>

285
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 5>Google say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can see it starting to get where</v>

286
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:08.081
<v Speaker 5>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to do it where you can do </v>

287
00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:09.930
<v Speaker 5>flowers and plants and anything's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty soon everything's going to be </v>

288
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.460
<v Speaker 5>google search,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there is no privacy.</v>

289
00:16:12.461 --> 00:16:15.190
<v Speaker 5>So while I'm here I could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

290
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

291
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean eventually I'm sure that shit is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to make its way into your house.</v>

292
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's already in Google goggles came out </v>

293
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

294
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.190
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you'll be able to search </v>

295
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:28.190
<v Speaker 4>someone's house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

296
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:28.190
<v Speaker 4>take a photo and you'll be able to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

297
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 4>this guy lives at 97 woodcrest road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People only have</v>

298
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.660
<v Speaker 5>five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You put a picture on your facebook,</v>

299
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:37.480
<v Speaker 5>a Christmas photo that has like your </v>
<v Speaker 5>bookshelf in the background.</v>

300
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Now present day that that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>start researching every single book </v>

301
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 5>that's on your shelf and it's gonna put </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a database somewhere and,</v>

302
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.570
<v Speaker 5>and GPS location.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

303
00:16:46.571 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 5>So like when you're searching for </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

304
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:48.880
<v Speaker 5>you could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

305
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:50.020
<v Speaker 5>Joe has that book at home.</v>

306
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I think what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what's happening with twitter </v>

307
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 4>and what's happening with facebook and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening with the just the </v>

308
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.491
<v Speaker 4>Internet in general is there's way more </v>
<v Speaker 4>connectivity between all human beings </v>

309
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:06.440
<v Speaker 4>and a part of that is access to </v>
<v Speaker 4>information so that information is not </v>

310
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:06.660
<v Speaker 4>going to be lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is now.</v>

311
00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:08.160
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to be private,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

312
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:13.161
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think eventually technology will come </v>

313
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:16.730
<v Speaker 4>to the point where the line will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely impossible and you will know </v>

314
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.421
<v Speaker 4>everything that everybody else knows and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's going to try to hold back on </v>

315
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:20.550
<v Speaker 4>it for awhile because people have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of dirty secrets.</v>

316
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.820
<v Speaker 4>They do a lot of creepy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think ultimately it's probably </v>

317
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.151
<v Speaker 4>going to be good for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that that's where we're </v>

318
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:31.701
<v Speaker 4>headed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're headed to a point where </v>

319
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:33.441
<v Speaker 4>everybody has access to all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>information that everybody else has and </v>

320
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:36.240
<v Speaker 4>not just like go on the Internet and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>search for it.</v>

321
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.230
<v Speaker 4>Not like in the rudimentary way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to actively look for.</v>

322
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:44.250
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to be right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's going to eventually </v>

323
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:44.250
<v Speaker 4>come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's gonna.</v>

324
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eventually get to a point where there's </v>

325
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.361
<v Speaker 4>some sort of technology that's created </v>
<v Speaker 4>that allows human minds interface with </v>

326
00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:54.921
<v Speaker 4>other human minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's definitely where </v>

327
00:17:54.921 --> 00:17:57.861
<v Speaker 4>this was all going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when there's talk of neural </v>

328
00:17:57.861 --> 00:17:58.200
<v Speaker 4>implants and all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think that's all crazy,</v>

329
00:17:58.201 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 4>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a small step from where we are in</v>

330
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:04.560
<v Speaker 4>comparison to where we were just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple hundred years ago.</v>

331
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean a couple hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fastest mode of transportation was </v>

332
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.620
<v Speaker 4>riding a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about that.</v>

333
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:15.770
<v Speaker 4>You have to write 300 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fastest ship on land is to ride an </v>

334
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:20.331
<v Speaker 4>animal or have an animal pull you behind</v>
<v Speaker 4>something with wheels or slave slaves.</v>

335
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:23.340
<v Speaker 4>Can't run as fast as some of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>

336
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a horse.</v>

337
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 4>This guy's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm doing this,</v>

338
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:34.250
<v Speaker 4>but I mean think about what a Banya </v>
<v Speaker 4>mental leap between the transference of </v>

339
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.950
<v Speaker 4>information today in 2009 and in 17.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

340
00:18:36.951 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 4>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

341
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 4>think about what we can do right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could send a fucking picture across,</v>

342
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>space is,</v>

343
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.710
<v Speaker 4>send it through the air and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally arrives.</v>

344
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:51.711
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I have a friend in the UK and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to send him a picture and a text </v>

345
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:52.310
<v Speaker 4>message,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can take the picture,</v>

346
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 4>send it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it gets to him just like that.</v>

347
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking incredible.</v>

348
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it literally will get there in seconds.</v>

349
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:06.110
<v Speaker 4>We don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't even fathom how nuts that is </v>

350
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 4>because we do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's coming next is going to make that</v>

351
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 4>seem like riding a horse.</v>

352
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.410
<v Speaker 4>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think is happening.</v>

353
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think is this whole this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this rush for inflammation and everybody</v>

354
00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 4>has this insane desire that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 4>have for the newest,</v>

355
00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:24.210
<v Speaker 4>greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>latest technology.</v>

356
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even when you don't need it,</v>

357
00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:28.550
<v Speaker 4>like people are always trying to pump up</v>
<v Speaker 4>their computers.</v>

358
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.570
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why you need a pumped up</v>
<v Speaker 4>computer really is to play video games </v>

359
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.130
<v Speaker 4>or if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're crunching a video like,</v>

360
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.160
<v Speaker 4>like he needs stuff like that when he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he makes videos just for raw </v>

361
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.431
<v Speaker 4>computing power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the average person does is not </v>

362
00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:43.431
<v Speaker 4>crunching video.</v>

363
00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:47.090
<v Speaker 7>You hit a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've hit a wall and computers in </v>

364
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.221
<v Speaker 7>general,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they really don't need even like </v>

365
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:52.360
<v Speaker 7>the fastest computers now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The programs that video programs aren't </v>

366
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:52.360
<v Speaker 7>even.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

367
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 7>That's why everybody's into those little</v>
<v Speaker 7>notebooks.</v>

368
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:58.130
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those notebooks are the shit except for </v>

369
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.130
<v Speaker 7>watching like hd videos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

370
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.670
<v Speaker 7>That's kind of sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you can't,</v>

371
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:01.800
<v Speaker 7>you can't load a cd into it either.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A DVD,</v>

372
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

373
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.430
<v Speaker 7>But that technologies like talking about</v>
<v Speaker 7>the floppy drive right before the floppy</v>

374
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:06.170
<v Speaker 7>drive left,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

375
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:11.180
<v Speaker 7>like cds and dvds are out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even Blu rays have like such a small </v>

376
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.711
<v Speaker 7>shelf life and you think it's ever going</v>
<v Speaker 7>to get to a point where bandwidth will </v>

377
00:20:15.711 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 7>be so broad and like mobile functions </v>
<v Speaker 7>like laptops and phones,</v>

378
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:22.971
<v Speaker 7>like those little mobile cards,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it'll be so powerful that it will be </v>

379
00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:22.971
<v Speaker 7>just like your home.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

380
00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:27.471
<v Speaker 7>it's totally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be all of that pretty </v>

381
00:20:27.471 --> 00:20:27.471
<v Speaker 7>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it'll basically be like,</v>

382
00:20:27.471 --> 00:20:31.190
<v Speaker 7>everything will be broad man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do we even know what the fuck that is </v>

383
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.430
<v Speaker 7>doing to human beings?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

384
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.390
<v Speaker 7>like the talking about cell phones </v>
<v Speaker 7>causing radiation and you know,</v>

385
00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 7>like when they say it's bad when we say </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's okay.</v>

386
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.260
<v Speaker 7>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you think that it's possible that </v>

387
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 7>that's like altering human beings given </v>
<v Speaker 7>kids autism?</v>

388
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:46.530
<v Speaker 7>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

389
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 7>It might be that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It might be that</v>

390
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 4>it might also be fucking with bees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been speculation that it's been </v>

391
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 4>fucking with bees and there's also been </v>
<v Speaker 4>speculation that at some,</v>

392
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:59.071
<v Speaker 4>some crazy virus of read that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's also been speculation that </v>

393
00:20:59.071 --> 00:21:02.370
<v Speaker 4>Wifi signals and cell phone signals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have fucks with b's ability to </v>

394
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.360
<v Speaker 4>transmit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did a thing for fear factor in once </v>

395
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.390
<v Speaker 4>with bees on it and it was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>trip because this guy was a beekeeper.</v>

396
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

397
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had all these bs that he brought with </v>

398
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the stunt was these dudes,</v>

399
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:17.911
<v Speaker 4>they had to be strapped to this pole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We strap them to the pole and then we </v>

400
00:21:17.911 --> 00:21:18.990
<v Speaker 4>cover them with bs and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand there for like five minutes.</v>

401
00:21:18.991 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 4>Tim Riggins fucked up because every now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

402
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bees were argue or something.</v>

403
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:24.030
<v Speaker 4>They'd sting to dude and it was bad.</v>

404
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 4>I got stung up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well while this was all going on and </v>

405
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.220
<v Speaker 4>while this guy's tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bees and caring for these bees,</v>

406
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.910
<v Speaker 4>a local swarm of bees came in so our </v>
<v Speaker 4>bees and their bees,</v>

407
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 4>we're talking it out and we had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>backup.</v>

408
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Everybody had to get off the set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had to close down the set.</v>

409
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:46.081
<v Speaker 4>We had to close down the stock and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody had to move back and the </v>

410
00:21:46.081 --> 00:21:46.081
<v Speaker 4>beekeeper say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we've got,</v>

411
00:21:46.081 --> 00:21:48.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a local local band of bees is moved in.</v>

412
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 4>I forget what he calls him a hive or I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know,</v>

413
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.230
<v Speaker 4>but that's like a no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

414
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:58.231
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A local band to bees moved into to sort </v>

415
00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:01.501
<v Speaker 4>it out with these bees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So our bees and their bees were just </v>

416
00:22:01.501 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 4>this fucking swarm in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were fighting.</v>

417
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.100
<v Speaker 4>They were just talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what's up?</v>

418
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 4>What are you guys do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll work with your doctor,</v>

419
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:07.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working with fear factor.</v>

420
00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:10.120
<v Speaker 4>We've got some dudes are going to cover </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and bees and shit.</v>

421
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 4>They're like working out what was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

422
00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:17.461
<v Speaker 4>And then they resolved their differences</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the local bees went a separate way </v>

423
00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:18.370
<v Speaker 4>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his be stayed.</v>

424
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.930
<v Speaker 4>Was it like a black cloud?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's correct.</v>

425
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.950
<v Speaker 4>It was not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a big fucking cloud of bees in </v>

426
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.950
<v Speaker 4>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the bees were communicating.</v>

427
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Where's your cell phone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why weren't you filming back is back in </v>

428
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.020
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have a [inaudible] no.</v>

429
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen or whatever role.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a press four times to get it as </v>

430
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 4>bad as little Motorola ea 15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those.</v>

431
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

432
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

433
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.570
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wonder if that's fucking with bds,</v>

434
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.600
<v Speaker 4>if our cell phone signals and everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>are fucking with beings that autism </v>

435
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:51.600
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

436
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 4>it might be something totally like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It also,</v>

437
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:55.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of speculation about autism is the</v>

438
00:22:55.331 --> 00:23:00.331
<v Speaker 4>age of the parents and that the women </v>
<v Speaker 4>are having babies like into their </v>

439
00:23:00.331 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 4>thirties and forties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that increases the risk.</v>

440
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.880
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's um,</v>

441
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.590
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very possible.</v>

442
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 4>Makes Sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

443
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we're just older and smarter and we</v>

444
00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 4>look at it now and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well God,</v>

445
00:23:11.051 --> 00:23:16.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how stupid would it be to have a kid </v>

446
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:16.051
<v Speaker 4>when you're 18?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're 18,</v>

447
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:16.051
<v Speaker 4>you're an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is absolutely true,</v>

448
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:20.700
<v Speaker 4>but when you're an 18 year old idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your genetics are much stronger and you </v>

449
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.321
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could have a kid and the kid </v>

450
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:25.321
<v Speaker 4>probably wouldn't be as fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

451
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:29.760
<v Speaker 4>the reality is even though we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>lengthening our lifetimes with nutrition</v>

452
00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:35.461
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>science and we're figuring out a way to </v>

453
00:23:35.461 --> 00:23:37.801
<v Speaker 4>make people live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't supposed to live much </v>

454
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:37.801
<v Speaker 4>longer than like 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

455
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 4>back in the day if you lived to be 50,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy Shit,</v>

456
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:41.110
<v Speaker 4>you pulled off an amazing,</v>

457
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.420
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not,</v>

458
00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 7>not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now people</v>

459
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.500
<v Speaker 4>are living to be 110 and you got </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sylvester.</v>

460
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 4>Stallone is 62 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's flogging,</v>

461
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 4>yoked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shredded.</v>

462
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are getting very strange now.</v>

463
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.440
<v Speaker 4>That's why guys are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just knock up 18 year old girls </v>

464
00:23:59.440 --> 00:23:59.880
<v Speaker 4>when they want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

465
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 4>girls would definitely give you the </v>
<v Speaker 4>better genetics.</v>

466
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 4>The real question though is do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you get anything other than,</v>

467
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hair,</v>

468
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Speaker 4>color,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eye color,</v>

469
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you get learned experiences and is it</v>

470
00:24:14.031 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 4>better off to have a parent with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of experiences?</v>

471
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Are those experiences transfer through </v>
<v Speaker 4>DNA because they didn't use to think it </v>

472
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.591
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to think that ideas were only </v>

473
00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 4>they were native to the person who had </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea,</v>

474
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
<v Speaker 4>but now they're starting to think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>memes can actually be transferred </v>

475
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.480
<v Speaker 4>through genetics and that useless </v>
<v Speaker 4>traits.</v>

476
00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:40.481
<v Speaker 4>Even like racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>racism can be transferred through </v>

477
00:24:40.481 --> 00:24:43.511
<v Speaker 4>genetics and it kind of makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of things that we </v>

478
00:24:43.511 --> 00:24:47.171
<v Speaker 4>have inside our genetics and our </v>
<v Speaker 4>instincts that are basically ancient </v>

479
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:52.160
<v Speaker 4>learned things like for like for </v>
<v Speaker 4>instances do named Rupert sheldrake.</v>

480
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Rupert sheldrake is this evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>biologists dude,</v>

481
00:24:56.121 --> 00:25:00.110
<v Speaker 4>and he pointed out that children that </v>
<v Speaker 4>live in New York City,</v>

482
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 4>they don't have dreams about like </v>
<v Speaker 4>muggers or car accidents.</v>

483
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 4>They have nightmares about monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about scary monsters and the reason they</v>

484
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:13.130
<v Speaker 4>have nightmares about scary monsters is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because back in our heads,</v>

485
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:18.131
<v Speaker 4>somewhere deep in our DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we remember back when we were like </v>

486
00:25:18.131 --> 00:25:22.870
<v Speaker 4>monkeys when we were these little apes </v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging around and trees and you're </v>

487
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.281
<v Speaker 4>running away from big cats and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit is always in our head because </v>

488
00:25:27.281 --> 00:25:31.661
<v Speaker 4>that is the number one thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was that fed off of,</v>

489
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>off chimps and apes is his big cats.</v>

490
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:37.520
<v Speaker 4>Big Cats are constantly killing monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 4>and chimps and apes.</v>

491
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.120
<v Speaker 4>And that's like when they find like old </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings,</v>

492
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.840
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

493
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

494
00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:44.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary versions of human beings,</v>

495
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.190
<v Speaker 4>subhuman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humanoids,</v>

496
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 4>they find all their skeletons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of them have like big fucking</v>

497
00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.000
<v Speaker 4>cat bites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big markings.</v>

498
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.150
<v Speaker 4>So that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like some memory that we have </v>

499
00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:58.150
<v Speaker 4>ingrained in our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our genetics,</v>

500
00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever the fuck we are.</v>

501
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible that if you're 18 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years old and you know,</v>

502
00:26:02.841 --> 00:26:03.980
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fuck a chicken,</v>

503
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:06.290
<v Speaker 4>she's 18 year both retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotTa,</v>

504
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:07.760
<v Speaker 4>you gotTa have a dumb ass kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

505
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might not just be,</v>

506
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:16.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hair color and your eye color and </v>

507
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.011
<v Speaker 4>how tall you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be your actual experiences and </v>

508
00:26:18.011 --> 00:26:18.020
<v Speaker 4>your human potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Second.</v>

509
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

510
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:20.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

511
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if you're a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're a fucking drunk,</v>

512
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:28.151
<v Speaker 4>if you get hammered and you're fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your life is in the toilet and you </v>

513
00:26:28.151 --> 00:26:28.870
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bang some chick because you know,</v>

514
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.110
<v Speaker 4>on the rebound and her old boyfriend </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to beat her and you shoot a load in</v>

515
00:26:33.111 --> 00:26:38.111
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a kid would be just like really </v>

516
00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:38.111
<v Speaker 4>fucking dumb and prone to make terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistakes.</v>

517
00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe you can get past it,</v>

518
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 4>but maybe his inclination like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we start off</v>

519
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.280
<v Speaker 7>in a certain place in life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not just based on the economic situation</v>

520
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:54.381
<v Speaker 7>that our parents are in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who the people we grow up with and what </v>

521
00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:56.700
<v Speaker 7>our agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it's maybe it's our,</v>

522
00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.840
<v Speaker 7>our,</v>
<v Speaker 7>our position starts out based on what </v>

523
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.280
<v Speaker 7>the parents were thinking and doing when</v>
<v Speaker 7>they fucked and conceived you like maybe</v>

524
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 7>if that's the lowest point in their </v>
<v Speaker 7>life,</v>

525
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 7>you not even because of the way they </v>
<v Speaker 7>raised you,</v>

526
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:14.901
<v Speaker 7>they can take you away and raise you in </v>
<v Speaker 7>an orphanage somewhere totally </v>

527
00:27:14.901 --> 00:27:18.111
<v Speaker 7>different,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but your potential is limited by the </v>

528
00:27:18.111 --> 00:27:19.320
<v Speaker 7>circumstances in which you were </v>
<v Speaker 7>conceived.</v>

529
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.780
<v Speaker 7>You think that's possible?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe.</v>

530
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 7>I don't think we have any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I think anything's possible,</v>

531
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:30.591
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's very obvious that there's a </v>

532
00:27:30.591 --> 00:27:31.290
<v Speaker 7>bunch of different types of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's like super powerful,</v>

533
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:36.291
<v Speaker 7>super successful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>super smart humans and there's really </v>

534
00:27:36.291 --> 00:27:38.400
<v Speaker 7>fucking dumb people because the </v>
<v Speaker 7>percentage of your brain being used,</v>

535
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think people use more brain than other</v>

536
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 7>people and I think it's such a small </v>
<v Speaker 7>percentage,</v>

537
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:44.920
<v Speaker 7>but even that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

538
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:50.060
<v Speaker 7>maybe that's the real way to become a </v>
<v Speaker 7>superhero.</v>

539
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 7>Find out how to use a 100 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 7>your brain.</v>

540
00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.330
<v Speaker 7>But it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have heard that.</v>

541
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:55.900
<v Speaker 7>That's bullshit that we don't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

542
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.190
<v Speaker 7>I mean when they look it up and it shows</v>
<v Speaker 7>the.</v>

543
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.710
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that,</v>

544
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 7>that's not what that part is for.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

545
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:03.150
<v Speaker 7>I think that that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

546
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 7>human beings only used 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 7>their brain.</v>

547
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.150
<v Speaker 7>I think that's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

548
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.220
<v Speaker 7>they don't know exactly what every part </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the brain is for.</v>

549
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.680
<v Speaker 7>It's like they're still like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

550
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.990
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like charting out the bottom of the</v>

551
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 7>sea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of shit they still haven't</v>

552
00:28:17.641 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 7>figured out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's see if any,</v>

553
00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:25.401
<v Speaker 7>you motherfuckers are smarter than us </v>
<v Speaker 7>and have answers to all these things </v>

554
00:28:25.401 --> 00:28:28.371
<v Speaker 7>that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is weird when you see like a human </v>

555
00:28:28.371 --> 00:28:30.951
<v Speaker 7>brain on TV and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's somebody that's a person to </v>

556
00:28:30.951 --> 00:28:31.770
<v Speaker 7>person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>

557
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's nuts.</v>

558
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.690
<v Speaker 7>Just twitter is blowing the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ladies and gentle.</v>

559
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.380
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's about twitter around.</v>

560
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.590
<v Speaker 7>I spoke twitter on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>backslash Joe Rogan.</v>

561
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:43.760
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>bought a long ass time ago.</v>

570
00:29:02.571 --> 00:29:05.390
<v Speaker 7>I got it on DVD and I just have never </v>
<v Speaker 7>gotten around to watching it.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I tried to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I stopped anti Chris.</v>

573
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.790
<v Speaker 7>I remember it just wasn't that </v>
<v Speaker 7>interesting to hear that shit.</v>

574
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.120
<v Speaker 7>Chris motherfuckers said it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 7>incredibly successful?</v>

579
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.460
<v Speaker 7>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean he like it.</v>

580
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.830
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he blows them off the fucking charts </v>

581
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.830
<v Speaker 7>slipped by every time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

582
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.830
<v Speaker 7>here's something that I needed to take </v>
<v Speaker 7>a.</v>

583
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 7>They actually found.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had a article this month</v>

584
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.490
<v Speaker 3>that there was a roadhouse video game in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the being made a few years ago,</v>

585
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 3>but the company went bankrupt.</v>

586
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Roadhouse video game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Patrick swayze.</v>

587
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.300
<v Speaker 4>That's the greatest bad movie ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right up there with showgirls.</v>

588
00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.090
<v Speaker 4>If you haven't seen roadhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck is wrong with</v>

589
00:30:00.091 --> 00:30:01.740
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you haven't seen showgirls,</v>

590
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.920
<v Speaker 4>drop this chat and and either download </v>
<v Speaker 4>it or go to the video store and do </v>

591
00:30:07.231 --> 00:30:09.270
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to watch showgirls.</v>

592
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Showgirls was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a quintessential movie where the </v>

593
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:18.020
<v Speaker 4>people who are doing the movie where </v>
<v Speaker 4>were just gapped out of their fucking </v>

594
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.950
<v Speaker 4>minds on cocaine and they made a </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible movie.</v>

595
00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:23.940
<v Speaker 4>That makes no sense and it's so bad that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>

596
00:30:23.941 --> 00:30:28.941
<v Speaker 4>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just one of those movies that's </v>

597
00:30:28.941 --> 00:30:31.701
<v Speaker 4>just perfectly crosses over into parody </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the point where you could watch it </v>

598
00:30:31.701 --> 00:30:33.150
<v Speaker 4>over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

599
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.330
<v Speaker 4>I've only seen it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Showgirls was awesome,</v>

600
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.210
<v Speaker 4>but showgirls and roadhouse or both,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically the same movie,</v>

601
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:46.800
<v Speaker 4>both movies where it's like they got </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that were just full of themselves</v>

602
00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:51.801
<v Speaker 4>enough and just underestimating the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence of viewers enough and just </v>

603
00:30:52.171 --> 00:30:54.570
<v Speaker 4>hack enough and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

604
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.600
<v Speaker 4>they just follow the dumbest formula </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines possible and the difference </v>

605
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.861
<v Speaker 4>between roadhouse and showgirls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doe is a roadhouse seems to be raw </v>

606
00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:07.971
<v Speaker 4>stupidity on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas showgirls is the most obvious </v>

607
00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:10.710
<v Speaker 4>cocaine movie of all time because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just so dumb.</v>

608
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.350
<v Speaker 4>Like you had to be on coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think that that was a good movie.</v>

609
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you made that move and you weren't on</v>

610
00:31:15.991 --> 00:31:17.600
<v Speaker 4>coke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would watch the dailies.</v>

611
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.420
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

612
00:31:18.421 --> 00:31:20.010
<v Speaker 4>The fuck we going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing?</v>

613
00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:21.810
<v Speaker 4>What is this moving?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're on call you're like,</v>

614
00:31:21.811 --> 00:31:23.280
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking awesome.</v>

615
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Coming into the line.</v>

616
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.760
<v Speaker 4>And what was your,</v>

617
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.090
<v Speaker 3>what's your bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you escalator,</v>

618
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:36.680
<v Speaker 3>which one has something to do with like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you even be able to see it yet?</v>

619
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human brain hasn't seen it yet.</v>

620
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was my theory about,</v>

621
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:47.610
<v Speaker 4>about how we believe that everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>around us is everything through his.</v>

622
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.640
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I talk about farts and what I say is</v>

623
00:31:50.641 --> 00:31:53.160
<v Speaker 4>that if someone farted and you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a nose,</v>

624
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 4>you'd have no idea if something was.</v>

625
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

626
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:56.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about something you used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say while ago,</v>

627
00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 3>something like kind of you were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying like how cars are.</v>

628
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Would you even be able to see it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

629
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because our brain hasn't seen it yet.</v>

630
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Like the tiger</v>

631
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:10.230
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would that added on the tiger bit was if</v>

632
00:32:10.231 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 4>a tiger was running at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you be able to even watch that?</v>

633
00:32:12.611 --> 00:32:13.810
<v Speaker 4>Because I think you bring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just start</v>

634
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.880
<v Speaker 3>producing cyclist pyramids or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to have a thing where you </v>

635
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.121
<v Speaker 3>talked about like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would they even be able to see it </v>

636
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:22.130
<v Speaker 3>because their brains never seen it </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

637
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.940
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

638
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 4>I think so man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's on my act.</v>

639
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:29.550
<v Speaker 4>That's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're thinking of there's a </v>

640
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.280
<v Speaker 4>part in the movie the secret where those</v>
<v Speaker 4>retards claim that or was it,</v>

641
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.500
<v Speaker 4>what the bleep do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like looking at,</v>

642
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:39.510
<v Speaker 4>like they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Indians couldn't recognize the </v>

643
00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:39.510
<v Speaker 4>Bolus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I see it,</v>

644
00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:39.510
<v Speaker 4>it was not my act now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

645
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.360
<v Speaker 4>my actors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

646
00:32:40.361 --> 00:32:45.361
<v Speaker 4>the part about how if we didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nose and you smell a Fart,</v>

647
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 4>and this is for the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching this,</v>

648
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.750
<v Speaker 4>this is the idea is that we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>any idea if there's more around us all </v>

649
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 4>the time that we can't sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's very possible that there is.</v>

650
00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.540
<v Speaker 4>And what I say is the fourth theory and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the theory is if someone farted and you </v>

651
00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.591
<v Speaker 4>couldn't smell it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have no idea that there's </v>

652
00:33:05.591 --> 00:33:05.591
<v Speaker 4>something around you.</v>

653
00:33:05.591 --> 00:33:07.780
<v Speaker 4>It's totally completely invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if someone farts you fucking smell </v>

654
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you didn't have a nose,</v>

655
00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:10.460
<v Speaker 4>you'd be just sitting in someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>stench.</v>

656
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.330
<v Speaker 4>How do we not know that there aren't an </v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite amount of things that we just </v>

657
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.910
<v Speaker 4>can't detect and that smell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though we can attack this,</v>

658
00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 4>it's for biological reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

659
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.460
<v Speaker 4>you smell gas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it's dangerous for you.</v>

660
00:33:21.461 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 4>You smell fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get away.</v>

661
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why we have a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>smell.</v>

662
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.380
<v Speaker 4>It's good for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what if we didn't?</v>

663
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:32.770
<v Speaker 4>If we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be an invisible thing and it's </v>

664
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.461
<v Speaker 4>just our imagination that limits the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities of how many other </v>

665
00:33:36.461 --> 00:33:39.350
<v Speaker 4>invisible things there are around us all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time that we can't detect.</v>

666
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.010
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of animals like worms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take your hand and he rolled over or</v>

667
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.470
<v Speaker 4>above a where they have no idea they're.</v>

668
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:50.530
<v Speaker 4>They have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible that if that exists </v>

669
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.801
<v Speaker 4>in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's also some shit like that </v>

670
00:33:53.801 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 4>with human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible that we're constantly</v>

671
00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 4>like the idea of dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dimensions might be dimensions of </v>

672
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.271
<v Speaker 4>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just might not have the ability to </v>

673
00:34:04.271 --> 00:34:04.370
<v Speaker 4>perceive all these other things that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>around us all the time.</v>

674
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could be like bad energy,</v>

675
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:07.720
<v Speaker 4>like you go into a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people,</v>

676
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.820
<v Speaker 4>many people have told stories or if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>go into a house where people have been </v>

677
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.431
<v Speaker 4>murdered and they could feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could feel fucked up energy in the </v>

678
00:34:15.431 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that all might be real shit.</v>

679
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:20.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we don't have a name for it and </v>

680
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:20.530
<v Speaker 4>we're not good at detecting it and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

681
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we call it a sense or a feeling that </v>

682
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Speaker 4>might be real energy that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>detecting.</v>

683
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 4>We're just not evolved enough to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>point where we can really tune into it </v>

684
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

685
00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.630
<v Speaker 7>Why is it that we like our smuggler and </v>
<v Speaker 7>farts but not somebody else's fired.</v>

686
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.610
<v Speaker 7>My farts are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you think it's just like,</v>

687
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.640
<v Speaker 7>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you think we would enjoy it if we </v>

688
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:41.640
<v Speaker 7>made herself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

689
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.090
<v Speaker 7>like if you forced yourself to smell my </v>
<v Speaker 7>heart and enjoy it,</v>

690
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.290
<v Speaker 7>like make yourself into it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'd have to be one of those sick dudes</v>

691
00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:49.610
<v Speaker 7>that wax off to Fart porn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

692
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.940
<v Speaker 7>because there's dudes that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's dudes,</v>

693
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.870
<v Speaker 7>there's dudes that like that that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>real.</v>

694
00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.050
<v Speaker 7>But I've never heard of anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 7>likes their buddies fartsy.</v>

695
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:01.080
<v Speaker 7>That's weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>

696
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.660
<v Speaker 7>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I enjoy my own farm.</v>

697
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.090
<v Speaker 7>I love my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody does.</v>

698
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.980
<v Speaker 7>If you're in your car and you feel a hot</v>
<v Speaker 7>one and a blast,</v>

699
00:35:10.981 --> 00:35:13.180
<v Speaker 7>you when you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He stopped smoking.</v>

700
00:35:13.181 --> 00:35:15.390
<v Speaker 7>When I'm in the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I cut my hand around my ass.</v>

701
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:20.230
<v Speaker 7>I call it the Donald Duck because it </v>
<v Speaker 7>makes it donald duck noise when you.</v>

702
00:35:20.231 --> 00:35:24.850
<v Speaker 7>And when I fart and it doesn't smell,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm always disappointed by far nothing.</v>

703
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:26.260
<v Speaker 7>It's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

704
00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:29.140
<v Speaker 7>But like if somebody else farts like on </v>
<v Speaker 7>a plane and you're like,</v>

705
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.350
<v Speaker 7>oh you mother Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't believe you did that,</v>

706
00:35:32.351 --> 00:35:34.260
<v Speaker 7>then we should love it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

707
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.610
<v Speaker 7>And it smells the same.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not like your farts smell different</v>

708
00:35:36.611 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 7>than mine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

709
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:42.500
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with our farts I think we get a little </v>

710
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:42.500
<v Speaker 7>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

711
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:42.500
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're getting all this bad stuff out of</v>

712
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.310
<v Speaker 7>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But with other people's farts it's like,</v>

713
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.150
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you stinky,</v>

714
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:45.860
<v Speaker 7>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

715
00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:49.650
<v Speaker 7>it's not the same reward.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is there any other smells that do that?</v>

716
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 7>I don't like to smell my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't like that.</v>

717
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:55.980
<v Speaker 7>I tell you that I don't like that when I</v>
<v Speaker 7>take a nasty dump on,</v>

718
00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>get me out of that room.</v>

719
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to go back in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I would blow my nose or something </v>

720
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Speaker 7>like that and go to get some totally </v>
<v Speaker 7>different.</v>

721
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck?</v>

722
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.490
<v Speaker 7>That was my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

723
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 7>I don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I do.</v>

724
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.560
<v Speaker 7>That's funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You do like if you have ever had to shit</v>

725
00:36:07.561 --> 00:36:09.420
<v Speaker 7>outside Iraq to take a ship in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>woods,</v>

726
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.610
<v Speaker 7>that's the worst because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 7>water.</v>

727
00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:15.120
<v Speaker 7>I think it's just just steamy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>stinky fucking dump on dirt.</v>

728
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:17.040
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The smells horrible.</v>

729
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.980
<v Speaker 7>Nobody ever liked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like sitting there sniffing their,</v>

730
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.820
<v Speaker 7>their pile of Shit and getting all happy</v>
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>

731
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.370
<v Speaker 7>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

732
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:28.250
<v Speaker 7>It's like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is the evolutionary reason for that</v>

733
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.860
<v Speaker 7>was the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's probably like the cure of aids </v>

734
00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.801
<v Speaker 7>somewhere in that something that </v>
<v Speaker 7>researchers are going to research on </v>

735
00:36:35.801 --> 00:36:35.960
<v Speaker 7>farts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lily,</v>

736
00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.620
<v Speaker 7>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

737
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.890
<v Speaker 7>what do you think about all these dudes?</v>

738
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.980
<v Speaker 7>And there's a bunch of scientists online</v>
<v Speaker 7>like um,</v>

739
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what,</v>

740
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:46.551
<v Speaker 7>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's just one guy that's at the head </v>

741
00:36:46.551 --> 00:36:46.551
<v Speaker 7>of the cause,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

742
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:51.590
<v Speaker 7>Peter Duesberg and they're all saying </v>
<v Speaker 7>that HIV does not cause aids and that </v>

743
00:36:52.191 --> 00:36:57.191
<v Speaker 7>HIV is a very weak virus and that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>only reason why HIV exists in the </v>

744
00:36:57.191 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 7>systems of these people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have aids is because their immune system</v>

745
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:02.250
<v Speaker 7>is so compromised that it can even kill </v>
<v Speaker 7>off HIV.</v>

746
00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's really weird that most of </v>

747
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.081
<v Speaker 7>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it seems like that have aids are drug </v>

748
00:37:10.081 --> 00:37:10.081
<v Speaker 7>users and gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they're going to have a.</v>

749
00:37:10.081 --> 00:37:11.440
<v Speaker 7>d has something to do with the immune </v>
<v Speaker 7>system,</v>

750
00:37:11.441 --> 00:37:13.270
<v Speaker 7>but then you get fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's his name?</v>

751
00:37:13.271 --> 00:37:15.370
<v Speaker 7>The basketball player that had fake </v>
<v Speaker 7>aides.</v>

752
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.500
<v Speaker 7>That's the other thing is that people </v>
<v Speaker 7>test negative after a while,</v>

753
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.540
<v Speaker 7>like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're the Richard he goes into and </v>

754
00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:25.540
<v Speaker 7>then it goes into,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>

755
00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.330
<v Speaker 7>into a dormant stage,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mean magic Johnson has aids and now he's</v>

<v Speaker 7>Commercials.</v>

759
00:37:32.631 --> 00:37:36.550
<v Speaker 7>He didn't get a lot of money on AIDS </v>
<v Speaker 7>medicine.</v>

760
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

761
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 7>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess.</v>

762
00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.530
<v Speaker 7>I mean they probably pay him millions of</v>
<v Speaker 7>dollars.</v>

763
00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:43.630
<v Speaker 7>Do any commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's still got a good name.</v>

764
00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.430
<v Speaker 7>How much mattresses though are you going</v>
<v Speaker 7>to sell it as?</v>

765
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.140
<v Speaker 7>Payback?</v>

<v Speaker 7>players,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all these dudes who you know are out </v>

<v Speaker 7>there just fucking banging chicks left </v>
<v Speaker 7>and right.</v>

769
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.880
<v Speaker 7>They must be freaking out about this </v>
<v Speaker 7>tiger woods shit.</v>

770
00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.280
<v Speaker 7>Who's target?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

771
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:04.281
<v Speaker 7>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll throw a monkey wrench into your </v>

772
00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:04.540
<v Speaker 7>endorsement deals and if you're like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>Michael Jordan type of dude,</v>

773
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.090
<v Speaker 7>like that's where those guys make them </v>
<v Speaker 7>the most,</v>

774
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.420
<v Speaker 7>the bulk of their cash as in </v>
<v Speaker 7>endorsements,</v>

775
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.470
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's why this is so dangerous to tiger</v>

776
00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:16.471
<v Speaker 7>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not the tiger woods can't go out </v>

777
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:16.471
<v Speaker 7>there and still kick your ass and golf </v>
<v Speaker 7>and say fuck you.</v>

778
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:18.010
<v Speaker 7>I can do whatever I want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He can,</v>

779
00:38:18.011 --> 00:38:21.610
<v Speaker 7>but he can't because the endorsements is</v>
<v Speaker 7>where he gets all his cash.</v>

780
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.530
<v Speaker 7>We'll look at letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Same thing.</v>

781
00:38:23.531 --> 00:38:26.500
<v Speaker 7>It's like blown up this year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Two thousand and nine cents.</v>

782
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.900
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't suck.</v>

783
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:31.140
<v Speaker 7>It's what I was talking about before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think what we're sensing,</v>

784
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:34.230
<v Speaker 7>what we're seeing in celebrities is </v>
<v Speaker 7>mirrored,</v>

785
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 7>is going to be mirrored as human beings.</v>

786
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 4>We're seeing more access to information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're seeing less secrets.</v>

787
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a trend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>

788
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:47.851
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a trend because I think that's </v>

789
00:38:47.851 --> 00:38:47.851
<v Speaker 4>eventually what the human race is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to come to.</v>

790
00:38:47.851 --> 00:38:52.320
<v Speaker 4>It's going to come to a point in time </v>
<v Speaker 4>where there was not going to be any </v>

791
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.271
<v Speaker 4>secrets and that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be full information </v>

792
00:38:54.271 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 4>disclosed from you to me and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what it is is the convergence of all</v>

793
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:57.690
<v Speaker 4>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's gonna.</v>

794
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:02.730
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going to start to ignite </v>
<v Speaker 4>the convergence amongst all human </v>

795
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:07.261
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be full access to </v>

796
00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:07.261
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know everything in your head.</v>

797
00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 4>You know everything in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty weird,</v>

798
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:12.991
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty fucking crazy and that's </v>

799
00:39:12.991 --> 00:39:14.671
<v Speaker 4>where it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going through technology and this </v>

800
00:39:14.671 --> 00:39:15.550
<v Speaker 4>is what the Internet about is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter is about.</v>

801
00:39:15.551 --> 00:39:17.140
<v Speaker 4>This with this huge stream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trout is about,</v>

802
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 4>this is what all the shit is about.</v>

803
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:23.670
<v Speaker 4>It's about a convergence of human beings</v>
<v Speaker 4>like human beings are eventually merging</v>

804
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 4>into one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

805
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:29.881
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole ancient line and eastern </v>

806
00:39:29.881 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 4>mysticism and each eastern religion is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

807
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.600
<v Speaker 4>that we are all one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are,</v>

808
00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:33.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are one consciousness,</v>

809
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.500
<v Speaker 4>like the bill Hicks Joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

810
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:37.630
<v Speaker 4>experiencing itself subjectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

811
00:39:37.631 --> 00:39:38.240
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

812
00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 4>the Timothy leary ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideology of all the,</v>

813
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.800
<v Speaker 4>all the psychedelic heads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the people that you know,</v>

814
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:47.920
<v Speaker 4>they really got into like heavy duty </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic trucks is that it's this one</v>

815
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:52.921
<v Speaker 4>thing and that we can't recognize that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're one thing because we have ego and </v>

816
00:39:52.921 --> 00:39:53.860
<v Speaker 4>we have survival and we have all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

817
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.750
<v Speaker 4>but that our technology and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology forcing us to evolve that the</v>

818
00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:03.751
<v Speaker 4>access to information that technology </v>
<v Speaker 4>provides eventually will cause human </v>

819
00:40:03.751 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 4>beings all human beings to converge and </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally be like one consciousness.</v>

820
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:11.730
<v Speaker 4>If I know all your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know all your information and we have </v>

821
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.881
<v Speaker 4>an access to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an interface that's much less crew than </v>

822
00:40:14.881 --> 00:40:16.210
<v Speaker 4>what we have now with typing and with </v>
<v Speaker 4>researching or watching documentaries,</v>

823
00:40:16.211 --> 00:40:20.090
<v Speaker 4>what if it's like an instant access,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a human neuro transplant,</v>

824
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 4>something that allows all of us to link </v>
<v Speaker 4>up our minds together.</v>

825
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.560
<v Speaker 4>That's not that outside of the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility.</v>

826
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:31.950
<v Speaker 4>That to me seems just as likely as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to send a picture through the </v>

827
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.400
<v Speaker 4>Internet on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just.</v>

828
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.430
<v Speaker 4>That's just as fucking crazy that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can send video through the air and you </v>

829
00:40:38.471 --> 00:40:40.240
<v Speaker 4>could watch a youtube video on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>iphone.</v>

830
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:41.440
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

831
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:43.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just coming through the air and you</v>

832
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:48.511
<v Speaker 4>put the headphones on and it's in stereo</v>
<v Speaker 4>like wax that's going through the </v>

833
00:40:48.511 --> 00:40:52.741
<v Speaker 4>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scott is just as likely that human </v>

834
00:40:52.741 --> 00:40:54.250
<v Speaker 4>beings are eventually going to come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a,</v>

835
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.280
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a technological invention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that we're going to come to </v>

836
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.240
<v Speaker 4>something that allows all human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>to interface together.</v>

837
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:06.240
<v Speaker 4>It might be through this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be something you put on and </v>

838
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.001
<v Speaker 4>everybody else that has it all links in </v>
<v Speaker 4>together or it might've actually become </v>

839
00:41:09.001 --> 00:41:13.170
<v Speaker 4>something that you put in your body or </v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be something they broadcast </v>

840
00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:13.180
<v Speaker 4>through the fucking air that links </v>
<v Speaker 4>people together.</v>

841
00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.740
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just can't wait till it gets cheaper </v>

842
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:19.740
<v Speaker 4>to be able to like upgrade your body </v>
<v Speaker 4>parts.</v>

843
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.400
<v Speaker 4>Like I want to have better items because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want night vision.</v>

844
00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:23.850
<v Speaker 4>I want to have fucking twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want.</v>

845
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 4>I knew about that woman that they made </v>
<v Speaker 4>her a new bladder.</v>

846
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might have a bladder out of her.</v>

847
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 4>They took her on bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They scrape the cells together since the</v>

848
00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:33.230
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

849

850
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if the stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stem cells,</v>

851
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:41.770
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they grew a new bladder for her </v>

852
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:41.770
<v Speaker 3>and a fucking petri dish and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>install it in their body.</v>

853
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

854
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bladder just to kind of a bag for pis.</v>

855
00:41:45.691 --> 00:41:50.691
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen with other shit </v>

<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a nightmare.</v>

<v Speaker 3>cravings for what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of those duties are you serious?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

900
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:40.430

<v Speaker 1>Magic Johnson's bought the cure for </v>

<v Speaker 1>Magic Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great South Park.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The cure for years.</v>

904
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.540
<v Speaker 1>No better south park episode than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one where the,</v>

905
00:43:48.541 --> 00:43:51.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I remember watching that going.</v>

907
00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 1>How do they get away with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't pass on circumstances,</v>

908
00:44:02.321 --> 00:44:05.680
<v Speaker 1>but you can pass on the psychic ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create them.</v>

909
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you really know that?</v>

912
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Are you just saying maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what's happening,</v>

913
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.030
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know the psychic ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create them.</v>

914
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever met anybody that says that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a channeler or says that they're</v>

915
00:44:26.301 --> 00:44:28.340
<v Speaker 1>savvy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't a fucking retard.</v>

916
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever met anyone?</v>

917
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time they do it like fucking scam</v>

918
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 1>artists to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never met one person that says </v>

919
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 1>they're a psychic or says they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel that isn't retarded.</v>

920
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 1>They're all retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it's almost like,</v>

921
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:42.330
<v Speaker 1>do you have to be retarded to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that?</v>

922
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some somewhat of a person that can </v>

923
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.660
<v Speaker 1>look like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so socially inept.</v>

924
00:44:49.661 --> 00:44:51.630
<v Speaker 1>You're so clueless as to how other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people perceive you,</v>

925
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.630
<v Speaker 1>that you can achieve certain frequencies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people can't.</v>

926
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything?</v>

927
00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Can I get Alex Jones on opiod?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony?</v>

928
00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

929
00:45:03.381 --> 00:45:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a little jimmy little.</v>

930
00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy did the Jesse Ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we'd like that.</v>

931
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones is not the kind of guy you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to like argue with like that.</v>

932
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.660
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to enjoy his company and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask them questions.</v>

933
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And then we started talking about new </v>
<v Speaker 1>world order,</v>

934
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.380
<v Speaker 1>black helicopters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legend gentleman.</v>

935
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I see them outside of my window every </v>
<v Speaker 1>night you tell me I'm crazy,</v>

936
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 1>but I see black helicopters outside my </v>
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>

937
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:32.420
<v Speaker 1>So what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't argue with that dude.</v>

938
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:37.480
<v Speaker 1>You go damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucking black helicopters that's </v>

939
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:37.480
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's supposed to like.</v>

940
00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:41.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was in the room with Jesse Ventura,</v>

941
00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm certain I would have handled it </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than Jimmy did,</v>

942
00:45:43.731 --> 00:45:46.400
<v Speaker 1>but Jimmy's one of those dudes were Jim </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norton,</v>

943
00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:50.030
<v Speaker 1>fantastic comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funniest guy in radio without a doubt by</v>

944
00:45:50.031 --> 00:45:50.510
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

945
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.690
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those dudes that when he,</v>

946
00:45:53.691 --> 00:45:54.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.050
<v Speaker 1>when he's in the face of someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bully,</v>

948
00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.690
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't like that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't stand up to that shit.</v>

949
00:45:59.691 --> 00:46:04.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he feels like that Jesse has this </v>

950
00:46:04.691 --> 00:46:07.481
<v Speaker 1>slow burn in his eyes and the Imo navy </v>
<v Speaker 1>seal and all that shit and that you're </v>

951
00:46:07.481 --> 00:46:08.240
<v Speaker 1>supposed to listen to them because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

952
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.770
<v Speaker 1>And Jim Norton just ain't buying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why Jimmy just shut them down</v>

953
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.150
<v Speaker 1>and clowned him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just what he does.</v>

954
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.760
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not good at people being bullies.</v>

955
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.110
<v Speaker 1>A respect that</v>

956
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:26.390
<v Speaker 1>people that meditate have large frontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobe cortex is studies.</v>

957
00:46:26.391 --> 00:46:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Show says Pete Shreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

958
00:46:29.961 --> 00:46:31.280
<v Speaker 1>That's very possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

959
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible that it changes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way your brain works.</v>

960
00:46:35.301 --> 00:46:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you lift weights,</v>

961
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.300
<v Speaker 1>you know it changes the way your </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>

962
00:46:38.301 --> 00:46:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

963
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.200
<v Speaker 1>if you exercise your mind in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

964
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:47.230
<v Speaker 1>if this doesn't make that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian is going to smoke marijuana live </v>

965
00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.670
<v Speaker 1>right here on ustream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God it's all legal.</v>

966
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing Obama's done.</v>

967
00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.600
<v Speaker 1>He said he would do stuff on after we'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>rediculus alright,</v>

968
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.680
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

969
00:47:03.681 --> 00:47:08.681
<v Speaker 1>Party people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the Rogan board and read </v>

970
00:47:08.681 --> 00:47:09.770
<v Speaker 1>some of the questions that you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have.</v>

971
00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:17.940
<v Speaker 1>What is my opinion on freewill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your blog talks about how we're all </v>

972
00:47:17.981 --> 00:47:21.070
<v Speaker 1>living through different circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very true,</v>

973
00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.930
<v Speaker 1>but it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what the power of free will,</v>

974
00:47:22.931 --> 00:47:26.090
<v Speaker 1>which kind of sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

975
00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Know I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start about freewill.</v>

976
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

977
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 4>think about free will and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different ways.</v>

978
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:36.751
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very possible that you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are shaping your own destiny and </v>

979
00:47:36.751 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

980
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>choose your path and you can,</v>

981
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go through this life and you know,</v>

982
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 4>and make something of yourself and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

983
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you did it by yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have through freewill.</v>

984
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.670
<v Speaker 4>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's very possible,</v>

985
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:54.120
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's all pos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also possible that life itself is a</v>

986
00:47:54.401 --> 00:47:59.401
<v Speaker 4>gigantic mathematical algorithm that all</v>
<v Speaker 4>life itself is like a gigantic </v>

987
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:05.941
<v Speaker 4>mathematical equation and that it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't seem like an equation because </v>

988
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 4>we're a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like that,</v>

989
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.630
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your personality,</v>

990
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 4>your biology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your circumstances,</v>

991
00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:18.070
<v Speaker 4>your experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all set up in line to put you in</v>

992
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:23.071
<v Speaker 4>a very specific position to move forward</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a very specific way to interface with</v>

993
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 4>all the other.</v>

994
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Very specific things that are around </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

995
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.600
<v Speaker 4>all the other very specific people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very specific events and that the idea </v>

996
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.551
<v Speaker 4>is that what the idea of free will is </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a misnomer.</v>

997
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:39.961
<v Speaker 4>Like you have instincts and you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences that guide you into a </v>

998
00:48:39.961 --> 00:48:40.620
<v Speaker 4>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say if you,</v>

999
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:41.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1000
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:46.990
<v Speaker 4>he drank poison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you almost died and it was terrible and </v>

1001
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:46.990
<v Speaker 4>he didn't know it was poison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1002
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 4>you'll be much more careful next time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you won't drink poison.</v>

1003
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:54.040
<v Speaker 4>The idea that that circumstance that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've experienced as lead you taught in</v>

1004
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:59.041
<v Speaker 4>a very specific way and that you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences literally are set up as a </v>

1005
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:04.471
<v Speaker 4>part of a mathematical equation and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all to lead this entire human race,</v>

1006
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:10.240
<v Speaker 4>which is really just one organism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one gigantic super organism to lead this</v>

1007
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:14.230
<v Speaker 4>entire human race into a specific place </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a very specific purpose.</v>

1008
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.150
<v Speaker 4>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1009
00:49:16.151 --> 00:49:17.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1010
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 4>when your ego has any control whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 4>over your mind.</v>

1011
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 4>Your ego wants you to think that no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1012
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:25.900
<v Speaker 4>I am in control of my own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my life.</v>

1013
00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:30.930
<v Speaker 4>I have done what I've done and I'm proud</v>
<v Speaker 4>of all that I've done because it's my </v>

1014
00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:35.221
<v Speaker 4>own accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but really it might be you're following </v>

1015
00:49:35.221 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 4>a program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really might be.</v>

1016
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 4>We're all a part of this gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 4>program that's,</v>

1017
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that all this,</v>

1018
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ego justification,</v>

1019
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:48.271
<v Speaker 4>ego gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex and love and fun and happiness and </v>

1020
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:53.280
<v Speaker 4>all these things are really just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers and equations and like the </v>

1021
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.600
<v Speaker 4>little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the powerful number that you get from </v>

1022
00:49:59.600 --> 00:49:59.600
<v Speaker 4>love forces you to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1023
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.690
<v Speaker 4>to be in love and have children and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>create more people and to be good to </v>

1024
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 4>those people and those people create </v>
<v Speaker 4>more good people and that,</v>

1025
00:50:05.321 --> 00:50:10.321
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these rewards are all in fact set up as </v>

1026
00:50:10.321 --> 00:50:13.741
<v Speaker 4>a part of an equation to move the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>race into one specific place that </v>

1027
00:50:13.741 --> 00:50:16.670
<v Speaker 4>everyone is working together all over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world and we just don't realize it.</v>

1028
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.190
<v Speaker 4>We're beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1029
00:50:18.191 --> 00:50:19.720
<v Speaker 4>we're bs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like when,</v>

1030
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean we don't know how bees </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate.</v>

1031
00:50:22.271 --> 00:50:24.740
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what sort of a culture bees have,</v>

1032
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 4>but we know that they don't have books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't their past.</v>

1033
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 4>They can't study their history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean how conscious,</v>

1034
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:35.201
<v Speaker 4>how aware are they in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they just going through the motions </v>

1035
00:50:35.201 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 4>because that's how they're programmed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if,</v>

1036
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 4>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's the case with wolves and bears</v>

1037
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:43.730
<v Speaker 4>and every other animal that sort of goes</v>
<v Speaker 4>through these natural motions to achieve</v>

1038
00:50:43.731 --> 00:50:46.250
<v Speaker 4>a specific result,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's what we're doing.</v>

1039
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.400
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we're just doing it and it's way </v>
<v Speaker 4>more complicated because what we're </v>

1040
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:51.830
<v Speaker 4>doing is we're actually changing our </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

1041
00:50:51.831 --> 00:50:56.831
<v Speaker 4>We're changing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're creating computers and creating </v>

1042
00:50:56.831 --> 00:50:59.951
<v Speaker 4>technology and we're involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're the only animal on the planet </v>

1043
00:50:59.951 --> 00:51:02.741
<v Speaker 4>that's involved in this symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with another life form and </v>

1044
00:51:02.741 --> 00:51:03.230
<v Speaker 4>that other life form is technology.</v>

1045
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you don't classify life as </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that has a heartbeat and </v>

1046
00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:12.161
<v Speaker 4>something that bleeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you classify life as something </v>

1047
00:51:12.161 --> 00:51:14.831
<v Speaker 4>that evolves and changes and grows and </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that is like inexorably linked</v>

1048
00:51:14.841 --> 00:51:17.810
<v Speaker 4>to human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>technology is just like a virus.</v>

1049
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:23.020
<v Speaker 4>Technology is just like something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a bacteria that's in your </v>

1050
00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 4>system that you can't get out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1051
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you have to have a lot of healthy </v>

1052
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.401
<v Speaker 4>bacteria in your body all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's like you have a symbiotic </v>

1053
00:51:30.401 --> 00:51:31.970
<v Speaker 4>relationship with this healthy bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it keeps you alive.</v>

1054
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 4>It actually fights off other bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1055
00:51:34.941 --> 00:51:37.040
<v Speaker 4>that's what probiotics are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what acidophilus says.</v>

1056
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:39.450
<v Speaker 4>You're taking in a live culture that </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be your,</v>

1057
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.350
<v Speaker 4>your warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they will fight off bad bacteria.</v>

1058
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:47.650
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very possible that that's what </v>

1059
00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:49.481
<v Speaker 4>technology is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The technology is a life force that we </v>

1060
00:51:49.481 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 4>are interfaced with and we are.</v>

1061
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.940
<v Speaker 4>We have a symbiotic relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this other thing.</v>

1062
00:51:52.941 --> 00:51:56.690
<v Speaker 4>And we needed to keep us alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We needed to keep the power on,</v>

1063
00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep,</v>

1064
00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.610
<v Speaker 4>to keep us warm in cold climates to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1065
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.690
<v Speaker 4>to make sure your car gets you to work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1066
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.840
<v Speaker 4>to make sure that the airbag goes off to</v>
<v Speaker 4>save your life and all this shit is </v>

1067
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:11.210
<v Speaker 4>designed to help us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in turn we keep it going.</v>

1068
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:16.390
<v Speaker 4>We look at old cars on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road that have broken down and dead and </v>

1069
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:18.140
<v Speaker 4>those things are just like dead bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1070
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:20.670
<v Speaker 4>cars that are old that stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just like,</v>

1071
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:22.070
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking cool.</v>

1072
00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.680
<v Speaker 4>That's just like seeing an old man at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gym with big muscles like,</v>

1073
00:52:24.681 --> 00:52:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1074
00:52:26.061 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally like technology and </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that we create,</v>

1075
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:35.050
<v Speaker 4>we are helping those things evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are helping those things evolve with </v>

1076
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:38.660
<v Speaker 4>our materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with our obsession with technology.</v>

1077
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.190
<v Speaker 4>We are trying to always constantly get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the newer,</v>

1078
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.160
<v Speaker 4>better cooler shit and in doing that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then supply that,</v>

1079
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:51.250
<v Speaker 4>we are forcing people to work in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry and continue to evolve </v>

1080
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.890
<v Speaker 4>technology mean it's very possible that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all one fucking big thing.</v>

1081
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:58.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's my opinion on that.</v>

1082
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:02.730
<v Speaker 4>What I get for Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mother's pussy.</v>

1083
00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1084
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:08.380
<v Speaker 2>what's my opinion of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1085
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 2>this is too tripper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people just get way too.</v>

1086
00:53:11.451 --> 00:53:12.320
<v Speaker 2>DMT On me.</v>

1087
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:18.670
<v Speaker 4>Stream is the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hippies are weird to me.</v>

1088
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:21.120
<v Speaker 4>This dude's question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is NPO.</v>

1089
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Sharman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is your opinion of the non ordinary</v>

1090
00:53:23.891 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 4>reality access DMT and</v>

1091
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.040
<v Speaker 1>other NCO substances?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Theo gins are,</v>

1092
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:36.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the literal translation is </v>

1093
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:37.020
<v Speaker 1>something that connects you to God but a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs.</v>

1094
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel there is much to learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this version of reality?</v>

1095
00:53:40.501 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 1>How can it be applied to ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality?</v>

1096
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem with any </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs,</v>

1097
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 1>whether you're doing Salvia or doing dmt</v>
<v Speaker 1>or smoking weed.</v>

1098
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you bringing any of that back?</v>

1099
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Is it enhancing your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>

1100
00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Anything enhances your law?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that question.</v>

1101
00:53:54.991 --> 00:53:56.060
<v Speaker 1>To me it seems like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1102
00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 1>he wrote it in the garage with his car </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

1103
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's my take on Charlie Sheen?</v>

1104
00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Sheen is a dude who's friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Alex.</v>

1105
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Joe like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not laughing.</v>

1106
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:16.770
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1107
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:21.000
<v Speaker 1>he is a nine slash 11 conspiracy buff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an actor.</v>

1108
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:25.810
<v Speaker 1>He knows every data that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might have just met.</v>

1109
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.480
<v Speaker 1>He's an actor after the tough action </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1110
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a couple of actors that are </v>

1111
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 1>pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not that many.</v>

1112
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are really annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said it busted the actors,</v>

1113
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 1>like Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when.</v>

1114
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:42.160
<v Speaker 1>No punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always want to talk,</v>

1115
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:44.220
<v Speaker 1>ain't got shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not giving you anything back.</v>

1116
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.400
<v Speaker 1>At least like with Joey Diaz is talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to be laughing and </v>

1117
00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:49.620
<v Speaker 1>you're going to enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want them to talk,</v>

1118
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but after it's just talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1119
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 1>actors always have the answers to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking to actors,</v>

1120
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:02.660
<v Speaker 1>very rarely does an actor want to admit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't know why something is </v>

1121
00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:02.660
<v Speaker 1>this or something.</v>

1122
00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1123
00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 1>they always have opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really poorly thought out opinions,</v>

1124
00:55:06.301 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on politics or a war or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1125
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Have you recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1126
00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:15.840
<v Speaker 1>an followed somebody on twitter because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just tweeted too much?</v>

1127
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I just unfollowed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1128
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I hardly ever unfollow someone you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time I bought a block.</v>

1129
00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 1>People if they just have arguments with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and just sort of boring,</v>

1130
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 1>but I followed the dumbest </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

1131
00:55:30.871 --> 00:55:35.871
<v Speaker 1>I followed so many dumb people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to tell you what they're </v>

1132
00:55:35.871 --> 00:55:38.691
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to tell you who they are </v>

1133
00:55:38.691 --> 00:55:39.240
<v Speaker 1>because some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them were just fantastic.</v>

1134
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With their terrible tweet.</v>

1135
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:44.350
<v Speaker 5>I just unfollowed Kevin Smith the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>day because she spent,</v>

1136
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:49.790
<v Speaker 5>he literally spent two hours replying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>every single person that has rode them </v>

1137
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:52.810
<v Speaker 5>and like the last two months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you did it because it blogs up your.</v>

1138
00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:55.330
<v Speaker 5>It was all him and had no one else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1139
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:56.650
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>next page.</v>

1140
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:58.840
<v Speaker 5>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She liked him though.</v>

1141
00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:00.700
<v Speaker 5>I do like them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's bullshit.</v>

1142
00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:05.730
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Needs to learn how to fucking use </v>

1143
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:05.730
<v Speaker 5>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1144
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:05.730
<v Speaker 5>how you're supposed to do if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>reply direct messages,</v>

1145
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.150
<v Speaker 5>but to all those people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're gonna,</v>

1146
00:56:07.151 --> 00:56:12.151
<v Speaker 5>if you're gonna replace all our time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't care what this answer this </v>

1147
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:12.151
<v Speaker 5>question is that if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1148
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:17.100
<v Speaker 5>the messages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem with the direct messages </v>

1149
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:17.100
<v Speaker 5>that you kept,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody</v>

1150
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.290
<v Speaker 1>else can see it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the cool things about Kevin Smith</v>

1151

<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1168
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:13.000

<v Speaker 1>an old queen to me now.</v>

1170
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Ever since then.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>possibly getting right.</v>

1174
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.740
<v Speaker 1>If you're really intelligent and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>super religious.</v>

1175
00:57:26.741 --> 00:57:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I always gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What are you doing belong guys?</v>

1177
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.870
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1178
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong.</v>

1179
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Either money or gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're really intelligent and you're,</v>

1180
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:40.921
<v Speaker 1>you're really buying into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not saying you know that </v>

1181
00:57:40.921 --> 00:57:42.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not saying that there's no this not</v>

1182
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:47.520
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first one to say that I don't </v>

1183
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:47.520
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>

1184
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:51.030
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also the first one to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know either and anybody that </v>

1185
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:54.391
<v Speaker 1>pays any attention to religion or </v>
<v Speaker 1>follows religion at all and it looks at </v>

1186
00:57:54.391 --> 00:57:54.400
<v Speaker 1>the history of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows that it's a.</v>

1187
00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:59.850
<v Speaker 4>it's a disjointed mess and nobody even </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows the origins of all this stuff and </v>

1188
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:03.901
<v Speaker 4>nobody knows how much people altered the</v>
<v Speaker 4>words and what we do know about it is </v>

1189
00:58:03.901 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 4>that the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the Bible itself,</v>

1190
00:58:04.721 --> 00:58:09.721
<v Speaker 4>the oldest version of the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't even used the Dead Sea </v>

1191
00:58:09.721 --> 00:58:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Scrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the oldest version of the Bible </v>

1192
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:12.900
<v Speaker 4>by far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even.</v>

1193
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 4>They don't even use that when you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like the best one,</v>

1194
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't it as like the purest version </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it?</v>

1195
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Now we're still busy using the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>testament.</v>

1196
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:22.450
<v Speaker 4>The New Testament was created by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Constantine and a bunch of bishops.</v>

1197
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.580
<v Speaker 4>They piled it together and the Old </v>
<v Speaker 4>Testament.</v>

1198
00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Old Testament,</v>

1199
00:58:25.541 --> 00:58:30.541
<v Speaker 4>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real version of it was written in </v>

1200
00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:32.551
<v Speaker 4>ancient Hebrew and to this day in 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they only know three out of four words </v>

1201
00:58:32.551 --> 00:58:33.520
<v Speaker 4>in ancient Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's 20,</v>

1202
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:37.210
<v Speaker 4>25 percent of the words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't know what the fuck it means.</v>

1203
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.220
<v Speaker 4>And on top of that letters also double </v>
<v Speaker 4>those numbers back then because there,</v>

1204
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:44.410
<v Speaker 4>there was no numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the letter a was also like the number</v>

1205
00:58:44.411 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you did it that way.</v>

1206
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:51.330
<v Speaker 4>So there was a numerical value to words </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was completely lost when they </v>

1207
00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 4>translated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>translated,</v>

1208
00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:57.751
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient Hebrew to Latin and then to </v>

1209
00:58:57.751 --> 00:58:57.751
<v Speaker 4>Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

1210
00:58:57.751 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 4>like the word love and the word God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the same numerical value.</v>

1211
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.680
<v Speaker 4>So we don't even really knowing what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck they were saying.</v>

1212
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:05.740
<v Speaker 4>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that there is no god,</v>

1213
00:59:05.741 --> 00:59:10.741
<v Speaker 4>that there's not something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is the follow </v>

1214
00:59:10.741 --> 00:59:11.890
<v Speaker 4>current religion as it's practiced and </v>
<v Speaker 4>preached today,</v>

1215
00:59:11.891 --> 00:59:13.930
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

1216
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 4>So if Ron Paul's really into that,</v>

1217
00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.150
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big old queen.</v>

1218
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:23.840
<v Speaker 1>What is doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's Ron Paul,</v>

1219
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.940
<v Speaker 1>big old queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if he just came out and said he's a</v>

1220
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:27.420
<v Speaker 1>big old queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would still vote for him,</v>

1221
00:59:27.421 --> 00:59:28.880
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1222
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see if somebody's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to get in there and shake up the </v>

1223
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 1>system and change the way you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1224
00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is run and you know,</v>

1225
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:42.640
<v Speaker 1>keep us out of other countries and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>demolish the irs and get rid of the CIA.</v>

1226
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:48.161
<v Speaker 1>And that'd be fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating to see if someone can </v>

1227
00:59:48.161 --> 00:59:49.070
<v Speaker 1>actually do that and not get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that</v>

1228
00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:52.200
<v Speaker 2>good if it Kendall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>these books and so I don't know if you </v>

1233
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.690
<v Speaker 7>can do this with a candle or not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but with this one way you can just go to</v>

1234
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:10.190
<v Speaker 7>google and download all these free books</v>

<v Speaker 7>You can go and get that.</v>

<v Speaker 7>So you can get any book basically for </v>
<v Speaker 7>free.</v>

1241
01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.660
<v Speaker 7>Well not any book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but any other ones.</v>

01:00:25.661 --> 01:00:30.661
<v Speaker 7>I'm Google has like a ton of books,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're all like old school at a </v>

1243
01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:30.661
<v Speaker 7>print books.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it has to be out,</v>

1244
01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:35.300
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got the kindle and I couldn't get any </v>

1245
01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.021
<v Speaker 7>hunter s thompson books.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One book that he wrote that was for </v>

1246
01:00:37.021 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 7>sale,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they didn't have a great shark.</v>

1247
01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:42.380
<v Speaker 7>It didn't have to google.com</v>
<v Speaker 7>backslash books and see if they have it </v>

1248
01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:46.141
<v Speaker 7>there and he was downloaded.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it works on kindle </v>

1249
01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:46.141
<v Speaker 7>though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Probably a kindle reader.</v>

1250
01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:46.420
<v Speaker 7>PDF files.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It does,</v>

1251
01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:49.450
<v Speaker 7>but when it reads pdf files doesn't let </v>
<v Speaker 7>you enlarge the text,</v>

1252
01:00:49.451 --> 01:00:50.620
<v Speaker 7>which was annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1253
01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:51.460
<v Speaker 7>you can do that on the sign.</v>

1254
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the wrong one.</v>

1255
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.550
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't still better probably.</v>

1256
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.100
<v Speaker 7>And our question earlier when we were </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking,</v>

1257
01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>what about kitting poker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can these bots on poker sites?</v>

1258
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Poker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay who was a John Carlos Alvarado was </v>

1259
01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.841
<v Speaker 1>on the rubbing board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says poker sites catch bots with the </v>

1260
01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>program that can see if you click the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same pixel every time you make a move.</v>

1261
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Something that's impossible to do by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

1262
01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1263
01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:24.850
<v Speaker 7>I guess why you have the program go over</v>
<v Speaker 7>a couple of pixels.</v>

1268
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Did I really forget everything I learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the taekwondo days?</v>

1269
01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I still remember some type of window </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1270
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Some stuff talking window is effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see commonly leaves and a lot </v>

1271
01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>of taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used a lot of turn side kicks in </v>

1272
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>front lake side kicks and frontline </v>
<v Speaker 1>roundhouse kicks where it doesn't switch</v>

1273
01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1274
01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of power and that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1275
01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not complete in taekwondo needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

1276
01:01:58.911 --> 01:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>It needs more time wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you get to and all that stuff,</v>

1277
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some stuff in it that's </v>

1278
01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1279
01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew that that would work before.</v>

1281
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.320

<v Speaker 1>because no one was ever good at it.</v>

1282
01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:20.321
<v Speaker 1>That was good at other stuff as well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's sort of the same thing </v>

1283
01:02:20.321 --> 01:02:20.321

01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1379
01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:56.920
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that before.</v>

1380
01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:59.890
<v Speaker 1>There's things like video programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's it called,</v>

1381
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Predator or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had one,</v>

1382
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go through the Internet and search </v>

1383
01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:07.600
<v Speaker 1>for like al Qaeda for search for </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists,</v>

1384
01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>search for certain specific key words,</v>

1385
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>peak oil versus science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what man,</v>

1386
01:07:16.071 --> 01:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to figure out some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other shit besides oil.</v>

1387
01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

1388
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stuff they could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with agriculture.</v>

1389
01:07:23.841 --> 01:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff they can do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen.</v>

1390
01:07:25.581 --> 01:07:30.581
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just we could have come up with </v>

1391
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:33.941
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just we got bamboozled into going </v>

1392
01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:35.600
<v Speaker 1>the way the oil because it was easy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap and it was already in place and we</v>

1393
01:07:35.601 --> 01:07:37.310
<v Speaker 1>stayed with oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>

1394
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think society is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumble because we run out of oil.</v>

1395
01:07:40.251 --> 01:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll come up with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as good.</v>

1396
01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:45.790
<v Speaker 7>She heard those meal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a mini coopers in the cold.</v>

1397
01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:50.320
<v Speaker 7>They electric ones in cold weather and </v>
<v Speaker 7>only gets half the power.</v>

1398
01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:56.700
<v Speaker 7>How big is that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's ridiculous because they're only </v>

1399
01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:00.451
<v Speaker 7>good for like 100 miles as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So in cold weather it goes 50 slash 50 </v>

1400
01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:00.451
<v Speaker 7>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if that makes sense.</v>

1401
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.660
<v Speaker 7>Because your batteries more dead in cold</v>
<v Speaker 7>weather piece.</v>

1402
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:05.340
<v Speaker 7>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1403
01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:08.450
<v Speaker 7>but the amount of buying that car,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's an expensive car imagined.</v>

1404
01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.720
<v Speaker 7>You know what we top gear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you know that show?</v>

1405
01:08:10.721 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 7>Top gear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>BBC.</v>

1406
01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:17.071
<v Speaker 7>Awesome show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They took one of those Prius's and </v>

1407
01:08:17.071 --> 01:08:20.151
<v Speaker 7>electric car and they drove it around a </v>
<v Speaker 7>track with a presence.</v>

1408
01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:20.970
<v Speaker 7>A hybrid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

1409
01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:26.340
<v Speaker 7>They drove it around the track with an m</v>
<v Speaker 7>three and all the [inaudible] had to do </v>

1410
01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.930
<v Speaker 7>was keep up with the Prius.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's all it had to do.</v>

1411
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:33.110
<v Speaker 7>The preschool and went full blast or on </v>
<v Speaker 7>the track and the [inaudible] obviously </v>

1412
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.110
<v Speaker 7>much,</v>
<v Speaker 7>much faster car.</v>

1413
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:36.570
<v Speaker 7>All I gotta do is keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Prius got 13 miles to the gallon and</v>

1414
01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:41.060
<v Speaker 7>the [inaudible] got 19,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so when the Prius drives hard,</v>

1415
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:43.720
<v Speaker 7>it's just as much of a piece of shit as </v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1416
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.810
<v Speaker 7>any other car.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1417
01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:49.820
<v Speaker 7>it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like it's fake being green and it </v>

1418
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.590
<v Speaker 7>apparently it's much more toxic to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>environment to create a Prius as to how </v>

1419
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:57.040
<v Speaker 7>it worked is Prius is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>only uh,</v>

1420
01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:02.220
<v Speaker 7>our electric under 25 miles an hour or </v>
<v Speaker 7>something like that for stop and go </v>

1421
01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:02.220
<v Speaker 7>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1422
01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.460
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's running off battery over that.</v>

1423
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.330
<v Speaker 7>Just a normal car.</v>

1424
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.830
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>And over that as a normal car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>

1426
01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just a small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty,</v>

1427
01:09:11.311 --> 01:09:13.050
<v Speaker 1>terrible God damn piece of shit.</v>

1430
01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.080

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:41.520
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it,</v>

1524
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I've just pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it up on twitter if you bored and </v>

1525
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:49.170
<v Speaker 1>you want to read this thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>witchcraft,</v>

1526
01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.840
<v Speaker 1>watch the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really creepy.</v>

1527
01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:57.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a funny thing about witchcraft in </v>

1528
01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.271
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody knows about the Salem </v>

1529
01:14:59.271 --> 01:14:59.271
<v Speaker 1>witch trials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1530
01:14:59.271 --> 01:14:59.271
<v Speaker 1>what I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1531
01:14:59.271 --> 01:15:02.370
<v Speaker 1>the biggest connection they have to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened during them,</v>

1532
01:15:02.371 --> 01:15:07.371
<v Speaker 1>why everybody thought they were being </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed and there's witchcraft going </v>

1533
01:15:07.371 --> 01:15:10.131
<v Speaker 1>on was that there was a late frost and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the wheat got frozen and when it </v>

1534
01:15:11.551 --> 01:15:14.250
<v Speaker 1>sought out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently when that happens,</v>

1535
01:15:14.251 --> 01:15:17.490
<v Speaker 1>when there's a late frost and freezes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thaws out,</v>

1536
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:22.910
<v Speaker 1>it grows a certain fungus on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this certain fungus is called Ercot </v>

1537
01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.360
<v Speaker 1>in Ercot has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like really similar or identical </v>

1538
01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.681
<v Speaker 1>rather chemically to lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they would take this bread that </v>

1539
01:15:33.681 --> 01:15:36.750
<v Speaker 1>they would make from this wheat that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown this fungus on it,</v>

1540
01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:39.090
<v Speaker 1>these people would fucking trip their </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls off.</v>

1541
01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:42.450
<v Speaker 1>They would have these crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrifying bad acid trip.</v>

1542
01:15:42.451 --> 01:15:44.940
<v Speaker 1>So they literally fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were under a spell,</v>

1543
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:48.930
<v Speaker 1>which totally makes sense and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>started burning bitches.</v>

1544
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.230
<v Speaker 1>And women always want to say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1545
01:15:52.231 --> 01:15:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1546
01:15:52.861 --> 01:15:54.360
<v Speaker 1>men were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1547
01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:55.660
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1548
01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:56.610
<v Speaker 1>men were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1549
01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spell that a woman would cast upon </v>

1550
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.921
<v Speaker 1>her upon him with her beauty was just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>perplexing and the men couldn't deal </v>

1551
01:16:03.921 --> 01:16:05.880
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that women had all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>powers that killed him.</v>

1552
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

1553
01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.380
<v Speaker 1>guys have been raping chicks forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tell him,</v>

1554
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:12.210
<v Speaker 1>got to stop back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's,</v>

1555
01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.030
<v Speaker 1>this is not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This not that perplexing.</v>

1556
01:16:15.031 --> 01:16:16.890
<v Speaker 1>It's guys want to shoot a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shoot a load,</v>

1557
01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy's wants you to load the jerk off.</v>

1558
01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:21.510
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to shoot a load anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1559
01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.300
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to start burying </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because they want to fuck them.</v>

1560
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a much more likely scenario</v>

1561
01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:33.501
<v Speaker 1>that this fungus grew on this wheat </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had already taken soil </v>

1562
01:16:33.501 --> 01:16:36.330
<v Speaker 1>samples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they had known from there,</v>

1563
01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:41.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever climatological studies that </v>

1564
01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:41.930
<v Speaker 1>they use to figure out how cold it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>during a specific time.</v>

1565
01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.100
<v Speaker 1>There was a late frost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some evidence that there was a</v>

1566
01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:46.420
<v Speaker 1>late frost and then this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1567
01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:50.670
<v Speaker 1>or God was also found somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this time period.</v>

1568
01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.880
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's just speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's much more educated speculation </v>

1569
01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.800
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that the men were under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spell of these women and they decided to</v>

1570
01:16:58.801 --> 01:17:00.810
<v Speaker 1>kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1571
01:17:02.190 --> 01:17:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably did the acid from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheat and then killed the cons.</v>

1572
01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:07.080
<v Speaker 1>That's probably what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1573
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:12.110
<v Speaker 1>that's why I was a witch trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were probably the context in the </v>

1574
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.110
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

1575
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 4>If I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's cut these major bitches.</v>

1576
01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:14.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like these chicks are bad energy.</v>

1577
01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 4>Like you'd be around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1578
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.040
<v Speaker 4>fucking pitches given me bad vibes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1579
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:23.050
<v Speaker 4>because you're all acid now and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably just started lighting them on </v>

1580
01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:23.050
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1581
01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:23.050
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's kill this bitch.</v>

1582
01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:25.210
<v Speaker 4>Why are we having are around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if that's really.</v>

1583
01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 4>The witch trials were out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe like afterwards,</v>

1584
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 4>people were so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They killed all the cuts off.</v>

1585
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that.</v>

1586
01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:36.990
<v Speaker 4>Is that possible ladies and gentlemen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

1587
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Little Fuck is calling me during my God </v>
<v Speaker 4>damn podcast,</v>

1588
01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.280
<v Speaker 4>Tait Fletcher.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Bitch.</v>

1590
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:45.380
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>

1591
01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:48.120
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to the question.</v>

1592
01:17:48.121 --> 01:17:48.750
<v Speaker 2>So a gentleman.</v>

1593
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.440
<v Speaker 4>Have I ever seen the northern lights in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Iceland?</v>

1594
01:17:52.441 --> 01:17:53.940
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen him in purpose.</v>

1595
01:17:53.941 --> 01:17:54.630
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

1596
01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:57.030
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some shit online though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks incredible.</v>

1597
01:17:57.210 --> 01:18:00.060
<v Speaker 4>It's like the sky becomes like a desktop</v>
<v Speaker 4>screensaver.</v>

1598
01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:03.540
<v Speaker 4>I've been seeing way more falling stars </v>
<v Speaker 4>lately.</v>

1599
01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.540
<v Speaker 4>Like it's almost getting to the point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's kind of ridiculous.</v>

1600
01:18:06.541 --> 01:18:09.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's maybe a deer coming once a week.</v>

1601
01:18:09.391 --> 01:18:11.070
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see it at least one.</v>

1602
01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:14.010
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if we know for me it </v>
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>

1603
01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:19.040
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem like it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said and talk about like </v>

1604
01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.250
<v Speaker 4>asteroid impacts over the asteroid that </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed the dinosaurs 65 million years </v>

1605
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:23.970
<v Speaker 4>ago or the one that killed you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything before that.</v>

1606
01:18:23.971 --> 01:18:26.640
<v Speaker 4>The mass extinction before that 250 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million years ago,</v>

1607
01:18:26.641 --> 01:18:31.641
<v Speaker 4>or the one that ended the Ice Age 10,500</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago when there's all this </v>

1608
01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:35.511
<v Speaker 4>speculation about asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the real reality is there are </v>

1609
01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:40.380
<v Speaker 4>gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands of gigantic rocks </v>

1610
01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:43.700
<v Speaker 4>in space that can fuck us up and every </v>
<v Speaker 4>now and then one comes crashing down.</v>

1611
01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:46.860
<v Speaker 4>It's happened many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

1612
01:18:46.861 --> 01:18:47.700
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

1613
01:18:47.701 --> 01:18:51.270
<v Speaker 4>many times over the history of the life </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the earth.</v>

1614
01:18:51.271 --> 01:18:55.140
<v Speaker 4>It's happened so many times and it could</v>
<v Speaker 4>easily happen today.</v>

1615
01:18:55.410 --> 01:19:00.410
<v Speaker 4>It could easily happen tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can easily one that comes from </v>

1616
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:02.390
<v Speaker 4>behind the sun and we can't see it until</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too late and there,</v>

1617
01:19:02.391 --> 01:19:07.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just fucks the whole world up.</v>

1618
01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.560
<v Speaker 4>That's so possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't like to think it's possible </v>

1619
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Speaker 4>because it's never happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I always like to see.</v>

1620
01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:17.610
<v Speaker 4>I always say it's like an ant hill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that human life is like an ant hill.</v>

1621
01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.160
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1622
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.000
<v Speaker 4>are an aunt and you're living in an ant </v>
<v Speaker 4>hill,</v>

1623
01:19:21.001 --> 01:19:24.620
<v Speaker 4>you were probably born in that ant hill </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that hill is all you've ever known.</v>

1624
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.490
<v Speaker 4>How long to answer live?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a week,</v>

1625
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:28.050
<v Speaker 4>couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

1626
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:30.510
<v Speaker 4>so say like the sand hill has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>around for six months.</v>

1627
01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:33.240
<v Speaker 4>That's been through the generations </v>
<v Speaker 4>after generations,</v>

1628
01:19:33.241 --> 01:19:38.241
<v Speaker 4>long dead have made this ant hill and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you know your toilet away and your </v>

1629
01:19:38.241 --> 01:19:43.191
<v Speaker 4>little ant hill and one day some kid is </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking through the field and he sees </v>

1630
01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:43.191
<v Speaker 4>that anthill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just boom,</v>

1631
01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:45.240
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She starts to stomp on it for no fucking</v>

1632
01:19:45.241 --> 01:19:47.430
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you're ant hills crushed out of</v>

1633
01:19:47.431 --> 01:19:52.431
<v Speaker 4>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never thought it was going to </v>

1634
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:52.431
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always been fine.</v>

1635
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:52.431
<v Speaker 4>Everything's always been cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the end hill,</v>

1636
01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:55.260
<v Speaker 4>if you had a take a gas and you had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a gamble,</v>

1637
01:19:55.261 --> 01:19:55.940
<v Speaker 4>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1638
01:19:55.941 --> 01:20:00.941
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and that was always going to be </v>

1639
01:20:00.941 --> 01:20:00.941
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always been here.</v>

1640
01:20:00.941 --> 01:20:00.941
<v Speaker 4>Always will be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

1641
01:20:00.941 --> 01:20:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Some kid just stomped the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1642
01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.140
<v Speaker 4>That can happen to people that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to Earth.</v>

1643
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Katrina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Katrina,</v>

1644
01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.690
<v Speaker 4>how about Detroit?</v>

1645
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who has a magnifying glass on </v>

1646
01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Detroit,</v>

1647
01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I watched Anthony Bordain had a show </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Michigan the other night and he </v>

1648
01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:17.600
<v Speaker 1>was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were driving through horrible,</v>

1649
01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.730
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

1650
01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:22.050
<v Speaker 1>You ever wants that Anthony Bourdain </v>
<v Speaker 1>show?</v>

1651
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Good show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you hungry.</v>

1652
01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.540
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the food show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No reservations.</v>

1653
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Fucking shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me so hungry.</v>

1654
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo says there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid with the possibility of hitting</v>

1655
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:38.730
<v Speaker 1>earth in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>29.</v>

1656
01:20:39.150 --> 01:20:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

1657
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know about.</v>

1658
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:45.750
<v Speaker 1>They come to the problem as the skies </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1659
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:48.600
<v Speaker 1>God Damn big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's covering everywhere.</v>

1660
01:20:48.601 --> 01:20:53.601
<v Speaker 1>Shit's coming from the North Pole and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the South Pole and you never know where </v>

1661
01:20:53.601 --> 01:20:57.321
<v Speaker 1>something's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could be coming from anywhere </v>

1662
01:20:57.321 --> 01:20:57.321
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

1663
01:20:57.321 --> 01:21:02.120
<v Speaker 1>There could be something heading our way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we haven't picked up on could be </v>

1664
01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:02.490
<v Speaker 1>behind something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't see it.</v>

1665
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Gravity distorts our view of things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1666
01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can literally look at it.</v>

1667
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Some of the telescope you could see </v>
<v Speaker 1>things behind the sun because of the </v>

1668
01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.610
<v Speaker 1>distortion and the gravity of the sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so massive.</v>

1669
01:21:14.611 --> 01:21:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that apparently is how,</v>

1670
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:22.430
<v Speaker 1>how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's occasionally things that </v>

1671
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.920
<v Speaker 1>could be hiding behind something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming straight at us.</v>

1672
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:24.720
<v Speaker 1>We don't even fucking see it until it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>too late,</v>

1673
01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:27.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just not enough human beings out</v>

1674
01:21:27.601 --> 01:21:30.510
<v Speaker 1>there monitoring the sky to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately predict,</v>

1675
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:31.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1676
01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:34.410
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are 100 percent clear skies.</v>

1677
01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's gonna hit us for the next 200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1678
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.790
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't say that.</v>

1679
01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.710
<v Speaker 1>There's always something that comes real</v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

1680
01:21:40.711 --> 01:21:42.390
<v Speaker 1>They just barely misses us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1681
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1682
01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I was three miles long and it missed us </v>
<v Speaker 1>by 200,000</v>

1683
01:21:46.681 --> 01:21:47.640
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not much,</v>

1684
01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:47.970
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1685
01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to some questions.</v>

1686
01:21:57.671 --> 01:21:58.600
<v Speaker 1>You dirty bitches,</v>

1687
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Nabisco in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as the antichrist.</v>

1688
01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people think you're set of 2012 </v>

1689
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.410
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1690
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Horrendously bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really bad.</v>

1691
01:22:10.821 --> 01:22:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Not even worth even a special effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucked.</v>

1692
01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were there.</v>

1693
01:22:14.241 --> 01:22:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>

1694
01:22:15.081 --> 01:22:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Things were happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't look real.</v>

1695
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Like the car is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a limo and jumping things and </v>

1696
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:23.620
<v Speaker 1>landing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Driving off and it looked a little talk,</v>

1697
01:22:23.621 --> 01:22:28.250
<v Speaker 1>computer generated and silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like every five seconds,</v>

1698
01:22:28.251 --> 01:22:29.260
<v Speaker 1>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1699
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:32.510
<v Speaker 1>the car was almost going off the cliff </v>
<v Speaker 1>but barely made it.</v>

1700
01:22:32.511 --> 01:22:33.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1701
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:34.520
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

1702
01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Stop with your nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy here,</v>

1703
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:50.980
<v Speaker 1>easy dog down below seven says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1704
01:22:50.981 --> 01:22:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did everything originate?</v>

1705
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.940
<v Speaker 1>But how did God start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1706
01:22:57.941 --> 01:23:02.941
<v Speaker 1>that's an easy question to answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

1707
01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:05.240
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1708
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:10.910
<v Speaker 4>were you there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real problem is believing in </v>

1709
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:11.550
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1710
01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:12.940
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the real problem.</v>

1711
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.380
<v Speaker 4>The real problem is believing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1712
01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:16.430
<v Speaker 4>It's not believing in God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in God.</v>

1713
01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.850
<v Speaker 4>The real problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believing in anything you don't know.</v>

1714
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.600
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God created a really good video game and</v>

1715
01:23:22.601 --> 01:23:27.601
<v Speaker 4>we're all in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's possible that this is God's </v>

1716
01:23:27.601 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 4>version of the sims and this is on </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebodies phone.</v>

1717
01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:32.440
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not even like a good video game.</v>

1718
01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:37.441
<v Speaker 4>We're just like a fucking cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>video shoot that people play when they </v>

1719
01:23:37.441 --> 01:23:41.221
<v Speaker 4>kill time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>waiting in line at the right rear break </v>

1720
01:23:41.221 --> 01:23:41.221
<v Speaker 4>break earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's God.</v>

1721
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:46.710
<v Speaker 4>The real problem with believing in God </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that believing in God just makes </v>

1722
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:46.710
<v Speaker 4>people feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1723
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:49.030
<v Speaker 4>it's not saying that God doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible that God exists,</v>

1724
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:53.590
<v Speaker 4>but you you don't have the information </v>
<v Speaker 4>no one does.</v>

1725
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:56.950
<v Speaker 4>You can decide that you have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>information because it empowers you.</v>

1726
01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:02.220
<v Speaker 4>You can decide that there's a god </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it makes you feel more </v>

1727
01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:05.491
<v Speaker 4>comfortable or makes you feel more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that there's a future to this </v>

1728
01:24:05.491 --> 01:24:09.931
<v Speaker 4>world and after you die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something waiting for you and </v>

1729
01:24:09.931 --> 01:24:10.450
<v Speaker 4>that gives you confidence and that gives</v>
<v Speaker 4>you that it can empower you,</v>

1730
01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.660
<v Speaker 4>and that works for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of fighters who are very </v>

1731
01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:18.130
<v Speaker 4>religious and that that belief in God </v>
<v Speaker 4>that actually empowers them and it can.</v>

1732
01:24:18.131 --> 01:24:20.920
<v Speaker 4>It can work that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it really is just a tool.</v>

1733
01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:25.980
<v Speaker 4>It's just a psychological tool that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're using to empower them and it </v>

1734
01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:29.780
<v Speaker 4>doesn't necessarily help them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What helps them is the state of mind </v>

1735
01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:31.390
<v Speaker 4>that they put themselves in by believing</v>
<v Speaker 4>in God.</v>

1736
01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a really kind of a funny thing.</v>

1737
01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.090
<v Speaker 4>It's a catch 22.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Believing in God can empower you.</v>

1738
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.120
<v Speaker 4>The ideas of Christianity are very </v>
<v Speaker 4>empowering ideas,</v>

1739
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 4>the ideas that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>

1740
01:24:42.401 --> 01:24:44.800
<v Speaker 4>love your man as if he sees you and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1741
01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:48.110
<v Speaker 4>do unto others as if you would have them</v>
<v Speaker 4>do unto yourself and you know,</v>

1742
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:50.920
<v Speaker 4>turn the other cheek and don't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>violent and be helping.</v>

1743
01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:55.450
<v Speaker 4>Be Loving and be humble and worship God </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the idea of God.</v>

1744
01:24:55.451 --> 01:25:00.451
<v Speaker 4>What God is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God is life and energy and the whole </v>

1745
01:25:00.451 --> 01:25:04.111
<v Speaker 4>universe and that you treat the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>process as it's one gigantic fantastic </v>

1746
01:25:04.241 --> 01:25:06.400
<v Speaker 4>thing and that in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1747
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:10.660
<v Speaker 4>in going to a religious service and in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in practicing,</v>

1748
01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.870
<v Speaker 4>you know any sort of a religion in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1749
01:25:12.871 --> 01:25:17.871
<v Speaker 4>in like sticking to a certain ethic that</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is committing to </v>

1750
01:25:17.871 --> 01:25:21.631
<v Speaker 4>positive energy and if you commit to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that positive energy and then those </v>

1751
01:25:21.631 --> 01:25:23.410
<v Speaker 4>positive thoughts and positive way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

1752
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.170
<v Speaker 4>that's empowering and that really will </v>
<v Speaker 4>help you.</v>

1753
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:31.350
<v Speaker 4>And if you really do believe that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a destiny and that God has carved </v>

1754
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:33.130
<v Speaker 4>out this destiny for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an empowering thing.</v>

1755
01:25:33.131 --> 01:25:38.131
<v Speaker 4>That shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit will absolutely make you </v>

1756
01:25:38.131 --> 01:25:38.410
<v Speaker 4>better things you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's evidence of God.</v>

1757
01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:40.690
<v Speaker 4>That's evidence that Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe,</v>

1758
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:45.870
<v Speaker 4>but more likely it's evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've put yourself in the exact proper </v>

1759
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:50.131
<v Speaker 4>state of mind to achieve things by </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking positive and having positive </v>

1760
01:25:50.131 --> 01:25:52.810
<v Speaker 4>energy and being a loving Christian by </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing all those things.</v>

1761
01:25:52.811 --> 01:25:57.160
<v Speaker 4>You've put the good energy out there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've given yourself confidence because</v>

1762
01:25:57.161 --> 01:26:02.161
<v Speaker 4>you're doing the right thing and you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>given yourself a strong belief in </v>

1763
01:26:02.161 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 4>yourself because you're following the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right path and in doing that,</v>

1764
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.860
<v Speaker 4>that's very empowering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how God is real.</v>

1765
01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:10.340
<v Speaker 4>That's how religion is real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it what it really all is at the</v>

1766
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:15.341
<v Speaker 4>heart of it is you tuning in to the the </v>
<v Speaker 4>correct frequency of the universe with </v>

1767
01:26:15.341 --> 01:26:19.961
<v Speaker 4>the least amount of resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the least amount of Latin amount of </v>

1768
01:26:19.961 --> 01:26:20.600
<v Speaker 4>resistance from you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The least amount of negative thinking,</v>

1769
01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:23.540
<v Speaker 4>the least amount of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I was a kid,</v>

1770
01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:28.541
<v Speaker 4>I'd get in arguments all the time with </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody about anything and really I </v>

1771
01:26:29.271 --> 01:26:31.550
<v Speaker 4>was just a knucklehead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just a dumb fuck,</v>

1772
01:26:31.551 --> 01:26:36.551
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't realize that by doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by creating all this drama in my life </v>

1773
01:26:36.551 --> 01:26:41.320
<v Speaker 4>like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just distracting the shit out of </v>

1774
01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Speaker 4>me and it was keeping me from doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I wanted to do.</v>

1775
01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:47.800
<v Speaker 4>He was keeping me from being happy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable and friendly and it was </v>

1776
01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.341
<v Speaker 4>keeping me from like I was constantly in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a state of causing trouble and causing </v>

1777
01:26:51.381 --> 01:26:56.381
<v Speaker 4>drama and creating all these obstacles </v>
<v Speaker 4>in my own life and I didn't realize it </v>

1778
01:26:56.381 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 4>at the time and I always thought of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that were religious.</v>

1779
01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:01.520
<v Speaker 4>Like I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's got to be a lot of power in</v>

1780
01:27:01.521 --> 01:27:06.521
<v Speaker 4>that because like I was afraid of a dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a religious who was on one of </v>

1781
01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:08.840
<v Speaker 4>the USAA taekwondo teens back when I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

1782
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 4>There was this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think his name was Bobby Clayton and I</v>

1783
01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:15.950
<v Speaker 4>think that's his name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't the best guy,</v>

1784
01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:19.130
<v Speaker 4>but he was crazy religious and that used</v>
<v Speaker 4>to scare the shit out of me.</v>

1785
01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.660
<v Speaker 4>This dude used to read the Bible every </v>
<v Speaker 4>day and this dude was like super,</v>

1786
01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:28.661
<v Speaker 4>super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super religious and he really believed </v>

1787
01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:28.661
<v Speaker 4>that himself and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1788
01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:32.410
<v Speaker 4>not very religious and even though I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing really well in these tournaments </v>

1789
01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:32.410
<v Speaker 4>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1790
01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:36.850
<v Speaker 4>beating a lot of really good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was something about this dude and </v>

1791
01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:37.730
<v Speaker 4>his religion that scared me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like on paper,</v>

1792
01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:39.410
<v Speaker 4>he shouldn't have been the scariest guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

1793
01:27:39.411 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 4>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

1794
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:44.280
<v Speaker 4>because this dude was really religious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for you know,</v>

1795
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:49.570
<v Speaker 4>that that belief that he had in himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the belief in his faith and his </v>

1796
01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:51.690
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that shit was,</v>

1797
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.840
<v Speaker 4>is empowering to him and I recognized </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was empowering to him that he </v>

1798
01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:56.840
<v Speaker 4>was really legit about it.</v>

1799
01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.060
<v Speaker 4>And then he was his super religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

1800
01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.060
<v Speaker 4>Like he was never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never swore he didn't drink,</v>

1801
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:04.940
<v Speaker 4>he was friendly to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like really,</v>

1802
01:28:04.941 --> 01:28:07.870
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really dedicated and that was,</v>

1803
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.470
<v Speaker 4>that made me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think religion is empowering.</v>

1804
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.800
<v Speaker 4>Brian has been a huge advocate of </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientology ever since he moved to Ohio.</v>

1805
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:19.270
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1806
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:21.670
<v Speaker 7>Tell us about your experiences with </v>
<v Speaker 7>scientology.</v>

1807
01:28:23.170 --> 01:28:24.710
<v Speaker 7>They're sluts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're easy,</v>

1808
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:30.110
<v Speaker 7>they're real easy to sleep with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just have to trick them in a lot of </v>

1809
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:32.410
<v Speaker 7>positive energy and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1810
01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.370
<v Speaker 7>and you just take their money and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>sleep with you.</v>

1811
01:28:34.371 --> 01:28:36.490
<v Speaker 7>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you hear that?</v>

1812
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:40.630
<v Speaker 7>Is the scientology how a thing with </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking are a lot of fun?</v>

1813
01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:43.720
<v Speaker 7>I all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1814
01:28:43.721 --> 01:28:46.480
<v Speaker 7>you don't definitely married or anything</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then I don't think so.</v>

1815
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:48.580
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When any new religion comes around,</v>

1816
01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:51.610
<v Speaker 7>you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying he's lying.</v>

1817
01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:57.610
<v Speaker 7>I think if I had to pick one religion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like if you had to do it,</v>

1818
01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:57.850
<v Speaker 7>I'd</v>

1819
01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.280
<v Speaker 4>be Buddhist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1820
01:29:00.281 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 4>that seems like the one that makes</v>

1821
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.710
<v Speaker 1>the most sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with being a Buddhist is</v>

1822
01:29:04.711 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 1>you've got to hang around with a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fucking.</v>

1823
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:09.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a bunch of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be Buddhists,</v>

1824
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:11.460
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:29:11.461 --> 01:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>They always smelly feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's like the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippies.</v>

1827
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:19.830
<v Speaker 1>It's all good on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem with hippies is,</v>

1828
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to work.</v>

1829
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking lazy and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them.</v>

1830
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1831
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:27.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like the stereotypes of the pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

1832
01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1833
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 1>a Ne'er do wells.</v>

<v Speaker 3>two years and now there's a band called</v>

2067
01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:33.250
<v Speaker 1>mail or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their clothes will come up with a name </v>

2068
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:36.901
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically a interviewing </v>

2069
01:43:36.901 --> 01:43:36.901
<v Speaker 1>comedians about the creative process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2070
01:43:36.901 --> 01:43:41.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also enter in the middle of a </v>

2071
01:43:41.551 --> 01:43:44.970
<v Speaker 1>coming up with another show that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's comedy related to I can't talk </v>

2072
01:43:45.611 --> 01:43:47.080
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it should be fun.</v>

2073
01:43:47.410 --> 01:43:50.170
<v Speaker 1>That and just more shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more comedy,</v>

2074
01:43:50.770 --> 01:43:52.270
<v Speaker 1>more good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is fear factor</v>

2075
01:43:52.290 --> 01:43:53.590
<v Speaker 7>returning anytime?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2076
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:57.320
<v Speaker 7>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know there was a rumor that.</v>

2077
01:43:57.321 --> 01:43:58.660
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

2078
01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:01.190
<v Speaker 7>there was a rumor for a while they were </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to try to bring fear factor back.</v>

2079
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:02.990
<v Speaker 7>This fear factor when they canceled it </v>
<v Speaker 7>was like,</v>

2080
01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:05.440
<v Speaker 7>it was kinda like they could have kept </v>
<v Speaker 7>going if they really want.</v>

2081
01:44:05.670 --> 01:44:07.190
<v Speaker 7>That's a show that could come back </v>
<v Speaker 7>easily,</v>

2082
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:11.780
<v Speaker 7>do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you did it without me didn't have</v>

2083
01:44:11.781 --> 01:44:16.781
<v Speaker 7>the flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure it would probably be great if </v>

2084
01:44:16.781 --> 01:44:16.781
<v Speaker 7>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like Mario Lopez.</v>

2085
01:44:16.781 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't pass up on that easy money.</v>

2086
01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.400
<v Speaker 7>Especially if you're working with all </v>
<v Speaker 7>the same people again and stuff.</v>

2087
01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:26.150
<v Speaker 7>I might be willing to</v>

2088
01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.940
<v Speaker 1>just for my kids just put money away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your movie coming on?</v>

2089
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>

2090
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>

2091
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Should I move to Colorado?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved Colorado Man sideshow.</v>

2092
01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Sit said should I move to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking loved it.</v>

2093
01:44:40.170 --> 01:44:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I would still be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mind the cold.</v>

2094
01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I liked the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the sky.</v>

2095
01:44:45.061 --> 01:44:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I like the way the fucking mountains </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked.</v>

2096
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I liked the vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked everything about it.</v>

2097
01:44:50.491 --> 01:44:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I liked it for me creatively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked living in Colorado,</v>

2098
01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:58.140
<v Speaker 1>but when you have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have children,</v>

2099
01:44:58.141 --> 01:45:03.141
<v Speaker 1>you have a wife and it's not as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as easy as just me being by </v>

2100
01:45:03.141 --> 01:45:03.141
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2101
01:45:03.141 --> 01:45:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it was just me by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably still be there.</v>

2102
01:45:04.951 --> 01:45:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I still be on the top of that mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was not into it.</v>

2103
01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:11.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just too creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When our dog got eaten,</v>

2104
01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.200
<v Speaker 1>our dog had eaten by mountain line.</v>

2105
01:45:15.210 --> 01:45:17.730
<v Speaker 1>That's not like a rumor that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

2106
01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Dog had eaten by mountain lions and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's bad driving in snow.</v>

2107
01:45:21.901 --> 01:45:24.810
<v Speaker 1>She crashed the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a couple of different things.</v>

2108
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:29.990
<v Speaker 1>And then she got pregnant and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy was the biggest reason why we </v>

2109
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.130
<v Speaker 1>had to move out of Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was because we were living over 8,000</v>

2110
01:45:32.131 --> 01:45:34.770
<v Speaker 1>feet above sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hot.</v>

2111
01:45:34.771 --> 01:45:37.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are 3000 feet above boulder and it is</v>

2112
01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:42.780
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really high altitude and when you're </v>

2113
01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:42.780
<v Speaker 1>pregnant it's just brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

2114
01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:45.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unhealthy for you and for the baby.</v>

2115
01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Colorado is like one of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>states in the country that one of the </v>

2116
01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:54.981
<v Speaker 1>top states in the country when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to premature births and a lot of it is </v>

2117
01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:55.830
<v Speaker 1>because the altitude just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get enough air up there.</v>

2118
01:45:55.890 --> 01:45:57.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great for your conditioning,</v>

2119
01:45:57.481 --> 01:46:02.481
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so good for from being a pregnant </v>

2120
01:46:02.481 --> 01:46:02.481
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

2121
01:46:02.481 --> 01:46:04.560
<v Speaker 1>So all those factors I had to move out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Colorado,</v>

2122
01:46:04.561 --> 01:46:07.810
<v Speaker 1>but if I could just be somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>live somewhere live in Colorado.</v>

2123
01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a heartbeat.</v>

2124
01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:12.210
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't have to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in Colorado and you know,</v>

2125
01:46:12.211 --> 01:46:14.580
<v Speaker 1>deal with snow when it comes to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking snowed in.</v>

2126
01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.560
<v Speaker 1>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's supposed to be like.</v>

2127
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.800
<v Speaker 1>A problem with me is I travel all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time so I would leave my wife and leave </v>

2128
01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the kids there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same by myself.</v>

2129
01:46:24.451 --> 01:46:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I'd have no problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

2130
01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:28.980
<v Speaker 1>So if you are going to move somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stay there,</v>

2131
01:46:28.981 --> 01:46:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I would say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado's fucking bad ass.</v>

2132
01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:36.650
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there will be a time when </v>

2133
01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:38.490
<v Speaker 1>all handheld access will have a pipe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

2134
01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Like the Tomahawk Tomahawks where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a pipe and an ax all in one.</v>

2135
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's true,</v>

2136
01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:53.930
<v Speaker 1>the Indians were bad motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that did just went to a </v>

2137
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:57.290
<v Speaker 1>renaissance festival getting carried </v>
<v Speaker 1>away because I mean if you think about,</v>

2138
01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:58.950
<v Speaker 1>if it was a pipe also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2139
01:46:58.951 --> 01:47:00.630
<v Speaker 1>this is the beauty of the Internet right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2140
01:47:00.631 --> 01:47:03.300
<v Speaker 1>We'll google this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did Tomahawks have pipes on?</v>

2141
01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I think there might've been a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>that did,</v>

2142
01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think the majority of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I speculate.</v>

2143
01:47:07.741 --> 01:47:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2144
01:47:08.871 --> 01:47:13.871
<v Speaker 1>I just doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it would just make that </v>

2145
01:47:13.871 --> 01:47:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the weapon weaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a hole through the middle of it.</v>

2146
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2147
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:20.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's enough.</v>

2148
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hype,</v>

2149
01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Tomahawk.</v>

2150
01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:29.980
<v Speaker 2>That's a pipe axes.</v>

2151
01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:33.490
<v Speaker 1>The crazy crow trading post.</v>

2152
01:47:33.710 --> 01:47:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Show me a pipe backs these pipes</v>

2153
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:44.470
<v Speaker 1>pipe historically accurate pipe axes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have spent years researching and </v>

2154
01:47:44.511 --> 01:47:48.200
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing the finest line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing Tomahawks pipe,</v>

2155
01:47:48.201 --> 01:47:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Tomahawks belt and camp ax is available </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2156
01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Did you even know there was a market for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of Shit?</v>

2157
01:47:55.190 --> 01:47:56.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the beautiful thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

2158
01:47:57.130 --> 01:47:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what this thing looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the pipe part.</v>

2159
01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Where's the pipe part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hand drill for smoking.</v>

2160
01:48:05.711 --> 01:48:10.711
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like anytime forge iron had </v>

2161
01:48:10.711 --> 01:48:13.280
<v Speaker 1>drilled for smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically the pipe is this.</v>

2162
01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:18.460
<v Speaker 1>You put some tobacco up in that bitch </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there and you smoke right out of </v>

2163
01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:18.460

<v Speaker 1>Weaker definitely would.</v>

2167
01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this seems like it's like really </v>

2181
01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:02.400
<v Speaker 2>That's added to the basket.</v>

2182
01:49:03.230 --> 01:49:04.540
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to check out now.</v>

2183
01:49:04.541 --> 01:49:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll check it out later because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want you guys to get bummed out at me.</v>

2184
01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:12.580
<v Speaker 1>It was boring enough looking for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet tree coming up on two hours.</v>

2185
01:49:12.581 --> 01:49:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Which would make this two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>

2186
01:49:14.610 --> 01:49:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Why are you getting bored anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2187
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I just think we to keep it to you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do another video.</v>

2188
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Someone doesn't think it's fun anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>

2189
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back.</v>

2190
01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred 71.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuckers in here.</v>

2191
01:49:27.901 --> 01:49:30.270
<v Speaker 1>We lost a lot of people for being really</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring.</v>

2192
01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Madison to I think is just about right.</v>

2193
01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.070
<v Speaker 1>You want them wanting more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not less.</v>

2194
01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Is that what we want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2195
01:49:41.150 --> 01:49:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan.</v>

2196
01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:45.290
<v Speaker 1>He correct two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the.</v>

2197
01:49:45.291 --> 01:49:50.291
<v Speaker 1>Where's the time on top left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they're getting light is right </v>

2198
01:49:50.291 --> 01:49:53.420
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think after two hours also it doesn't </v>

2199
01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:58.150
<v Speaker 1>save maybe or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as people start hating this bug,</v>

2200
01:49:58.190 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 1>it's got nothing to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boring as shit.</v>

2201
01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:05.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far we've answered questions.</v>

2202
01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:10.180
<v Speaker 1>We put photos up on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about some heavy subjects.</v>

2203
01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Would more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you need that?</v>

2204
01:50:12.641 --> 01:50:17.641
<v Speaker 1>He's in gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all living in an alien's petri </v>

2205
01:50:17.641 --> 01:50:20.230
<v Speaker 1>dish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says Dawkins 20 maybe,</v>

2206
01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you know as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is time illusion shred for 31.</v>

2207
01:50:26.801 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Wants to know if time's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's an illusion.</v>

2208
01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:31.630
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think time is just one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2209
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:34.370
<v Speaker 1>You tell that the David Copperfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's.</v>

2210
01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I think time is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2211
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean we already know that time changes</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go fast.</v>

2212
01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone's in a super fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceship,</v>

2213
01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:47.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2214
01:50:47.681 --> 01:50:52.681
<v Speaker 1>and they go at the speed of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like time goes by much quicker on earth </v>

2215
01:50:52.681 --> 01:50:56.341
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't in their plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they come back and they're super </v>

2216
01:50:56.341 --> 01:50:56.341
<v Speaker 1>fast spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2217
01:50:56.341 --> 01:51:01.260
<v Speaker 1>for them it's only been a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for us it could be like 100 years </v>

2218
01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:03.751
<v Speaker 1>depending on how far and fast they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So time lose in a way that I don't,</v>

2219
01:51:03.850 --> 01:51:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the way we look at </v>

2220
01:51:08.850 --> 01:51:09.340
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's as cut and dry.</v>

2221
01:51:09.341 --> 01:51:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2222
01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:13.100
<v Speaker 1>this is midnight and this is 1:00.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2223
01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:19.440
<v Speaker 1>it's much more dependent upon the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the human beings and like the </v>

2224
01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.160
<v Speaker 1>frequency of the persons in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the person's living,</v>

2225
01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:21.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>

2226
01:51:21.930 --> 01:51:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you're living on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2227
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:28.500
<v Speaker 1>this dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that there's the time varies </v>

2228
01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.130
<v Speaker 1>throughout other dimensions and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>access those dimensions.</v>

2229
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they really do come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ships that can fly through space at </v>

2230
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:39.000
<v Speaker 1>closest speed of light or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really will be able to go to a </v>

2231
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.060
<v Speaker 1>place where they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're literally going forward in time.</v>

2232
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:45.870
<v Speaker 1>They'll have lived one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come back to earth and hundreds of </v>

2233
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 1>years have gone by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just nutty shit.</v>

2234
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2235
01:51:47.170 --> 01:51:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we understand time enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Tom is one of those things that </v>

2236
01:51:52.170 --> 01:51:52.990
<v Speaker 1>we think we've got a grip I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is,</v>

2237
01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:56.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably far more complex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing and variable than we think</v>

2238
01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:02.080
<v Speaker 5>I didn't use to get rid of daylight </v>
<v Speaker 5>savings time because I think it's </v>

2239
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.040
<v Speaker 5>bullshit that it's fucking pitch black </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside and it's only 6:30.</v>

2240
01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.750
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's absolutely right.</v>

2241
01:52:05.751 --> 01:52:08.090
<v Speaker 5>Farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all fucking thief's.</v>

2242
01:52:08.150 --> 01:52:10.990
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how dare you.</v>

2243
01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:16.020
<v Speaker 5>But seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Mellencamp hater back then it made </v>

2244
01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:16.620
<v Speaker 5>sense because everybody was a farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2245
01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:18.800
<v Speaker 5>everything has to do with farmers </v>
<v Speaker 5>nowadays.</v>

2246
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Why didn't they just get up earlier to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get it?</v>

2247
01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:23.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't get everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense.</v>

2248
01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2249
01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:27.230
<v Speaker 1>if you have a regular job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2250
01:52:27.231 --> 01:52:32.231
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's dark out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's light out the fucking </v>

2251
01:52:32.231 --> 01:52:32.231
<v Speaker 1>earth span.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about Arizona.</v>

2252
01:52:32.231 --> 01:52:33.050
<v Speaker 1>The Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't change their time.</v>

2253
01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:34.030
<v Speaker 1>They're like fuck,</v>

2254
01:52:34.210 --> 01:52:36.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's stupid.</v>

2255
01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.890
<v Speaker 5>What they need to even do it better than</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2256
01:52:37.891 --> 01:52:42.891
<v Speaker 5>They need to like really fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I want it to be bright out till </v>

2257
01:52:42.891 --> 01:52:43.650
<v Speaker 5>like nine to 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>at night.</v>

2258
01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:44.820
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'd be cool.</v>

2259
01:52:44.850 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then it would be dark</v>

2260
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.290
<v Speaker 2>out until like noon here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's fine.</v>

2261
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2262
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's retarded.</v>

2263
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Retarded is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense.</v>

2264
01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Most people would rather like to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2265
01:52:56.181 --> 01:53:01.181
<v Speaker 3>Like most people would rather have </v>
<v Speaker 3>daylight when you get off work and </v>

2266
01:53:01.621 --> 01:53:02.020
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2267
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I think that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>

2268
01:53:12.370 --> 01:53:14.890
<v Speaker 2>I spelled twitter long while my link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I did.</v>

2269
01:53:16.110 --> 01:53:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could fix it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's too late.</v>

2270
01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:22.690
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is what it is.</v>

2271
01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get better.</v>

2272
01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:28.740
<v Speaker 2>What do you do that other program </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember?</v>

2273
01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>gun in his pocket.</v>

2301

<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2303
01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:13.060
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Real.</v>

2304
01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:17.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to meet that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like his comedy.</v>

2305
01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I think he's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever listen to him on a grand </v>

2306
01:55:22.931 --> 01:55:24.190
<v Speaker 2>theft auto?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2307
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2308
01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:27.280
<v Speaker 2>He does like the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2309
01:55:27.281 --> 01:55:32.281
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a comedy club and grand theft </v>

2310
01:55:32.281 --> 01:55:32.950
<v Speaker 2>auto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

2311
01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:44.940
<v Speaker 2>If not telepathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's next for Human Johnny Bananas?</v>

2312
01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Twenty one wants to know boots for men </v>
<v Speaker 1>if not telepathy.</v>

2313
01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:52.620
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snacks for human evolution.</v>

2314
01:55:52.890 --> 01:55:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Probably a reversal if not telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we gonna I think we're in a race </v>

2315
01:55:58.621 --> 01:56:01.680
<v Speaker 1>right now between technology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>retards,</v>

2316
01:56:01.681 --> 01:56:05.570
<v Speaker 1>between technology and caveman style </v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

2317
01:56:05.850 --> 01:56:08.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about invading Pakistan,</v>

2318
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:11.100
<v Speaker 1>veining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yemen and more war and more craziness.</v>

2319
01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:12.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at a,</v>

2320
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:17.790
<v Speaker 1>a crossroads and I think we could either</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hit by a meteor or blow ourselves up</v>

2321
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:24.680
<v Speaker 1>or figure out the next level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what,</v>

2322
01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:29.760
<v Speaker 1>what's going to take human beings from </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are to the next stage of </v>

2323
01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.390
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is like a real thing.</v>

2324
01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're really going to evolve.</v>

2325
01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.920
<v Speaker 1>We're really moving towards something </v>
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

2326
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what this,</v>

2327
01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 1>this frantic fucking society we live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>is all about.</v>

2328
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:45.201
<v Speaker 1>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're pushing and moving towards </v>

2329
01:56:45.201 --> 01:56:47.471
<v Speaker 1>something all working together towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and I think it's going to be </v>

2330
01:56:47.471 --> 01:56:48.180
<v Speaker 1>technology driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's one of those things.</v>

2331
01:56:48.181 --> 01:56:53.181
<v Speaker 1>Either that's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some sort of a </v>

2332
01:56:53.181 --> 01:56:55.730
<v Speaker 1>technologically birthed connection that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all people all of a sudden share some </v>

2333
01:56:59.281 --> 01:57:00.090
<v Speaker 1>sort of a,</v>

2334
01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:04.020
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a convergence of all human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

2335
01:57:04.021 --> 01:57:09.021
<v Speaker 1>It's either gonna be that or it's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be blow ourselves up or a meteor </v>

2336
01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:11.190
<v Speaker 1>fucks us up or yellowstone explodes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we start from scratch.</v>

2337
01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:15.030
<v Speaker 1>You know what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if in the future,</v>

2338
01:57:15.031 --> 01:57:19.550
<v Speaker 1>the first robot to get pregnant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine,</v>

2339
01:57:19.590 --> 01:57:24.590
<v Speaker 1>imagine you figured out a way to get out</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines so closely tuned into human </v>

2340
01:57:24.590 --> 01:57:26.550
<v Speaker 1>beings that you can fuck them and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>them pregnant.</v>

2341
01:57:26.551 --> 01:57:31.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very possible then don't </v>

2342
01:57:31.551 --> 01:57:32.670
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything's possible at this point.</v>

2343
01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2344
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can make so many things </v>

2345
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.030
<v Speaker 1>artificially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out a way to make pork in a</v>

2346
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:42.400
<v Speaker 1>laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual,</v>

2347
01:57:42.401 --> 01:57:44.270
<v Speaker 1>the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can take some of the meat from,</v>

2348
01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:49.300
<v Speaker 1>from a pig and then making a laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it's not really like </v>

2349
01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:50.340
<v Speaker 1>mushy because it doesn't exercise at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like,</v>

2350
01:57:50.341 --> 01:57:55.341
<v Speaker 1>it's not like taught sinew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to figure out a way </v>

2351
01:57:55.341 --> 01:57:55.800
<v Speaker 1>to maybe electrically exercise the </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

2352
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:59.790
<v Speaker 1>You could literally like just make </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic like rooms full of meat,</v>

2353
01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:05.060
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even have a life attached to </v>

2354
01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:05.060
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can do that,</v>

2355
01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:05.970
<v Speaker 1>if they can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't they?</v>

2356
01:58:05.971 --> 01:58:08.370
<v Speaker 1>If they can figure out a way to grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>

2357
01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.370
<v Speaker 1>why can't they figure out a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>an artificial human being</v>

2358
01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:13.820
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be just like blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner though?</v>

2359
01:58:13.821 --> 01:58:16.700
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be all sad and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to kill you.</v>

2360
01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:23.870
<v Speaker 1>You know you have to give emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't give them emotions,</v>

2361
01:58:23.871 --> 01:58:26.990
<v Speaker 1>then you know they can't relate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2362
01:58:26.991 --> 01:58:31.991
<v Speaker 1>They can't empathize with people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then just go on mad raping and killing </v>

2363
01:58:31.991 --> 01:58:33.760
<v Speaker 1>sprees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you make artificial people,</v>

2364
01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:36.440
<v Speaker 1>if you make them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get the hard ons and shit,</v>

2365
01:58:37.130 --> 01:58:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a boner.</v>

2366
01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Our robots imagine.</v>

2367
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you make the females you make </v>
<v Speaker 4>males to like for like old gay dudes,</v>

2368
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:51.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes and what you know,</v>

2369
01:58:51.361 --> 01:58:56.170
<v Speaker 4>like to have a robot fucked all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but gay dudes would want some robot gay.</v>

2370
01:58:56.460 --> 01:59:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Do you imagine if they could make a like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real live like safe.</v>

2371
01:59:00.850 --> 01:59:04.720
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy who was your neighbor </v>
<v Speaker 4>who was really creepy and he was fixated</v>

2372
01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:09.721
<v Speaker 4>on you and he make a robot that looks </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly like you and just fuck it all </v>

2373
01:59:09.721 --> 01:59:13.420
<v Speaker 4>day long and punch it and tie it up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit on its head and there's nothing you</v>

2374
01:59:13.421 --> 01:59:18.421
<v Speaker 4>can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So literally next door to your fucking </v>

2375
01:59:18.421 --> 01:59:18.550
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's like putting that,</v>

2376
01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:20.590
<v Speaker 4>the robot head out the window and waving</v>
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>

2377
01:59:20.591 --> 01:59:20.970
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2378
01:59:21.010 --> 01:59:24.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm pissing his mouth and it's like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a fake you.</v>

2379
01:59:24.610 --> 01:59:26.530
<v Speaker 4>And he's just fucking it up all day.</v>

2380
01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:32.220
<v Speaker 4>How disturbing with that be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing you can do about it </v>

2381
01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:32.220
<v Speaker 4>because you have the papers on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a real human sir.</v>

2382
01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:33.550
<v Speaker 4>And they chose the papers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2383
01:59:33.610 --> 01:59:35.140
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2384
01:59:35.141 --> 01:59:36.340
<v Speaker 4>if it's a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2385
01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.590
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I have a grappling dummy in my,</v>

2386
01:59:38.610 --> 01:59:40.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my garage that I use in my practice,</v>

2387
01:59:40.811 --> 01:59:42.310
<v Speaker 4>my Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2388
01:59:42.311 --> 01:59:44.700
<v Speaker 4>and you could practice positions on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's a,</v>

2389
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:47.500
<v Speaker 4>it's called the above a dummy to Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could buy it from,</v>

2390
01:59:47.501 --> 01:59:47.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2391
01:59:47.991 --> 01:59:48.570
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2392
01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:50.770
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Gracie Academy in Torrance.</v>

2393
01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:51.310
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2394
01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:53.230
<v Speaker 4>they're the ones who start selling </v>
<v Speaker 4>another website.</v>

2395
01:59:53.231 --> 01:59:55.630
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the website is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look above a dummy,</v>

2396
01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:58.000
<v Speaker 4>it's a dummy that's just designed for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu.</v>

2397
01:59:58.210 --> 02:00:03.210
<v Speaker 4>And we filmed once playing around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember we're in the yard and in the </v>

2398
02:00:03.210 --> 02:00:06.810
<v Speaker 4>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were beating the shit out of it and </v>

2399
02:00:06.810 --> 02:00:06.810
<v Speaker 4>kick it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if that was a real person?</v>

2400
02:00:06.810 --> 02:00:06.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a dummy that we made,</v>

2401
02:00:06.810 --> 02:00:10.060
<v Speaker 4>but what if it's a robot person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if there's like a robot person that</v>

2402
02:00:10.061 --> 02:00:12.280
<v Speaker 4>you could practice Jujitsu on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can rape them.</v>

2403
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Who could punch him in the face?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could just beat the shit out of me.</v>

2404
02:00:15.311 --> 02:00:20.311
<v Speaker 4>You could chop his arms off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd be screaming and yelling and the </v>

2405
02:00:20.311 --> 02:00:20.311
<v Speaker 4>cops come to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2406
02:00:20.311 --> 02:00:20.311
<v Speaker 4>it's a fake person.</v>

2407
02:00:20.311 --> 02:00:24.720
<v Speaker 3>You ever been there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The laws would have to probably change </v>

2408
02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:27.250
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artificial intelligence is just the </v>

2409
02:00:27.250 --> 02:00:27.250
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2410
02:00:27.250 --> 02:00:28.080
<v Speaker 3>because then I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2411
02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:30.610
<v Speaker 3>because I mean a dog isn't as smart as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

2412
02:00:30.611 --> 02:00:31.320
<v Speaker 3>but don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to.</v>

2413
02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:36.360
<v Speaker 3>You're allowed to chop the dog's legs </v>
<v Speaker 3>off and stuff like a robot that has </v>

2414
02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:40.470
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still going to be considered </v>

2415
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.470
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2416
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you think that they'll treat it </v>

2417
02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:44.900
<v Speaker 4>the same way as a human being?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the laws?</v>

2418
02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:45.170
<v Speaker 4>It'll be like murder,</v>

2419
02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:46.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if it's.</v>

2420
02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:48.890
<v Speaker 3>If it can think it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered life,</v>

2421
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:52.910
<v Speaker 3>but before they figured that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a couple of years of</v>

2422
02:00:52.911 --> 02:00:54.610
<v Speaker 3>masturbating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extra staffing,</v>

2423
02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:59.190
<v Speaker 4>have a direct replica of you and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna fuck.</v>

2424
02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.050
<v Speaker 4>It's right in front of your window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to blow an air heart.</v>

2425
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:05.140
<v Speaker 4>I look out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is he doing?</v>

2426
02:01:05.170 --> 02:01:09.600
<v Speaker 4>You looked at these fucking your head </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you think about it,</v>

2427
02:01:09.601 --> 02:01:10.470
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if that was me?</v>

2428
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:15.510
<v Speaker 4>What if I was the duplicate and the real</v>
<v Speaker 4>me was watching me get raped.</v>

2429
02:01:18.150 --> 02:01:19.890
<v Speaker 3>It's weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be real.</v>

2430
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:22.740
<v Speaker 3>That could be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could really be a possibility.</v>

2431
02:01:22.770 --> 02:01:27.770
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm surprised is that there's not </v>

2432
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:29.361
<v Speaker 3>technology yet where we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have a program and type out shit</v>

2433
02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:32.130
<v Speaker 3>and make it sound exactly like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2434
02:01:32.150 --> 02:01:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your voice can do the exact levels.</v>

2435
02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:38.190
<v Speaker 3>So like you could prank call with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mom and stuff like that.</v>

2436
02:01:38.191 --> 02:01:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Is there should be that or it shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be that.</v>

2437
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2438
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why haven't they figured that out?</v>

2439
02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It seems easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2440
02:01:43.281 --> 02:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>it's really ridiculous too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you still have to sign things.</v>

2441
02:01:45.891 --> 02:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>You scribble their name.</v>

2442
02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is stupid because I write taco </v>

2443
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:52.970
<v Speaker 3>penis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even care.</v>

2444
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:54.280
<v Speaker 3>They don't look at it and it'll check </v>
<v Speaker 3>your id.</v>

2445
02:01:54.281 --> 02:01:54.490
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

2446
02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2447
02:01:55.770 --> 02:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't sign my credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you could look at my driver's</v>

2448
02:01:58.481 --> 02:02:03.481
<v Speaker 1>license,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I scribbled my name on that and it's a </v>

2449
02:02:03.481 --> 02:02:05.301
<v Speaker 1>similar level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what are these fucking people that </v>

2450
02:02:05.301 --> 02:02:06.190
<v Speaker 1>work at the target or they scribble </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts can look at that scribble.</v>

2451
02:02:06.191 --> 02:02:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the same guy.</v>

2452
02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I write full sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honest to God.</v>

2453
02:02:12.730 --> 02:02:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2454
02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>How is that still around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2455
02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Something with your name and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>legally binding.</v>

2456
02:02:19.570 --> 02:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>If you write something with your name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2457
02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Like you know when I got married I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a marriage certificate and had to</v>

2458
02:02:25.731 --> 02:02:27.610
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scribble and that's it.</v>

2459
02:02:27.670 --> 02:02:30.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what ties you up now when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote void.</v>

2460
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:31.900
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do that.</v>

2461
02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I would write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not real and scribble because </v>

2462
02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:38.990
<v Speaker 3>then she has a gun head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I get a divorce I got.</v>

2463
02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:42.110
<v Speaker 1>If you could see I wrote this is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>void on it.</v>

2464
02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that was enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Valid.</v>

2465
02:02:45.690 --> 02:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2466
02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could say it's like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I could say,</v>

2467
02:02:50.631 --> 02:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>well we have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the documents you sign.</v>

2468
02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Then you can look at and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what I wrote.</v>

2469
02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says this is not real.</v>

2470
02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been married.</v>

2471
02:02:58.550 --> 02:03:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not agree to this.</v>

2472
02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm a gun is being held up to my hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>

2473
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>They have my dog hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robots will have rights after awhile,</v>

2474
02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:13.980
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a guy I watched that will smith </v>

2475
02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:13.980
<v Speaker 1>movie ai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ai,</v>

2476
02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>ai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they need to make an ai maybe like </v>

2477
02:03:17.850 --> 02:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>with the kid like sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

2478
02:03:17.850 --> 02:03:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I am robot robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

2479
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:21.680
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty good moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good movie.</v>

2480
02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Everything was Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember all the robots look like Max </v>

2481
02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

2482
02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will have a chance against those </v>

2483
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Santos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's talking about UFC.</v>

2484
02:03:32.110 --> 02:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>This is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you leave you won't talk about UFC </v>

2485
02:03:37.110 --> 02:03:37.700
<v Speaker 1>will answer one UFC question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2486
02:03:37.701 --> 02:03:38.930
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert arrivals.</v>

2487
02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really good striker,</v>

2488
02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:45.830
<v Speaker 1>dangerous motherfucker and he knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big opportunity for him.</v>

2489
02:03:45.831 --> 02:03:47.750
<v Speaker 1>He's going to come charge and guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>blazing.</v>

2490
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think it's stupid when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask you is going to win that fight </v>

2491
02:03:52.810 --> 02:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>because obviously it's a fight for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

2492
02:03:52.810 --> 02:03:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that there's not an obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>winner of this fight,</v>

2493
02:03:55.191 --> 02:03:56.930
<v Speaker 1>so most of the time it's not an obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>winner,</v>

2494
02:03:56.931 --> 02:04:01.931
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of the times when </v>

2495
02:04:01.931 --> 02:04:02.240
<v Speaker 1>when everybody agrees that a certain guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to win,</v>

2496
02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that you're right,</v>

2497
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>but in this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy doesn't know that much about </v>

2498
02:04:09.250 --> 02:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>this Gilbert Ivo guy probably and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonders.</v>

2499
02:04:09.250 --> 02:04:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I think Gilbert's got a real good chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

2500
02:04:10.981 --> 02:04:12.770
<v Speaker 1>He's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he trains hard,</v>

2501
02:04:12.771 --> 02:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>if he's in real good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very,</v>

2502
02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:19.700
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knocks a lot of guys out his out of </v>

2503
02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Gary Goodrich and pride was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most spectacular knockouts ever.</v>

2504
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Head kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2505
02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>One shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 seconds of the fight and put </v>

2506
02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:29.630
<v Speaker 1>them to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's questions that you can ask a dog to</v>

2507
02:04:29.631 --> 02:04:34.631
<v Speaker 1>bark once for yes and two for no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it had the same percentage of the </v>

2508
02:04:34.631 --> 02:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>outcome of the question in the answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2509
02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:36.680
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you say,</v>

2510
02:04:36.681 --> 02:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that going to win,</v>

2511
02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:40.290
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2512
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:45.350
<v Speaker 1>But someone's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll also tell you if someone's good or </v>

2513
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.350
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2514
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if someone's going to.</v>

2515
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more sports questions.</v>

2516
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Order it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to order that for the time </v>

2517
02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:55.981
<v Speaker 1>occupied next broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully if they get it too many times </v>

2518
02:04:55.981 --> 02:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>we will have a tomahawk pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a fucking awesome item.</v>

2519
02:04:58.031 --> 02:05:03.031
<v Speaker 1>Like you need another pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed tom off [inaudible] like a </v>

2520
02:05:03.031 --> 02:05:06.181
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker I bake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially since it's a replica of </v>

2521
02:05:09.761 --> 02:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>something from a dude name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Cloud was fanny packs.</v>

2522
02:05:14.021 --> 02:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2523
02:05:14.561 --> 02:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>they have a sweep and we'll get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody that quilt.</v>

2524
02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a shoulder bag.</v>

2525
02:05:19.001 --> 02:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't do shoulder bags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a God damn purse.</v>

2526
02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fanny pack is fucking manly.</v>

2527
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a manly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2528
02:05:26.681 --> 02:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the Rogan board and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

2529
02:05:29.051 --> 02:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is fanny pack manly?</v>

2530
02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fanny packs and mainly because if you're</v>

2531
02:05:32.771 --> 02:05:37.771
<v Speaker 1>wearing a fanny pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all you're saying I don't give </v>

2532
02:05:37.771 --> 02:05:37.771
<v Speaker 1>a fuck what you think about how I look.</v>

2533
02:05:37.771 --> 02:05:42.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just slapped in this big stupid gay </v>

2534
02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:42.300
<v Speaker 1>thing around your waist and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2535
02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I have two hands free and I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to look good for you.</v>

2536
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to get you to be my </v>

2537
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:52.321
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like having all my shit in a bag then </v>

2538
02:05:52.321 --> 02:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to get laid.</v>

2539
02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>So when people talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man hugging,</v>

2540
02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>you wear it for a pug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so gay.</v>

2541
02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a bag that connects to my waist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is silly.</v>

2542
02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:04.860
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why you don't think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>good looking because women figures </v>

2543
02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:07.770
<v Speaker 1>disgusting and women think it looks gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women have figured out a way to </v>

2544
02:06:07.770 --> 02:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>bully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys did not wearing it by telling us </v>

2545
02:06:12.630 --> 02:06:12.700
<v Speaker 1>that looks gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you care what kind of a bag?</v>

2546
02:06:12.701 --> 02:06:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Another man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's your.</v>

2547
02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Unless he's wearing a bright pink hello </v>
<v Speaker 1>kitty strap.</v>

2548
02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:19.620
<v Speaker 1>It covers up your crotch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2549
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:21.910
<v Speaker 1>it does cover up my crotch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

2550
02:06:22.150 --> 02:06:27.150
<v Speaker 1>So if there's like a micro media that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from outer space and could </v>

2551
02:06:27.150 --> 02:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>potentially hit me in the deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to hit my cell phone first or</v>

2552
02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:31.060
<v Speaker 1>perhaps my wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

2553
02:06:31.061 --> 02:06:33.460
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I go to the airport,</v>

2554
02:06:33.461 --> 02:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>I unbuckled that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2555
02:06:35.031 --> 02:06:40.031
<v Speaker 1>put it on my car keys on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My cell phones now at fanny packs of the</v>

2556
02:06:41.081 --> 02:06:41.890
<v Speaker 1>shit son</v>

2557
02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:45.710
<v Speaker 2>got here.</v>

2558
02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:50.880
<v Speaker 1>That would be cool if gay people love </v>
<v Speaker 1>the smell farts.</v>

2559
02:06:51.250 --> 02:06:53.010
<v Speaker 1>That was didn't Joe Joseph</v>

2560
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:54.480
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>

2561
02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:01.440
<v Speaker 1>This fellow says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are you going to come to the east </v>

2562
02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:01.440
<v Speaker 1>coast of Canada?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the east coast.</v>

2563
02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2564
02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in Montreal last April.</v>

2565
02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:07.600
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be back.</v>

2566
02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll definitely be back up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2567
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:18.030
<v Speaker 2>page two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to the Rogan board right </v>

2568
02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:18.030
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To answer your questions</v>

2569
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>thing about Jersey shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Jersey shore watches that </v>

2570
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.770
<v Speaker 1>thought I would like it because I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>too many dudes like that growing up.</v>

2571
02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:25.780
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like more annoying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

2572
02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:28.630
<v Speaker 1>It's fun for a couple seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you fist pump,</v>

2573
02:07:28.650 --> 02:07:30.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after awhile it's just,</v>

2574
02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:32.620
<v Speaker 1>it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did this is my theory.</v>

2575
02:07:32.621 --> 02:07:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean talking to my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2576
02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it kind of like when Hill's </v>
<v Speaker 1>first came</v>

2577
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:38.020
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone thought that was a real.</v>

2578
02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Then slowly got to the point where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out it was a fake show that's </v>

2579
02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:47.911
<v Speaker 3>film to look real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Jersey shores real way too dumb </v>

2580
02:07:47.911 --> 02:07:51.361
<v Speaker 3>to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know half of them are like male </v>

2581
02:07:51.361 --> 02:07:53.611
<v Speaker 3>strippers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to audition like they're all in </v>

2582
02:07:53.611 --> 02:07:55.951
<v Speaker 3>the entertainment field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Jersey shore and stood the </v>

2583
02:07:55.951 --> 02:07:55.951
<v Speaker 3>hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2584
02:07:55.951 --> 02:07:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I bet you anything of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2585
02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:01.180
<v Speaker 3>I bet you anything sounds and they all </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in this house.</v>

2586
02:08:01.181 --> 02:08:03.240
<v Speaker 3>It's really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like railroad house.</v>

2587
02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:06.040
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the real people.</v>

2588
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:08.230
<v Speaker 3>It's really a genius show if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>it that way,</v>

2589
02:08:08.410 --> 02:08:11.650
<v Speaker 3>but I think in three years we're all </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be like knowing it's fake.</v>

2590
02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:14.940
<v Speaker 3>Like that fight somehow is fake and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything really.</v>

2591
02:08:15.150 --> 02:08:17.230
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't fake when I do punch that </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl to face,</v>

2592
02:08:17.650 --> 02:08:19.430
<v Speaker 3>unless that chick is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2593
02:08:19.590 --> 02:08:23.440
<v Speaker 3>stump woman and they fucking practice it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for like 50 years.</v>

2594
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:28.030
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they practiced the punch a lot,</v>

2595
02:08:28.031 --> 02:08:28.420
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2596
02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:29.780
<v Speaker 6>Hm.</v>

2597
02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:33.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean you look at movies and you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at that punch,</v>

2598
02:08:33.261 --> 02:08:35.510
<v Speaker 3>it looks real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they filmed it like to look fake,</v>

2599
02:08:36.810 --> 02:08:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I think they'll do got drunk and punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bitch face.</v>

2600
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said what?</v>

2601
02:08:43.691 --> 02:08:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I have full blown aids or spend one year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mark Hayden's body pick one.</v>

2602
02:08:49.190 --> 02:08:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Well I know what full blown aids you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>recover from.</v>

2603
02:08:55.100 --> 02:09:00.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being in one year and marketing's body </v>

2604
02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:00.100
<v Speaker 3>will probably be torture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David.</v>

2605
02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I think full blown aids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take your vitamins,</v>

2606
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:06.050
<v Speaker 3>probably be okay in a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You spend one year in mark cadens body.</v>

2607
02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Every chicken could possibly fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck unaids.</v>

2608
02:09:09.210 --> 02:09:11.750
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get out of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonds and mark cadens body.</v>

2609
02:09:11.930 --> 02:09:15.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't get aids in marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even understand the question.</v>

2610
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:21.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying if you have one year in his </v>

2611
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:21.000
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could just abuse it.</v>

2612
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Like fucking get the fuck out of there </v>
<v Speaker 3>in one year.</v>

2613
02:09:21.381 --> 02:09:23.240
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

2614
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:25.210
<v Speaker 2>That's in this.</v>

2615
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's end this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You gonna have to be a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>clever than that.</v>

2644
02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:42.530
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

2645
02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:45.440

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2648
02:10:54.101 --> 02:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Fake Brett Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

2649
02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:03.490
<v Speaker 1>For Roger's not on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't gentlemen that's a fake Brett </v>

2650
02:11:03.490 --> 02:11:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The railroad rogers is a bad </v>

2651
02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:06.760
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not him.</v>

2652
02:11:06.930 --> 02:11:11.240
<v Speaker 1>But it was really funny when the fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brett Rogers was having an argument with</v>

2653
02:11:11.241 --> 02:11:14.820
<v Speaker 1>a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a warm machine that was pretty funny.</v>

2654
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>War machine didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought it was all really happening.</v>

2655
02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stopped talking a while ago.</v>

2656
02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>What happened if you've given up on us?</v>

2657
02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:29.340
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get to the cutoff point where I'm just</v>

2658
02:11:29.341 --> 02:11:31.260
<v Speaker 7>tired of staring at computer.</v>

2659
02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an accompany in Indian head dress</v>

2660
02:11:35.811 --> 02:11:38.650
<v Speaker 1>to go with my Tomahawk pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says uh,</v>

2661
02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:41.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2663
02:11:42.621 --> 02:11:45.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think yes,</v>

2664
02:11:45.681 --> 02:11:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I think if we're gonna really get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch with the spirit world.</v>

2665
02:11:48.770 --> 02:11:51.230
<v Speaker 1>We're going to need full Indian attire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

2666
02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to need the whole thing,</v>

2667
02:11:53.151 --> 02:11:55.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to need feathers and shit.</v>

2668
02:11:55.491 --> 02:11:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2669
02:11:57.170 --> 02:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>the correct type of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd kind of make sure we only smoke </v>

2670
02:12:02.170 --> 02:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>what the Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small?</v>

2671
02:12:02.170 --> 02:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2672
02:12:02.170 --> 02:12:02.870
<v Speaker 7>Smaller condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Small.</v>

2673
02:12:02.930 --> 02:12:04.190
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not those Indians.</v>

2674
02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:06.930
<v Speaker 7>American Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That India Indians.</v>

2675
02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Girl Mosh pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched her for a couple of seconds,</v>

2676
02:12:10.111 --> 02:12:15.111
<v Speaker 1>but it was like one of those terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos where they cut some dude's head </v>

2677
02:12:15.111 --> 02:12:15.111
<v Speaker 1>off after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just shut it off.</v>

2678
02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:21.230
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any of these questions don't suck.</v>

2679
02:12:23.890 --> 02:12:28.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2680
02:12:29.090 --> 02:12:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I think if anything came out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

2681
02:12:31.911 --> 02:12:36.911
<v Speaker 1>someone right now is thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>designing a robot where you clone your </v>

2682
02:12:37.251 --> 02:12:40.000
<v Speaker 1>neighbor and make a robot out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then fuck them and rape them in front of</v>

2683
02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:42.980
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody is thinking about that.</v>

2684
02:12:42.981 --> 02:12:45.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think if this</v>

2685
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:47.560
<v Speaker 7>chat has done anything good for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>world,</v>

2686
02:12:47.590 --> 02:12:52.590
<v Speaker 7>it's introduced that idea at that </v>
<v Speaker 7>possibility out there of making a clone </v>

2687
02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:53.790
<v Speaker 7>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're just gonna sack is we're going to</v>

2688
02:12:53.791 --> 02:12:57.040
<v Speaker 7>be like 90 years old and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 7>to make the perfect fuck robot,</v>

2689
02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:59.430
<v Speaker 7>but we're going to be so old.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're not going to even care anymore.</v>

2690
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:05.810
<v Speaker 7>I'm telling you that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2691
02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:11.940
<v Speaker 7>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they'll probably have more problems </v>

2692
02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:11.940
<v Speaker 7>than we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2693
02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:12.840
<v Speaker 7>we'll probably look back on these days </v>
<v Speaker 7>and Oh,</v>

2694
02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:17.880
<v Speaker 7>remember the simple times they just get </v>
<v Speaker 7>on the Internet and drive to work and </v>

2695

<v Speaker 1>We're gonna have to kill our cats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2710
02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:02.060
<v Speaker 4>After you have a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cats become just really annoying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>little bitch.</v>

2717
02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>A couple more questions here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the rug and boards if we've </v>

2718
02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:25.230
<v Speaker 1>got a good question there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever get mad?</v>

2719
02:14:25.231 --> 02:14:30.231
<v Speaker 1>Like in anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually pushed her off to the point </v>

2720
02:14:30.231 --> 02:14:30.270
<v Speaker 1>where urban smash a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that I get upset,</v>

2721
02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:33.410
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be pretty fucking a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

2722
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Me that upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty rational when it comes to </v>

2723
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.510
<v Speaker 1>most things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have A.</v>

2724
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:40.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean everyone has the ability to freak</v>
<v Speaker 4>out over something.</v>

2725
02:14:40.911 --> 02:14:43.280
<v Speaker 4>It's just whether or not you choose to </v>
<v Speaker 4>let yourself get there.</v>

2726
02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:45.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just gotTa.</v>

2727
02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:50.260
<v Speaker 4>Make sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the most important thing about </v>

2728
02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:52.571
<v Speaker 4>not getting mad as manage your biology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to treat your biology like it's </v>

2729
02:14:52.571 --> 02:14:52.700
<v Speaker 4>a bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you have,</v>

2730
02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:54.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're in debt,</v>

2731
02:14:54.370 --> 02:14:57.920
<v Speaker 4>you know you owe it something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you know your overdrafted you,</v>

2732
02:14:57.930 --> 02:15:00.770
<v Speaker 4>you owe yourself an expenditure of </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy.</v>

2733
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you have a certain type of</v>

2734
02:15:02.511 --> 02:15:04.790
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a muscular body,</v>

2735
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:07.550
<v Speaker 4>if you have a person is in engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletics or whole life,</v>

2736
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:10.520
<v Speaker 4>you have a Bot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's used to exerting a lot of energy</v>

2737
02:15:10.521 --> 02:15:15.521
<v Speaker 4>when you owe it to that body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to like you have a debt to pay </v>

2738
02:15:15.521 --> 02:15:16.430
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't pay that debt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna,</v>

2739
02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:21.460
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna have a problem where you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have too much energy that's </v>

2740
02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:23.060
<v Speaker 4>stored up and built in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not blown out and it's going to come out</v>

2741
02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:24.350
<v Speaker 4>and unusual ways.</v>

2742
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:27.750
<v Speaker 4>Look in traffic or at work or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll you'll,</v>

2743
02:15:27.751 --> 02:15:30.890
<v Speaker 4>you'll start screaming and freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 4>about something he really didn't need to</v>

2744
02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:34.190
<v Speaker 4>and really it's all just about managing </v>
<v Speaker 4>your biology,</v>

2745
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:39.430
<v Speaker 4>managing your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very important to have some </v>

2746
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:40.550
<v Speaker 4>downtime where you can sit alone by </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself and just think,</v>

2747
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:42.650
<v Speaker 4>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very important for me.</v>

2748
02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:45.620
<v Speaker 4>The isolation tank does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like times 100,</v>

2749
02:15:45.621 --> 02:15:50.621
<v Speaker 4>that's my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes even just sitting on the </v>

2750
02:15:50.621 --> 02:15:50.621
<v Speaker 4>couch and just by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just thinking,</v>

2751
02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:52.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can call it meditation,</v>

2752
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:54.050
<v Speaker 4>you can call it whatever the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

2753
02:15:54.051 --> 02:15:59.051
<v Speaker 4>Just spending time to organize your </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and put your mind in a certain </v>

2754
02:15:59.051 --> 02:16:03.071
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put your body in a certain place with </v>

2755
02:16:03.071 --> 02:16:03.071
<v Speaker 4>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with yoga,</v>

2756
02:16:03.071 --> 02:16:04.430
<v Speaker 4>with nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that Shit's important.</v>

2757
02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:07.640
<v Speaker 4>You've got to manage your biology and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you manage your biology,</v>

2758
02:16:07.641 --> 02:16:09.830
<v Speaker 4>it makes managing your mind much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much easier.</v>

2759
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:12.290
<v Speaker 4>Managing your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>managing a biology.</v>

2760
02:16:12.291 --> 02:16:14.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the key to not getting upset at </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2761
02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:20.440
<v Speaker 4>You fucking faggots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the best artists created from the </v>

2762
02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:22.850
<v Speaker 4>starving artist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems that this is a good question.</v>

2763
02:16:22.990 --> 02:16:26.420
<v Speaker 4>It seems the best art is created from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the starving artists being wealthy.</v>

2764
02:16:26.421 --> 02:16:29.320
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel it hurts your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>create art comedy,</v>

2765
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:34.350
<v Speaker 4>or do you believe that not having to </v>
<v Speaker 4>worry about your financial wellbeing </v>

2766
02:16:34.350 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 4>allows you more time to be creative?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good question.</v>

2767
02:16:37.390 --> 02:16:41.260
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of times people are much </v>
<v Speaker 4>more ambitious when they're starving.</v>

2768
02:16:41.261 --> 02:16:44.860
<v Speaker 4>They have much more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have much more a dedication towards</v>

2769
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:49.861
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that you can't </v>

2770
02:16:49.861 --> 02:16:49.861
<v Speaker 4>have a lot of dedication towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>something when you become successful.</v>

2771
02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:52.630
<v Speaker 4>It all depends on what was your </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation in the first place.</v>

2772
02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:56.410
<v Speaker 4>If your motivation in the first place </v>
<v Speaker 4>was recognition and you know,</v>

2773
02:16:56.411 --> 02:16:59.830
<v Speaker 4>adulation and then you become famous and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you get that,</v>

2774
02:16:59.831 --> 02:17:01.780
<v Speaker 4>then you have no motivation to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

2775
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:06.130
<v Speaker 4>but if your motivation is the actual art</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself is creating new things,</v>

2776
02:17:06.310 --> 02:17:11.310
<v Speaker 4>then I think you can be more free as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>become successful because you're in a </v>

2777
02:17:11.310 --> 02:17:12.670
<v Speaker 4>position where you don't have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 4>about money anymore,</v>

2778
02:17:12.671 --> 02:17:17.671
<v Speaker 4>so you have one less thing to think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about and you're ambitious in the sense </v>

2779
02:17:17.671 --> 02:17:18.750
<v Speaker 4>of being creative instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on money.</v>

2780
02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.210
<v Speaker 4>Your mind is not geared on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mind is weird on the art.</v>

2781
02:17:22.570 --> 02:17:25.510
<v Speaker 4>That's how I like to think that I am and</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm at my best,</v>

2782
02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:28.360
<v Speaker 4>that is where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my mind frame.</v>

2783
02:17:28.630 --> 02:17:33.630
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my my point of references that I </v>

2784
02:17:33.630 --> 02:17:34.150
<v Speaker 4>think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the creation of the art itself.</v>

2785
02:17:34.330 --> 02:17:36.880
<v Speaker 4>That's when I'm at my best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I think about money,</v>

2786
02:17:36.881 --> 02:17:39.940
<v Speaker 4>I think about like how much is this </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to pay me and is this worth this?</v>

2787
02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:42.590
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's.</v>

2788
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:45.460
<v Speaker 4>You don't get the same results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same passion to it,</v>

2789
02:17:45.461 --> 02:17:50.461
<v Speaker 4>but the passion has got to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be my comedy the way in my </v>

2790
02:17:50.461 --> 02:17:54.241
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my motivation is all about whether or </v>

2791
02:17:54.241 --> 02:17:56.401
<v Speaker 4>not people enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do anything that people </v>

2792
02:17:56.401 --> 02:17:56.401
<v Speaker 4>don't enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to make sure that everything that</v>

2793
02:17:56.401 --> 02:18:01.021
<v Speaker 4>I'm creating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm creating it so other people get </v>

2794
02:18:01.021 --> 02:18:01.050
<v Speaker 4>enjoyment out of it and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reward that you get for that one.</v>

2795
02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:02.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as you're concentrating on that,</v>

2796
02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:08.160
<v Speaker 4>you do no wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as you have the dynamic in the </v>

2797
02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:08.160
<v Speaker 4>relationship between you and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience,</v>

2798
02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:13.170
<v Speaker 4>as long as you respect that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as long as your relationship to the </v>

2799
02:18:13.170 --> 02:18:14.530
<v Speaker 4>creativity is all based on just </v>
<v Speaker 4>producing more stuff,</v>

2800
02:18:14.531 --> 02:18:17.710
<v Speaker 4>that's good that people enjoy as long as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it for that reason,</v>

2801
02:18:18.010 --> 02:18:19.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you have to worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2802
02:18:19.751 --> 02:18:24.751
<v Speaker 4>money robbing you of your enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you were just in it for the money</v>

2803
02:18:24.971 --> 02:18:27.010
<v Speaker 4>and just in it for the adulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2804
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:28.930
<v Speaker 4>you become successful and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden like,</v>

2805
02:18:28.931 --> 02:18:31.660
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna wanna do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be.</v>

2806
02:18:31.661 --> 02:18:34.450
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be enthusiastic </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it anymore.</v>

2807
02:18:40.310 --> 02:18:44.340
<v Speaker 4>Hyena flew equal super aids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

2808
02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:49.060
<v Speaker 4>We're planning on doing December 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first 2012.</v>

2809
02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2810

<v Speaker 4>If it's really what people's.</v>

2811
02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:55.090
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to go to the pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

2812
02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.510
<v Speaker 4>If it's really what some people think it</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

2813
02:18:58.511 --> 02:19:01.030
<v Speaker 4>this convergence is technological </v>
<v Speaker 4>convergence.</v>

2814
02:19:01.031 --> 02:19:06.031
<v Speaker 4>We're all human beings will interface </v>
<v Speaker 4>with each other where someone creates a </v>

2815
02:19:06.031 --> 02:19:07.990
<v Speaker 4>time machine where some huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>technological breakthrough happens.</v>

2816
02:19:07.991 --> 02:19:09.610
<v Speaker 4>If that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what some people think.</v>

2817
02:19:09.611 --> 02:19:14.611
<v Speaker 4>December 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first 2012 or whatever that shit's </v>

<v Speaker 4>the time it's gonna.</v>

2819
02:19:15.330 --> 02:19:17.380
<v Speaker 4>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it doesn't matter where you are.</v>

2820
02:19:17.381 --> 02:19:19.690
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they should be amongst friends.</v>

2822
02:19:24.691 --> 02:19:24.691
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

2823
02:19:24.691 --> 02:19:25.210
<v Speaker 4>Should we commit to a 24 hour?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's commit to.</v>

2824
02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to commit to a huge dream </v>

2825
02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:30.720
<v Speaker 4>for December,</v>
<v Speaker 4>December</v>

2826
02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first 2012,</v>

2827
02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:34.420
<v Speaker 1>December 20th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012 commit so that as the 21st turns </v>

2828
02:19:34.420 --> 02:19:34.610
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it at midnight.</v>

2829
02:19:34.611 --> 02:19:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Show at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will start at 8:00</v>

2830
02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:38.660
<v Speaker 1>eastern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's 11:00</v>

2831
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:40.730
<v Speaker 1>eastern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what time it is in England.</v>

2832
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:41.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2833
02:19:41.901 --> 02:19:43.640
<v Speaker 1>That's not December 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First 2012.</v>

2834
02:19:43.641 --> 02:19:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It's all based on fucking America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2835
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Because the Mayans and the Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>were basically on the same calendar sort</v>

2836
02:19:49.011 --> 02:19:50.960
<v Speaker 1>of right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of really.</v>

2837
02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I think a different timeline resource in</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching eatsa is the same as Miami.</v>

2838
02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little bit below that.</v>

2839
02:19:58.250 --> 02:20:00.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>December 20th,</v>

2840
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:03.380
<v Speaker 1>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012.</v>

2841
02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Brian and I are committing right now to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a use dream.</v>

2842
02:20:05.691 --> 02:20:06.230
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do it.</v>

2843
02:20:07.890 --> 02:20:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Feel strong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's going to happen.</v>

2844
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>

2845
02:20:11.701 --> 02:20:13.530
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a possibility.</v>

2846
02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:18.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people let them know that </v>

2847
02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:20.511
<v Speaker 1>something's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a friend that likes to believe </v>

2848
02:20:20.511 --> 02:20:23.271
<v Speaker 1>in Ufos and psychics and con chem trails</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anything,</v>

2849
02:20:23.970 --> 02:20:25.470
<v Speaker 1>anything wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2850
02:20:25.471 --> 02:20:27.900
<v Speaker 1>this dude is just jumps on board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2851
02:20:27.930 --> 02:20:32.930
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's just as possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's going to happen as more </v>

2852
02:20:34.410 --> 02:20:37.210
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is possible to.</v>

2853
02:20:37.211 --> 02:20:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Something might happen on the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody's thinking something's</v>

2854
02:20:39.481 --> 02:20:40.630
<v Speaker 1>going to happen on that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2855
02:20:40.690 --> 02:20:45.690
<v Speaker 1>If it's some dude sitting somewhere with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some bombs that made me think that I </v>

2856
02:20:45.690 --> 02:20:46.000
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2857
02:20:46.050 --> 02:20:51.050
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we're going to force </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to happen by really </v>

2858
02:20:51.050 --> 02:20:51.050
<v Speaker 1>concentrating it as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2859
02:20:51.050 --> 02:20:53.550
<v Speaker 1>as a point of focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one point.</v>

2860
02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what everyone thought was </v>

2861
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.790
<v Speaker 1>going to happen in 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

2862
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:59.130
<v Speaker 1>But everybody was waiting for the clocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>to break in.</v>

2863
02:20:59.131 --> 02:21:04.131
<v Speaker 1>2,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very specific things falling from </v>

2864
02:21:04.131 --> 02:21:04.131
<v Speaker 1>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop working,</v>

2865
02:21:04.131 --> 02:21:05.430
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stayed home.</v>

2866
02:21:05.610 --> 02:21:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I remember I stayed home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the first,</v>

2867
02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:12.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first years where I didn't do a new </v>

2868
02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:12.620
<v Speaker 1>year's show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2869
02:21:12.750 --> 02:21:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I think I probably was worried.</v>

2870
02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:17.990
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird is that everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really freaked out about that.</v>

2871
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:22.100
<v Speaker 3>And then we had all this built up stress</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of it.</v>

2872
02:21:22.101 --> 02:21:25.250
<v Speaker 3>And then just shortly after nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>11,</v>

2873
02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:27.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we finally got the release,</v>

2874
02:21:27.231 --> 02:21:28.600
<v Speaker 3>all the stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the world's ending.</v>

2875
02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:35.860
<v Speaker 3>I just remember being really stressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out thinking something was going to </v>

2876
02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:37.010
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like right after 9:11.</v>

2877
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's quit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2880
02:21:46.290 --> 02:21:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hours and 20 minutes.</v>

2881
02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I ate a bag of carrots today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a juicer now.</v>

2882
02:21:51.611 --> 02:21:52.150

<v Speaker 1>But that says to me is at least 100 </v>

2884
02:21:57.640 --> 02:21:58.880
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers thought we were boring as </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>from one to 10 my but three,</v>

2889
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:15.200
<v Speaker 1>three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really could use shaving and trimming.</v>

2890
02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:20.500
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to an old Howard stern </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcasts where they were fined and he </v>

2891
02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:22.670
<v Speaker 1>was fine for talking about shaving is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't realize how crazy those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking regular radio shows are like </v>

<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2894
02:22:27.961 --> 02:22:30.600
<v Speaker 1>But it was inspiring and I was thinking </v>

2895
02:22:30.601 --> 02:22:32.870
<v Speaker 1>my own bonaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2896
02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:33.780
<v Speaker 1>it could definitely help.</v>

2897
02:22:37.850 --> 02:22:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Solar flares are not in our control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing to worry about,</v>

2898
02:22:41.901 --> 02:22:46.901

<v Speaker 1>leave shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a slob and have problems as </v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't make resolutions.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's not a girl because I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking girl.</v>

2910
02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:18.600
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2911
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:20.230
<v Speaker 3>if I wanted to fix something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

2912
02:23:20.231 --> 02:23:20.700
<v Speaker 3>I would start.</v>

2913
02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:22.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't wait.</v>

2914
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I always say I'm going to work out more </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>

2915
02:23:24.921 --> 02:23:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get my shit together.</v>

2916
02:23:26.390 --> 02:23:29.900
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part I put out as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy as I want to put out.</v>

2917
02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I focus on things as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as I can while still enjoying </v>

2918
02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:35.080
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2919
02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:38.690
<v Speaker 1>always dancing around obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very important to me.</v>

2920
02:23:38.691 --> 02:23:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's with comedy or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2921
02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And with games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with anything in my life,</v>

2922
02:23:42.141 --> 02:23:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I always have to dance around becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with things.</v>

2923
02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:49.690
<v Speaker 1>So for me it's just just enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just try to be balanced and try to </v>

2924
02:23:50.031 --> 02:23:51.770
<v Speaker 1>consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2925
02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:56.980
<v Speaker 1>just try to have a good time to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive when I get obsessed with </v>

2926
02:23:56.980 --> 02:24:00.161
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's about Jujitsu or comedy or </v>

2927
02:24:00.161 --> 02:24:03.640
<v Speaker 1>playing games like pool or video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get crazy about things and I don't </v>

2928
02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:06.680
<v Speaker 1>like that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get obsessed with things.</v>

2929
02:24:07.170 --> 02:24:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

<v Speaker 3>branches off more and more and more and </v>

<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>December 10th,</v>

2980
02:26:31.961 --> 02:26:36.961
<v Speaker 4>2019 93.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when the Internet turned on in </v>

2981
02:26:36.961 --> 02:26:38.800
<v Speaker 4>the world changed forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was like a recognized date,</v>

2982
02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:43.980
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be way more important than </v>

2983
02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:43.980
<v Speaker 4>fucking Columbus Day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

2984
02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:45.580
<v Speaker 4>How about we studied Columbus Day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that dude never even landed in America,</v>

2985
02:26:45.610 --> 02:26:50.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was in the Bahamas or raping and </v>

2986
02:26:50.610 --> 02:26:50.610
<v Speaker 4>murdering people and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2987
02:26:50.610 --> 02:26:53.650
<v Speaker 4>and then Columbus Day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet day is a way bigger day for</v>

2988
02:26:53.651 --> 02:26:55.600
<v Speaker 4>American history than fucking Columbus </v>
<v Speaker 4>Day.</v>

2989
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:59.530
<v Speaker 4>If they came out with an Internet day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be important.</v>

2990
02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:00.190
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2991
02:27:01.290 --> 02:27:06.290
<v Speaker 4>December 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first 2012 has to be like that Internet </v>

2992
02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:06.290
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be David.</v>

2993
02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:06.750
<v Speaker 4>We look back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2994
02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:11.340
<v Speaker 4>that day some shit started off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the day that changed everything.</v>

2995
02:27:11.370 --> 02:27:12.240
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>December 20,</v>

2996
02:27:12.241 --> 02:27:14.680
<v Speaker 4>first 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be the,</v>

2997
02:27:14.681 --> 02:27:16.660
<v Speaker 4>all the hype behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's not that,</v>

2998
02:27:16.661 --> 02:27:18.000
<v Speaker 4>then it's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2999
02:27:18.001 --> 02:27:19.720
<v Speaker 4>this whole idea that it's the end of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>

3000
02:27:19.721 --> 02:27:21.810
<v Speaker 4>So it's becoming a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a new era.</v>

3001
02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

3002
02:27:22.591 --> 02:27:27.591
<v Speaker 4>possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to me that could just as easily </v>

3003
02:27:27.591 --> 02:27:30.711
<v Speaker 4>happen tomorrow or being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do we assume that the Mayans were </v>

3004
02:27:30.711 --> 02:27:32.130
<v Speaker 4>absolutely correct about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they were correcting,</v>

3005
02:27:32.131 --> 02:27:35.490
<v Speaker 4>recognizing that human beings go in </v>
<v Speaker 4>cycles,</v>

3006
02:27:35.491 --> 02:27:36.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's uh,</v>

3007
02:27:36.081 --> 02:27:36.690
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3008
02:27:36.691 --> 02:27:40.140
<v Speaker 4>an an old idea that you guys is a um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3009
02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:45.220
<v Speaker 4>and I believe Hindu idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's Hindu or along the same </v>

3010
02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:49.101
<v Speaker 4>lines that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like stages that humanity goes </v>

3011
02:27:49.101 --> 02:27:52.881
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes through and that these stages of </v>

3012
02:27:52.881 --> 02:27:52.881
<v Speaker 4>these cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're all repeatable,</v>

3013
02:27:52.881 --> 02:27:53.520
<v Speaker 4>they just keep happening.</v>

3014
02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:56.190
<v Speaker 4>I can a cycle over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like how you breathe in,</v>

3015
02:27:56.191 --> 02:27:58.800
<v Speaker 4>you breathe out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humanity rises and falls.</v>

3016
02:27:59.250 --> 02:28:02.360
<v Speaker 4>And right now we're supposed to be in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kali Yoga and this.</v>

3017
02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:07.400
<v Speaker 4>It's also supposed to end the same time </v>
<v Speaker 4>around where the Mayans believe that </v>

3018
02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:11.871
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this age is going to end and the same </v>

3019
02:28:11.871 --> 02:28:11.990
<v Speaker 4>time we're terence Mckenna's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3020
02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:15.240
<v Speaker 4>timewave zero novelty theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which a lot of people think is bullshit.</v>

3021
02:28:15.241 --> 02:28:20.241
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's bullshit or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was a guy named terrence </v>

3022
02:28:20.241 --> 02:28:22.910
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna that had this crazy mathematical</v>
<v Speaker 4>algorithm designed track time and it was</v>

3023
02:28:22.911 --> 02:28:27.911
<v Speaker 4>based off the teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea was that you could apply </v>

3024
02:28:27.911 --> 02:28:28.970
<v Speaker 4>this to past events and show that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>human innovation,</v>

3025
02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:34.180
<v Speaker 4>that progress in humanity is all like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could chart it on a graph that it's </v>

3026
02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:37.910
<v Speaker 4>all like going along a certain direction</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that eventually was going to reach a</v>

3027
02:28:37.911 --> 02:28:40.100
<v Speaker 4>point of what he called ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>novelty.</v>

3028
02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:44.960
<v Speaker 4>And the idea of ultimate novelty would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be something that we would figure out or</v>

3029
02:28:44.961 --> 02:28:47.180
<v Speaker 4>do like create a time machine or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

3030
02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:50.570
<v Speaker 4>That would literally change everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>as we know it.</v>

3031
02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:55.840
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that Ray Kurtzweil calls it the </v>

3032
02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:58.451
<v Speaker 4>singularity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that there's a bunch of </v>

3033
02:28:58.451 --> 02:29:00.050
<v Speaker 4>different scientists that believe we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving towards this convergence,</v>

3034
02:29:00.051 --> 02:29:05.051
<v Speaker 4>this one big invention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they tie that into the mind thing </v>

3035
02:29:05.051 --> 02:29:09.161
<v Speaker 4>that December 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first 2012 is exactly the same as the </v>

3036
02:29:09.161 --> 02:29:11.300
<v Speaker 4>ending point for ultimate novelty for </v>
<v Speaker 4>timewave zero,</v>

3037
02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:14.390
<v Speaker 4>and that Terence Mckenna arrived at that</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3038
02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:16.280
<v Speaker 4>Completely independent of the Mayan </v>
<v Speaker 4>calendar.</v>

3039
02:29:16.310 --> 02:29:19.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have really studied at either.</v>

3040
02:29:19.011 --> 02:29:19.190
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3041
02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Did he tell you about this whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he just programmed this logic around</v>

3042
02:29:24.221 --> 02:29:24.610
<v Speaker 3>that date?</v>

3043
02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:26.550
<v Speaker 4>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's possible.</v>

3044
02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:28.140
<v Speaker 4>It didn't seem like he was a liar </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3045
02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:29.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might've been kind of a hippie</v>

3046
02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:31.360
<v Speaker 3>and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all lies.</v>

3047
02:29:31.361 --> 02:29:33.430
<v Speaker 3>They all want the money so they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy weed,</v>

3048
02:29:34.220 --> 02:29:39.040
<v Speaker 4>fucking patrolling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we don't know if it was a.</v>

3049
02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:44.170
<v Speaker 4>What we do know is this fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>has been going on for two hours and 30 </v>

3050
02:29:44.170 --> 02:29:44.960
<v Speaker 4>minutes and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's over.</v>

3051
02:29:44.961 --> 02:29:49.961
<v Speaker 4>Religious Gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian and I are going to get something </v>

3052
02:29:49.961 --> 02:29:50.120
<v Speaker 4>to eat and we're going to sign out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to try to do this every week</v>

3053
02:29:50.121 --> 02:29:50.480
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

3054
02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Two hours every week.</v>

3055
02:29:52.270 --> 02:29:53.580
<v Speaker 4>Two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two hours and a half,</v>

3056
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:55.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two hours is not so good,</v>

3057
02:29:55.690 --> 02:29:57.460
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or two hours in the half is not so good.</v>

3058
02:29:57.461 --> 02:29:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Two hours to perfect by now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3059
02:29:59.501 --> 02:30:01.960
<v Speaker 4>we appreciate all 400 and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3060
02:30:01.961 --> 02:30:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had 500 people at one point in time.</v>

3061
02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:06.540
<v Speaker 4>It's like a comedy club and as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

3062
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:08.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets more Internet in here,</v>

3063
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:12.120
<v Speaker 3>we're going to start triple broadcasting</v>
<v Speaker 3>it on both Justin TV</v>

3064
02:30:12.390 --> 02:30:13.500
<v Speaker 4>and all the other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will,</v>

3065
02:30:13.530 --> 02:30:17.570
<v Speaker 4>we'll put it on three and St.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we'll give you different angles to,</v>

3066
02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:20.310
<v Speaker 4>to be a fucking Weirdo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3067
02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Can we get better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger heads up a couple of days.</v>

3068
02:30:23.491 --> 02:30:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend Jim Dirksen did know,</v>

3069
02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:30.300
<v Speaker 4>did Erik Didriksen Cim?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didrikson yeah,</v>

3070
02:30:30.301 --> 02:30:30.770
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

3071
02:30:30.780 --> 02:30:32.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll definitely get more advanced time.</v>

3072
02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:34.250
<v Speaker 4>We just figured it out yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do,</v>

3073
02:30:34.270 --> 02:30:36.540
<v Speaker 4>and then I put it up and said we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do it in a couple hours,</v>

3074
02:30:36.930 --> 02:30:41.930
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we'll do next time is what we're </v>

3075
02:30:41.930 --> 02:30:42.630
<v Speaker 4>eventually going to do is have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific time we start at every week.</v>

3076
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:44.360
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like a Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3077
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:47.020
<v Speaker 4>Wednesday afternoons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3078
02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:52.040
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because even if we go on the road for </v>

3079
02:30:52.040 --> 02:30:52.040
<v Speaker 4>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't leave until Thursday usually.</v>

3080
02:30:52.040 --> 02:30:53.820
<v Speaker 4>So we'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll try to do a Tuesday or a Wednesday</v>

3081
02:30:53.821 --> 02:30:54.570
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll do,</v>

3082
02:30:54.571 --> 02:30:57.780
<v Speaker 4>we'll do like late afternoon in La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 3:00</v>

3083
02:30:57.781 --> 02:31:02.010
<v Speaker 4>is perfect somewhere around that line </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll do it on a regular basis.</v>

3084
02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:03.100
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
