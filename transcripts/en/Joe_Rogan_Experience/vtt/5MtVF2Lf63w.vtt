00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.983
<v Speaker 1>I find,</v>

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:04.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:05.041
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

5
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>vandelay probably one of my all time favorite guys to watch because you see it</v>

6
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>was pure chaos,</v>

7
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>but I find that people like yourself oftentimes make really good analysts</v>

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>because like you were a guy who is like looking at fighting,</v>

9
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>whether it's mma,</v>

10
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>stand up on the ground,</v>

11
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:22.284
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

12
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at it at this very analytical level.</v>

13
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>It's for me it's like asking questions.</v>

14
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my boxing coaches.</v>

15
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Kenny welding used to say that when I thought Aaron the second time he watched</v>

16
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.270
<v Speaker 1>the fight after the fact and he was like,</v>

17
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

18
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.961
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think?</v>

19
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:39.794
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

20
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

21
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>It has a lot of questions.</v>

22
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.451
<v Speaker 1>Is like,</v>

23
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:42.871
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

24
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:43.760
<v Speaker 1>He has a lot of questions.</v>

25
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

26
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>every time you do something you're asking them a question and then I'm sorry,</v>

27
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>every time he does something,</v>

28
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>he's asking you a question and you're answering him with like,</v>

29
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this and what are you going to do about what I'm doing?</v>

30
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>And he's just asking me why are you doing that?</v>

31
00:00:57.301 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing that?</v>

32
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

33
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>he's saying he's asking all the questions,</v>

34
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>but he has no answers.</v>

35
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>So he's asking me questions.</v>

36
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving him matches and um,</v>

37
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I think that's Kinda how I watched fight.</v>

38
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.053
<v Speaker 1>So how I fought,</v>

39
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I would try to do something and see what you're doing because of that.</v>

40
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>You kind of play with that and feel it.</v>

41
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

42
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's how I watch other people fly to watch.</v>

43
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>When I watch guys fight,</v>

44
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:18.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

45
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:19.411
<v Speaker 1>what is he doing?</v>

46
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Why is he doing that?</v>

47
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Is he trying to set something up?</v>

48
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Is this guy going to react?</v>

49
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>How is that guy going to react to that?</v>

50
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>What's he going to do about him?</v>

51
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>What's he going to do about his strengths?</v>

52
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>He knows he's coming in with these strengths.</v>

53
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>So how is he going to try and take those things away?</v>

54
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>he just going to try to impose his own strengths.</v>

56
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.103
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

57
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.851
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

58
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>that's what fighting is.</v>

59
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:42.201
<v Speaker 1>It's be making yourself as comfortable as you can be at all times while making</v>

60
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>the other guy as uncomfortable as he can be.</v>

61
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.321
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

62
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what I,</v>

63
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I tried to look at and I tried to see if guys play like that,</v>

64
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>how the,</v>

65
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>how are they going to play that game?</v>

66
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 1>That completely makes sense that you had that kind of style with that approach.</v>

68
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

69
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I just always admired the way you would set things up.</v>

70
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>You always had a real technical style,</v>

71
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.521
<v Speaker 1>which I mean,</v>

72
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

73
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>I admire chaos to admire those Melvin manhoef dudes too.</v>

74
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I admire vandelay like maybe more than anybody just because it was so wild to</v>

76
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:18.714
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

77
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.711
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

78
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I find,</v>

79
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I find that for analysis like Dominick Cruz is another guy I think knocks it out</v>

80
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>of park because he's so,</v>

81
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 1>so smart and his assessment of risk and reward and putting yourself in a</v>

82
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>position where your opponent doesn't exactly know what you're going to do,</v>

83
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know how he's gonna react because you're,</v>

84
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>you have this awkward style that you've seen other people react to for a long</v>

85
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

86
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>But for them it's like this new thing.</v>

87
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>They're standing in front of this guy who's switching stances and bouncing and</v>

88
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>moving up and down and back and forth,</v>

89
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>and you're not exactly sure what the fuck he's doing,</v>

90
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>but he knows what you're going to do because he's so used to doing it to regular</v>

91
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:57.241
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

92
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>like everybody who stands like you,</v>

93
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.730
<v Speaker 1>like certain guys that you have that like more Thai style and God there.</v>

94
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>There's so much that they're giving a guy in that situation and when you got a</v>

95
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>guy like dominick Cruz,</v>

96
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>like he's not predictable at all.</v>

97
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>He's like flipping stances and moving around and throwing punches from these</v>

98
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>weird fucking angles where you would swear he's doing it wrong.</v>

99
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

100
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>It's for me,</v>

102
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I always look at the way someone explained something to me is the easiest way to</v>

103
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.304
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>

104
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>And Ben asked Grin.</v>

105
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.793
<v Speaker 1>Tyron said,</v>

106
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Ben Likes to cause scrambles,</v>

107
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what dom does.</v>

109
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>He's causing scrambles on the feet because he's.</v>

110
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>He's not in the traditional position.</v>

111
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:38.900
<v Speaker 1>He's not in.</v>

112
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>He's not coming at you like everybody else does.</v>

113
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>So what he's doing is initiating and scrambled right away.</v>

114
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.290
<v Speaker 1>When you're.</v>

115
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>When you get a guy on top of you like Rda and he's good at establishing</v>

116
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:49.714
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

117
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>if you can create a scramble,</v>

118
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>then you have a better chance of getting out than if you,</v>

119
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>than if you just try to use basic technique.</v>

120
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And Dominic is comfortable in those scrambles.</v>

121
00:03:59.231 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

122
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>he's been in them so many times.</v>

123
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>When you react you have like three or four reactions.</v>

124
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>But he has like 22.</v>

125
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.473
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

126
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

127
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>he did a great breakdown.</v>

129
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>A cure from the underground cure genesis.</v>

130
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>He uh,</v>

132
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find that he put it up today.</v>

133
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.931
<v Speaker 1>He put up a,</v>

134
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

135
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.170
<v Speaker 1>an article breaking down all the variables of dominick Cruz's footwork.</v>

136
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting stuff because you don't until you see it as a list,</v>

137
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>like all the different things he does.</v>

138
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And kubrick did an awesome job of,</v>

139
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>of just sort of a breaking down all the different things in his fights and it</v>

140
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>just makes you realize like,</v>

141
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:39.731
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

142
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>that guy's got a lot of options to like someone was,</v>

143
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Ludwig,</v>

144
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>was saying that he doesn't think he has good technique.</v>

145
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>And how can you say that though,</v>

146
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>because he lands so many punches,</v>

147
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>like how can you say it?</v>

148
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Like it might not look like everybody else's.</v>

149
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>But goddamn,</v>

150
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.573
<v Speaker 1>it's working.</v>

151
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

152
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.631
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

153
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy how effective it is.</v>

154
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.671
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

155
00:04:57.671 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>this is all this stuff that,</v>

156
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>that Kirk wrote down,</v>

157
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>all the different stuff that dominic does.</v>

158
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.861
<v Speaker 1>Pretty interesting,</v>

159
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.694
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 1>A neo footwork is what people are calling it,</v>

161
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:11.014
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

162
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So like a Tj dillashaw style.</v>

163
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>He's got a very interesting style too.</v>

164
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

165
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.163
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

166
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I hit pads with Dwayne recently.</v>

167
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne showed me some stuff and one of the things he's doing is all he's</v>

168
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>switched stances.</v>

169
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>He's doing like these you're switching and throwing punches as you're switching.</v>

170
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of this switch stance stuff that he's rick really incorporating</v>

171
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>into these combinations.</v>

172
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>And you see it a lot from tj.</v>

173
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean Tj is as comfortable from a south paws.</v>

174
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>He is from an Orthodox and he's doing a lot of these switch moves.</v>

175
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Like they're,</v>

176
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.540
<v Speaker 1>they're hitting pads with these and they're very confused,</v>

177
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.143
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

178
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 1>So remember when I said I don't like that style,</v>

179
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>that Geeky pseudo style because not because,</v>

180
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>but dominic style,</v>

181
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>that style I think is the style to beat that.</v>

182
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>The reason I say that is because the way dominic is approaching it,</v>

183
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>he's approaching it from a educated,</v>

184
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.471
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

185
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>more educated,</v>

186
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>more studious place.</v>

187
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>These guys are approaching it from trying to get you to buy the wolf ticket.</v>

188
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

189
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.541
<v Speaker 1>so they're.</v>

190
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>They're giving you these weird looks because that's gonna make you get off</v>

191
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:25.431
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>

192
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:25.671
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

193
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>I'd stand there for them.</v>

194
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Be The guy that's just a target.</v>

195
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>But dom is giving you these looks from a fighting perspective.</v>

196
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>He's always in position to fight those guys.</v>

197
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:35.631
<v Speaker 1>When you're.</v>

198
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:36.520
<v Speaker 1>When you're breakdancing,</v>

199
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're not in position to react.</v>

200
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Dom is always imposition to react and that's why I think that style is the style</v>

201
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>that beats the other style.</v>

202
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>10 out of 10 times.</v>

203
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>What's really interesting is I don't recall anybody before dominick Cruz doing</v>

204
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:51.854
<v Speaker 1>it like that.</v>

205
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>A really don't it.</v>

206
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of what.</v>

207
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

208
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:56.811
<v Speaker 1>it's limited,</v>

209
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 1>but Mohammed Ali did a lot of things like that with his boxing,</v>

210
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>the rope and open his footwork that that's,</v>

212
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a part of it.</v>

213
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a part of what dom does.</v>

214
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Dom does it for MMA,</v>

215
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>so he has to be aware of the kicks,</v>

216
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 1>tie ups and clenches.</v>

217
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

218
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>how many times do you see guys press dom on the fence?</v>

219
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.303
<v Speaker 1>Almost never.</v>

220
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

221
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely.</v>
