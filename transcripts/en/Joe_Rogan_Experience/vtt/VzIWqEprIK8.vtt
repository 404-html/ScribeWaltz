00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on my second photo book.</v>

3
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>My first one came out and uh,</v>

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>the second one's going to be pretty cool cause it's all my North Korea shots.</v>

5
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:10.374
<v Speaker 1>That'll be crazy.</v>

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

7
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>You went to North Korea to where?</v>

8
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>We used to get that visa a few years ago.</v>

9
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>So it was a sad when Kim Jong Il was still alive.</v>

10
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>it was a Kim Jong Il.</v>

12
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>They'll let last days of Kim Jong Il before Kim Jong Moon.</v>

14
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a,</v>

17
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:25.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>like when I was in new Iran,</v>

19
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>just like they point you with what you're supposed to look at.</v>

20
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Don't look over here.</v>

21
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a propaganda to how much time did you spend a North Korea?</v>

22
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>About a week I was in Pyongyang and the areas around Pyongyang and then I went</v>

23
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>there via Beijing and then from there up to Mongolia,</v>

24
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>then over to Butan what was North Korea life?</v>

25
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Just sad,</v>

26
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>this poor people who are scared of their government.</v>

28
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

29
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>my tour guides since I went there alone,</v>

30
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>they were very suspicious of me.</v>

31
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>So sure.</v>

32
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>You put two tour spies on me,</v>

33
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>the Nice one who talked to me and the main one who just skeleton took notes and</v>

34
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>every day the guy would ask me basically the same question.</v>

35
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like when a detective is trying to peel the layers of onion skin off.</v>

36
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So you said you're a businessman.</v>

37
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:13.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

38
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:14.634
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.271
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

40
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>

41
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.231
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

42
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:16.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I edit books,</v>

44
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>which is true mine and it's a really,</v>

45
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>what are the books about it?</v>

46
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:21.991
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

47
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:22.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>often they're not that good at winging it.</v>

51
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you're all putting one hotel,</v>

52
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you and the Dutch tourists and the Australians.</v>

54
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's in the one hotel across the bridge that's with men,</v>

55
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:34.951
<v Speaker 1>with rifles.</v>

56
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not going anywhere.</v>

57
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>And so every day they go on their buses and I get in the car and the Australians</v>

58
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>recognize me,</v>

59
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>the Brits recognize me and they all want photos.</v>

60
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>And you're walking to the,</v>

61
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.214
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.811
<v Speaker 1>whatever that,</v>

64
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>that room is the,</v>

65
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:50.904
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

66
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>the room where the north and south meet,</v>

67
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>whether they come in through the northern door and the southern doors,</v>

69
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>that blue room on the Dsj,</v>

70
00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.721
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

72
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll come up with a joint.</v>

73
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.651
<v Speaker 1>The JSA,</v>

74
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>the joint security area,</v>

75
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:03.684
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

76
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I pulled one of the Australians to the side.</v>

77
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

78
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>can you please call your friends off me?</v>

79
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Because my tour spy is starting to ask me really weird questions about why</v>

80
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>people want their photo with me.</v>

81
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm caught being in movies,</v>

82
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.784
<v Speaker 1>writing books,</v>

83
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>rock and roll,</v>

84
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm going downtown for a meeting that I might not get out of.</v>

85
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And so he cooled out all his Australian friends.</v>

86
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>But then there's this one British guy who just kept getting in my face with the</v>

87
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>camera cause y'all are getting taken to the same places.</v>

88
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'll never forget this.</v>

89
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:35.994
<v Speaker 1>My tour guide,</v>

90
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>who for the previous three days was like,</v>

91
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>his English was from school like Ha Henry.</v>

92
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

93
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>he went from that to how does this guy know you?</v>

94
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden his English was as good as mine.</v>

95
00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

96
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

97
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not good at lying.</v>

98
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.921
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

99
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I met him in the breakfast room.</v>

100
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:51.631
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

101
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's hot for me.</v>

102
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:53.011
<v Speaker 1>I have no,</v>

103
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I just tried to explain it away and I just had to kind of go,</v>

104
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:56.701
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

105
00:02:56.701 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>and I had to try and avoid this guy and I,</v>

106
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.241
<v Speaker 1>I was getting,</v>

107
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I was really nervous the last day I was there when they finally took me back to</v>

108
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>the airport in Beijing.</v>

109
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.621
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

110
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.101
<v Speaker 1>damn man,</v>

111
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>am I really getting on this plane?</v>

112
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And when the plane took off,</v>

113
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:08.951
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

114
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

115
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.971
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

116
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I did that,</v>

117
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>but why wouldn't you just say,</v>

118
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm a musician.</v>

119
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm a good,</v>

120
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.690
<v Speaker 1>we will let you inform.</v>

121
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I went on a tourist visa and if you claim any of that,</v>

122
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get tons of scrutiny and they're not going to let you in.</v>

123
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>They won't let you in if you're an artist.</v>

124
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.551
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

125
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:25.384
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not,</v>

126
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.321
<v Speaker 1>because they're just,</v>

127
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:26.951
<v Speaker 1>they fear it.</v>

128
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:27.461
<v Speaker 1>They fear what?</v>

129
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>You'll go back to the mainland with something in the wrong because you're a</v>

130
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.511
<v Speaker 1>public person,</v>

131
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>they don't want it.</v>

132
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>But they absolutely let,</v>

133
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134

139
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:41.861
<v Speaker 1>That'll work out.</v>

140
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:42.610

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating dinner with this guy and his amazing wife,</v>

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>her cousin,</v>

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>a new show,</v>

166
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>the woman,</v>

167
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>her cousin calls her and says,</v>

168
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>your friend Henry's on TV.</v>

169
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

170
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Achmed dropped his fork and said,</v>

171
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>we've got to go.</v>

172
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.250
<v Speaker 1>We have to get you to your,</v>

173
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.011
<v Speaker 1>your hotel.</v>

174
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>You got to pack up right now we just go to the airport,</v>

175
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>check in,</v>

176
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.173
<v Speaker 1>check your luggage,</v>

177
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>find a corner,</v>

178
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>put your face in it and wait for the flight.</v>

179
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.493
<v Speaker 1>And I got to the,</v>

180
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I got to the airport like four hours early because you said you just,</v>

181
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you got to go.</v>

182
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

183
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And so I just sat there in the airport with my face down and then eventually got</v>

184
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:48.161
<v Speaker 1>on like,</v>

185
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:48.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:48.601

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>the 3:00 AM to Dubai and I was out of there.</v>

188
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

189
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>What would have happened if you get caught questions,</v>

191
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>which leads to more questions and you just don't know.</v>

192
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 1>It turns into like,</v>

193
00:04:59.081 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

194
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 1>he's been interrogated for the last three months and we don't know.</v>

195
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 1>And since I'm not a hot looking girl,</v>

196
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>President Clinton's not coming to rescue me.</v>

198
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.400
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

199
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 1>and so those are the two countries I've been to where don't tell them what you</v>

200
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>do with what I was instructed before I left.</v>

201
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

202
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
