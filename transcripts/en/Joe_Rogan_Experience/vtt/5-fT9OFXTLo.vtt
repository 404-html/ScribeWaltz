<v Speaker 1>It was the original plan.</v>

65
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.270
<v Speaker 1>At first we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do you think about red band?</v>

<v Speaker 3>acid made a decision not to do it </v>

71
00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 3>anymore in my life because I've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a point where my brain,</v>

72
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I just want to keep my brain a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit together and it was together.</v>

73
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.960

90
00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:20.440

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.210

<v Speaker 1>He realized how brilliant something is </v>

96
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.370
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you're high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it about that?</v>

97
00:04:37.371 --> 00:04:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Why do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you have to get high to,</v>

98
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>to realize that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

99
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It seems silly when you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We felt everything.</v>

104
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how like you go to the movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you go to the movies you're on </v>

<v Speaker 1>It was from a different angle.</v>

110
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:13.730
<v Speaker 1>You're watching acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.481
<v Speaker 1>have ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a perfect volume to rip you </v>

120
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could hear it,</v>

121
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:42.791
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana and Dana and I were watching that </v>

122
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:43.580
<v Speaker 1>the other day and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

123
00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen this a thousand times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I still like watching it.</v>

124
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:52.651
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing if you're there live </v>

125
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:52.651
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes before the UFC actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts,</v>

126
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:52.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to be in your seat.</v>

127
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 1>You have to be so good to like whoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

128
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that guy loves fights like </v>
<v Speaker 1>he just.</v>

129
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:02.591
<v Speaker 1>He nailed it to perfect beats to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect fucking punches and kicks and </v>

130
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>gets you pumped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely do.</v>

131
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

132
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:06.660
<v Speaker 1>it never wears out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

133
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it hundreds of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many times I've seen </v>

134
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

135
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean every UFC star have done at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 us' and you're there.</v>

136
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.680
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting food when that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

137
00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because between spikes between spike and</v>

138
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>regular UFC is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've done over 100,</v>

139
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>so been over a thousand fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

140
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>here's the best one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It and we need it.</v>

141
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're there as a civilian and on,</v>

142
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.990
<v Speaker 1>it just goes from Babo rally and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>locks down here.</v>

143
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.270
<v Speaker 1>You just see a picture and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>silver saying,</v>

144
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 1>when I go back tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to knock his fucking mouth </v>

145
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 1>block right now.</v>

146
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Think about it on the acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now his head just came out and I think </v>

147
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.880
<v Speaker 1>it was vetoed and it was just a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

148
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was fucking Marlon Brando </v>
<v Speaker 1>is superman.</v>

149
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.720
<v Speaker 1>The fucking heads around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like you're going down in New </v>

150
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.900
<v Speaker 1>York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got water.</v>

151
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.510
<v Speaker 1>They were judging them and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>heads will.</v>

152
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:09.511
<v Speaker 1>That's the brilliance about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That at one point in the UFC as a </v>

153
00:07:09.511 --> 00:07:12.871
<v Speaker 1>civilian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just gets very dark and it's just a </v>

154
00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:12.871
<v Speaker 1>perfect timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin,</v>

155
00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>you see a head pop back tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take them pound them </v>

156
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

157
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just gotTa keep showing little </v>

158
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>tidbits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and they showed a veto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they went to John Jones,</v>

160
00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:29.140
<v Speaker 1>then they went to Jake Ellensburg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just so well done.</v>

161
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Every time that show a new allied or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ducks crowd explodes and it's when you </v>

162
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.630
<v Speaker 1>watch another sporting event.</v>

163
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Now it's so below that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

164
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I went to a Laker game last year </v>
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>

165
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against Wade waves team though he might </v>

166
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Miami here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a fucking great game,</v>

167
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>but there was a lot of lols in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of lows in it at the UFC.</v>

168
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:52.360
<v Speaker 1>When Bruce Buffer says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what you gotTa do,</v>

169
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Go for 22 fucking minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like glass.</v>

170
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get a hot dog,</v>

171
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We argue that fucking thing.</v>

172
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>We now want a fucking game stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge that they tell you that courtesy </v>

173
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.470
<v Speaker 1>and what that is Fox had done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

174
00:08:07.471 --> 00:08:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prelim cards,</v>

175
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.150
<v Speaker 1>but then the main card started saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

176
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7:00</v>

177
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.330
<v Speaker 1>PM and if the main card starts at 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM,</v>

178
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.550
<v Speaker 1>we have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the prelims are all done,</v>

179
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.370
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you get 20 minutes for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights are supposed to start.</v>

180
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.890
<v Speaker 1>So we don't start fights early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to wait until paperview starts.</v>

181
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get like five first round </v>
<v Speaker 1>knockouts in the early fights.</v>

182
00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're just like,</v>

183
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we run out quick and it was </v>

184
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.370
<v Speaker 1>weird because this particular UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>started off.</v>

185
00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:37.371
<v Speaker 1>I think we gave Ruediger as wherever he </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Paul Taylor and beat up fast and </v>

186
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 1>then Kingsley came out against Romero </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hit him with violent gladiator fuck </v>

187
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these to the body and like fuck man,</v>

188
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you can feel bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could feel the fucking chimney </v>

189
00:08:54.391 --> 00:08:56.500
<v Speaker 1>strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda have the asset.</v>

190
00:08:56.501 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I was finding myself like this and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked around and adjust myself.</v>

191
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.990
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check yourself before you wreck </v>

192
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:05.990
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

193
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're not high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dude's a specimen or specimen it.</v>

194
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.530
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of like a fucking solid 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>

195
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.350
<v Speaker 1>He's got a 12 pack on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those dudes.</v>

196
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 1>You look at his back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these crazy striations in </v>

197
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 1>their super athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

198
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.831
<v Speaker 1>It was fun shit with those football </v>
<v Speaker 1>players on another level to another </v>

199
00:09:26.061 --> 00:09:29.450
<v Speaker 1>level of athleticism and Kingsbury </v>
<v Speaker 1>smashed that dude.</v>

200
00:09:29.451 --> 00:09:34.451
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those guys every time you </v>

201
00:09:34.451 --> 00:09:36.131
<v Speaker 1>see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's been training for three </v>

202
00:09:36.131 --> 00:09:36.131
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:09:36.131 --> 00:09:36.131
<v Speaker 1>he makes these leaps and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

204
00:09:36.131 --> 00:09:36.190

<v Speaker 1>there's some dudes to just get so good </v>
<v Speaker 1>so quick.</v>

209
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch like John Jones,</v>

210
00:09:45.831 --> 00:09:47.900
<v Speaker 1>the first fight that he had a um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.400
<v Speaker 1>or even the fight with Stephan Bonner.</v>

212
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked promising but bought or made </v>

213
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.400
<v Speaker 1>it to the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>everything like that and did some wild </v>

215
00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

217
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.460
<v Speaker 1>He's unorthodox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you see them now and you go,</v>

218
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:05.990
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid is on another level to another.</v>

219
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.360
<v Speaker 1>The way he handled Brandon Vera and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

220
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean his last fight was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just proved it.</v>

221
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Brian painters a fucking stud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just manhandled that kid.</v>

222
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.550
<v Speaker 1>He was on top of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time there was an exchange,</v>

223
00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:21.551
<v Speaker 1>he was on top controlling the position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was never remotely threatened and </v>

224
00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:21.551
<v Speaker 1>squeezing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

225
00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:22.580
<v Speaker 1>The kids a beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

226
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Bader is a fucking gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do would you just stand next to that </v>

227
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.451
<v Speaker 1>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the biggest tool fibers out </v>

228
00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:33.311
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that Jon Jones is able to </v>

229
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:33.311
<v Speaker 1>handle him like that.</v>

230
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:33.500
<v Speaker 1>It was like a half second where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like a scrum,</v>

231
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>like he tried to flip it and get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way over and then John's got out</v>

232
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:41.391
<v Speaker 1>of that and it was done in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones has two brothers and both of </v>

<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did the countdown,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>totally different things.</v>

278
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 1>You met him in Boston?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ran into him at the hotel.</v>

279
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Is it black people are rappers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

309
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.150
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing what they thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>about was rich when they were little,</v>

310
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>so it's always them holding a bowl of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>

311
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Cereal and cars and put women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

313
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.120
<v Speaker 1>this looks like rich stuff for while.</v>

314
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Got a urinal installed in his house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with that.</v>

315
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:26.191
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially one of those flashlights </v>

316
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:26.191
<v Speaker 1>splashes here and I'll say the cake in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

319

<v Speaker 1>but it's been rejected by plumbers.</v>

322
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Plumbers don't like it because it cuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>back on the maintenance,</v>

323
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 1>so they try to say unsanitary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in actuality the other ones are more</v>

324
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>unsanitary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>
