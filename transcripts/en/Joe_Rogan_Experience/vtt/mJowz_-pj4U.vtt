00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Just some ramblings from this morning.</v>

49
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.361
<v Speaker 1>Important stuff.</v>

52
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the first thing that I,</v>

53
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I've written in this notebook.</v>

55
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I've not been doing handwriting lunch at all in the last years,</v>

56
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>probably mostly digital,</v>

57
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>which is not good because I actually majored in English.</v>

58
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.471
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

59
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you definitely lose your ability to write words.</v>

60
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:23.051
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

61
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I tried riding in,</v>

62
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason I wrote mostly in all caps,</v>

65
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>cause I just mostly just write notes.</v>

67
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 1>But I tried writing with like lowercase letters and then I tried writing in</v>

68
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 1>cursive and my cursive is like,</v>

69
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like I have to relearn it.</v>

70
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I was finding and just like trailing off at the end of certain words.</v>

72
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>But I blended all together.</v>

73
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>He what?</v>

74
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I blended all together with capital and lower case o.</v>

75
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Why you do that?</v>

76
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

77
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>well just as a normal person would proper grammar.</v>

78
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were just mixing them up randomly.</v>

79
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

80
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

81

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.671
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

83
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I did write my,</v>

84
00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:56.020

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:46.741
<v Speaker 1>That I think that standing from this Guy Sokol who first trolled a lot of the</v>

154
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>postmodern journals and he was the first,</v>

155
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>and so it's called a socal hoax to do that kind of trolling.</v>

156
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to figure out who's who.</v>

157
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.821
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

158
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to figure out what's the hoax.</v>

159
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I got a trick by that.</v>

160
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>There's this one thing called the postmodernism generator online.</v>

161
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a computer that writes articles that puts all of this fancy language</v>

162
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>together and I,</v>

163
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>someone sent it to me and I showed it to my teacher and I was like,</v>

164
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.121
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

165
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

166
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>this is saying something pretty interesting.</v>

167
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

168
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>it was horse shit.</v>

169
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>What do you a,</v>

171
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of all this?</v>

173
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Hoaxing you've been hoaxed twice then you just admitted in the first admitted to</v>

174
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:23.504
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

175
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

176
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that you sort of have to have the right to,</v>

177
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>to hoax a hoax to be wrong,</v>

178
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>to mess up.</v>

179
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

180
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>that's not messing up.</v>

181
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>That's deceiving people.</v>

182
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.863
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

183
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

184
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of have the right to do that too.</v>

185
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have the right to troll.</v>

186
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

187
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the right to impersonate,</v>

188
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>but I have the right to get trolled and be wrong.</v>

189
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

190
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the right to impersonate.</v>

191
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't have a verified account.</v>

192
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Pretend you'd Joey Diaz.</v>

193
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

194
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>

195
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>But harmless trolling like that guy did to you.</v>

196
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that kind of like part of freedom?</v>

197
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

198
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

199
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

200
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Just comes down this info from social networks because it's wrong.</v>

201
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense.</v>

202
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

203
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.710
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

204
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.531
<v Speaker 1>it also depends on,</v>

205
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:06.364
<v Speaker 1>does that make sense?</v>

206
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.623
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

207
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>like if someone is purposely,</v>

208
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.861
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

209
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you find some Chinese bought that's purposely disseminating</v>

210
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.140
<v Speaker 1>incorrect and negative information about maybe a potential presidential</v>

211
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>

212
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Let's pick one Tulsi Gabbert there are disseminating fake news about her.</v>

213
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know for sure that it's fake,</v>

214
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 1>you know for sure who the,</v>

215
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.981
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you know,</v>

216
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>but you know for sure who the source of it is.</v>

217
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that should be taken down?</v>

218
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that if it's illegal it should be taken down.</v>

219
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>If it's illegal.</v>

220
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

222
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>But it was just lies then.</v>

223
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>That could be illegal.</v>

224
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a lawyer so I,</v>

225
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:52.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to position the network or just like advocate for other networks to</v>

226
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>take more of a neutral stance.</v>

227
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>There's this cool thing called the Manila principles,</v>

228
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 3>which the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote with a bunch of other Internet</v>

229
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 3>freedom groups,</v>

230
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 3>which is talking about how digital and intermediaries should,</v>

231
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be making subjective decisions about what's getting taken down and</v>

232
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 3>should require a court order now with a DNS provider or you know,</v>

233
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.480
<v Speaker 3>something less content focused,</v>

234
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 3>playing DNS to people don't know.</v>

235
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 3>We don't like a domain name.</v>

236
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 3>So explain what that is.</v>

237
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like where you buy domain and you know,</v>

238
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 3>but for a soldier now or we're hosting tons of content,</v>

239
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 3>so it's harder for us because we see illegal content in it.</v>

240
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 3>We should proactively take some of it down if we know it's illegal,</v>

241
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>

242
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 3>you know it's just slippery.</v>

243
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.391
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

244
00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:44.970
<v Speaker 4>I follow quite a few people who have a,</v>

245
00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:45.301
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>

246
00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say they have hoax accounts,</v>

247
00:06:46.591 --> 00:06:48.450
<v Speaker 4>but they have parody accounts and they,</v>

248
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.560
<v Speaker 4>and you know a lot of people read into it wrong and think they're being honest</v>

249
00:06:52.561 --> 00:06:54.420
<v Speaker 4>and argue with them like a,</v>

250
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:54.910
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

251
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.960
<v Speaker 4>there's progressive dad guy on Instagram your fall,</v>

252
00:06:57.961 --> 00:07:00.180
<v Speaker 4>him know exactly what you're talking about.</v>

253
00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 4>This hilarious when I fall it too.</v>

254
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:02.484
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty funny.</v>

255
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.140
<v Speaker 4>I follow quite a few of them.</v>

256
00:07:04.141 --> 00:07:07.440
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy who was the wrong skin guy who was saying he was born in the</v>

257
00:07:07.441 --> 00:07:08.310
<v Speaker 4>wrong color skin,</v>

258
00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:13.290
<v Speaker 4>that he's trans racial and he would make these ridiculous arguments about it and</v>

259
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Elwick.</v>

260
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.911
<v Speaker 4>What was his name?</v>

261
00:07:14.911 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 4>He apparently is a comic.</v>

262
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.050
<v Speaker 5>I was just thinking of this,</v>

263
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.100
<v Speaker 5>this sort of star,</v>

264
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.401
<v Speaker 5>a couple,</v>

265
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:19.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the moment they had to do it,</v>

266
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:24.100
<v Speaker 5>but let's say four years ago a lot of those troll accounts had to sort of say,</v>

267
00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:26.260
<v Speaker 5>we're not this person.</v>

268
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.861
<v Speaker 5>For instance,</v>

269
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 5>the one main one I follow is a,</v>

270
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:28.990
<v Speaker 5>is now,</v>

271
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.700
<v Speaker 5>now it's known as not Bill Walton.</v>

272
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.880
<v Speaker 5>He tweets funny sports jokes all night long after like what's on TV as though</v>

273
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:37.061
<v Speaker 5>he's Bill Walton,</v>

274
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:37.894
<v Speaker 5>Mike and Bill Walton.</v>

275
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.160
<v Speaker 5>But like at some point he had to put in the name like this is not bill Walton,</v>

276
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:44.700
<v Speaker 5>but still has quite a few followers and he's still,</v>

277
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.880
<v Speaker 5>he still gets the jokes out,</v>

278
00:07:45.881 --> 00:07:46.290
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

279
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.810
<v Speaker 4>that's from,</v>

280
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:47.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

281
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Well what's your stance on people who make accounts of your stuff?</v>

282
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.000
<v Speaker 4>Put it out there?</v>

283
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.481
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

284
00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:52.560
<v Speaker 4>I got with a lot of them,</v>

285
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

286
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

287
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.261
<v Speaker 4>there's a ton of them.</v>

288
00:07:55.261 --> 00:07:57.090
<v Speaker 4>Some of them actually do good stuff.</v>

289
00:07:57.091 --> 00:08:00.360
<v Speaker 4>Like they make little clips and they put those clips online and it's actually,</v>

290
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.320
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>

291
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.760
<v Speaker 4>It's good for people enjoy the show.</v>

292
00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:07.410
<v Speaker 4>They get a little one minute snippet of things and then some of them just will</v>

293
00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:10.860
<v Speaker 4>pretend to be me and contact people and try to book them on the show,</v>

294
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:11.880
<v Speaker 4>which is really weird.</v>

295
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

296
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.763
<v Speaker 4>I've had that.</v>

297
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.383
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

298
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.231
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

299
00:08:16.231 --> 00:08:16.441
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

300
00:08:16.441 --> 00:08:16.891
<v Speaker 4>who is that?</v>

301
00:08:16.891 --> 00:08:18.900
<v Speaker 4>Is that a 16 year old kid in Indiana?</v>

302
00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:19.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

303
00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:19.630
<v Speaker 4>who is that?</v>

304
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.463
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>

305
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.653
<v Speaker 4>it's odd.</v>

306
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.141
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

307
00:08:22.141 --> 00:08:26.670
<v Speaker 4>but it's overall like get past my own personal feelings.</v>

308
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

309
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:27.630
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

310
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:27.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

311
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.920
<v Speaker 4>because it's about me,</v>

312
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.813
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

313
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.201
<v Speaker 4>This is the,</v>

314
00:08:31.201 --> 00:08:31.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

315
00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:32.200
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

316
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.510
<v Speaker 4>this strange new ground that we're covering.</v>

317
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.241
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

318
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:40.410
<v Speaker 4>mean we've been discussing this ad nauseum on the podcast lately that</v>

319
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 4>essentially we've been dealing with 20 years of this and in those 20 years it's</v>

320
00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:46.950
<v Speaker 4>changed radically.</v>

321
00:08:46.951 --> 00:08:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

322
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.150
<v Speaker 4>what it is,</v>

323
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.610
<v Speaker 4>it's become something completely different.</v>

324
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 4>It's become something that changes public opinion on things overnight.</v>

325
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

326
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>become something where you can distribute information from,</v>

327
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 1>person to person about some,</v>

329
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

330
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>huge international news event.</v>

331
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>You could get all of your information from Twitter,</v>

332
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.850
<v Speaker 1>whether it's what happened in Venezuela or what,</v>

333
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:12.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

334
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>anywhere there's something in the world.</v>

335
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.500
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

336
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>your people are turning to social media almost before they're turn anywhere</v>

337
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:19.100
<v Speaker 1>you're looking.</v>

338
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

339
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:19.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

341
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 1>when I hear about something,</v>

342
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I almost always,</v>

343
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>before I even Google it,</v>

344
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I almost always go to Twitter and check Twitter and you know,</v>

345
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and see what's going on.</v>

346
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>And she had us that go at duck duck,</v>

347
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:30.600
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

348
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of that one?</v>

349
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:31.581
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

350
00:09:31.581 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 1>it's at,</v>

351
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like a privacy focused search engine.</v>

352
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like pretty much the only privacy alternative to Google.</v>

353
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like this idea that we say,</v>

354
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.573
<v Speaker 1>I'll just Google it.</v>

355
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.911
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

356
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Why do we,</v>

357
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean our whole process has been to like purge proprietary surveillance tools</v>

358
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:54.261
<v Speaker 1>from our company and I've been trying to get myself like getting off Facebook,</v>

359
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:55.110
<v Speaker 1>getting off Twitter,</v>

360
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 1>getting off Instagram.</v>

361
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just like there's so abusive to everybody and it's like there's brilliant</v>

362
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 1>people who work there.</v>

363
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean Instagram is such a well designed app or you can beautiful,</v>

364
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.500
<v Speaker 1>but so what do you think is abusive about it particularly?</v>

365
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 1>There's start with Twitter.</v>

366
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 1>They're all the same.</v>

367
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.840
<v Speaker 1>They're all the same.</v>

368
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

369
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they're all the same?</v>

370
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Because they're all gigantic businesses.</v>

371
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And they're all the same because none of them share their source code and they</v>

373
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 1>all spy on everybody and they don't show you what is happening behind the</v>

374
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:30.151
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>

375
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't show you what the code is doing.</v>

376
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.030
<v Speaker 1>So like in that,</v>

377
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 1>in that note I wrote to the other day,</v>

378
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like I compare it to like food transparency.</v>

379
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.293
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

380
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 1>50 years ago nobody thought about that.</v>

381
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And then 20 years ago everyone's like,</v>

382
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what's in my food white.</v>

383
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>But why wouldn't you want to know what's in your apps?</v>

384
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

385
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's super sketchy what they're doing,</v>

386
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>but how so like what,</v>

387
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:55.141
<v Speaker 1>what supers can,</v>

388
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

389
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 1>But we know that they're spying on everyone and tracking you everywhere you go.</v>

390
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>They're targeting things at you based on physical location,</v>

391
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>browser history,</v>

392
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:04.650
<v Speaker 1>even when you're not on those websites,</v>

393
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 1>some of their falling around where you're going in the Internet.</v>

394
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

395
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.260
<v Speaker 1>And so some people except that for this free search engine would free email and</v>

396
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>

397
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 1>The PSAP except the fact that a certain percentage of what they're doing is not</v>

398
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>going to be private,</v>

399
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 1>or at least their searches are not going to be probably like say if you circle</v>

400
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.270
<v Speaker 1>you thinking about buying a jeep and you searched jeeps,</v>

401
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:26.641
<v Speaker 1>you look at,</v>

402
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:26.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 1>2019 jeep and then all of a sudden all your Google ads are about jeeps,</v>

404
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

405
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:32.611
<v Speaker 1>They'll like,</v>

406
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 1>we know,</v>

407
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.750
<v Speaker 1>we know you thinking about the jeep bill and I don't think that that makes</v>

408
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.500
<v Speaker 1>people want to spend more time on Google and Facebook.</v>

409
00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>If fruity he does.</v>

410
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it freaks them out?</v>

411
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're just numb to it and so we accept it,</v>

412
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's more that.</v>

413
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:48.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

414
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:53.601
<v Speaker 1>And so there's all different layers of like what we use</v>

415
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 3>with your browsers,</v>

416
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 3>your apps,</v>

417
00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 3>your operating system,</v>

418
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 3>your food,</v>

419
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.050
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

420
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

421
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.183
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

422
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.181
<v Speaker 3>your energy.</v>

423
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:09.181
<v Speaker 3>Like all of this technology has code that's associated with it.</v>

424
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.433
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

425
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 3>and when you open up your computer,</v>

426
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 3>when you sign into a browser,</v>

427
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 3>when you open up an app,</v>

428
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 3>you are empowering that APP.</v>

429
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 3>That's how the apps of the world become huge,</v>

430
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:22.210
<v Speaker 3>monstrous corporations.</v>

431
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:23.600
<v Speaker 3>This because we all use them every day.</v>

432
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

433
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 3>So if you switch from,</v>

434
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

435
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 3>oh at Macko s to like a new Lenox or like Debbie and urban too,</v>

436
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 3>if you use brave or Firefox,</v>

437
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 3>if you um,</v>

438
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

439
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Duckduckgo is actually proprietary,</v>

440
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:38.921
<v Speaker 3>which is annoying,</v>

441
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 3>but they are very privacy focused.</v>

442
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.860
<v Speaker 3>And then there's apps,</v>

443
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 3>there's minds,</v>

444
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of,</v>

445
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 3>there's other open source of decentralized social networks out there that we can</v>

446
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 3>potentially federate with.</v>

447
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:54.450
<v Speaker 3>There's really cool new interesting protocols like dat and IPFS that are like</v>

448
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:56.570
<v Speaker 3>more torn style backend.</v>

449
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.590
<v Speaker 3>So there's actually no servers in a giant warehouse like Facebook and Google.</v>

450
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 3>It's more,</v>

451
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 3>it's fully peer to peer and we're trying to balance it because it's not like</v>

452
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:11.680
<v Speaker 3>decentralization equals good and centralization equals bad.</v>

453
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

454
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

455
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 3>in order to get a suite app like Instagram style,</v>

456
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 3>you need servers to like process video.</v>

457
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 3>And so the tech is still sort of immature in the fully peer to peer,</v>

458
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:22.520
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

459
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

460
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.940
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin style internet.</v>

461
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.710
<v Speaker 3>But we're definitely getting there.</v>

462
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.770
<v Speaker 3>And I just think it's important for people to use things that are transparent to</v>

463
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 3>them and respecting our freedom.</v>

464
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:34.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

465
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the problems with these giant companies is that once they become</v>

466
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:38.741
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

467
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:40.360
<v Speaker 4>he kind of used them as a default.</v>

468
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.120
<v Speaker 4>And it's very difficult to get people to communicate with you off of them.</v>

469
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:43.700
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

470
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

471
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 4>it's a hard to say,</v>

472
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:45.401
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

473
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:45.601
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

474
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm launching this new social media APP.</v>

475
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine you could speak to this.</v>

476
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm launching this new social media APP and,</v>

477
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:53.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

478
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.100
<v Speaker 4>I want you to join it.</v>

479
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 4>People like put them already on fucking Facebook.</v>

480
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm already on Google.</v>

481
00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm Ernie on Instagram.</v>

482
00:13:59.111 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do that,</v>

483
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:00.670
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

484
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.360
<v Speaker 4>It's too much,</v>

485
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 4>too much extra.</v>

486
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 4>And we make it a million times harder for ourselves because we're not scooping</v>

487
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:05.820
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

488
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.130
<v Speaker 3>people's contacts and,</v>

489
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

490
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.600
<v Speaker 3>taking all their information.</v>

491
00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:10.140
<v Speaker 3>You are not,</v>

492
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.910
<v Speaker 3>we're minds.</v>

493
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:11.121
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

494
00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

495
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.940
<v Speaker 3>So like when you give your address book to a App,</v>

496
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.953
<v Speaker 3>who does that?</v>

497
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Every most apps would be,</v>

498
00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:18.660
<v Speaker 3>you've gotta be an Asshole,</v>

499
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:18.980
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

500
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:19.231
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

501
00:14:19.231 --> 00:14:19.980
<v Speaker 3>but when you say,</v>

502
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.131
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

503
00:14:20.131 --> 00:14:23.370
<v Speaker 3>I want to find my friends who are on this app and you share your contacts,</v>

504
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.360
<v Speaker 3>we not supposed to do that.</v>

505
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.621
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to do that.</v>

506
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

507
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.660
<v Speaker 3>But most people do.</v>

508
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.421
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

509
00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:30.810
<v Speaker 3>your friends didn't give you permission to give Facebook their phone number.</v>

510
00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:31.644
<v Speaker 3>Do you do that?</v>

511
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 3>I probably used to like</v>

512
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:34.781
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>

513
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:35.261
<v Speaker 4>eight years ago,</v>

514
00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:35.481
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

515
00:14:35.481 --> 00:14:36.310
<v Speaker 4>But don't do it anymore.</v>

516
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.760
<v Speaker 4>I always say the same thing when it pops up kit though.</v>

517
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Fuck Outta here.</v>

518
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 4>That's always what I say.</v>

519
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:42.110
<v Speaker 4>Would you like to share your,</v>

520
00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:42.970
<v Speaker 4>your contacts?</v>

521
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

522
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:45.251
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

523
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.630
<v Speaker 4>you can't have my contacts.</v>

524
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:47.171
<v Speaker 4>You asshole.</v>

525
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're doing.</v>

526
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 4>Facebook is weird one man.</v>

527
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.003
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

528
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 4>it's such a sneaky</v>

529
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.930
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

530
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:53.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

531
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Facebook and it,</v>

532
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:55.971
<v Speaker 1>like all this,</v>

534
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:56.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

535
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

536
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 1>the congressional hearings and the inner workings of it all.</v>

537
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:05.861
<v Speaker 1>And w there the fact that it profits off of outrage.</v>

538
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>So it wants people to argue like the,</v>

539
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:10.791
<v Speaker 1>the Ai,</v>

540
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:15.791
<v Speaker 1>the computer learning specifically wants people to have like contentious debates</v>

541
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:17.684
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>

542
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Cause that keeps their eyes focused on the website.</v>

543
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>And if your eyes are focused on Facebook,</v>

544
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:23.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

545
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 1>then those Facebook ads are very valuable.</v>

546
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating,</v>

547
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:28.544
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

548
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the outrage is unavoidable on any network.</v>

549
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>

550
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

551
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Speaker 1>are you gonna are you going to take down there taking down outrage,</v>

552
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Tom?</v>

553
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:38.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

554
00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:39.080
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

555
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.531
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

556
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 1>and it just seems so inconsistent and subjective how they're applying.</v>

557
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:44.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

558
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 1>even just yesterday,</v>

559
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I think some,</v>

560
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

561
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 1>journalists got banned from Facebook.</v>

562
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

563
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

564
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send this to you Jamie.</v>

565
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's,</v>

566
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a really crazy one because they wanted her to show who her funding sources</v>

567
00:15:57.981 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 1>were and I didn't even know that there was an area where you could show that.</v>

568
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:04.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like they're making this up as they go along.</v>

569
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

570
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Kyle Kalinsky sent me this today.</v>

571
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send this to you right now.</v>

572
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:09.351
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

573
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Hang on one second.</v>

574
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.273
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

575
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.411
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

576
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very quiet,</v>

577
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.650
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately this is an audio show,</v>

578
00:16:20.651 --> 00:16:21.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's alive there.</v>

579
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

580
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.373
<v Speaker 1>Not Dead Air.</v>

581
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:23.920
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

582
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

583
00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:24.461
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

584
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:25.294
<v Speaker 1>I just sent it to you.</v>

585
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.020

<v Speaker 1>They don't communicate with anyone.</v>

600
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.030
<v Speaker 1>They've been banning legit accounts for years.</v>

601
00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.330
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whites,</v>

607
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.850
<v Speaker 1>if you post in the newsfeed,</v>

608
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:07.684
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

609
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.770
<v Speaker 1>careful,</v>

610
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.470
<v Speaker 1>this could be an unsecure website.</v>

611
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.143
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

612
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.650
<v Speaker 1>just I clicked on a link from TMZ yesterday and got the same thing from on</v>

613
00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Twitter.</v>

614
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:18.191
<v Speaker 1>Twitter.</v>

615
00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I said this might be malicious.</v>

616
00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:20.284
<v Speaker 1>They're spam.</v>

617
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.710
<v Speaker 1>There could be from minds.</v>

618
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:21.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

619
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:22.480
<v Speaker 1>it's from Tia.</v>

620
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.201
<v Speaker 1>TMZ Link.</v>

621
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:26.150
<v Speaker 1>It was clicking this like this story is on TMZ here to us.</v>

622
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 1>You the,</v>

623
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the story.</v>

624
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.950
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to keep you from going to TMZ.</v>

625
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it was the first time I've ever seen that.</v>

627
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:32.843
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

628
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

629
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:37.420
<v Speaker 1>It's probably caught up in some algorithm and I sent an actual written letter to</v>

630
00:17:37.421 --> 00:17:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Facebook about it.</v>

631
00:17:38.801 --> 00:17:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I don't get back.</v>

632
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.440
<v Speaker 1>And then there's no human written letter.</v>

633
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.080
<v Speaker 1>He wrote it with a piece of paper known now that would have been cool.</v>

634
00:17:44.081 --> 00:17:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I sign it with ink,</v>

635
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.720
<v Speaker 1>but really we had no cars.</v>

636
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Our lawyer said to you,</v>

637
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 1>that actually proves that you sent them something,</v>

638
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 1>some sort of diligence,</v>

639
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:59.270
<v Speaker 1>but there's just no recourse and it's their lost.</v>

640
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 1>So explain.</v>

641
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.750
<v Speaker 1>So if someone is trying to say on Facebook master,</v>

642
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

643
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 1>you should go check out minds.com they won't let you post that link now.</v>

644
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And what is their excuse?</v>

645
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:12.811
<v Speaker 1>They don't tell you.</v>

646
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

647
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:13.501
<v Speaker 1>they don't tell you.</v>

648
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 1>So is it because you're competing social media network?</v>

649
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.291
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

650
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get into,</v>

651
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

652
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't know?</v>

653
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say,</v>

654
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 1>just know that it does.</v>

655
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

656
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't know why it does,</v>

658
00:18:24.511 --> 00:18:24.871
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

659
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:25.171
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

660
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 1>they're calling us unsecure and I'm pretty sure that Facebook got hacked.</v>

661
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.333
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

662
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.770
<v Speaker 1>they compromise everybody's data.</v>

663
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:31.891
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

664
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 1>do you want to talk about unsecure?</v>

665
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.110
<v Speaker 1>There's no more unsecure site that exists.</v>

666
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.681
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of funny,</v>

667
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:40.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

668
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean after those hearings and uh,</v>

669
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.460
<v Speaker 1>after all the,</v>

670
00:18:44.461 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

671
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 1>the Russia stuff,</v>

672
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.401
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

673
00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:48.030
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

674
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 1>it is kind of funny calling somebody else on secure.</v>

675
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

676
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.080
<v Speaker 1>they're insecure.</v>

677
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Mark Zuckerberg was very insecure.</v>

678
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

679
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.200
<v Speaker 1>he's also stupid rich.</v>

680
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.921
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

681
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:56.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

682
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.580
<v Speaker 1>he seems like he's too rich.</v>

683
00:18:57.581 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Like he fucked up.</v>

684
00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Like he's there sipping water,</v>

685
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 1>like a robot trying to figure out what the fuck he's doing with his life.</v>

686
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that they're scared because they know they've betrayed everybody and so</v>

687
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:10.480
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get them to speak.</v>

688
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

689
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.700
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting with,</v>

690
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.500
<v Speaker 1>with Dorsey here because I,</v>

691
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

692
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.360
<v Speaker 1>give him credit for speaking,</v>

693
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.960
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is that he's not answering the question well,</v>

694
00:19:21.571 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 1>he's bringing someone else in to answer the questions in the next go round.</v>

695
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.090
<v Speaker 1>And so that should be very interesting.</v>

696
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 1>He actually didn't know the answer to those questions.</v>

697
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably doesn't know all the specifics because he's a CEO of not</v>

698
00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:33.241
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

699
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 1>but two different corporations,</v>

700
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 1>these busy shit and also Richard,</v>

701
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.330
<v Speaker 1>but true.</v>

702
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.980
<v Speaker 1>But I think that when we look at the policy that exists on these networks,</v>

703
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 1>like he is in control of the policy to large degree,</v>

704
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a board decision,</v>

705
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a decision making process,</v>

706
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but he has a large voice.</v>

707
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

708
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how large his voices,</v>

709
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I assume that's probably true,</v>

710
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.530
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things we did detail on the last podcast with Tim Pool was how he</v>

711
00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.560
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the CEO for quite a long time fired and then rehired it.</v>

712
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

713
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

714
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:02.911
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

715
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:03.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

716
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.670
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's some contention,</v>

717
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.210
<v Speaker 1>there's some issues and you know,</v>

718
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

719
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of money involved in these things and I think that plays a giant part</v>

720
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:12.930
<v Speaker 1>and how they decide to make decisions and,</v>

721
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.500
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that an advertiser in reality doesn't like,</v>

722
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 1>say you're an advertiser and you want to advertise your computer.</v>

723
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

724
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 1>And there's a video on youtube that is about something controversial.</v>

725
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Does it actually make sense for that advertiser to not show their product on</v>

726
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that controversial video?</v>

727
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Don't they want to sell computers?</v>

728
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

729
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 1>well it depends.</v>

730
00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:39.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

731
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:43.950
<v Speaker 1>if the controversial videos are about how Jews are evil and you have this video</v>

732
00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:45.980
<v Speaker 1>about Jews being evil and then you know,</v>

733
00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you're like by razor computers come on.</v>

734
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

735
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.070
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that people actually,</v>

736
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I can understand not wanting to support certain types of content and maybe</v>

737
00:20:55.811 --> 00:21:00.811
<v Speaker 1>advertisers feel like they're supporting that content by advertising next to it.</v>

738
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 1>But I also don't think that people,</v>

739
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.450
<v Speaker 1>when they're watching a controversial video on the Internet say,</v>

740
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.493
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

741
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 1>this advertiser is completely out of line for being next to this controversial</v>

743
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:14.051
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

744
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:14.261
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

745
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a,</v>

746
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 1>a healthy direction to move.</v>

747
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

748
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

749
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 1>that's one way to look at it.</v>

750
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Another way to look at it is if you are a giant company that sells things,</v>

751
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're Toyota and you're selling Tundras,</v>

752
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't want your Tundras to be associated in any way with something that you</v>

753
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 1>might think is negative.</v>

754
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 1>It's their prerogative.</v>

755
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.060
<v Speaker 1>If they're paying for advertising,</v>

756
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 1>they can kind of decide.</v>

757
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the things that's leading,</v>

758
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

759
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 1>youtube and specific,</v>

760
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.173
<v Speaker 1>and I've had</v>

761
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.940
<v Speaker 1>a ton of conversations about this there.</v>

762
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:49.010
<v Speaker 1>It's leading them specifically to try to monetize things that could be</v>

763
00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:54.010
<v Speaker 1>considered distasteful or insensitive or controversial.</v>

764
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's very frustrating to content creators when you talk to them.</v>

765
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 1>They're essentially saying that they need to do better and that their tools are</v>

766
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:03.070
<v Speaker 1>very blunt,</v>

767
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.440
<v Speaker 1>that they don't really have the correct computer learning tools to figure out</v>

768
00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:10.120
<v Speaker 1>what is offensive and why.</v>

769
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a human review system,</v>

770
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 1>which is very weird and we've run into that many times.</v>

771
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.791
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

772
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:20.080
<v Speaker 1>we'll have like a podcast with like say Tom Papa who's an uncontroversial</v>

773
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 1>fantastic standup comedian and it's like demonetized and then we're like,</v>

774
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:24.131
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

775
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:24.880
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

776
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.331
<v Speaker 1>And then we go,</v>

777
00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck can we talk about?</v>

778
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 1>We didn't talk about anything crazy.</v>

779
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's really damaging for brands when it gets the monetize right away.</v>

780
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's that initial time period that generates the most revenue.</v>

781
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

782
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Speaker 1>So when you have to go back and do it,</v>

783
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

784
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.150
<v Speaker 1>so I agree with that,</v>

785
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 1>but so we built a tool that's like a peer to peer advertising tool.</v>

786
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

787
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 1>there's two options.</v>

788
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:50.941
<v Speaker 1>You can say you earn crypto for your contributions and then which Cryptos do you</v>

789
00:22:51.581 --> 00:22:52.121
<v Speaker 1>support?</v>

790
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 1>We have an ethereum based token,</v>

791
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to support all of them.</v>

792
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 1>So what is a theory on base token?</v>

793
00:22:58.271 --> 00:22:59.830
<v Speaker 1>So it's an Erc 20 token.</v>

794
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

795
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.800
<v Speaker 1>It means that we basically reward people for all of their activities.</v>

796
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

797
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.990
<v Speaker 1>so let's say if Jamie's posted on mines and uh,</v>

798
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.220
<v Speaker 1>people love his posts,</v>

799
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.020
<v Speaker 1>he gets rewarded in some,</v>

800
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:11.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

801
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:12.783
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>

802
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.390
<v Speaker 1>How much again?</v>

803
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

804
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.680
<v Speaker 1>can I go buy one token will give you a thousand impressions.</v>

805
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

806
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.530
<v Speaker 1>so you were not focused on like,</v>

807
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.711
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

808
00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:22.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make money from this one.</v>

809
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:25.870
<v Speaker 1>We're saying one token will give you a thousand impressions or you get a</v>

810
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>thousand impressions from,</v>

811
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.860
<v Speaker 1>you get a token from 1000 impressions want when you use a token to advertise on</v>

812
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

813
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

814
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 1>you get a thousand impressions when you boost your posts with it.</v>

815
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 1>So wait a minute.</v>

816
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 1>If you use the Crypto,</v>

817
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.990
<v Speaker 1>you use a token.</v>

818
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.700
<v Speaker 1>You guarantee views.</v>

819
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

820
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Well that's word,</v>

821
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

822
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.333
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

823
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

824
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 3>you're guaranteeing people see something.</v>

825
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

826
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.133
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

827
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.920
<v Speaker 3>when you boosted it gets fed to people's newsfeed chronologically,</v>

828
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:55.281
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

829
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 3>I say so there's just a backlog.</v>

830
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.890
<v Speaker 3>So sort of like when Instagram has a sponsored posts,</v>

831
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 3>except we're not spying on people to,</v>

832
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.880
<v Speaker 3>when we send them Instagram Spaz on people to mine.</v>

833
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

834
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

835
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm stupid.</v>

836
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Help me out.</v>

837
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.953
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

838
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 3>yes they do.</v>

839
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.640
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is we just don't know.</v>

840
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:17.750
<v Speaker 3>So this is where free and open source software is just essential.</v>

841
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Like the big networks,</v>

842
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 3>there's no excuse for them not to be sharing their software.</v>

843
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

844
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you're a public forum on that scale,</v>

845
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.640
<v Speaker 3>the community just has a right to know what the algorithms are doing.</v>

846
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 3>So you think that they're not sharing their software because their software is</v>

847
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 3>encoded and designed to spy on you and extract information and sell that</v>

848
00:24:40.461 --> 00:24:41.294
<v Speaker 3>information?</v>

849
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Partially like when Jamie gives up your contacts,</v>

850
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:46.430
<v Speaker 3>when he signs up for an APP and he says,</v>

851
00:24:46.431 --> 00:24:47.240
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

852
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 3>you can get access to all my contacts.</v>

853
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of reason and they don't want people to compete with them.</v>

854
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Like anyone could actually take all of our code and make their own social</v>

855
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:55.280
<v Speaker 3>network and compete with us.</v>

856
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.240
<v Speaker 3>They could set up on their own servers and we encourage that.</v>

857
00:24:59.241 --> 00:25:02.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what like the Fed averse is called.</v>

858
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 3>That's what Elon Musk does with Tesla.</v>

859
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.980
<v Speaker 3>All of his electric patents for electric cars.</v>

860
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 3>I think that he opened up the pants.</v>

861
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:09.374
<v Speaker 3>I don't think if he,</v>

862
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 3>he opened sourced all the,</v>

863
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 3>the code of the car.</v>

864
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:13.551
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

865
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely in moving in the right direction of like he wants to build the</v>

866
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:18.164
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

867
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

868
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 3>And he also wants to save the world.</v>

869
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean he legitimately has any also house shit,</v>

870
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.890
<v Speaker 3>load of money and just got enough money.</v>

871
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

872
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.240
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

873
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a big factor with those guys.</v>

874
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.620
<v Speaker 3>But don't,</v>

875
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that it's almost like it's going to help whatever network does</v>

876
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 3>that Oh is more transparent,</v>

877
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 3>stop spying on people.</v>

878
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.280
<v Speaker 3>Is More community run and evolved.</v>

879
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't that be the network that you would think humanity would want to stick</v>

880
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:48.440
<v Speaker 3>with in the long term?</v>

881
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Like wouldn't that be a good move of them?</v>

882
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Yes and no.</v>

883
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 3>For the average person.</v>

884
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.570
<v Speaker 3>What are they losing when they get on Facebook or Google?</v>

885
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:58.310
<v Speaker 3>What are the what?</v>

886
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.210
<v Speaker 3>What's bad?</v>

887
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.250
<v Speaker 3>What happens now their legs are going down,</v>

888
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.430
<v Speaker 3>everybody's likes are going down and that makes everyone very sad.</v>

889
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

890
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:05.451
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

891
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:06.261
<v Speaker 3>the algorithms,</v>

892
00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:11.261
<v Speaker 3>you're only reaching 5% of your own followers organically on Facebook now,</v>

893
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 3>and they're starting to change the chronological feed on Instagram too.</v>

894
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.150
<v Speaker 3>And they know that this causes depression and they're still doing it because</v>

895
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:22.220
<v Speaker 3>they know that the,</v>

896
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

897
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.540
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

898
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.890
<v Speaker 3>they think they're better at showing you what you want to see than you are and</v>

899
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:28.850
<v Speaker 3>they want to make money from it.</v>

900
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by they know that this causes depression?</v>

901
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.760
<v Speaker 3>They've done studies about mental health in relation to,</v>

902
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:41.921
<v Speaker 3>actually Facebook got exposed like five years ago for doing a secret study on</v>

903
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 3>like a few million users where they were injecting both positive and negative</v>

904
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 3>content into the newsfeed and they proved that they could affect people's moods.</v>

905
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 3>This was with Princeton and there's a huge backlash and they're like,</v>

906
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:53.251
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

907
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:54.084
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

908
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.583
<v Speaker 3>Whoops.</v>

909
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.301
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

910
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:00.780
<v Speaker 1>But this isn't of injecting negative or positive content.</v>

911
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:05.760
<v Speaker 1>This is just moving these images or these posts around so that less people</v>

912
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.190
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] there's two different topics there.</v>

913
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.640
<v Speaker 3>The basic news feed on Facebook is now a mysterious conglomeration of thousands</v>

914
00:27:15.181 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 3>of variables,</v>

915
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.010
<v Speaker 3>which we don't know.</v>

916
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

917
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.080
<v Speaker 3>but additionally,</v>

918
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:19.950
<v Speaker 3>like a few years ago,</v>

919
00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:24.951
<v Speaker 3>they were exposed for having been experimenting with people's brains.</v>

920
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.341
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

921
00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I remember that now.</v>

922
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I remember that now that that's right.</v>

923
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

924
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking like,</v>

925
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:31.591
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

926
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:32.424
<v Speaker 1>that's kinda creepy.</v>

927
00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] on the people that are on their site and they're not telling these</v>

928
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.390
<v Speaker 1>people that are experimenting on them.</v>

929
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

930
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 1>But do they,</v>

931
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

932
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.950
<v Speaker 1>if they're trying to make it better,</v>

933
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

934
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 1>do you think that they're really,</v>

935
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a factor that it acts,</v>

936
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 1>it actually mean how does it cause depression if they're just,</v>

937
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.890
<v Speaker 1>if your images or your posts are not being seen as by as many people</v>

938
00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:02.330
<v Speaker 3>have you talked to kids posting on social media and their reactions to how many</v>

939
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:04.074
<v Speaker 3>likes they're getting,</v>

940
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.980
<v Speaker 3>they get very,</v>

941
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.993
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

942
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.183
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

943
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.153
<v Speaker 3>concerned.</v>

944
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:11.401
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

945
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:14.100
<v Speaker 3>that seems like more of a problem with that.</v>

946
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.270
<v Speaker 3>It is both.</v>

947
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.841
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

948
00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 3>it is on both sides being addicted to likes as some sort of,</v>

949
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:21.024
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

950
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

951
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.480
<v Speaker 3>to weird dope.</v>

952
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

953
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:23.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

954
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 3>It's not healthy and no,</v>

955
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.880
<v Speaker 3>we need to learn to not care about that.</v>

956
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the core purpose of a social network is to subscribe to someone</v>

957
00:28:32.161 --> 00:28:32.994
<v Speaker 3>and see their stuff.</v>

958
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

959
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 3>And when people subscribe to you,</v>

960
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.270
<v Speaker 3>they see your stuff,</v>

961
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:36.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

962
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:41.990
<v Speaker 3>So when you spend years building up a following on social media and say you earn</v>

963
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 3>100,000 followers or something,</v>

964
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 3>and then suddenly the network says,</v>

965
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.190
<v Speaker 3>mm,</v>

966
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.023
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

967
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.790
<v Speaker 3>now your friends can't see that anymore.</v>

968
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.680
<v Speaker 3>That's not cool.</v>

969
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

970
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.690
<v Speaker 3>and even to like Twitter's default newsfeed is no longer chronological.</v>

971
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 3>You have to click it to go chronological and then it defaults back to their</v>

972
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:03.270
<v Speaker 3>weird algorithm thing.</v>

973
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.440
<v Speaker 3>So we're saying,</v>

974
00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:04.760
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

975
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 3>a hundred percent organic,</v>

976
00:29:05.731 --> 00:29:06.391
<v Speaker 3>chronological,</v>

977
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:08.340
<v Speaker 3>raw forever as default.</v>

978
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 3>And then if you want to curate,</v>

979
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:10.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

980
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:13.410
<v Speaker 3>algorithms or have recommended stuff come in as a alternative,</v>

981
00:29:13.411 --> 00:29:14.244
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

982
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 3>But that is the core purpose of social media is to connect with people that</v>

983
00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:20.510
<v Speaker 3>follow you and the other way around.</v>

984
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the purposes,</v>

985
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:27.080
<v Speaker 1>like why do you think Facebook would decide to have things not in chronological</v>

986
00:29:27.081 --> 00:29:29.990
<v Speaker 1>order and only be seen by 5% of your followers?</v>

987
00:29:29.991 --> 00:29:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what will it be the benefit in that for them?</v>

988
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.133
<v Speaker 1>Revenue.</v>

989
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:33.471
<v Speaker 1>Revenue.</v>

990
00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:34.304
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>

991
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.450
<v Speaker 1>How's that generate revenue?</v>

992
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:40.510
<v Speaker 1>They just know that they can keep you on the app better if you had less likes.</v>

993
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:43.260
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

994
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>If your your stuff seen by less people,</v>

995
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:45.934
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense.</v>

996
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

997
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It sort of works both ways.</v>

998
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:54.271
<v Speaker 1>I think that they think they know the people that you're going to react to the</v>

999
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:55.894
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>

1000
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.550
<v Speaker 1>So as a consumer,</v>

1001
00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 1>when you're getting that content,</v>

1002
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.290
<v Speaker 1>you know the algorithms are showing you what you typically like.</v>

1003
00:30:03.291 --> 00:30:04.124
<v Speaker 1>Have you noticed that?</v>

1004
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not paying much attention but I don't believe you.</v>

1005
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1006
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:11.200
<v Speaker 1>for Creator it's hurting creators.</v>

1007
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 1>People who post are getting hurt.</v>

1008
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.170
<v Speaker 1>People who are sitting there just scrolling.</v>

1009
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.230
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones who are really getting addicted more so with the algorithms.</v>

1010
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.890
<v Speaker 1>So how are the people that are posting getting hurt?</v>

1011
00:30:25.891 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 1>They're getting hurt because their stuff is being seen by last people.</v>

1012
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not chronological and it's an organic cause it's curated.</v>

1014
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

1015
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.540
<v Speaker 1>But aren't they doing it because they think it's going to be a better and a,</v>

1016
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:39.400
<v Speaker 1>an experience that's more conducive to your life?</v>

1017
00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:40.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>

1018
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:40.871
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

1019
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:41.141
<v Speaker 1>They're doing?</v>

1020
00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:46.141
<v Speaker 1>A four then they're doing it because they have studied through looking at the</v>

1021
00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

1022
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.120
<v Speaker 1>how to keep people on the APP more.</v>

1023
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:49.661
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1024
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:53.950
<v Speaker 1>And that way is to give them like say if I Google or if I look at muscle cars on</v>

1025
00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Instagram now,</v>

1026
00:30:54.911 --> 00:30:56.320
<v Speaker 1>if I go to my search,</v>

1027
00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 1>it's all muscle car stuff.</v>

1028
00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:58.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's what it is.</v>

1029
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.991
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

1030
00:30:58.991 --> 00:30:59.141
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1031
00:30:59.141 --> 00:30:59.974
<v Speaker 1>he likes that.</v>

1032
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to,</v>

1033
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.870
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to give him a lot of that.</v>

1034
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's okay as an alternative feed or to put that somewhere.</v>

1035
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I just think the core feed always needs to stay pure.</v>

1036
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1037
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you're just down the slippery slope again and understand it's</v>

1038
00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 1>just feeding their,</v>

1039
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.040
<v Speaker 1>they're injecting things into your head that you didn't ask for.</v>

1040
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1041
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And they're doing it because they want to keep you around.</v>

1042
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.273
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1044
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1045
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 1>how many different companies are subscribing to that is,</v>

1046
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:34.321
<v Speaker 1>it seems like all the big ones were saying are curating and moving things around</v>

1047
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 1>and all the big ones have an algorithm that's designed to keep you on board.</v>

1048
00:31:38.351 --> 00:31:39.184
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1049
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's okay to pursue.</v>

1050
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I think there's really cool things you can do with AI and machine learning and</v>

1051
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:47.470
<v Speaker 1>algorithms that is really beneficial,</v>

1052
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's just taking away people's reach when they have worked years and years</v>

1053
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:53.314
<v Speaker 1>to achieve it.</v>

1054
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.423
<v Speaker 1>It's not okay.</v>

1055
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this is this marriage between something that is this social</v>

1056
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:03.250
<v Speaker 1>media network that's designed to allow people to communicate with each other and</v>

1057
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:05.500
<v Speaker 1>then commerce like this business,</v>

1058
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:07.210
<v Speaker 1>like how do we maximize this business?</v>

1059
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:08.920
<v Speaker 1>How do we get more profit out of this business?</v>

1060
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.990
<v Speaker 1>How do we get these people to engage more?</v>

1061
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And then they start monkeying with the code and screw in with what you see and</v>

1062
00:32:15.581 --> 00:32:16.181
<v Speaker 1>what you don't say.</v>

1063
00:32:16.181 --> 00:32:17.140
<v Speaker 1>You think that's what's happening?</v>

1064
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.860
<v Speaker 1>But in,</v>

1066
00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 1>in the short term it's probably working,</v>

1067
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but in the long term they're betraying everybody's trust.</v>

1068
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It has to be more of a consent based system.</v>

1069
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.690
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1070
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>at least give people,</v>

1071
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.990
<v Speaker 1>well it should be a opt out by default and find,</v>

1072
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 1>give me messages to opt in so that you can show me certain things.</v>

1073
00:32:35.981 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>But this whole force forcing</v>

1074
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.390
<v Speaker 3>people into surveillance has,</v>

1075
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 3>it just has to stop.</v>

1076
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1077
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.070
<v Speaker 3>it's super scary.</v>

1078
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 3>How's the super scared of you?</v>

1079
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 3>It's just too much power.</v>

1080
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1081
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 3>it's too much power for something that supposed to be silly,</v>

1082
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:54.831
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1083
00:32:54.831 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Like what was Facebook supposed to supposed to be some silly thing that you just</v>

1084
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 3>can communicate with friends.</v>

1085
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1086
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 3>but from the beginning,</v>

1087
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:02.871
<v Speaker 3>all of these,</v>

1088
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:06.560
<v Speaker 3>none of these networks have ever really been about the people of the networks.</v>

1089
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 3>It's always been closed source since the inception.</v>

1090
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1091
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.730
<v Speaker 3>but then you look at open networks out there,</v>

1092
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.593
<v Speaker 3>you have Wikipedia,</v>

1093
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 3>totally open source community.</v>

1094
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Ryan granted they have their issues with moderation.</v>

1095
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.263
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>

1096
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Speaker 3>But it's a top 10 website in the world is totally open source,</v>

1097
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:25.670
<v Speaker 3>creative Commons content,</v>

1098
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.190
<v Speaker 3>incredible human achievement,</v>

1099
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:29.683
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin,</v>

1100
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.770
<v Speaker 3>open source money.</v>

1101
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:36.250
<v Speaker 3>Wordpress even is an open source CMS system that is like powering 25% of the</v>

1102
00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:37.784
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

1103
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 3>So why when that happened with social media it should,</v>

1104
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean this way everyone's hanging out so we should all sort of collectively</v>

1105
00:33:45.351 --> 00:33:46.184
<v Speaker 3>even own it.</v>

1106
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.680
<v Speaker 3>We did a an equity crowdfunding round,</v>

1107
00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:53.120
<v Speaker 3>so like thousands members of our community actually on the site now.</v>

1108
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:54.280
<v Speaker 3>How many people are on mines?</v>

1109
00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.200
<v Speaker 3>We have like a million and a half registered,</v>

1110
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 3>like quarter million active.</v>

1111
00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.301
<v Speaker 3>Various we're,</v>

1112
00:33:59.301 --> 00:33:59.471
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1113
00:33:59.471 --> 00:34:00.201
<v Speaker 3>we're small.</v>

1114
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:05.201
<v Speaker 3>But the weird thing is that even though we're a fraction of the size,</v>

1115
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:10.130
<v Speaker 3>especially smaller creators who come get better reach on minds than they do on</v>

1116
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Facebook and Twitter because we have this reward and incentive system sort of</v>

1117
00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:18.851
<v Speaker 3>like gamified where you earn breach and you earn more of a voice for</v>

1118
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:21.494
<v Speaker 3>contributing.</v>

1119
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.680
<v Speaker 3>So like you could have a account on Twitter for 10 years in post thousands and</v>

1120
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 3>thousands of tweets and you never hit that viral nerve and you just never,</v>

1121
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.480
<v Speaker 3>never really get much exposure.</v>

1122
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:35.660
<v Speaker 3>So we're trying to help people be heard.</v>

1123
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.440
<v Speaker 3>And so you'll find a small creator who on other networks has no followers,</v>

1124
00:34:39.441 --> 00:34:41.300
<v Speaker 3>have thousands and thousands of followers on mines.</v>

1125
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.490
<v Speaker 3>And what do you think you would like to do with mines in the future that you</v>

1126
00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:47.480
<v Speaker 3>haven't been able to do yet?</v>

1127
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Engineer the control out of ourselves so that we aren't even in a position to</v>

1128
00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.094
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1129
00:34:59.010 --> 00:34:59.843
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1130
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.940
<v Speaker 3>take people's stuff down or who would have someone in posts your house and your</v>

1131
00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:07.070
<v Speaker 3>information where your kids go to school.</v>

1132
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I think that on the central servers obviously yes,</v>

1133
00:35:11.661 --> 00:35:16.661
<v Speaker 3>we're always going to moderate and if it's legal it can stay.</v>

1134
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 3>If it's not illegal it can't.</v>

1135
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:18.853
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1136
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
<v Speaker 3>a decentralized social network is definitely where we have to go because,</v>

1137
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:25.970
<v Speaker 3>and yeah.</v>

1138
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:26.301
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1139
00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1140
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.260
<v Speaker 3>it's scary.</v>

1141
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:27.711
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1142
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:28.461
<v Speaker 3>you've talked about this,</v>

1143
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:30.620
<v Speaker 3>like things are getting more transparent.</v>

1144
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Our lives is sort of like the inevitable evolution of technology.</v>

1145
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.541
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1146
00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 3>how many hours a day do you stream a couple,</v>

1147
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1148
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 3>25 years ago would you have thought you'd be sharing,</v>

1149
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:42.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1150
00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 3>20% of your life live streaming to,</v>

1151
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1152
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 3>millions of people like you're,</v>

1153
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:50.310
<v Speaker 3>our lives are becoming more transparent.</v>

1154
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:52.320
<v Speaker 3>Just inevitably it's just pulling us.</v>

1155
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:53.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1156
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1157
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.503
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1158
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1159
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin crypto,</v>

1160
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 3>dat torn Stipe,</v>

1161
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.720
<v Speaker 3>torn type architecture.</v>

1162
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 3>That is just where we're going because it's more resilient,</v>

1163
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:10.410
<v Speaker 3>it's less censorship prone,</v>

1164
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.540
<v Speaker 3>there's just benefits of it.</v>

1165
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 3>I think that we can bounce it to like maybe when you post,</v>

1166
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:16.190
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>

1167
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.023
<v Speaker 3>a decision.</v>

1168
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to be able to delete this at any point?</v>

1169
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:20.431
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1170
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:20.701
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

1171
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Then you can post the central server.</v>

1172
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you want this to get unleashed?</v>

1173
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:26.520
<v Speaker 3>It's scary because you know,</v>

1175
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 3>they're scary stuff on the Internet.</v>

1176
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.890
<v Speaker 3>It's already like that.</v>

1177
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.570
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1178
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.100
<v Speaker 3>getting into censorship more.</v>

1179
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:37.270
<v Speaker 3>But does censorship even solve the problem or does it make it worse?</v>

1180
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.513
<v Speaker 3>What problem?</v>

1181
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 3>The problem of crazy content,</v>

1182
00:36:40.141 --> 00:36:41.430
<v Speaker 3>illegal content does it,</v>

1183
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:42.360
<v Speaker 3>how could it make it worse?</v>

1184
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1185
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like it can often amplify radicalization</v>

1186
00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:47.901
<v Speaker 1>definitely count,</v>

1187
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:48.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1188
00:36:48.101 --> 00:36:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:36:48.561 --> 00:36:49.490
<v Speaker 1>And it definitely,</v>

1191
00:36:49.491 --> 00:36:50.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1192
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.920
<v Speaker 1>when you censor people,</v>

1193
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.400
<v Speaker 1>it just makes them aware that there's plot against them too.</v>

1194
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1195
00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of conservatives on Twitter are finding that.</v>

1196
00:36:59.421 --> 00:36:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Some of the,</v>

1197
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris actually just sent me an article.</v>

1198
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1199
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.520
<v Speaker 1>it was a detailing the bias against conservatives on Twitter that they've</v>

1200
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.473
<v Speaker 1>actually done,</v>

1201
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1202
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:13.790
<v Speaker 1>like some real studying it and it's pretty demonstrated [inaudible] demonstrably</v>

1203
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.460
<v Speaker 1>it affects both the left and the right wheel.</v>

1204
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Too much trouble.</v>

1205
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1206
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.890
<v Speaker 1>The way I'm saying it wrong.</v>

1207
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1208
00:37:19.491 --> 00:37:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1209
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.340
<v Speaker 1>it affects the left and the right for sure.</v>

1210
00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:22.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1211
00:37:22.811 --> 00:37:23.621
<v Speaker 3>that's what Kyle was saying.</v>

1212
00:37:23.621 --> 00:37:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I watched that video that he did and he said it's antiestablishment that seems</v>

1213
00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:27.550
<v Speaker 3>to be getting targeted.</v>

1214
00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.230
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1215
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:29.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1216
00:37:29.441 --> 00:37:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Abby's been censored on face and I'd be willing to learn.</v>

1217
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.393
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1218
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.331
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

1219
00:37:34.331 --> 00:37:35.370
<v Speaker 3>this person today,</v>

1220
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean most of the stuff coming out of our t is progressive,</v>

1221
00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.401
<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>

1222
00:37:39.401 --> 00:37:43.180
<v Speaker 3>And who knows what kind of games are getting played behind the scenes with the</v>

1223
00:37:43.181 --> 00:37:43.541
<v Speaker 3>rush.</v>

1224
00:37:43.541 --> 00:37:44.374
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1225
00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.573
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

1226
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.100
<v Speaker 3>But the point is they have a right to be there.</v>

1227
00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:48.641
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

1228
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:49.450
<v Speaker 3>look at,</v>

1229
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.860
<v Speaker 3>this is not youtubes fault,</v>

1230
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.810
<v Speaker 3>but remember the youtube shooter,</v>

1231
00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:54.341
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1232
00:37:54.341 --> 00:37:58.960
<v Speaker 3>she thought she was getting censored on Youtube and she went and brought a gun</v>

1233
00:37:58.961 --> 00:38:00.190
<v Speaker 3>to the youtube headquarters.</v>

1234
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Like people get pissed when they get censored.</v>

1235
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.340
<v Speaker 3>It affects you.</v>

1236
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.001
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1237
00:38:07.001 --> 00:38:07.661
<v Speaker 1>But in her case,</v>

1238
00:38:07.661 --> 00:38:10.330
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a crazy person and loads of really being sensitive to</v>

1239
00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:10.840
<v Speaker 1>people out there.</v>

1240
00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1241
00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:11.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1242
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.700
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>

1243
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Shashi wasn't being,</v>

1244
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.910
<v Speaker 1>she was getting censored just like everybody else is getting soft censored on</v>

1245
00:38:15.911 --> 00:38:16.744
<v Speaker 1>these networks.</v>

1246
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:17.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1247
00:38:17.321 --> 00:38:18.101
<v Speaker 1>she just thought does,</v>

1248
00:38:18.101 --> 00:38:18.550
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

1249
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.960
<v Speaker 1>she didn't,</v>

1250
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.150
<v Speaker 1>wasn't getting promoted the way she wanted to wait.</v>

1251
00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody was actively doing anything to her.</v>

1252
00:38:23.631 --> 00:38:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that her stuff was 10 saying that the soft censorship of the</v>

1253
00:38:26.981 --> 00:38:27.850
<v Speaker 1>algorithms,</v>

1254
00:38:27.851 --> 00:38:32.560
<v Speaker 1>people getting demonetized this has an impact on psychology.</v>

1255
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1256
00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

1257
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.841
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1258
00:38:34.841 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying they were deliberately targeting her and so horrible what happened,</v>

1259
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.503
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1260
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.813
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1261
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1262
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.900
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying is that these algorithms that they use in order to</v>

1263
00:38:45.901 --> 00:38:49.380
<v Speaker 1>maximize their revenue and give people things that they like,</v>

1264
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.520
<v Speaker 1>but actually takes away from things being posted chronologically,</v>

1265
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.430
<v Speaker 1>keep certain things from being seen by as many people.</v>

1266
00:38:56.431 --> 00:38:58.080
<v Speaker 1>So it keeps him from being as viral,</v>

1267
00:38:58.081 --> 00:39:00.210
<v Speaker 1>so keeps the whole thing from being organic.</v>

1268
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1270
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:03.803
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

1271
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1272
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:04.891
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1273
00:39:04.891 --> 00:39:05.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1274
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:09.600
<v Speaker 1>it gets to that point where we're realizing that all of these things,</v>

1275
00:39:09.601 --> 00:39:11.730
<v Speaker 1>all these social media things are really recent.</v>

1276
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.140
<v Speaker 1>We've only had them for a few years and we don't necessarily know what the rules</v>

1277
00:39:16.141 --> 00:39:17.250
<v Speaker 1>should or shouldn't be.</v>

1278
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's good.</v>

1279
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1280
00:39:18.591 --> 00:39:20.010
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on,</v>

1281
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to find out where these upstarts or these new people are coming into</v>

1282
00:39:24.301 --> 00:39:24.691
<v Speaker 1>the game.</v>

1283
00:39:24.691 --> 00:39:25.524
<v Speaker 1>Like minds,</v>

1284
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:29.620
<v Speaker 1>like where you're coming into the game from and what,</v>

1285
00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:32.910
<v Speaker 1>what is your position on what's wrong with the current state of affairs?</v>

1286
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:39:33.931 --> 00:39:34.471
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

1288
00:39:34.471 --> 00:39:37.710
<v Speaker 1>there is messed up stuff on social media.</v>

1289
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:38.963
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not,</v>

1290
00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.400
<v Speaker 1>we'll get pigeonholed into being like,</v>

1291
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.641
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1292
00:39:41.641 --> 00:39:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you support all of this,</v>

1293
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.160
<v Speaker 1>this crazy stuff.</v>

1294
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.150
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1295
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.160
<v Speaker 1>most of the users on mines are like artists,</v>

1296
00:39:47.161 --> 00:39:47.851
<v Speaker 1>musicians,</v>

1297
00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:48.480
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers,</v>

1298
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:48.961
<v Speaker 1>activists,</v>

1299
00:39:48.961 --> 00:39:49.561
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>

1300
00:39:49.561 --> 00:39:51.000
<v Speaker 1>just trying to get their content out there.</v>

1301
00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a very tiny minority of like actually,</v>

1302
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1303
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:55.710
<v Speaker 1>crazy content.</v>

1304
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.720
<v Speaker 1>But when you say crazy content,</v>

1305
00:39:57.721 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

1306
00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.073
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1307
00:39:59.340 --> 00:39:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:00.991
<v Speaker 1>Or I mean,</v>

1310
00:40:00.991 --> 00:40:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to make decisions on what is and isn't crazy.</v>

1311
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:04.770
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

1312
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 1>that's not my place,</v>

1313
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.423
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1314
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.950
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1315
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it's been proven that censorship is not the answer.</v>

1316
00:40:15.611 --> 00:40:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1317
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.200
<v Speaker 1>look at the history of prohibition.</v>

1318
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1319
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.450
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1320
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:19.840
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1321
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.040
<v Speaker 1>you have digital content,</v>

1322
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:22.270
<v Speaker 1>it's substances,</v>

1323
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.133
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1324
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.490
<v Speaker 1>it's anything from people want information and they want the ability to make the</v>

1325
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:28.540
<v Speaker 1>decision for themselves.</v>

1326
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 1>They certainly do.</v>

1327
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the argument on the other side is when people were distributing,</v>

1328
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:35.350
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to use the big air quotes,</v>

1329
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 1>hate speech,</v>

1330
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.990
<v Speaker 1>that's when it gets slippery to me because who's to decide what's hate speech</v>

1331
00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:41.920
<v Speaker 1>and what's not hate speech.</v>

1332
00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:42.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1333
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people make some ridiculous fucking statements about all sorts of</v>

1334
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 1>people that are inaccurate and they do that in order to categorize them and</v>

1335
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:53.550
<v Speaker 1>pigeonhole them and an easily definable and dismissible care,</v>

1336
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:53.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1337
00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:54.880
<v Speaker 1>characterization,</v>

1338
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:55.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
00:40:55.581 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>and you just decide,</v>

1340
00:40:56.531 --> 00:40:56.771
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1341
00:40:56.771 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 1>that Bill Ottman guy,</v>

1342
00:40:58.450 --> 00:40:59.710
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a this.</v>

1343
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:00.041
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1344
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 1>he's a radical that and he believes in this,</v>

1345
00:41:02.771 --> 00:41:03.670
<v Speaker 1>so fuck him.</v>

1346
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:04.301
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1347
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:04.721
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1348
00:41:04.721 --> 00:41:05.201
<v Speaker 1>fuck cam,</v>

1349
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:05.641
<v Speaker 1>sweep more.</v>

1350
00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:05.761
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1351
00:41:05.761 --> 00:41:07.600
<v Speaker 1>and then cancel culture comes in like,</v>

1352
00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:08.770
<v Speaker 1>we're going to cancel bill Ackman.</v>

1353
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.390
<v Speaker 1>We're not listening to him anymore.</v>

1354
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.330
<v Speaker 1>He lied to us about his source or whatever the fuck you doing.</v>

1355
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of Daryl Davis?</v>

1356
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:15.641
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1357
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:16.474
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>

1358
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Most,</v>

1359
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I forgot Dale Davis.</v>

1360
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Your boy.</v>

1361
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.320
<v Speaker 1>He's my boy.</v>

1362
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:19.880
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1363
00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1364
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1365
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.191
<v Speaker 1>I haven't met him,</v>

1366
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

1367
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.271
<v Speaker 1>he's my boy.</v>

1368
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I want him to be my boy.</v>

1369
00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:28.740
<v Speaker 1>So he is a black man who befriended hundreds of members of the KKK and he got</v>

1370
00:41:30.311 --> 00:41:31.144
<v Speaker 1>them all to leave.</v>

1371
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.470
<v Speaker 1>He got them to leave the kid.</v>

1372
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 1>200</v>

1373
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Speaker 4>members.</v>

1374
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1375
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.380
<v Speaker 4>After he was like,</v>

1376
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:36.711
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1377
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:37.544
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna talk to you</v>

1378
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 4>really well.</v>

1379
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see the n a w Kamau Bell's a show when he visited with those white</v>

1380
00:41:45.471 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 4>supremacists?</v>

1381
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Not that specific one.</v>

1382
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.511
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1383
00:41:48.511 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 4>it was really good because he's such a nice guy.</v>

1384
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.260
<v Speaker 4>He's so like easy to get along with that.</v>

1385
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:55.600
<v Speaker 4>They were like sort of like,</v>

1386
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 4>they let the guard down around them and you know,</v>

1387
00:41:57.921 --> 00:42:01.400
<v Speaker 4>you get to see these people kind of confused that they liked this guy.</v>

1388
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.133
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1389
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:08.950
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think initiating human contact via the social networks,</v>

1390
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.930
<v Speaker 4>like that's really important.</v>

1391
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:13.730
<v Speaker 4>But to play devil's advocate,</v>

1392
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the worst ways for people to express themselves in a way where you</v>

1393
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:22.520
<v Speaker 4>consider other human beings experiences and feelings and the way they're going</v>

1394
00:42:22.521 --> 00:42:24.860
<v Speaker 4>to receive what you're saying because there's no social cues.</v>

1395
00:42:24.861 --> 00:42:25.880
<v Speaker 4>You're not interacting with them,</v>

1396
00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 4>you're not looking at them in the eyes.</v>

1397
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.420
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the weirder forms of communication between human beings and one that</v>

1398
00:42:32.421 --> 00:42:37.421
<v Speaker 4>I would argue we have not really necessarily a successfully navigated it yet.</v>

1399
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

1400
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:44.630
<v Speaker 4>I was actually saying that I think we should use social media more to get people</v>

1401
00:42:44.631 --> 00:42:46.700
<v Speaker 4>to get together in real life.</v>

1402
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.991
<v Speaker 4>Do you know who,</v>

1403
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1404
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 4>Megan Phelps's?</v>

1405
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1406
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.931
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1407
00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:51.201
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1408
00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:51.801
<v Speaker 4>was a,</v>

1409
00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:54.530
<v Speaker 4>with the Westboro Baptist Church.</v>

1410
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:55.281
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1411
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:55.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1412
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:56.030
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1413
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.271
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1414
00:42:56.271 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 4>the famous one that the protests sows soldier's funerals and you know,</v>

1415
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:01.231
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1416
00:43:01.231 --> 00:43:04.700
<v Speaker 4>and anything gay and they're like ruthlessly,</v>

1417
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 4>viciously fundamental Christians were,</v>

1418
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:08.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1419
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1420
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 4>they do a lot of protesting at funerals and do a lot of stuff to try to get,</v>

1421
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:17.350
<v Speaker 4>she was with them for the longest time and then got on Twitter and through</v>

1422
00:43:18.171 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 4>communicating on Twitter when you meet her,</v>

1423
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.420
<v Speaker 4>you would never believe it in a million years that she was ever this</v>

1424
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:27.650
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalist and that she was ever some mean person sending hateful messages</v>

1425
00:43:27.651 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 4>to people because their son was gay or whatever it was.</v>

1426
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Now she's completely cured of it.</v>

1427
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.540
<v Speaker 4>She has no contact with the church anymore.</v>

1428
00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 4>She's married,</v>

1429

<v Speaker 4>she completely outside of it.</v>

1431
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 4>She does podcasts now and give Ted talks and speaks about radicalization and</v>

1432
00:43:42.471 --> 00:43:44.630
<v Speaker 4>about how she was kind of indoctrinated in,</v>

1433
00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:46.880
<v Speaker 4>grew up in this family and her,</v>

1434
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 4>her grandfather,</v>

1435
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 4>Fred Phelps was this,</v>

1436
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1437

1439
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:53.790
<v Speaker 4>Like a really mean Vishy.</v>

1440
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.220
<v Speaker 4>He's the God hates fags guy.</v>

1441
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:55.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1442
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.980
<v Speaker 4>they would have those signs that they would hold it up.</v>

1443
00:43:57.981 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 4>But at the soldier's funerals,</v>

1444
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:00.561
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1445
00:44:00.561 --> 00:44:02.060
<v Speaker 4>he's like really inflammatory stuff,</v>

1446
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.160
<v Speaker 4>but through Twitter,</v>

1447
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:07.730
<v Speaker 4>through her communicating with people on Twitter and specifically her now</v>

1448
00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:08.564
<v Speaker 4>husband,</v>

1449
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.190
<v Speaker 4>like he,</v>

1450
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:14.190
<v Speaker 4>he cured her like it just with rational discourse and communication and she was</v>

1451
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] will change.</v>

1452
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:16.860
<v Speaker 4>They will change.</v>

1453
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why banning them.</v>

1454
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:19.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1455
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:20.140
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

1456
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 4>I saw on a recent podcast you've been talking about redemption.</v>

1457
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.693
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1458
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1459
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:27.350
<v Speaker 4>but I'm curious,</v>

1460
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:28.184
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>

1461
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.630
<v Speaker 4>do you think people,</v>

1462
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

1463
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 4>how does that look like?</v>

1464
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:31.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1465
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:32.330
<v Speaker 4>timber,</v>

1466
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:35.190
<v Speaker 1>you look in the case of like Megan Phelps,</v>

1467
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 1>that's a real thing,</v>

1468
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1469
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.340
<v Speaker 1>She really did change.</v>

1470
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1471
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 1>another example is Christian peak Illini.</v>

1472
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:41.993
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who he is?</v>

1473
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.200
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

1474
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:48.020
<v Speaker 1>a white supremacists KKK member guy who's been on Sam Harris' podcast.</v>

1475
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:53.060
<v Speaker 1>He's also done some Ted talks who now speaks out against it and talks about how</v>

1476
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 1>he's indoctrinated and talks about how lost he was.</v>

1477
00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Now he was brought into this ideology.</v>

1478
00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1479
00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.370
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

1480
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 1>there's many people like that all over the world.</v>

1481
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1482
00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:03.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1483
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Magid,</v>

1484
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Magid was another perfect example.</v>

1485
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:07.830
<v Speaker 1>He was an Islamist,</v>

1486
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:08.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1487
00:45:08.491 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to form a caliphate,</v>

1488
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.900
<v Speaker 1>was literally thinking about radical Islamic terrorism as being some sort of a</v>

1489
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:16.351
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

1490
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Now he's the opposite.</v>

1491
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Now he's trying to get people to leave and he's trying to get people to be more</v>

1492
00:45:21.991 --> 00:45:24.660
<v Speaker 1>reasonable and secular and see what happened to him.</v>

1493
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 1>He ain't got punched in the street.</v>

1494
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1495
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1496
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.961
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1497
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Some guy called him a fucking packy,</v>

1498
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:30.421
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1499
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:33.510
<v Speaker 1>and punched him in the head and fucked his head up and he's got this giant</v>

1500
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:33.840
<v Speaker 1>cotton,</v>

1501
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 1>his head from a ring and his face is swollen up,</v>

1502
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but apparently they have the guy on video and um,</v>

1503
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:39.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1504
00:45:39.571 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 1>they think that they're going to be able to arrest the guy I've had imagined on</v>

1505
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:42.631
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

1506
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 1>He's a super nice guy.</v>

1507
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.931
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1508
00:45:43.931 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 1>the hard thing is that all right.</v>

1509
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.461
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1510
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:48.990
<v Speaker 1>We see these transformations take place.</v>

1511
00:45:48.991 --> 00:45:51.420
<v Speaker 1>It makes us feel warm inside and yes,</v>

1512
00:45:51.421 --> 00:45:52.020
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1513
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.890
<v Speaker 1>people can change,</v>

1514
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

1515
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.613
<v Speaker 1>what are people have,</v>

1516
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.110
<v Speaker 1>should people have to go apologize to Twitter?</v>

1517
00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:58.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1518
00:45:58.351 --> 00:45:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1519
00:45:59.220 --> 00:45:59.461
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1520
00:45:59.461 --> 00:46:00.600
<v Speaker 1>can I come back?</v>

1521
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1522
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not like sometimes people are going to think completely</v>

1523
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:06.570
<v Speaker 1>differently than you and you just have to deal with it and it,</v>

1524
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.680
<v Speaker 1>that should be okay.</v>

1525
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:07.861
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1526
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:12.861
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't force people to come in to our way of thinking in order to have</v>

1527
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:14.010
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>

1528
00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:14.191
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1529
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

1530
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:15.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>

1531
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1532
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 1>and like who is to decide what this path to redemption is and whether or not</v>

1533
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:22.074
<v Speaker 1>you've completed it,</v>

1534
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1535
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Who has decided like maybe you are a log,</v>

1536
00:46:26.601 --> 00:46:30.750
<v Speaker 1>a hyper radical lefty and maybe Jamie's points of view and yours are just never</v>

1537
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:31.500
<v Speaker 1>going to line up.</v>

1538
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:31.921
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>

1539
00:46:31.921 --> 00:46:32.754
<v Speaker 1>fuck him.</v>

1540
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.840
<v Speaker 1>He's banned for life,</v>

1541
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people had been banned for life and when you look at some of the</v>

1542
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:39.211
<v Speaker 1>infractions,</v>

1543
00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:40.230
<v Speaker 1>they'd been banned for it.</v>

1544
00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:40.501
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1545
00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1546
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that one.</v>

1547
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.440
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't really make sense.</v>

1548
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Almost none of the high pro profile banning cases make much sense.</v>

1549
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:48.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1550
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like a short term solution that's creating a longterm problem.</v>

1551
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1552
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:54.690
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>

1553
00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.210
<v Speaker 1>So I just think that we have to talk about it more.</v>

1554
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1555
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1556
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1557
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.451
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1558
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:05.670
<v Speaker 1>why can't we just get everyone to talk about it?</v>

1559
00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1560
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Like at the same time,</v>

1561
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1562
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're just wasting time here.</v>

1563
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:11.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1564
00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:12.151
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

1565
00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:15.870
<v Speaker 1>but I also think we're figuring it out as we go along with a bunch of different</v>

1566
00:47:15.871 --> 00:47:17.220
<v Speaker 1>competing ideologies.</v>

1567
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1568
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1569
00:47:18.391 --> 00:47:19.290
<v Speaker 1>you have yours,</v>

1570
00:47:19.291 --> 00:47:20.430
<v Speaker 1>which like you dude,</v>

1571
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:22.440
<v Speaker 1>you look like a hacker.</v>

1572
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Unlike House of cards.</v>

1573
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.490
<v Speaker 1>He looked like a guy you call in to break into the,</v>

1574
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:26.731
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1575
00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:28.280
<v Speaker 1>the mainframe server.</v>

1576
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Not that honestly.</v>

1577
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe</v>

1578
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.371
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

1579
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:30.790
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1580
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I hang out on get lab in checkout co,</v>

1581
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.553
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1582
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:35.411
<v Speaker 4>I cannot code.</v>

1583
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 4>I cannot code.</v>

1584
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:36.850
<v Speaker 4>Listen man,</v>

1585
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm claiming I'm not claiming to be a developer.</v>

1586
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 4>No D's.</v>

1587
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.121
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1588
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:40.481
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

1589
00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:41.470
<v Speaker 4>These people are,</v>

1590
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.700
<v Speaker 4>I know there's another level.</v>

1591
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1592
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.840
<v Speaker 4>it is incredible.</v>

1593
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:44.674
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>

1594
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:45.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1595
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1596
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1597
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 4>that's like,</v>

1598
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.010
<v Speaker 4>if someone says to me like,</v>

1599
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.060
<v Speaker 4>you're an MMA fighter,</v>

1600
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:49.241
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1601
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:50.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely not.</v>

1602
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 4>They are on another fucking level.</v>

1603
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:53.731
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a different,</v>

1604
00:47:53.731 --> 00:47:53.881
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1605
00:47:53.881 --> 00:47:54.010
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1606
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 4>I know a little martial arts,</v>

1607
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 4>but just settle the fuck down.</v>

1608
00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1609
00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:58.383
<v Speaker 4>Same kind of thing.</v>

1610
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.360
<v Speaker 4>I think though that you,</v>

1611
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.050
<v Speaker 4>your ideology is going to be your,</v>

1612
00:48:04.051 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 4>your point of view and perspectives going to be very different than maybe</v>

1613
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:09.310
<v Speaker 4>someone who's like a radical Marxist,</v>

1614
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:09.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1615
00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.490
<v Speaker 4>it shouldn't they be allowed to post post on the site to someone who's like an</v>

1616
00:48:12.491 --> 00:48:13.720
<v Speaker 4>extreme socialist,</v>

1617
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.150
<v Speaker 4>someone like a AOC.</v>

1618
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1619
00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:17.320
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>

1620
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.890
<v Speaker 4>someone who thinks that we should give money to people who are unwilling to</v>

1621
00:48:20.891 --> 00:48:21.310
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

1622
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:26.170
<v Speaker 4>someone who thinks that we should try to engineer society and tax the top x</v>

1623
00:48:26.171 --> 00:48:27.004
<v Speaker 4>percent,</v>

1624
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:27.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1625
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:29.680
<v Speaker 4>70 something percent of their income.</v>

1626
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:34.710
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those different people and we have to figure out how to,</v>

1627
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 4>to make it so that,</v>

1628
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.753
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1629
00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:44.340
<v Speaker 4>we have to figure out a way to make it so all the ideas can compete in the</v>

1630
00:48:44.341 --> 00:48:45.600
<v Speaker 4>marketplace of ideas.</v>

1631
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1632
00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:49.140
<v Speaker 4>All these different ideas can compete and we can find out which one is better</v>

1633
00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.360
<v Speaker 4>and we can find out which one is better.</v>

1634
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:52.931
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1635
00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:54.400
<v Speaker 4>You don't always find out which one is better though.</v>

1636
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:54.581
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1637
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:55.680
<v Speaker 4>You find out which one is most people?</v>

1638
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:56.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what happened with Hitler.</v>

1639
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.360
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1640
00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 4>Or you don't really find out what's better.</v>

1641
00:48:58.691 --> 00:48:59.524
<v Speaker 4>You find out what,</v>

1642
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.090
<v Speaker 4>what's got more juice behind it.</v>

1643
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:03.583
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1644
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.030
<v Speaker 3>it's too risky.</v>

1645
00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Even being in the position that I'm in,</v>

1646
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:08.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1647
00:49:08.901 --> 00:49:10.310
<v Speaker 3>I see these edge cases,</v>

1648
00:49:10.311 --> 00:49:11.091
<v Speaker 3>like we say,</v>

1649
00:49:11.091 --> 00:49:11.301
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1650
00:49:11.301 --> 00:49:12.740
<v Speaker 3>if it's legal it can be there.</v>

1651
00:49:12.741 --> 00:49:15.290
<v Speaker 3>But we still see edge cases where we have to make decisions.</v>

1652
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:16.400
<v Speaker 3>What's like an edge case?</v>

1653
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.753
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1654
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:22.423
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1655
00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean there is,</v>

1656
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to go here,</v>

1657
00:49:26.091 --> 00:49:28.080
<v Speaker 3>but I will right there,</v>

1658
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:32.300
<v Speaker 3>there is a type of animation.</v>

1659
00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.253
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1660
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.640
<v Speaker 3>porn anomia yeah,</v>

1661
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1662
00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.190
<v Speaker 3>That is very sketchy.</v>

1663
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Uber,</v>

1664
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1665
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:40.400
<v Speaker 3>like child porn,</v>

1666
00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.530
<v Speaker 3>animated child porn.</v>

1667
00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:42.980
<v Speaker 3>And we've taken the stance that,</v>

1668
00:49:42.981 --> 00:49:43.280
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1669
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.000
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1670
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.890
<v Speaker 3>it could fall under obscenity laws.</v>

1671
00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.611
<v Speaker 3>So we don't,</v>

1672
00:49:46.611 --> 00:49:47.444
<v Speaker 3>we're not cool.</v>

1673
00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.070
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1674
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.390
<v Speaker 3>that is a huge debate,</v>

1675
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:50.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1676
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:51.201
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1677
00:49:51.201 --> 00:49:51.380
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1678
00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:55.580
<v Speaker 3>that it has not been decided by the Supreme Court if animated,</v>

1679
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:56.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1680
00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.790
<v Speaker 3>kids like they will do the weirdest stuff.</v>

1681
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.080
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1682
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.060
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to be telling people what is and what is not art.</v>

1683
00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:05.953
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1684
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:10.480
<v Speaker 4>So like some of that Japanese stuff with tentacles,</v>

1685
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 4>like some of that stuff is just like,</v>

1686
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 4>what is happening here?</v>

1687
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Like octopuses Bang and checks and every hole and they're choking on it and</v>

1688
00:50:20.891 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 4>they've got one in their ass and one of their vagina and it's all like very,</v>

1689
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.200
<v Speaker 4>very liquidity.</v>

1690
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:27.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1691
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.370
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of splattering</v>

1692
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:28.761
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1693
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:29.001
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1694
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

1695
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:31.250
<v Speaker 1>And is that okay?</v>

1696
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Because it's just art,</v>

1697
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1698
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1699
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Speaker 1>if it was a person getting fucked left,</v>

1700
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 1>right and center by an octopus,</v>

1701
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:37.581
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

1702
00:50:37.581 --> 00:50:37.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1703
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I think we've crossed some lines here.</v>

1704
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 1>That's beastiality.</v>

1705
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:42.360
<v Speaker 1>But if it's an image and if then,</v>

1706
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:45.170
<v Speaker 1>then the image is a girl with a school girl costume on,</v>

1707
00:50:45.171 --> 00:50:46.600
<v Speaker 1>she's dressed like a Catholic school girl,</v>

1708
00:50:46.601 --> 00:50:47.434
<v Speaker 1>a little skirt,</v>

1709
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.690
<v Speaker 1>and she's getting banged by an octopus.</v>

1710
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do with that?</v>

1711
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1712
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1713
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1714
00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.153
<v Speaker 1>What would you do?</v>

1715
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

1716
00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I don't have a social media site where I have to make that decision.</v>

1717
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:00.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1718
00:51:00.951 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the real concern would be,</v>

1719
00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 1>is this something that is actually illegal?</v>

1720
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.963
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

1721
00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:08.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1722
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:08.871
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

1723
00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:13.520
<v Speaker 1>we've tried to look at the case law and we've seen that this type of stuff has</v>

1724
00:51:13.521 --> 00:51:14.354
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

1725
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:14.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1726
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:15.770
<v Speaker 1>called obscenity.</v>

1727
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:16.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1728
00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:16.401
<v Speaker 1>Before.</v>

1729
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And so we're just not going to risk it.</v>

1730
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:19.850
<v Speaker 1>But I still,</v>

1731
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1732
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.270
<v Speaker 1>in a alright,</v>

1733
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:23.143
<v Speaker 1>nipples,</v>

1734
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.710
<v Speaker 1>nipples look right.</v>

1735
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that free the nipple started out fortune?</v>

1736
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1737
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.561
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

1738
00:51:30.561 --> 00:51:31.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole,</v>

1739
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole movement to be honest.</v>

1740
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:33.380
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1741
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Time magazine just did a really interesting piece about a statue.</v>

1742
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 1>They got banned from Facebook and he was a naked ancient statue.</v>

1743
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.653
<v Speaker 1>That's a nipple.</v>

1744
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.571
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1745
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:42.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1746
00:51:42.111 --> 00:51:42.944
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

1747
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not realistic that,</v>

1748
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:45.520
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1749
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:50.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not helping society taking down in a naked statue.</v>

1750
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.590
<v Speaker 1>When we were talking about the other day,</v>

1751
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:52.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1752
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.160
<v Speaker 1>during the Superbowl that a Adam Levine had his shirt off and Brian read,</v>

1753
00:51:57.291 --> 00:51:57.821
<v Speaker 1>Ben was like,</v>

1754
00:51:57.821 --> 00:51:57.961
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1755
00:51:57.961 --> 00:52:00.230
<v Speaker 1>d wasn't that like what Janet Jackson got in trouble for?</v>

1756
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:00.651
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1757
00:52:00.651 --> 00:52:01.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1758
00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Why does,</v>

1759
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:06.200
<v Speaker 1>why is it okay if Adam Levine shows his nipples and Janet Jackson's nipples are</v>

1760
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:08.840
<v Speaker 1>offensive because there's sexualized because she's a woman.</v>

1761
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:11.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the weird fact.</v>

1762
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Men had to gain the right to have their nipples shown in public back in the day.</v>

1763
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 1>When's the day I,</v>

1764
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:21.530
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1765
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.660
<v Speaker 1>if you go on the free the nipple site,</v>

1766
00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:24.494
<v Speaker 1>there's this</v>

1767
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:27.080
<v Speaker 1>go on their Instagram or something.</v>

1768
00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that's maybe where I saw it back when I used Instagram.</v>

1769
00:52:29.841 --> 00:52:30.674
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1770
00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1771
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:33.260
<v Speaker 1>society is evolving.</v>

1772
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:34.310
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get there,</v>

1773
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.970
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be able to handle it I think or give people the controls so that</v>

1774
00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:40.750
<v Speaker 1>they can only see the types of things that they want to see.</v>

1775
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.080
<v Speaker 1>That's ultimately what it's about.</v>

1776
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:44.030
<v Speaker 1>So like you should have like a filter.</v>

1777
00:52:44.031 --> 00:52:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Like do I want 18 plus?</v>

1778
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Do our want.</v>

1779
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1780
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.740
<v Speaker 1>PG 13,</v>

1781
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:49.783
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

1782
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.740
<v Speaker 1>what kind of distinction do I want?</v>

1783
00:52:51.741 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1785
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:53.421
<v Speaker 1>And then when,</v>

1786
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>when things come up,</v>

1787
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:58.010
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that Instagram has been doing is like they say,</v>

1788
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I follow a lot of hunters and Instagram has things where they say,</v>

1789
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:02.841
<v Speaker 1>warning,</v>

1790
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:04.040
<v Speaker 1>this is a sensitive content.</v>

1791
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1792
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 1>nature is metal gets popped on that a lot too because nature's metals and</v>

1793
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:09.231
<v Speaker 1>Instagram side,</v>

1794
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:14.231
<v Speaker 1>that's all like these crazy images and videos of animals eating other animals</v>

1795
00:53:15.741 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Speaker 1>and attacking their animals.</v>

1796
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.610
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes some of them they just decide this one's too fucked up.</v>

1797
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1798
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:21.200
<v Speaker 1>like just decide,</v>

1809
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 4>You have to double click.</v>

1810
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.393
<v Speaker 4>What do you got Jamie?</v>

1811
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 4>Basically from,</v>

1812
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:40.441
<v Speaker 4>I just looked up,</v>

1813
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Tarzan is the catalyst for why guys wanted to wear their shirts off.</v>

1814
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.260
<v Speaker 4>They had like a 1920s,</v>

1815
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.530
<v Speaker 4>19 terrorists they had to wear in pools.</v>

1816
00:53:49.531 --> 00:53:50.670
<v Speaker 4>They had to wear a top.</v>

1817
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:51.301
<v Speaker 4>But look,</v>

1818
00:53:51.301 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 4>this is the only covers one mil.</v>

1819
00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:55.860
<v Speaker 4>Thus they're probably tired or sway or an alien right there.</v>

1820
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.690
<v Speaker 4>That's how they started playing down the strap.</v>

1821
00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.471
<v Speaker 4>Look at it says here,</v>

1828

<v Speaker 4>That's when they overturned it.</v>

1829
00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:18.690
<v Speaker 4>The incident attracted press attention as Atlantic city,</v>

1830
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.780
<v Speaker 4>other waterfronts similarly mandated against men.</v>

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.230
<v Speaker 4>is the wilderness,</v>

1874
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:39.610
<v Speaker 4>well his book,</v>

1875
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.290
<v Speaker 4>the coddling of the American mind,</v>

1876
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:41.761
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1877
00:55:41.761 --> 00:55:42.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1878
00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm in that right now.</v>

1879
00:55:43.061 --> 00:55:46.330
<v Speaker 4>I just finished his other one and I'm working on that one.</v>

1880
00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.660
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of it has to do with social media and a lot of it has to do with the</v>

1881
00:55:49.661 --> 00:55:51.430
<v Speaker 4>impact that it has on young people.</v>

1882
00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:52.923
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1883
00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:56.500
<v Speaker 4>people are not really designed for this and you might be able to handle it if</v>

1884
00:55:56.501 --> 00:55:59.620
<v Speaker 4>your 32 year old man or a 35 year old woman or whatever you are.</v>

1885
00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:01.810
<v Speaker 4>But if you're a 15 year old girl,</v>

1886
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.811
<v Speaker 3>this might,</v>

1887
00:56:02.811 --> 00:56:03.950
<v Speaker 3>it might be overwhelming.</v>

1888
00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:04.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1889
00:56:04.671 --> 00:56:05.390
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1890
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:09.050
<v Speaker 3>the angst and the anxiety and you know,</v>

1891
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.620
<v Speaker 3>wanting to,</v>

1892
00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 3>I was saying about the,</v>

1893
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:11.180
<v Speaker 3>the depression,</v>

1894
00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:11.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1895
00:56:11.391 --> 00:56:15.170
<v Speaker 3>they see if they're not at a party or their stuff's not getting liked,</v>

1896
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.030
<v Speaker 3>that has an impact on them.</v>

1897
00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:22.060
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately I think the networks need to be helping educate people how to,</v>

1898
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1899
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 1>whether it's this info,</v>

1900
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:26.920
<v Speaker 1>educate people how to research.</v>

1901
00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I did see that youtube is starting to do like a,</v>

1902
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 1>you've been on this for too long type thing.</v>

1903
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:32.501
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1904
00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1905
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Like get a life you fuck yeah.</v>

1906
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.950
<v Speaker 1>They tell you that I want to build stuff like that.</v>

1907
00:56:36.951 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 1>That that's really important.</v>

1908
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:39.064
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1909
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Helping people get off.</v>

1910
00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1911
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.023
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

1912
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:44.163
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that.</v>

1913
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done enough time on youtube where they're kicking me off.</v>

1914
00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:49.623
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

1915
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.873
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>

1916
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:52.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1917
00:56:52.181 --> 00:56:52.631
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

1918
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I sent,</v>

1919
00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:53.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1920
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo,</v>

1921
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:56.650
<v Speaker 1>this thing from the Guardian about,</v>

1922
00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1923
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.660
<v Speaker 1>the upsurge in people that believe in the flat earth and all of it because of</v>

1924
00:57:01.661 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos and that apparently now youtube is,</v>

1925
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.730
<v Speaker 1>they want to censor those.</v>

1926
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.201
<v Speaker 1>They want to,</v>

1927
00:57:08.201 --> 00:57:08.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1928
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.140
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1929
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:09.400
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1930
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 1>they feel like flat earth videos and uh,</v>

1931
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I think another one,</v>

1932
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 1>check this check gives this if I'm wrong about this,</v>

1933
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:21.610
<v Speaker 1>but I think they also want to lean on those anti-vaccination videos.</v>

1934
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a concern with those.</v>

1935
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I think they're worried about a bunch of different things along those lines.</v>

1936
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1937
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 1>like they feel like there's disinformation and outright lies that are being</v>

1938
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:32.530
<v Speaker 1>spread.</v>

1939
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:33.520
<v Speaker 1>How do we combat it?</v>

1940
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:34.600
<v Speaker 1>We own this platform.</v>

1941
00:57:34.601 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

1942
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 1>They feel like they have a responsibility.</v>

1943
00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I think there is responsibility.</v>

1944
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1945
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 1>but what is the responsibility?</v>

1946
00:57:40.451 --> 00:57:41.260
<v Speaker 1>If there's a debate,</v>

1947
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more to educate people how to research as opposed to saying this is</v>

1948
00:57:46.361 --> 00:57:47.500
<v Speaker 1>or is not true.</v>

1949
00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:47.831
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1950
00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Because who's deciding that?</v>

1951
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1952
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I believe the earth is round,</v>

1953
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.073
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1954
00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:54.573
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1955
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I also believe it's such a stupid conspiracy that you should have it.</v>

1956
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 1>You should be allowed and it should be something you should show your friends.</v>

1957
00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:04.361
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1958
00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1959
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I need you to go look at this.</v>

1960
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.320
<v Speaker 1>This has 37,000 thumbs up.</v>

1961
00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 1>And they really believe that the fucking earth is flat.</v>

1962
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.770
<v Speaker 1>They really believe there's an ice wall outside Antarctica.</v>

1963
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 1>They really believe that the sky doesn't move.</v>

1964
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 1>That it's that the,</v>

1965
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:19.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1966
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.830
<v Speaker 1>that we're in some sort of a,</v>

1967
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like projected images or something.</v>

1968
00:58:23.951 --> 00:58:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a bunch of like really,</v>

1969
00:58:25.631 --> 00:58:27.310
<v Speaker 1>really wacky theories.</v>

1970
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Like I think those are okay.</v>

1971
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:30.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1972
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.680
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1973
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1974
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:36.850
<v Speaker 1>But I think freedom of information sort of transcends a lot of these little</v>

1975
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:37.743
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>

1976
00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 1>So if there was more freedom of information so we actually knew everything the</v>

1977
00:58:41.261 --> 00:58:46.261
<v Speaker 1>government knew about all of the different conspiracies and black projects,</v>

1978
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:47.740
<v Speaker 1>the black budget.</v>

1979
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1980
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:52.180
<v Speaker 1>More information is going to get both sides.</v>

1981
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 1>The ability to understand what is happening.</v>

1982
00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:55.090
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1983
00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:58.960
<v Speaker 1>The reality is that we don't know what's happening and there is lots of secret</v>

1984
00:58:58.961 --> 00:58:59.770
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1985
00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:03.070
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that though is then you're dealing with foreign governments</v>

1986
00:59:03.071 --> 00:59:05.950
<v Speaker 1>that are way better at keeping secrets than we are.</v>

1987
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And if they have access to our secrets,</v>

1988
00:59:07.781 --> 00:59:11.500
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that's been kind of disturbing is seeing the actual</v>

1989
00:59:11.501 --> 00:59:16.501
<v Speaker 1>influence of these Russian troll farms have had on not just our political</v>

1990
00:59:17.171 --> 00:59:18.004
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

1991
00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:21.400
<v Speaker 1>but sowing seeds of descent amongst people and,</v>

1992
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 1>and starting</v>

1993
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.130
<v Speaker 4>conflict amongst people and how people are buying into it.</v>

1994
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:25.701
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1995
00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:29.050
<v Speaker 4>like this a podcast I've been talking about a lot with Sam Harris and Renee</v>

1996
00:59:29.051 --> 00:59:29.630
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

1997
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:30.021
<v Speaker 4>that's her name,</v>

1998
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:30.854
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1999
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:32.053
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2000
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:37.180
<v Speaker 4>where they talked about how these Russian troll farms set up a conflict by</v>

2001
00:59:38.151 --> 00:59:43.151
<v Speaker 4>having a pro Muslim rally across the street from a pro Texas pride rally.</v>

2002
00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 4>And they just set it all up and had it there.</v>

2003
00:59:45.861 --> 00:59:48.650
<v Speaker 4>And then a skirmish broke out because these people are across the street from</v>

2004
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:50.900
<v Speaker 4>each other and that they do this with,</v>

2005
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 4>they were having these African American groups that were seeing anyone but</v>

2006
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 4>Hillary and they were going to like try really trying to get people to vote for</v>

2007
00:59:58.191 --> 00:59:59.030
<v Speaker 4>Jill Stein.</v>

2008
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:01.460
<v Speaker 4>Really trying to get people to even consider Trump,</v>

2009
01:00:01.461 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 4>but anyone but Hillary and then you,</v>

2010
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:07.040
<v Speaker 4>they were also having like ones that were against them.</v>

2011
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:11.810
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to like make debate to trying to make anger and they don't think</v>

2012
01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:12.830
<v Speaker 4>you can stop that.</v>

2013
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.210
<v Speaker 4>But it's a fascinating thing,</v>

2014
01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:14.541
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

2015
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:16.400
<v Speaker 4>That this is like a concerted effort.</v>

2016
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:17.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:17.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.120
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you feel about that when you say,</v>

2019
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:20.240
<v Speaker 4>when you are,</v>

2020
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:20.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2021
01:00:20.481 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 4>you're in a position where you have a fairly small network,</v>

2022
01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:24.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's influential.</v>

2023
01:00:24.741 --> 01:00:25.250
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2024
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:30.250
<v Speaker 4>And then see watching Zuckerberg and the Facebook shit on TV and they're talking</v>

2025
01:00:30.411 --> 01:00:32.930
<v Speaker 4>to these congresspeople and senators and they're talking to all these</v>

2026
01:00:32.931 --> 01:00:36.380
<v Speaker 4>politicians about what's going on and how to stop it and what they're trying to</v>

2027
01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:36.741
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

2028
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2029
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:37.850
<v Speaker 4>and you feel like,</v>

2030
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:38.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

2031
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:39.830
<v Speaker 4>like this is kind of a,</v>

2032
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 4>this is an arena that I'm getting it</v>

2033
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:42.303
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2034
01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.320
<v Speaker 3>What would you do?</v>

2035
01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:45.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2036
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I think more conversation needs to happen now less.</v>

2037
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2038
01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:50.910
<v Speaker 3>So I think you're right.</v>

2039
01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:51.360
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2040
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.560
<v Speaker 3>I want more information.</v>

2041
01:00:52.561 --> 01:00:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I want from the government,</v>

2042
01:00:53.551 --> 01:00:54.840
<v Speaker 3>from the corporations,</v>

2043
01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:55.590
<v Speaker 3>from the trolls,</v>

2044
01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:56.610
<v Speaker 3>from the trolls.</v>

2045
01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:58.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2046
01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2047
01:00:59.120 --> 01:00:59.631
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2048
01:00:59.631 --> 01:00:59.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2049
01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I have a pretty good ability to discern what is and is not troll</v>

2050
01:01:06.661 --> 01:01:07.141
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

2051
01:01:07.141 --> 01:01:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I think help people understand how,</v>

2052
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.053
<v Speaker 3>how to read,</v>

2053
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.950
<v Speaker 3>how to absorb information.</v>

2054
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Like just banning an account that is trying to,</v>

2055
01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:22.650
<v Speaker 3>has an agenda is everyone has an agenda.</v>

2056
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a propaganda back and forth between everybody.</v>

2057
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2058
01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:27.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2059
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:30.870
<v Speaker 3>just because somebody posts a Jill Stein meme.</v>

2060
01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.393
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2061
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:33.960
<v Speaker 3>what's your point?</v>

2062
01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Like their intention.</v>

2063
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.003
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2064
01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that,</v>

2065
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2066
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:45.000
<v Speaker 3>regime change behavior is positive and negative.</v>

2067
01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how we sort of switch gears.</v>

2068
01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:47.261
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2069
01:01:47.261 --> 01:01:47.591
<v Speaker 4>we did,</v>

2070
01:01:47.591 --> 01:01:47.951
<v Speaker 4>but let,</v>

2071
01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:48.280
<v Speaker 4>let me,</v>

2072
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.210
<v Speaker 4>let me step in here.</v>

2073
01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:49.680
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

2074
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.250
<v Speaker 4>when you're saying a Jill Stein meme,</v>

2075
01:01:51.251 --> 01:01:55.000
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely nothing wrong with you posting a Jill Stein meme.</v>

2076
01:01:55.001 --> 01:01:57.100
<v Speaker 4>Like say if you have a joke about Jill Stein,</v>

2077
01:01:57.101 --> 01:01:58.360
<v Speaker 4>you wanted to post it in a meme.</v>

2078
01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.440
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

2079
01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.030
<v Speaker 4>What's weird for people is that people were being hired to make these memes and</v>

2080
01:02:04.031 --> 01:02:04.151
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2081
01:02:04.151 --> 01:02:07.600
<v Speaker 4>these memes may not have anything to do with her own personal ideology.</v>

2082
01:02:07.601 --> 01:02:09.100
<v Speaker 4>They must just might just decide,</v>

2083
01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:09.281
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2084
01:02:09.281 --> 01:02:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to collect this check and I'm going to end.</v>

2085
01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:15.220
<v Speaker 4>They make apparently according to Renee and this podcast you did with Sam</v>

2086
01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Harris,</v>

2087
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.320
<v Speaker 4>they make really hilarious memes.</v>

2088
01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:18.730
<v Speaker 4>Like some of them are really fun.</v>

2089
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 4>I listen to that podcast.</v>

2090
01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2091
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.411
<v Speaker 3>it was great.</v>

2092
01:02:20.411 --> 01:02:20.990
<v Speaker 3>She said that she,</v>

2093
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.830
<v Speaker 3>she started laughing.</v>

2094
01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:22.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:23.064
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2096
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 3>And she,</v>

2097
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:23.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2098
01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 3>she had to go through thousands and thousands of them.</v>

2099
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.351
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

2100
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:30.300
<v Speaker 3>There's this idea of a web of trust,</v>

2101
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.230
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting.</v>

2102
01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like a peer to peer.</v>

2103
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:34.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a Chinese social score,</v>

2104
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.180
<v Speaker 3>but it's like if you,</v>

2105
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 3>the people that you're connected with</v>

2106
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.680
<v Speaker 3>show a certain account to be untrustworthy,</v>

2107
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:44.431
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

2108
01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 3>because you trust your little network.</v>

2109
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 3>So there it's sort of like a peer to peer score.</v>

2110
01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.770
<v Speaker 3>We were looking at different ideas.</v>

2111
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:53.604
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

2112
01:02:55.110 --> 01:03:00.110
<v Speaker 3>transparency and understanding what's going on with different accounts and if</v>

2113
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:01.651
<v Speaker 3>it's the real person,</v>

2114
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:03.660
<v Speaker 3>that's all important stuff.</v>

2115
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:04.171
<v Speaker 3>We don't,</v>

2116
01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:05.640
<v Speaker 3>we don't want frauds,</v>

2117
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:07.170
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to send foe,</v>

2118
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2119
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 3>we just have to really step back and think about how we're doing it rather than</v>

2120
01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:16.500
<v Speaker 3>letting AI and algorithms run the show.</v>

2121
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.513
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2122
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>

2123
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2124
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:21.210
<v Speaker 3>do you think that there is a,</v>

2125
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say there's a market,</v>

2126
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:24.300
<v Speaker 3>is there a demand for this?</v>

2127
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Like are a lot of people responding in a positive way to the way you guys are</v>

2128
01:03:27.751 --> 01:03:28.650
<v Speaker 3>approaching the game?</v>

2129
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:29.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2130
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:30.091
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2131
01:03:30.091 --> 01:03:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Every time there's a big scandal every time,</v>

2132
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:34.980
<v Speaker 3>whether it's,</v>

2133
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2134
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:37.320
<v Speaker 3>data manipulation or,</v>

2135
01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2136
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:43.490
<v Speaker 3>our first big growth spurt was during the Snowden days when he released all the</v>

2137
01:03:43.801 --> 01:03:44.470
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

2138
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.760
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2139
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.150
<v Speaker 3>People are really upset with what's happening.</v>

2140
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:49.320
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2141
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.153
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2142
01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:51.570
<v Speaker 3>where are they supposed to do?</v>

2143
01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Like this is what they're using for their communication.</v>

2144
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.650
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to just achieve,</v>

2145
01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2146
01:03:56.161 --> 01:04:00.960
<v Speaker 3>a multibillion person network overnight so that everybody's there and so we're</v>

2147
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:01.794
<v Speaker 3>stuck.</v>

2148
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:02.820
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

2149
01:04:02.821 --> 01:04:07.821
<v Speaker 3>I think that supplementing just installing these alternative apps,</v>

2150
01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:08.580
<v Speaker 3>not just us,</v>

2151
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.380
<v Speaker 3>it's like the whole open source market.</v>

2152
01:04:10.381 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even here trying to just talk about what we're doing right.</v>

2153
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you don't have those apps on your phone and you don't use those</v>

2154
01:04:18.841 --> 01:04:19.674
<v Speaker 3>browsers,</v>

2155
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:20.911
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

2156
01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:21.744
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

2157
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:22.770
<v Speaker 3>you're not helping.</v>

2158
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.590
<v Speaker 3>And people just want to vote with their energy,</v>

2159
01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2160
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:27.240
<v Speaker 3>and vote with their time.</v>

2161
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.150
<v Speaker 3>So it's more of an education thing.</v>

2162
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.020
<v Speaker 3>People just don't know that this matters and that this can help change the whole</v>

2163
01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Internet simply by logging into an app once in a while.</v>

2164
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.353
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2165
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:39.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2166
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.890
<v Speaker 3>it's like organic food.</v>

2167
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean we want to put things into it.</v>

2168
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 3>We want to support things to have integrity.</v>

2169
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 3>So when you click something,</v>

2170
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.830
<v Speaker 3>you are supporting that thing.</v>

2171
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.870
<v Speaker 3>When you're sitting on an app all day,</v>

2172
01:04:52.871 --> 01:04:54.160
<v Speaker 3>you are feeding that APP.</v>

2173
01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.930
<v Speaker 3>That's how the apps get all the money.</v>

2174
01:04:55.931 --> 01:04:58.210
<v Speaker 3>That's where they get all their funding.</v>

2175
01:04:58.211 --> 01:04:59.020
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

2176
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.500
<v Speaker 3>That's where it's all based,</v>

2177
01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:02.980
<v Speaker 3>is in user retention and energy.</v>

2178
01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.730
<v Speaker 3>And do you think that most people were even aware of this?</v>

2179
01:05:06.731 --> 01:05:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they're just using it because it's convenient?</v>

2180
01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:12.010
<v Speaker 3>The biggest shariah going on right now?</v>

2181
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't know that Facebook owns Instagram.</v>

2182
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.950
<v Speaker 3>They think Instagram's like cool because you know it's Facebook,</v>

2183
01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:20.411
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2184
01:05:20.411 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 3>It's one giant umbrella.</v>

2185
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2186
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2187
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2188
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.693
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

2189
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.290
<v Speaker 3>what is the difference between the two?</v>

2190
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Obviously with Instagram it's just pictures mostly.</v>

2191
01:05:29.741 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 3>And then whatever the post is below the pictures.</v>

2192
01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:37.110
<v Speaker 3>But with Facebook it's a lot more commentary and long verbose statements on</v>

2193
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2194
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.320
<v Speaker 3>And then people arguing in the comments about it.</v>

2195
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.393
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

2196
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:43.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2197
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:47.500
<v Speaker 3>they're all the Instagram founders left abandoned ship.</v>

2198
01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:49.150
<v Speaker 3>The whatsapp founders abandoned ship,</v>

2199
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 3>the oculus founder abandoned ship,</v>

2200
01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.140
<v Speaker 3>all because of the privacy stuff.</v>

2201
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.551
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2202
01:05:53.551 --> 01:05:53.891
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2203
01:05:53.891 --> 01:05:55.840
<v Speaker 3>you took this good thing.</v>

2204
01:05:55.841 --> 01:05:56.111
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2205
01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:56.921
<v Speaker 3>it was proprietary.</v>

2206
01:05:56.921 --> 01:06:00.760
<v Speaker 3>So I would argue if it was ever actually a fully good thing,</v>

2207
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.050
<v Speaker 3>but at least it wasn't,</v>

2208
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:02.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2209
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.970
<v Speaker 3>completely corrupted by Facebook.</v>

2210
01:06:03.971 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 3>But all of the founders of those companies left because they hate what's going</v>

2211
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:07.744
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2212
01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.390
<v Speaker 3>What the whatsapp guy joined signal,</v>

2213
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:15.220
<v Speaker 3>which is a really cool opensource anti and encrypted messaging APP.</v>

2214
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.440
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2215
01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.810
<v Speaker 3>these people know to what happened with whatsapp.</v>

2216
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:20.980
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same anymore.</v>

2217
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.020
<v Speaker 3>WHATSAPP is owned by Facebook.</v>

2218
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know this.</v>

2219
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh sorry.</v>

2220
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2221
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:27.401
<v Speaker 3>come on Bro.</v>

2222
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:28.840
<v Speaker 3>Get with a gang of jungle man.</v>

2223
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Well you're deep into this man.</v>

2224
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.740
<v Speaker 3>That's why I want to talk to you.</v>

2225
01:06:32.741 --> 01:06:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2226
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:33.933
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2227
01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 3>and they're all buying up companies and,</v>

2228
01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.280
<v Speaker 3>and using the same sort of ideas.</v>

2229
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2230
01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Now they're talking about integrating the messages between what?</v>

2231
01:06:42.371 --> 01:06:42.821
<v Speaker 3>WHATSAPP,</v>

2232
01:06:42.821 --> 01:06:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Instagram and Facebook.</v>

2233
01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:46.720
<v Speaker 3>So it's all one system rule.</v>

2234
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Centralization.</v>

2237
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:52.773
<v Speaker 3>It has happened.</v>

2238
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:54.460
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't been turned on yet,</v>

2239
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:55.480
<v Speaker 3>but I believe it's happening.</v>

2240
01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2241
01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:57.820
<v Speaker 3>doesn't like your dms on Instagram.</v>

2242
01:06:57.821 --> 01:06:59.500
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to download the Facebook messenger.</v>

2243
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:00.640
<v Speaker 3>So what is,</v>

2244
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:03.140
<v Speaker 3>what are the challenges for something like minds,</v>

2245
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2246
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.951
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2247
01:07:03.951 --> 01:07:05.170
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to take off,</v>

2248
01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:06.160
<v Speaker 3>like there was a,</v>

2249
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:06.431
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2250
01:07:06.431 --> 01:07:11.431
<v Speaker 3>social media Instagram type thing that was around a little while ago.</v>

2251
01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I remember I used it like once and I posted about it and what was that called?</v>

2252
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.370
<v Speaker 3>But then Vero,</v>

2253
01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:19.383
<v Speaker 3>is that what it was?</v>

2254
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.280
<v Speaker 3>But then a lot of people were saying it was bullshit and they're proprietary,</v>

2255
01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 3>which you don't know.</v>

2256
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.050
<v Speaker 3>It's closed source.</v>

2257
01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 3>No idea what's going on behind the scenes.</v>

2258
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Same as the other one.</v>

2259
01:07:28.871 --> 01:07:33.430
<v Speaker 3>A lot of apps try to say that there are alternatives and that,</v>

2260
01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:33.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2261
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:34.721
<v Speaker 3>they support x,</v>

2262
01:07:34.721 --> 01:07:35.071
<v Speaker 3>Y and z.</v>

2263
01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:36.880
<v Speaker 3>No privacy or free speech or whatnot.</v>

2264
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:37.743
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2265
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's any new paradigm if they're not showing their source code so</v>

2266
01:07:43.061 --> 01:07:44.440
<v Speaker 3>that people can see the algorithms,</v>

2267
01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:45.280
<v Speaker 3>the people who care.</v>

2268
01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:45.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2269
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:47.950
<v Speaker 3>obviously most people aren't going to go and inspect the code,</v>

2270
01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:52.900
<v Speaker 3>but just the principle that the experts could cause they will,</v>

2271
01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:53.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2272
01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>there's all kinds of think tanks and whatnot that they would love to dive into</v>

2273
01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 3>the source code to understand how these companies were actually behaving.</v>

2274
01:08:00.311 --> 01:08:01.144
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2275
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2276
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:06.630
<v Speaker 3>waving the privacy flag without being open source or this is getting a little</v>

2277
01:08:07.841 --> 01:08:08.441
<v Speaker 3>bit into the weeds,</v>

2278
01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of this comes down to licensing of,</v>

2279
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.090
<v Speaker 3>of content or code.</v>

2280
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:15.070
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2281
01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 3>the license that we use for our code is called the general public license,</v>

2282
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 3>the Agpl v three,</v>

2283
01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 3>which means that anyone can take our code and do whatever they want with it.</v>

2284
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 3>They can sell it,</v>

2285
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:25.971
<v Speaker 3>they can do anything,</v>

2286
01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:27.410
<v Speaker 3>but if they make changes,</v>

2287
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.420
<v Speaker 3>they have to show them with everybody else.</v>

2288
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.370
<v Speaker 3>So it's sort of like,</v>

2289
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:31.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2290
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.140
<v Speaker 3>the creative Commons,</v>

2291
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Cheryl like license,</v>

2292
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:36.500
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially says the same thing.</v>

2293
01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Take my video photo,</v>

2294
01:08:38.391 --> 01:08:39.081
<v Speaker 3>remix it,</v>

2295
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:39.914
<v Speaker 3>do whatever you want,</v>

2296
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.810
<v Speaker 3>but you have to share the result with everybody else.</v>

2297
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Open source basically means you can do whatever you want with it.</v>

2298
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:48.050
<v Speaker 3>You can take it,</v>

2299
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:49.400
<v Speaker 3>make it your own,</v>

2300
01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:50.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2301
01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:52.430
<v Speaker 3>keep your own little secret sauce of what makes you feel good.</v>

2302
01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:58.540
<v Speaker 3>They get conflated because you know free software sounds like free as in free</v>

2303
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:00.410
<v Speaker 3>beer,</v>

2304
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:01.670
<v Speaker 3>not free as in freedom.</v>

2305
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:04.430
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2306
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:11.040
<v Speaker 3>licensing is really what this all coalesces into [inaudible] and it's been</v>

2307
01:09:13.721 --> 01:09:18.250
<v Speaker 3>proven that you can make a lot of money with free and open source software.</v>

2308
01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at wordpress,</v>

2309
01:09:19.811 --> 01:09:24.811
<v Speaker 3>it's a hugely successful technology corporation and multibillion dollars people</v>

2310
01:09:26.531 --> 01:09:27.370
<v Speaker 3>share the code.</v>

2311
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.250
<v Speaker 3>That's how it,</v>

2312
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:30.640
<v Speaker 3>it created a network effect because they did that.</v>

2313
01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:35.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like the grateful dead would let everybody record their music and how it</v>

2314
01:09:35.111 --> 01:09:35.651
<v Speaker 3>spreads.</v>

2315
01:09:35.651 --> 01:09:40.420
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually a good marketing tactic and it also gives transparency so</v>

2316
01:09:40.421 --> 01:09:42.940
<v Speaker 3>people can see what the hell is going on right now.</v>

2317
01:09:42.941 --> 01:09:45.010
<v Speaker 3>When you started this,</v>

2318
01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:45.830
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2319
01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:50.830
<v Speaker 3>what was your objective and where are you thinking about it as a potential large</v>

2320
01:09:51.101 --> 01:09:55.390
<v Speaker 3>scale source of revenue or were you just thinking this is something that I would</v>

2321
01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:58.840
<v Speaker 3>like to do and do correctly because I don't think anybody's doing it this way.</v>

2322
01:09:58.841 --> 01:09:59.710
<v Speaker 3>Open source,</v>

2323
01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:00.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2324
01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.880
<v Speaker 3>pro censorship or pro a freedom of speech anticensorship and to,</v>

2325
01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:06.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2326
01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:10.780
<v Speaker 3>to just do the bare minimum amount of managing content.</v>

2327
01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone should be able to make money.</v>

2328
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it should have to be mutually exclusive.</v>

2329
01:10:18.031 --> 01:10:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Like you do something for free for everybody and you also can't make money.</v>

2330
01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a big misconception.</v>

2331
01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:26.670
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to give people the tools to make money.</v>

2332
01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean I w w we have like a monthly recurring subscription system,</v>

2333
01:10:30.931 --> 01:10:35.670
<v Speaker 3>sort of like a crypto patrion type tool so you can subscribe to people.</v>

2334
01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:40.530
<v Speaker 3>We had the ability for creators to accept Fiat dollars,</v>

2335
01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:46.100
<v Speaker 3>but we took it out because it's stripe and stripe is a closed source system,</v>

2336
01:10:47.971 --> 01:10:50.640
<v Speaker 3>which we just didn't have longterm faith in.</v>

2337
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.970
<v Speaker 3>So stripe was a,</v>

2338
01:10:51.971 --> 01:10:55.560
<v Speaker 3>and some sort of an extension to your site if we were using their API to</v>

2339
01:10:55.561 --> 01:10:57.000
<v Speaker 3>facilitate peer to peer payments.</v>

2340
01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2341
01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:02.210
<v Speaker 3>this is why I'm really patrion most likely band Carl because Argon of a car Gunn</v>

2342
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.471
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

2343
01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:08.304
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2344
01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:09.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2345
01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:11.430
<v Speaker 3>because the payment processors went to them or like,</v>

2346
01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:12.264
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2347
01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:12.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2348
01:11:12.481 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 3>stripe has strict terms</v>

2349
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:15.360
<v Speaker 4>and we didn't want to be,</v>

2350
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:16.613
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2351
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:18.110
<v Speaker 4>talking to straight.</v>

2352
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:22.770
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't want to be subject to overlords in our company decisions.</v>

2353
01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.490
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2354
01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:29.190
<v Speaker 4>you think that that's what happened with Carl that is most likely what happened.</v>

2355
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 4>So they stepped in and said,</v>

2356
01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:31.050
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2357
01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:32.850
<v Speaker 4>we don't want this guy to be a part of the site.</v>

2358
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:33.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2359
01:11:33.421 --> 01:11:36.960
<v Speaker 4>And I think that stripe probably stepped in with a lot of explicit content,</v>

2360
01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:38.010
<v Speaker 4>controversial content.</v>

2361
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:38.191
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2362
01:11:38.191 --> 01:11:41.550
<v Speaker 4>it's in their policy that you can't facilitate payments dealing with that type</v>

2363
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:42.210
<v Speaker 4>of content.</v>

2364
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:44.010
<v Speaker 4>And now we're seeing banks actually go,</v>

2365
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:45.090
<v Speaker 4>go after people.</v>

2366
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:49.890
<v Speaker 4>Well the thing about Carl doe was that his content that there was questionable,</v>

2367
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:53.070
<v Speaker 4>wasn't even related to patriarch had nothing to do with it.</v>

2368
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:54.930
<v Speaker 4>It was on another person's podcast.</v>

2369
01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:59.020
<v Speaker 4>It was from six months prior and that other person's podcast was on youtube.</v>

2370
01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 4>It had nothing to do with patron.</v>

2371
01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.800
<v Speaker 4>And they had specifically said that they were not going to act on content that</v>

2372
01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 4>was outside of their network.</v>

2373
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:09.930
<v Speaker 4>They were only going to react to things that were on Patrion.</v>

2374
01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:10.970
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2375
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Cause you can make little blogs and stuff on Patrion.</v>

2376
01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2377
01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.610
<v Speaker 4>They do have some content.</v>

2378
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2379
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:16.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2380
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:16.973
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2381
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:18.240
<v Speaker 4>but that's not what patron said.</v>

2382
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:19.650
<v Speaker 4>Obviously the processors,</v>

2383
01:12:19.651 --> 01:12:19.950
<v Speaker 4>Pr,</v>

2384
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:20.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>

2385
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:21.600
<v Speaker 4>who knows.</v>

2386
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:21.901
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2387
01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:22.800
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to act like,</v>

2388
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:26.760
<v Speaker 4>I also don't want it to seem like I have an ideology that I'm trying to push</v>

2389
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:27.660
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2390
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:32.660
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm very open to moving in the direction that makes the most sense for the</v>

2391
01:12:34.261 --> 01:12:34.741
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

2392
01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:35.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2393
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm not attached to what I'm thinking.</v>

2394
01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.180
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

2395
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.380
<v Speaker 4>So I liked that.</v>

2396
01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I wish,</v>

2397
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.400
<v Speaker 4>I wish more people would do that.</v>

2398
01:12:43.401 --> 01:12:43.650
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

2399
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:44.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean I tried to do that.</v>

2400
01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm really getting way better at it,</v>

2401
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:50.150
<v Speaker 4>but it's something I actively work on.</v>

2402
01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 4>Like these ideas that I have,</v>

2403
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm not fucking married them.</v>

2404
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Don't argue them.</v>

2405
01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:55.613
<v Speaker 4>Look at them,</v>

2406
01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.201
<v Speaker 4>look at them.</v>

2407
01:12:56.201 --> 01:12:57.510
<v Speaker 4>And if someone says something different,</v>

2408
01:12:57.511 --> 01:12:57.631
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

2409
01:12:57.631 --> 01:12:58.380
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>

2410
01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:58.890
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2411
01:12:58.890 --> 01:12:59.340
<v Speaker 4>They'll go,</v>

2412
01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.100
<v Speaker 4>no man.</v>

2413
01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:00.211
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2414
01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:01.070
<v Speaker 4>I brought bro.</v>

2415
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:01.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2416
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:01.651
<v Speaker 4>cause that,</v>

2417
01:13:01.651 --> 01:13:06.651
<v Speaker 4>that natural instinct to argue and to claim some sort of a personal identity</v>

2418
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.091
<v Speaker 4>with your,</v>

2419
01:13:09.091 --> 01:13:09.301
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2420
01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:10.290
<v Speaker 4>with your ideas.</v>

2421
01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.000
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2422
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.600
<v Speaker 4>that's part of the problem that we have.</v>

2423
01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2424
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.733
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

2425
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.800
<v Speaker 4>it's a main conflict issue with social media is one of the things that I see a</v>

2426
01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:20.064
<v Speaker 4>lot of that,</v>

2427
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:20.581
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2428
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I used to do it way back in the day.</v>

2429
01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:24.330
<v Speaker 4>If you go back to the early days of Twitter,</v>

2430
01:13:24.331 --> 01:13:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I used to argue with people.</v>

2431
01:13:25.561 --> 01:13:27.450
<v Speaker 4>I used to argue with people on social media.</v>

2432
01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:29.640
<v Speaker 4>Then I realized some long time ago,</v>

2433
01:13:29.641 --> 01:13:32.580
<v Speaker 4>like there is no good that comes out of that.</v>

2434
01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:36.750
<v Speaker 4>I might correct someone if someone said something that's incorrect,</v>

2435
01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:38.850
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not going to argue and I'm not going to insult.</v>

2436
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2437
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2438
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm just not,</v>

2439
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't even,</v>

2440
01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:41.830
<v Speaker 4>doesn't work.</v>

2441
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:42.690
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work.</v>

2442
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 4>It just makes people argue back and insult your back and nothing ever gets</v>

2443
01:13:47.401 --> 01:13:47.881
<v Speaker 4>accomplished.</v>

2444
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally a dunk on people and it's fun.</v>

2445
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:51.121
<v Speaker 4>But Rhea,</v>

2446
01:13:51.121 --> 01:13:51.811
<v Speaker 4>in reality,</v>

2447
01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:52.591
<v Speaker 4>especially me,</v>

2448
01:13:52.591 --> 01:13:52.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2449
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:54.570
<v Speaker 4>I kind of dunk on people for a living.</v>

2450
01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.800
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just gonna,</v>

2451
01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to engage and I don't,</v>

2452
01:13:58.650 --> 01:13:59.970
<v Speaker 4>this is going to sound corny as fuck.</v>

2453
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.</v>

2454
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.213
<v Speaker 4>I really don't.</v>

2455
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:05.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be in some argument where someone is looking at their phone</v>

2456
01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:05.650
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2457
01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:06.720
<v Speaker 4>fucking fuck you.</v>

2458
01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:07.201
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

2459
01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:08.034
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that.</v>

2460
01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:08.873
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that.</v>

2461
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:09.773
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>

2462
01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.003
<v Speaker 4>I know what it is.</v>

2463
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.033
<v Speaker 4>I know what it is,</v>

2464
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:12.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2465
01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:15.580
<v Speaker 1>it's in this flat medium.</v>

2466
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2467
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:19.060
<v Speaker 1>This two dimensional medium of typing,</v>

2468
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:22.870
<v Speaker 1>text and then sending taxed and you type tax and San taxed,</v>

2469
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:28.240
<v Speaker 1>the conflict that arises through that is never beneficial in my opinion.</v>

2470
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't get anything out of it.</v>

2471
01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

2472
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2473
01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>if I'm expressing something,</v>

2474
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:34.840
<v Speaker 1>almost always,</v>

2475
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.961
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2476
01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:36.870
<v Speaker 1>try to express something about shit I like,</v>

2477
01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2478
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:37.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:14:37.451 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I love this new show.</v>

2480
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:39.640
<v Speaker 1>All this movie was great.</v>

2481
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2482
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:41.080

2483
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Like check out this picture.</v>

2484
01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:44.620
<v Speaker 1>You might want to check this out.</v>

2485
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.160
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2486
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:45.993
<v Speaker 1>it's tone.</v>

2487
01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2488
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:46.931
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

2489
01:14:46.931 --> 01:14:47.480
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

2490
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2491
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.401
<v Speaker 1>same with me.</v>

2492
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:53.401
<v Speaker 1>Like I was much more trying to convince people about what I thought was right.</v>

2493
01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:54.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2494
01:14:54.671 --> 01:14:55.510
<v Speaker 1>coming out of college,</v>

2495
01:14:55.511 --> 01:14:57.160
<v Speaker 1>you think you're all high and mighty.</v>

2496
01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>

2497
01:14:59.050 --> 01:14:59.883
<v Speaker 1>People just,</v>

2498
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:00.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2499
01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.020
<v Speaker 1>are allergic to I'm allergic to,</v>

2500
01:15:02.021 --> 01:15:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I cannot handle it.</v>

2501
01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:04.253
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>

2502
01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:06.460
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to to talk like that.</v>

2503
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:08.080
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if you're having a good time.</v>

2504
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:08.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2505
01:15:08.261 --> 01:15:10.420
<v Speaker 1>And trying to just like show someone up.</v>

2506
01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:10.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2507
01:15:10.921 --> 01:15:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2508
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:11.621
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>

2509
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:12.431
<v Speaker 1>you can have fun with it.</v>

2510
01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 1>It's more comedic.</v>

2511
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:16.090
<v Speaker 1>But when you're actually taking yourself seriously,</v>

2512
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:18.550
<v Speaker 1>like it's not going to work.</v>

2513
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2514
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to work.</v>

2515
01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And it actually has the exact opposite effect.</v>

2516
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:24.431
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

2517
01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:25.264
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2518
01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:26.680
<v Speaker 1>the expression,</v>

2519
01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:28.060
<v Speaker 1>what w how's expression?</v>

2520
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Like a jealousy is like a poison.</v>

2521
01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:33.460
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

2522
01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.001
<v Speaker 1>how does it go?</v>

2523
01:15:34.001 --> 01:15:39.001
<v Speaker 1>Jealousy is like a poison that you take yourself because you don't like what</v>

2524
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:40.930
<v Speaker 1>someone else's accomplishing.</v>

2525
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I forget the terrible job paraphrase Matt and I,</v>

2526
01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:44.201
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2527
01:15:44.201 --> 01:15:48.250
<v Speaker 1>my worst paraphrasing of all time mumble mouth motherfucker than I am.</v>

2528
01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.210
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2529
01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:52.000
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is that it has the exact opposite effect.</v>

2530
01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Like [inaudible] jealous about someone that actually makes you feel bad instead</v>

2531
01:15:55.481 --> 01:15:56.170
<v Speaker 1>of them feel bad.</v>

2532
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:57.910
<v Speaker 1>It also makes them not want to hang out with you.</v>

2533
01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2534
01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:58.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2535
01:15:58.751 --> 01:15:59.800
<v Speaker 1>they probably don't want hanging out with you anyway,</v>

2536
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:00.634
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest.</v>

2537
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:01.623
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2538
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.790
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2539
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2540
01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:07.300
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing by back and forth on.</v>

2541
01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:07.781
<v Speaker 1>So I know,</v>

2542
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:11.320
<v Speaker 1>and I know people who do engage in it and sometimes they have these,</v>

2543
01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:11.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2544
01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:15.850
<v Speaker 1>anxiety moments where they don't sleep for days because they're involved in</v>

2545
01:16:15.851 --> 01:16:16.870
<v Speaker 1>these Twitter feuds.</v>

2546
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2547
01:16:17.681 --> 01:16:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I know people that have done this where they've gotten involved in Twitter feuds</v>

2548
01:16:20.281 --> 01:16:20.351
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2549
01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:22.570
<v Speaker 1>they'll wake up three o'clock in the morning to check their Twitter feed and</v>

2550
01:16:22.571 --> 01:16:22.780
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2551
01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.860
<v Speaker 1>oh Christ man,</v>

2552
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:25.600
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta go,</v>

2553
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:26.081
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2554
01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:26.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2555
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.880
<v Speaker 1>go on a yoga retreat or something.</v>

2556
01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2557
01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 1>he can't do this.</v>

2558
01:16:28.991 --> 01:16:30.280
<v Speaker 1>You can't live your life like this.</v>

2559
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I think there may be some value to the debate.</v>

2560
01:16:37.061 --> 01:16:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Have it should be there.</v>

2561
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:40.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just be there debate and it's like,</v>

2562
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.601
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2563
01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to spend my time doing it that way.</v>

2564
01:16:43.661 --> 01:16:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Some people want to spend their time doing it that way.</v>

2565
01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And if there's cool mechanisms for,</v>

2566
01:16:47.501 --> 01:16:47.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2567
01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>the most voted content to be seen.</v>

2568
01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2569
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2570
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:51.551
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2571
01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:53.310
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting to check out sometimes too,</v>

2572
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:54.370
<v Speaker 1>to look at feedback,</v>

2573
01:16:54.371 --> 01:16:56.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2574
01:16:56.231 --> 01:16:57.064
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2575
01:16:57.490 --> 01:16:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2576
01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not nearly as an effective way of communicating your ideas as like making</v>

2577
01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:04.300
<v Speaker 1>something more personal.</v>

2578
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:05.980
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>

2579
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:06.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2580
01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:07.414
<v Speaker 1>even video is,</v>

2581
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:07.740
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2582
01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>is more effective than that because people actually</v>

2583
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.740
<v Speaker 4>have a chance to look at you or obviously in person.</v>

2584
01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2588
01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 4>in person is obviously the best.</v>

2589
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2590
01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:21.020
<v Speaker 4>and I think my concern really about the futures.</v>

2591
01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:22.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm holding back a sneeze right now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2593

2594
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.133
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I can,</v>

2595
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.820
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those borderline ones.</v>

2596
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.610
<v Speaker 4>What he's supposed to do.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Are you trying to resist?</v>

2599
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:34.750
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

2600

<v Speaker 4>We're good.</v>

2603
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.033
<v Speaker 4>We're out of the woods.</v>

2604
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.963
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2605
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:38.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2606
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:39.800
<v Speaker 4>I lost my train of thought.</v>

2607
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:40.191
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

2608
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:40.870
<v Speaker 4>What were we just saying?</v>

2609
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:41.021

<v Speaker 4>no jealousy quote.</v>

2612
01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:44.960
<v Speaker 4>You're talking to your,</v>

2613
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.741
<v Speaker 4>we want to get past that.</v>

2614
01:17:45.741 --> 01:17:46.100
<v Speaker 4>And Jamie,</v>

2615
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.960
<v Speaker 4>I know we for days I was looking for it and then</v>

2616
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I lost it.</v>

2617
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 4>I lost it in my,</v>

2618
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:53.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2619
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:55.580
<v Speaker 4>holding back a sneeze that,</v>

2620
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:56.181
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2621
01:17:56.181 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 4>that's what I was worried about Ai.</v>

2622
01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not AI augmented reality.</v>

2623
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.250
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm really worried about.</v>

2624
01:18:01.251 --> 01:18:02.480
<v Speaker 4>Not Artificial but augmented.</v>

2625
01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.440
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2626
01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

2627
01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.850
<v Speaker 4>my concern is at what we're experiencing right now in this flat form of two</v>

2628
01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:12.710
<v Speaker 4>dimensional taxed is something that is very overwhelming to a lot of people's</v>

2629
01:18:12.711 --> 01:18:13.191
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2630
01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:15.980
<v Speaker 4>And you're looking at some kids that are online social media,</v>

2631
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.311
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>

2632
01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 4>10 hours a day just staring at their phones.</v>

2633
01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:19.850
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2634
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:24.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm extremely concerned and I have some jokes about it in my act about the next</v>

2635
01:18:24.381 --> 01:18:29.381
<v Speaker 4>wave because I think that we are overwhelmed by this incredibly attractive</v>

2636
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.520
<v Speaker 4>medium where we're,</v>

2637
01:18:32.521 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 4>we're attracted to,</v>

2638
01:18:33.531 --> 01:18:38.290
<v Speaker 4>our phones were attracted to this style of engaging and information,</v>

2639
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:40.010
<v Speaker 4>receiving information and passing it from it.</v>

2640
01:18:40.011 --> 01:18:42.500
<v Speaker 4>And then an online arguments and debates and,</v>

2641
01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.830
<v Speaker 4>and looking at pictures and this constant stream,</v>

2642
01:18:45.831 --> 01:18:46.610
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

2643
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:47.443
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2644
01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:49.040
<v Speaker 4>just looking at your phone,</v>

2645
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.110
<v Speaker 4>it's not that thrilling.</v>

2646
01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:51.970
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

2647
01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:52.580
<v Speaker 4>hmm.</v>

2648
01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.110
<v Speaker 4>It's not that thrilling and just like,</v>

2649
01:18:54.111 --> 01:18:54.530
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2650
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.830
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2651
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.870
<v Speaker 4>but it's still getting you all day long.</v>

2652
01:18:57.050 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 4>Like there's nothing really crazy happening when my concern is if something</v>

2653
01:19:01.311 --> 01:19:03.080
<v Speaker 4>really crazy does start to happen,</v>

2654
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:08.150
<v Speaker 4>when you really can have experiences that are a hyper normal like that are that</v>

2655
01:19:08.151 --> 01:19:13.151
<v Speaker 4>are more powerful than anything you can experience in this regular carbon based</v>

2656
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.890
<v Speaker 4>physical touch and feel world.</v>

2657
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.980
<v Speaker 4>And once we start experiencing augmented reality,</v>

2658
01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.160
<v Speaker 4>the integration between humans and technology and then the ability to share</v>

2659
01:19:24.561 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 4>augmented reality like to shit.</v>

2660
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:30.980
<v Speaker 4>Like if you were at work and you have these fucking goggles on and your</v>

2661
01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:34.090
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend is at work on the other side of town and you,</v>

2662
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.120
<v Speaker 4>you guys both have like these similar video pets that are with you and dancing</v>

2663
01:19:40.371 --> 01:19:44.420
<v Speaker 4>around and providing you with fucking advertisements and giving you things</v>

2664
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:44.901
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2665
01:19:44.901 --> 01:19:45.320
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2666
01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 4>there's next levels to this stuff that I'm trying to like see the future,</v>

2667
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 4>but I'm too fucking stupid and I don't really know anything about technology,</v>

2668
01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.930
<v Speaker 4>but I know that they're going to get deeper into our lives.</v>

2669
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:58.580
<v Speaker 4>I know that these technologies,</v>

2670
01:19:58.610 --> 01:19:59.780
<v Speaker 4>not they liked the government,</v>

2671
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:01.070
<v Speaker 4>but these technologies,</v>

2672
01:20:01.071 --> 01:20:05.840
<v Speaker 4>they're going to get deeper into your life and that they got you by the balls</v>

2673
01:20:05.841 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 4>and the clit with a fucking phone</v>

2674
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.840
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't even do much.</v>

2675
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Take some pictures,</v>

2676
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:12.600
<v Speaker 3>look at some pictures,</v>

2677
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:13.620
<v Speaker 3>look at some text,</v>

2678
01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:14.640
<v Speaker 3>watch some videos.</v>

2679
01:20:14.641 --> 01:20:18.180
<v Speaker 3>That's all it does and access to most human knowledge.</v>

2680
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.990
<v Speaker 3>That's true,</v>

2681
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:20.130
<v Speaker 3>but how many people are using that?</v>

2682
01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2683
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.871
<v Speaker 3>Was He,</v>

2685
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:22.170
<v Speaker 3>they are for sure.</v>

2686
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 3>They definitely are.</v>

2687
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.240
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of googling going on.</v>

2688
01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:25.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:20.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like a rare entertainment thing to do.</v>

2728
01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:24.090
<v Speaker 3>I just want to make sure that like see even with the robots that we're carrying</v>

2729
01:21:24.091 --> 01:21:26.970
<v Speaker 3>around now do is,</v>

2730
01:21:26.971 --> 01:21:30.030
<v Speaker 3>is it respecting my freedom is this thing on my side?</v>

2731
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2732
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:34.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is right now because I'm using android is open source.</v>

2733
01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Are you an android guy?</v>

2734
01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:36.201
<v Speaker 3>Of course you will.</v>

2735
01:21:36.201 --> 01:21:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2736
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:39.330
<v Speaker 3>But all this crypto guys,</v>

2737
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:40.270
<v Speaker 3>they're all android.</v>

2738
01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:43.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just more freedom.</v>

2739
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:49.330
<v Speaker 3>But now Google's version of android is just as bad as ILS whose version of</v>

2740
01:21:49.381 --> 01:21:50.220
<v Speaker 3>android to use.</v>

2741
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

2742
01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:52.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2743
01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:53.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2744
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:53.320
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2745
01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling him,</v>

2746
01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:54.391
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2747
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:55.021
<v Speaker 3>I'm not perfect.</v>

2748
01:21:55.021 --> 01:21:55.441
<v Speaker 3>I'm on,</v>

2749
01:21:55.441 --> 01:21:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the Google android right now,</v>

2750
01:21:56.941 --> 01:21:58.410
<v Speaker 3>but there's a version called replicant,</v>

2751
01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.273
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2752
01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:02.970
<v Speaker 3>which is a fully free version of android that I'm probably,</v>

2753
01:22:02.971 --> 01:22:05.040
<v Speaker 3>because I just cracked my phone like a day ago,</v>

2754
01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 3>so I might get a new one.</v>

2755
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:06.744
<v Speaker 3>What do you use him?</v>

2756
01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.490
<v Speaker 3>What phone do you use as eight?</v>

2757
01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:09.541
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2758
01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:10.374
<v Speaker 3>look at you.</v>

2759
01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2760
01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:11.643
<v Speaker 3>kind of retro.</v>

2761
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Is it like a year ago,</v>

2762
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:14.970
<v Speaker 3>there's this one called the black phone,</v>

2763
01:22:14.971 --> 01:22:15.840
<v Speaker 3>which I'm looking into,</v>

2764
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:16.470
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2765
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:18.930
<v Speaker 3>it's like a hyper encrypted phone,</v>

2766
01:22:18.931 --> 01:22:19.611
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

2767
01:22:19.611 --> 01:22:20.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's,</v>

2768
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:22.170
<v Speaker 3>if it's fully free.</v>

2769
01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:25.860
<v Speaker 3>So isn't there a blockchain based phone that there were coming out with and the</v>

2770
01:22:25.861 --> 01:22:26.910
<v Speaker 3>theory and base phone?</v>

2771
01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that,</v>

2772
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2773
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.421
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2774
01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that something Jamie?</v>

2775
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:31.201
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2776
01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:32.280
<v Speaker 3>I definitely got announced,</v>

2777
01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:33.750
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know that it's still in development.</v>

2778
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.330
<v Speaker 3>You can't run everything on a blockchain?</v>

2779
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.780
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2780
01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Blockchains are pretty slow.</v>

2781
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2782
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.520
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2783
01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.920
<v Speaker 3>we use it even to publish to the ethereum blockchain.</v>

2784
01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Like when you send each other payments on mines,</v>

2785
01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:47.940
<v Speaker 3>it costs like,</v>

2786
01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:48.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2787
01:22:48.121 --> 01:22:48.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a gas fee.</v>

2788
01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:54.290
<v Speaker 3>So the way that the network is powered is that the miners get paid with gas with</v>

2789
01:22:54.421 --> 01:22:55.254
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of ether.</v>

2790
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.670
<v Speaker 3>So cost like a buck to do a post.</v>

2791
01:22:57.671 --> 01:22:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Like there's fully decentralized social networks.</v>

2792
01:22:59.431 --> 01:23:00.750
<v Speaker 3>There's one called a PP,</v>

2793
01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:04.110
<v Speaker 3>which you have to pay for everything you do right on on it.</v>

2794
01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.430
<v Speaker 3>And so this is why it's,</v>

2795
01:23:05.431 --> 01:23:06.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a cool experiment,</v>

2796
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's really not scalable.</v>

2797
01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.610
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2798
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:11.110
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be a combination of,</v>

2799
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:12.520
<v Speaker 1>of decentralized technology.</v>

2800
01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Like not just blockchain.</v>

2801
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:16.443
<v Speaker 1>People like to,</v>

2802
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2803
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.870
<v Speaker 1>say the blockchain is going to solve all the problems and it's,</v>

2804
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.110
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna solve a lot of problems.</v>

2805
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredible tool.</v>

2806
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:22.630
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2807
01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I am a,</v>

2808
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.361
<v Speaker 1>what does this,</v>

2809
01:23:25.361 --> 01:23:25.721
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2810
01:23:25.721 --> 01:23:28.570
<v Speaker 1>is this it the Finney one that's out now?</v>

2811
01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:28.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2812
01:23:28.781 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2813
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.190
<v Speaker 1>just what I'm saying,</v>

2814
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.150
<v Speaker 1>like a month ago or pretty siren.</v>

2815
01:23:33.151 --> 01:23:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2816
01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.260
<v Speaker 1>s which I'm not exactly what does that jazz,</v>

2817
01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:37.180
<v Speaker 1>good luck getting the fucking app with that.</v>

2818
01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Then in some of those android apps,</v>

2819
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:40.671
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2820
01:23:40.671 --> 01:23:41.381
<v Speaker 1>they're sneaky,</v>

2821
01:23:41.381 --> 01:23:41.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2822
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't they steal bitcoin?</v>

2823
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:44.560
<v Speaker 1>There was an android app that,</v>

2824
01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:44.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2825
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 1>got in trouble for stealing cryptocurrency.</v>

2826
01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.200
<v Speaker 1>It was a stealing it in the background.</v>

2827
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:50.561
<v Speaker 1>While you,</v>

2828
01:23:50.561 --> 01:23:53.410
<v Speaker 1>while you had your app open and it was on the Google play store.</v>

2829
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:54.100
<v Speaker 1>See if that's true.</v>

2830
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not have made something up.</v>

2831
01:23:55.001 --> 01:23:55.834
<v Speaker 1>I could get sued.</v>

2832
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:57.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I did though.</v>

2833
01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it might've been mining and I think it was stealing.</v>

2834
01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2835
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:03.820
<v Speaker 1>we'll pull that up so we could see it.</v>

2836
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2837
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I have an android phone as well.</v>

2838
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I have a note nine.</v>

2839
01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.313
<v Speaker 1>I really like it.</v>

2840
01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:10.150
<v Speaker 1>It's giant.</v>

2841
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Huge screen.</v>

2842
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Great battery life.</v>

2843
01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

2844
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.540
<v Speaker 1>So you use both?</v>

2845
01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2846
01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin scam warning over fake android APP that steals cryptocurrency from your</v>

2847
01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:18.341
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

2848
01:24:18.341 --> 01:24:18.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2849
01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:19.354
<v Speaker 1>I use both.</v>

2850
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.253
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2851
01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Andrew is very good now.</v>

2852
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:22.383
<v Speaker 1>It's very good.</v>

2853
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2854
01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I was an early adopter and it was like clunky and shitty and then I would go to</v>

2855
01:24:26.591 --> 01:24:27.170
<v Speaker 1>my iPhone.</v>

2856
01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:27.401
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2857
01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:27.731
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2858
01:24:27.731 --> 01:24:28.564
<v Speaker 1>this is so much better.</v>

2859
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.411
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2860
01:24:29.411 --> 01:24:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Iphone is great with his integration with like Apple TV integration with a</v>

2861
01:24:33.341 --> 01:24:33.971
<v Speaker 1>laptop.</v>

2862
01:24:33.971 --> 01:24:36.530
<v Speaker 1>But I also have a windows laptop that I use a lot of.</v>

2863
01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.361
<v Speaker 1>I really like a,</v>

2864
01:24:37.361 --> 01:24:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I have a Lenovo think pad for,</v>

2865
01:24:39.821 --> 01:24:42.220
<v Speaker 1>as for writing the keyboards better.</v>

2866
01:24:42.221 --> 01:24:42.641
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2867
01:24:42.641 --> 01:24:47.641
<v Speaker 1>I actually bought an older Mac book just for the keyboard because as a writer</v>

2868
01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:48.310
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2869
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you want tactile feedback as you're writing.</v>

2870
01:24:51.131 --> 01:24:51.964
<v Speaker 1>It just helps.</v>

2871
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:54.970
<v Speaker 1>It makes it easier for you to recognize where the keys are.</v>

2872
01:24:55.330 --> 01:25:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And Apple has decided to go so far towards design and just for aesthetic beauty</v>

2873
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.850
<v Speaker 1>that they've ruined the tactile feedback to you.</v>

2874
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Remember that though when the old smart phones,</v>

2875
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

2876
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.290
<v Speaker 1>they still had the keyboard.</v>

2877
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I thought I would never leave that because he's tactile.</v>

2878
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:15.303
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2879
01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately left.</v>

2880
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:17.081
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2881
01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:18.550
<v Speaker 1>But that's a different experience.</v>

2882
01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.780
<v Speaker 1>That's just yams.</v>

2883
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I can do that with my thumbs and I kind of know where everything is and I'm not</v>

2884
01:25:23.231 --> 01:25:24.160
<v Speaker 1>writing a novel.</v>

2885
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2886
01:25:24.851 --> 01:25:28.000
<v Speaker 1>when I'm writing a material or essays or something like that,</v>

2887
01:25:28.001 --> 01:25:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

2888
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I need a fucking keyboard.</v>

2889
01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:32.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that the holographic screen that's just here,</v>

2890
01:25:32.411 --> 01:25:35.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't think if it just like auto corrects everything you do and you could</v>

2891
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:37.540
<v Speaker 1>just like maybe,</v>

2892
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:38.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

2893
01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:38.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2894
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I liked the tactile too.</v>

2895
01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

2896
01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:42.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a feeling I like mechanical keyboards.</v>

2897
01:25:42.581 --> 01:25:43.390
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2898
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:44.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a feeling of knowing.</v>

2899
01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:45.773
<v Speaker 1>Could you,</v>

2900
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 1>did you test out that facetime bug?</v>

2901
01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear about face time bug and there was a facetime bug where?</v>

2902
01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:54.843
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

2903
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.903
<v Speaker 1>You didn't see that?</v>

2904
01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:56.741
<v Speaker 1>I heard about it,</v>

2905
01:25:56.741 --> 01:25:58.030
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't look into it at all.</v>

2906
01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:01.210
<v Speaker 1>We didn't test it out and play with basically you could call someone and hear</v>

2907
01:26:01.211 --> 01:26:02.650
<v Speaker 1>them without them picking up.</v>

2908
01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2909
01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Without</v>

2910
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.830
<v Speaker 3>them picking up.</v>

2911
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Then picking it up.</v>

2912
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2913
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:10.900
<v Speaker 3>so the thing is ringing on facetime and they don't even have to pick up and then</v>

2914
01:26:11.151 --> 01:26:12.980
<v Speaker 3>you're on the other end talking shit about them.</v>

2915
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2916
01:26:13.150 --> 01:26:14.480
<v Speaker 3>He's basically surveil anybody,</v>

2917
01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Bill and fuck minds.</v>

2918
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:17.390
<v Speaker 3>That guy's full of shit.</v>

2919
01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:18.950
<v Speaker 3>As soon as the big companies come to him,</v>

2920
01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 3>he's going to stick his ass in the air just like all of them to the camera can</v>

2921
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:24.350
<v Speaker 3>be turned on to make sense.</v>

2922
01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:25.820
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about that when I'm beating off,</v>

2923
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:27.763
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>

2924
01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:28.963
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>

2925
01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:30.523
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2926
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.020
<v Speaker 3>apple acts like it cares about privacy,</v>

2927
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:36.680
<v Speaker 3>which maybe it doesn't turn certain overthinks the FBI,</v>

2928
01:26:36.710 --> 01:26:38.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly what's,</v>

2929
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:41.300
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know what the apple phones are doing.</v>

2930
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2931
01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.180
<v Speaker 3>Apple is all locked down,</v>

2932
01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:45.043
<v Speaker 3>closed source.</v>

2933
01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:50.710
<v Speaker 3>And additionally there was a creepy speech that Tim Cook just just gave creepy.</v>

2934
01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Did you see it?</v>

2935
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:52.340
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2936
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Let's listen to it.</v>

2937
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2938
01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:53.941
<v Speaker 3>let's listen to his show.</v>

2939
01:26:53.941 --> 01:26:54.980
<v Speaker 3>He plays folky music,</v>

2940
01:26:54.981 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Adl speech.</v>

2941
01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any spooky music you could play in the background while he's doing</v>

2942
01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:00.164
<v Speaker 3>the speech?</v>

2943
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:02.900
<v Speaker 3>We might get in trouble for that.</v>

2944
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:04.880
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

2945
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:06.260
<v Speaker 3>it's good intentions.</v>

2946
01:27:06.261 --> 01:27:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Like people who want less hate speech,</v>

2947
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:11.100
<v Speaker 3>we all want less h beach.</v>

2948
01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Of course we want people to get along better.</v>

2949
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:15.103
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2950
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.340
<v Speaker 3>But this idea that I don't want to give too much away,</v>

2951
01:27:19.341 --> 01:27:19.821
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2952
01:27:19.821 --> 01:27:24.821
<v Speaker 3>he's acting as if they are going to be the moral authority about the types of</v>

2953
01:27:26.151 --> 01:27:28.460
<v Speaker 3>content that can exist on the APP store.</v>

2954
01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2955
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:32.630
<v Speaker 3>So I just don't know how that's scalable.</v>

2956
01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:33.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2957
01:27:33.591 --> 01:27:34.424
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2958
01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Like let's hear what here.</v>

2959
01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.380
<v Speaker 3>I was just hoping this is the right one is,</v>

2960
01:27:37.381 --> 01:27:38.150
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>

2961
01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:43.150
<v Speaker 3>It says CEO Tim Cook Banning Hate Division is the right thing to do.</v>

2962
01:27:43.761 --> 01:27:44.481
<v Speaker 3>12 three,</v>

2963
01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:45.680
<v Speaker 3>2018 is that it?</v>

2964
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 3>December.</v>

2965
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:46.910
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2966
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:47.241
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2967
01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:48.074
<v Speaker 3>Let's hear it.</v>

2968
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:49.161
<v Speaker 3>Hello,</v>

2969
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:49.994
<v Speaker 3>Tim.</v>

2970
01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.553
<v Speaker 3>Volume please.</v>

2971
01:27:52.110 --> 01:27:57.110
<v Speaker 3>Devices connected to the humanity that makes us us.</v>

2972
01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:00.890
<v Speaker 7>We do that in many ways.</v>

2973
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:06.580
<v Speaker 7>What are the most important is how we honor a teaching that can be found in</v>

2974
01:28:07.431 --> 01:28:08.264
<v Speaker 7>Judaism,</v>

2975
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 7>but is shared across all faiths and traditions.</v>

2976
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:17.860
<v Speaker 7>It's a lesson that was carried forward by the late Elie Rizal.</v>

2977
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.170
<v Speaker 7>May his memory be a blessing.</v>

2978
01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:27.460
<v Speaker 7>It's a lesson put into practice by America's Muslim community who raised</v>

2979
01:28:27.671 --> 01:28:30.860
<v Speaker 7>thousands for the victims of the tree of life killings,</v>

2980
01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.540
<v Speaker 7>Lowe,</v>

2981
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.410
<v Speaker 7>Tom Mode.</v>

2982
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:35.030
<v Speaker 7>I'll dom ray ACA.</v>

2983
01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:39.260
<v Speaker 7>Do not be indifferent to the bloodshed of your fellow man.</v>

2984
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:42.770
<v Speaker 7>Do not be indifferent.</v>

2985
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.560
<v Speaker 7>This mandate moves us to speak up for immigrants and for those who seek</v>

2986
01:28:51.591 --> 01:28:53.870
<v Speaker 7>opportunity in the United States.</v>

2987
01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:59.090
<v Speaker 7>We do it not only because they're individual dignity,</v>

2988
01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.170
<v Speaker 7>creativity,</v>

2989
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.190
<v Speaker 7>and ingenuity,</v>

2990
01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:05.130
<v Speaker 7>the power to make this country and even better place,</v>

2991
01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:10.940
<v Speaker 7>but because our own humanity commands us to welcome those who knew need welcome.</v>

2992
01:29:14.230 --> 01:29:19.230
<v Speaker 7>It moves us to speak up for the Lgbtq community for those whose differences can</v>

2993
01:29:20.531 --> 01:29:23.350
<v Speaker 7>make them a target for violence and scorn.</v>

2994
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:25.151
<v Speaker 7>We do so.</v>

2995
01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:30.151
<v Speaker 7>Not only because these unique and uncommon perspectives can open our eyes to new</v>

2996
01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:32.260
<v Speaker 7>ways of thinking,</v>

2997
01:29:33.190 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 7>but because our own dignity moves us to see the dignity and others,</v>

2998
01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.160
<v Speaker 7>perhaps most importantly,</v>

2999
01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:45.430
<v Speaker 7>it drives us not to be bystanders.</v>

3000
01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:46.511
<v Speaker 7>Bystanders,</v>

3001
01:29:46.511 --> 01:29:50.860
<v Speaker 7>as hate tries to make its headquarters in the digital world</v>

3002
01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:53.650
<v Speaker 7>and apple,</v>

3003
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:58.210
<v Speaker 7>we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on this</v>

3004
01:29:58.211 --> 01:29:59.080
<v Speaker 7>challenge.</v>

3005
01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:02.410
<v Speaker 7>There is no time to get tied up in knots.</v>

3006
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.720
<v Speaker 8>Okay?</v>

3007
01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.720
<v Speaker 7>That's why we only have one message for those who seek to push hate division and</v>

3008
01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:12.900
<v Speaker 7>violence.</v>

3009
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:14.820
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3010
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:18.420
<v Speaker 7>You have no place on our platforms.</v>

3011
01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:23.930
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible]</v>

3012
01:30:27.710 --> 01:30:32.710
<v Speaker 7>you have no home here from the earliest days of Itunes to apple music today.</v>

3013
01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:39.260
<v Speaker 7>We have always prohibited music with a message of white supremacy.</v>

3014
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:40.011
<v Speaker 7>Hold on.</v>

3015
01:30:40.011 --> 01:30:40.844
<v Speaker 7>Sorry.</v>

3016
01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.813
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3017
01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:45.120
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3018
01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.710
<v Speaker 4>what do you think they're signaling here?</v>

3019
01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Like are they signaling that they're about to start censoring things?</v>

3020
01:30:50.041 --> 01:30:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Like what do they already,</v>

3021
01:30:51.691 --> 01:30:53.430
<v Speaker 4>are they okay?</v>

3022
01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:54.231
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

3023
01:30:54.231 --> 01:30:57.480
<v Speaker 4>The shit you probably shouldn't put white supremacy music on,</v>

3024
01:30:57.870 --> 01:31:01.050
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of like really violent stuff that you can get on iTunes.</v>

3025
01:31:01.051 --> 01:31:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3026
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:03.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you go back to the old Nwa albums,</v>

3027
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:05.940
<v Speaker 4>there's some that's available,</v>

3028
01:31:05.941 --> 01:31:06.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3029
01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:06.961
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3030
01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:07.794
<v Speaker 4>I guess I would,</v>

3031
01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:08.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming.</v>

3032
01:31:08.611 --> 01:31:09.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3033
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:10.110
<v Speaker 4>that it is for sure.</v>

3034
01:31:10.111 --> 01:31:10.680
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

3035
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.990
<v Speaker 4>like straight Outta Compton,</v>

3036
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:12.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3037
01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.580
<v Speaker 4>some violin shit.</v>

3038
01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:16.770
<v Speaker 4>And then how about the films that they have?</v>

3039
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:19.620
<v Speaker 4>How about the films that you can get on the iTunes store?</v>

3040
01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.940
<v Speaker 4>There is a lot of very,</v>

3041
01:31:20.941 --> 01:31:21.331
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

3042
01:31:21.331 --> 01:31:23.010
<v Speaker 4>very violent films,</v>

3043
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:24.870
<v Speaker 4>like extremely violent.</v>

3044
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:26.910
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of films that like,</v>

3045
01:31:27.690 --> 01:31:31.680
<v Speaker 4>is it that they're making the distinction between something that's fiction that</v>

3046
01:31:31.681 --> 01:31:33.300
<v Speaker 4>although it may be disturbing,</v>

3047
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:37.980
<v Speaker 4>you understand that this is a movie and this is something someone wrote versus</v>

3048
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:42.480
<v Speaker 4>someone art versus versus someone with commentary,</v>

3049
01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:43.470
<v Speaker 4>their commentary say.</v>

3050
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:44.730
<v Speaker 4>And then here's the other thing.</v>

3051
01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.780
<v Speaker 4>Well he was saying hate and division.</v>

3052
01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.180
<v Speaker 4>They won't promote division,</v>

3053
01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:52.440
<v Speaker 4>but that's a weird one.</v>

3054
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:52.621
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3055
01:31:52.621 --> 01:31:53.221
<v Speaker 4>That means like,</v>

3056
01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

3057
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.540
<v Speaker 4>People who disagree with you and what does division has good intentions.</v>

3058
01:31:57.541 --> 01:31:58.740
<v Speaker 4>You can sort of steal it.</v>

3059
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:59.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3060
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 4>The problem with this,</v>

3061
01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:02.170
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

3062
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:05.170
<v Speaker 1>he's not allowing the conversation to take place.</v>

3063
01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:10.171
<v Speaker 1>So this is in direct conflict with the Daryl Davises with confronting these</v>

3064
01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 1>issues so we can kill it.</v>

3065
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.241
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

3066
01:32:16.241 --> 01:32:16.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3067
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:17.900
<v Speaker 1>w w when,</v>

3068
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:21.280
<v Speaker 1>when he's saying you have no place on our platform,</v>

3069
01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:25.090
<v Speaker 1>they probably feel like you can go somewhere else.</v>

3070
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.890
<v Speaker 1>He's building a wall.</v>

3071
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:27.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3072
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3073
01:32:28.661 --> 01:32:29.590
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I'm saying,</v>

3074
01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:31.480
<v Speaker 1>like everybody kind of feels like you can go somewhere.</v>

3075
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.500
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens though.</v>

3076
01:32:32.501 --> 01:32:35.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's how things get more radicalized and everybody goes to Gab.</v>

3077
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:38.470
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

3078
01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3079
01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:40.990
<v Speaker 1>the conversation needs to take place.</v>

3080
01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:41.780
<v Speaker 1>People on the lap,</v>

3081
01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:42.520
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3082
01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:46.630
<v Speaker 1>he's acting like he's speaking for all Lgbtq people.</v>

3083
01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3084
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.823
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

3085
01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:53.040
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of people on the left and Lgbtq people aren't always on the left,</v>

3086
01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:55.750
<v Speaker 1>and not all of them want that.</v>

3087
01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:55.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3088
01:32:55.991 --> 01:32:56.824
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

3089
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.720
<v Speaker 1>there's division in LBG,</v>

3090
01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:01.150
<v Speaker 1>t and Q,</v>

3091
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:02.291
<v Speaker 1>like there's a,</v>

3092
01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:05.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a big issue right now with Martina Navratilova that was going on about</v>

3093
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:10.950
<v Speaker 1>her discussing the reality of Trans Women competing against biological women and</v>

3094
01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:16.720
<v Speaker 1>that she opposes it and she thinks is there some fundamental advantages,</v>

3095
01:33:16.721 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 1>which is leading to a lot of weightlifting world records being broken by Trans</v>

3096
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>

3097
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:21.641
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

3098
01:33:21.641 --> 01:33:23.050
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking preposterous.</v>

3099
01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And including Trans Women with penises,</v>

3100
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:27.040
<v Speaker 1>now they're attacking her for being trans phobic.</v>

3101
01:33:27.041 --> 01:33:32.041
<v Speaker 1>So there's not even a United and United opinion in the Lbgtq community for sure.</v>

3102
01:33:34.571 --> 01:33:35.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's why that uh,</v>

3103
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Megan Murphy I think,</v>

3104
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:38.020
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3105
01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:38.853
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3106
01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I go to this restaurant in Bridgeport,</v>

3107
01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut called blood root,</v>

3108
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.750
<v Speaker 1>which is like sort of an old school feminist like vegetarian Vegan spot and in</v>

3109
01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Bridgeport.</v>

3110
01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:49.443
<v Speaker 1>In Bridgeport.</v>

3111
01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Bridgeport,</v>

3112
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3113
01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Kind con.</v>

3114
01:33:51.230 --> 01:33:51.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3115
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:52.300
<v Speaker 1>no offense.</v>

3116
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I know it's kind of a dot.</v>

3117
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:54.183
<v Speaker 1>Wild place.</v>

3118
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:56.730
<v Speaker 1>We would have a gathering of the vibes,</v>

3119
01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:57.603
<v Speaker 1>music festivals.</v>

3120
01:33:57.850 --> 01:33:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I helped organize,</v>

3121
01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I used to do stand up in Bridgeport and I said,</v>

3122
01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:02.410
<v Speaker 1>please call the joker's wild.</v>

3123
01:34:02.710 --> 01:34:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a comedy club.</v>

3124
01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:06.880
<v Speaker 1>So only beat a guy with a shoe there,</v>

3125
01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:09.670
<v Speaker 1>a beat a guy in the face with a shoe,</v>

3126
01:34:09.671 --> 01:34:11.350
<v Speaker 1>pull the shoe off and to intervene.</v>

3127
01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I was 24 I know what the fuck was going on.</v>

3128
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:17.021
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

3129
01:34:17.021 --> 01:34:17.770
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

3130
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:19.180
<v Speaker 1>that restaurant that you know,</v>

3131
01:34:19.181 --> 01:34:20.050
<v Speaker 1>they get called,</v>

3132
01:34:20.051 --> 01:34:20.884
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3133
01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:21.460
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

3134
01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Turf Turfs.</v>

3135
01:34:23.801 --> 01:34:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3136
01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Trans exclusionary radical feminist.</v>

3137
01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

3138
01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3139
01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.990
<v Speaker 1>they're the old school ones and they're saying,</v>

3140
01:34:31.991 --> 01:34:32.321
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3141
01:34:32.321 --> 01:34:32.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3142
01:34:32.771 --> 01:34:34.150
<v Speaker 1>we're not against your,</v>

3143
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:35.013
<v Speaker 1>your battle.</v>

3144
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.700
<v Speaker 1>We're not against trans rights.</v>

3145
01:34:36.701 --> 01:34:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3146
01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:37.130
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

3147
01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:38.260
<v Speaker 1>who would be against trans?</v>

3148
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:40.720
<v Speaker 1>But they're just saying that's not our thing.</v>

3149
01:34:40.721 --> 01:34:41.554
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

3150
01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:46.000
<v Speaker 1>there's diversity and they're trying to clump everyone together and the whole</v>

3151
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:47.590
<v Speaker 1>intersectional world.</v>

3152
01:34:47.591 --> 01:34:48.610
<v Speaker 1>And I look,</v>

3153
01:34:48.611 --> 01:34:50.110
<v Speaker 1>people want to band together.</v>

3154
01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 1>The oppressed groups want to band together.</v>

3155
01:34:52.301 --> 01:34:53.070
<v Speaker 1>They should.</v>

3156
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3157
01:34:53.410 --> 01:34:54.243
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

3158
01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:55.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple.</v>

3159
01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3160
01:34:56.230 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be</v>

3161
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.480
<v Speaker 4>differing opinions.</v>

3162
01:34:59.481 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 4>And especially when you have something like,</v>

3163
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3164
01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Trans Women competing against biological women and you know,</v>

3165
01:35:07.161 --> 01:35:09.950
<v Speaker 4>you have someone like Martina Navratilova that made her,</v>

3166
01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 4>her life's work and her career competing as a biological woman.</v>

3167
01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:15.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3168
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:16.910
<v Speaker 4>she's gonna have some opposition to that.</v>

3169
01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:20.060
<v Speaker 4>And then the idea that everyone's supposed to be lumped in together with some</v>

3170
01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:24.710
<v Speaker 4>mandate that no one has really openly discussed and you're supposed to agree and</v>

3171
01:35:24.711 --> 01:35:26.510
<v Speaker 4>it fluctuates and moves like the tide,</v>

3172
01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:27.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3173
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.750
<v Speaker 4>like what is in his and moves like the Todd,</v>

3174
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:32.390
<v Speaker 4>it just changes.</v>

3175
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:34.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like this court of public opinion.</v>

3176
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:34.701
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3177
01:35:34.701 --> 01:35:37.590
<v Speaker 4>it's constantly rendering new verdicts and you,</v>

3178
01:35:37.591 --> 01:35:39.350
<v Speaker 4>you have to keep up and catch up.</v>

3179
01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Things that were acceptable just a few years ago are totally unacceptable.</v>

3180
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:45.590
<v Speaker 4>It mean comedy is,</v>

3181
01:35:45.591 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 4>is the key area too.</v>

3182
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.751
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3183
01:35:47.751 --> 01:35:49.430
<v Speaker 4>It is not what,</v>

3184
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:50.780
<v Speaker 4>what's happening on social media now.</v>

3185
01:35:50.781 --> 01:35:53.870
<v Speaker 4>Not Sustainable for comedy because it's fine.</v>

3186
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

3187
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:55.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3188
01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.353
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

3189
01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:57.320
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

3190
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:57.860
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>

3191
01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.320
<v Speaker 4>Because it creates outrage and then comedy,</v>

3192
01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.390
<v Speaker 4>it relieves that pressure.</v>

3193
01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:03.260
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3194
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:04.093
<v Speaker 4>believe me,</v>

3195
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:06.440
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of blow back and believe me,</v>

3196
01:36:06.441 --> 01:36:08.000
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of debate and discussion,</v>

3197
01:36:08.001 --> 01:36:08.451
<v Speaker 4>but also,</v>

3198
01:36:08.451 --> 01:36:09.284
<v Speaker 4>believe me,</v>

3199
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:13.400
<v Speaker 4>when someone does do some politically incorrect,</v>

3200
01:36:13.401 --> 01:36:14.151
<v Speaker 4>really good,</v>

3201
01:36:14.151 --> 01:36:16.190
<v Speaker 4>stand up people go fucking bonkers.</v>

3202
01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:17.053
<v Speaker 4>They love it.</v>

3203
01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:18.050
<v Speaker 4>It's going,</v>

3204
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:21.110
<v Speaker 4>it's like one of the best times ever right now to do stand up.</v>

3205
01:36:21.111 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 4>People go fucking April.</v>

3206
01:36:22.890 --> 01:36:23.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3207
01:36:23.211 --> 01:36:23.481
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3208
01:36:23.481 --> 01:36:24.770
<v Speaker 4>it's incredible material.</v>

3209
01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:27.630
<v Speaker 4>But I'm just saying for you know,</v>

3210
01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.110
<v Speaker 4>comics that are running into issues with getting banned or when not,</v>

3211
01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:32.953
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3212
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.231
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3213
01:36:33.231 --> 01:36:34.850
<v Speaker 4>who's running into issues with getting banned?</v>

3214
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:37.303
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3215
01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:37.971
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3216
01:36:37.971 --> 01:36:38.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3217
01:36:38.241 --> 01:36:39.190
<v Speaker 4>one Oh,</v>

3218
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

3219
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:40.010
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3220
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.550
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3221
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:41.690
<v Speaker 4>Owens had some issues.</v>

3222
01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3223
01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.513
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3224
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:44.691
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3225
01:36:44.691 --> 01:36:47.240
<v Speaker 4>you could make some arguments at Owens not doing so well right now.</v>

3226
01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:48.493
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3227
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:52.890
<v Speaker 4>but he's also developing his following because of the factors.</v>

3228
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:54.620
<v Speaker 4>People that don't agree with him being banned.</v>

3229
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:55.281
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

3230
01:36:55.281 --> 01:36:56.900
<v Speaker 4>he's a very specific example.</v>

3231
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:58.070
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3232
01:36:58.070 --> 01:37:00.080
<v Speaker 4>other people that are being banned.</v>

3233
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:02.361
<v Speaker 4>Do you know of,</v>

3234
01:37:02.361 --> 01:37:02.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3235
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:03.590
<v Speaker 4>other who,</v>

3236
01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.410
<v Speaker 4>what other standup comedians and a bunch of comics on,</v>

3237
01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.480
<v Speaker 4>maybe they haven't been fully band from social media,</v>

3238
01:37:08.481 --> 01:37:09.890
<v Speaker 4>but they've had their performances,</v>

3239
01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3240
01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.120
<v Speaker 4>shutdown.</v>

3241
01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:13.400
<v Speaker 4>Who was that one guy who was like,</v>

3242
01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:13.651
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3243
01:37:13.651 --> 01:37:14.484
<v Speaker 4>new mash.</v>

3244
01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:15.020
<v Speaker 4>Tell,</v>

3245
01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:16.370
<v Speaker 4>but that was at a college.</v>

3246
01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:17.360
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

3247
01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:17.991
<v Speaker 4>do the same.</v>

3248
01:37:17.991 --> 01:37:19.790
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

3249
01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:20.510
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3250
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:24.020
<v Speaker 4>But universities have been bad for that for a long time.</v>

3251
01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:24.780
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3252
01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:29.600
<v Speaker 4>they're the most sensitive of all audiences and they're the ones who are the</v>

3253
01:37:29.601 --> 01:37:30.171
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>

3254
01:37:30.171 --> 01:37:30.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3255
01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:31.850
<v Speaker 4>they believe the most,</v>

3256
01:37:31.851 --> 01:37:36.410
<v Speaker 4>that they're going to change the world and that their ideals are there,</v>

3257
01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:39.890
<v Speaker 4>their ideals are rock solid and they have to push back against anything that</v>

3258
01:37:39.891 --> 01:37:40.580
<v Speaker 4>opposes them.</v>

3259
01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:42.320
<v Speaker 4>Ari was temporarily banned.</v>

3260
01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:43.640
<v Speaker 4>That was an accident.</v>

3261
01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:44.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3262
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:47.900
<v Speaker 4>The Ra thing was he was joking around and they thought he was making legitimate</v>

3263
01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:48.730
<v Speaker 4>death threat.</v>

3264
01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Could it,</v>

3265
01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:49.371
<v Speaker 4>that could happen,</v>

3266
01:37:49.371 --> 01:37:50.720
<v Speaker 4>but joking around with a good friend of ours,</v>

3267
01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:51.400
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3268
01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.440
<v Speaker 4>the algorithms are our key in the moderators are just not right.</v>

3269
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:56.303
<v Speaker 4>We can't</v>

3270
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 3>just be having this happen all the time and then they just keep saying,</v>

3271
01:37:59.701 --> 01:37:59.851
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3272
01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:00.570
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

3273
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:01.403
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

3274
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.620
<v Speaker 3>There has to be a new approach completely.</v>

3275
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:06.000
<v Speaker 3>It can't just be,</v>

3276
01:38:06.001 --> 01:38:06.211
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3277
01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:08.260
<v Speaker 3>let them back on and,</v>

3278
01:38:08.610 --> 01:38:10.530
<v Speaker 3>and just keep doing what they're doing.</v>

3279
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:15.830
<v Speaker 3>Like we need to completely reapproach how moderation is happening.</v>

3280
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:18.930
<v Speaker 3>The whole policies situation,</v>

3281
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:20.280
<v Speaker 3>the transparency situation.</v>

3282
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:21.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a matter of</v>

3283
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:24.780
<v Speaker 3>going to the overlords and saying,</v>

3284
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3285
01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:25.500
<v Speaker 3>can I,</v>

3286
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.730
<v Speaker 3>can I please come back?</v>

3287
01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3288
01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:27.510
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3289
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:28.343
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

3290
01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:33.780
<v Speaker 3>that's not suitable for the communication structure of the planet earth.</v>

3291
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.731
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3292
01:38:34.731 --> 01:38:39.731
<v Speaker 4>I think what's not suitable is that commerce should not dictate how human beings</v>

3293
01:38:39.771 --> 01:38:41.510
<v Speaker 4>are allowed to openly communicate with each other.</v>

3294
01:38:41.511 --> 01:38:45.140
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that Jack said that's kind of contrary to his company's</v>

3295
01:38:45.141 --> 01:38:48.770
<v Speaker 4>actions was that he believes that the ability to communicate as a fundamental</v>

3296
01:38:48.771 --> 01:38:49.310
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3297
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:50.900
<v Speaker 4>like the ability to get electricity.</v>

3298
01:38:50.901 --> 01:38:52.130
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're in the KKK,</v>

3299
01:38:52.131 --> 01:38:53.600
<v Speaker 4>you could still order electricity,</v>

3300
01:38:54.190 --> 01:38:54.441
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3301
01:38:54.441 --> 01:38:57.980
<v Speaker 4>So should you be able to just distribute information if people say no,</v>

3302
01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:58.911
<v Speaker 4>then you have to say,</v>

3303
01:38:58.911 --> 01:38:59.241
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3304
01:38:59.241 --> 01:39:03.350
<v Speaker 4>well who's to decide what can and cannot be distributed?</v>

3305
01:39:03.650 --> 01:39:06.680
<v Speaker 4>And then who's to decide if they can go somewhere else.</v>

3306
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:09.560
<v Speaker 4>And then what happens if you tell a person they can't go anywhere,</v>

3307
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:10.910
<v Speaker 4>then things get really weird.</v>

3308
01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.620
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at more of a</v>

3309
01:39:13.150 --> 01:39:18.150
<v Speaker 3>community moderation structure so that we've even been considering like a juror</v>

3310
01:39:19.301 --> 01:39:24.130
<v Speaker 3>system so that if we make a bad decision in someone appeals it,</v>

3311
01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.160
<v Speaker 3>then the community can potentially make the decisions as opposed to us or you</v>

3312
01:39:29.501 --> 01:39:29.770
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

3313
01:39:29.770 --> 01:39:33.460
<v Speaker 3>But then when you go further enough for far enough into the decentralization</v>

3314
01:39:33.461 --> 01:39:34.030
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

3315
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:35.230
<v Speaker 3>it just becomes impossible.</v>

3316
01:39:35.231 --> 01:39:36.880
<v Speaker 3>So we sort of have to decide.</v>

3317
01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:39.130
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where it's going to go.</v>

3318
01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.713
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3319
01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:43.113
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3320
01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.193
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3321
01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:45.813
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3322
01:39:46.330 --> 01:39:51.330
<v Speaker 3>that's the uncensorable Internet and this idea that we can do things and then</v>

3323
01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:52.901
<v Speaker 3>just delete them.</v>

3324
01:39:52.901 --> 01:39:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Like in the Gdpr,</v>

3325
01:39:54.491 --> 01:39:57.970
<v Speaker 3>the European privacy laws have this whole idea of the right to be forgotten</v>

3326
01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.073
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>

3327
01:39:59.770 --> 01:40:03.430
<v Speaker 3>which is very difficult because deleting things from any database,</v>

3328
01:40:03.431 --> 01:40:06.760
<v Speaker 3>specially a blockchain is not easy.</v>

3329
01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:08.800
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that you can go on the internet,</v>

3330
01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:10.480
<v Speaker 3>do crazy shit,</v>

3331
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.060
<v Speaker 3>and then just have it taken away.</v>

3332
01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:19.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a paradox because privacy means control,</v>

3333
01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:21.640
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3334
01:40:21.810 --> 01:40:22.040
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3335
01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:27.040
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't jive with the way that technology works to just be able to delete</v>

3336
01:40:27.311 --> 01:40:31.510
<v Speaker 3>things like you're writing to a database that's not even how the universe</v>

3337
01:40:31.511 --> 01:40:32.440
<v Speaker 3>probably really works.</v>

3338
01:40:32.441 --> 01:40:33.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just say,</v>

3339
01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:33.971
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3340
01:40:33.971 --> 01:40:36.760
<v Speaker 3>I just went and punched that guy in the face and the bar and I just want to</v>

3341
01:40:36.761 --> 01:40:38.470
<v Speaker 3>delete that from having happened.</v>

3342
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3343
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:39.623
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3344
01:40:41.370 --> 01:40:42.203
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3345
01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3346
01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:44.123
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3347
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:45.383
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

3348
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:49.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that what we're dealing with now is like,</v>

3349
01:40:49.621 --> 01:40:51.450
<v Speaker 4>you have to interface with it,</v>

3350
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:52.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3351
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.890
<v Speaker 4>You have to interface with your computer.</v>

3352
01:40:53.891 --> 01:40:56.920
<v Speaker 4>You have to interface with your phone to access all this stuff.</v>

3353
01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:02.490
<v Speaker 4>My real concern is that that's just a temporary step and that we're going to</v>

3354
01:41:02.711 --> 01:41:07.030
<v Speaker 4>just consistently and constantly be interfaced with all of each other.</v>

3355
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:07.601
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3356
01:41:07.601 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 4>Ilan brought something up when he was on the podcast,</v>

3357
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:11.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3358
01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.290
<v Speaker 4>called neuro link and he didn't want to fully describe it cause he said he</v>

3359
01:41:14.291 --> 01:41:14.591
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>

3360
01:41:14.591 --> 01:41:16.300
<v Speaker 4>but he said it's going to be live within,</v>

3361
01:41:16.301 --> 01:41:16.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3362
01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:18.160
<v Speaker 4>a matter of x amount of months.</v>

3363
01:41:18.730 --> 01:41:22.600
<v Speaker 4>And he was talking about it increasing the bandwidth between human beings and</v>

3364
01:41:22.601 --> 01:41:25.780
<v Speaker 4>information in a radical way that's going to change society.</v>

3365
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:28.410
<v Speaker 1>That is what I'm talking about.</v>

3366
01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:32.070
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about an injection you basically do in like your throat and it's a</v>

3367
01:41:32.071 --> 01:41:34.110
<v Speaker 1>neural lace and it just,</v>

3368
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:34.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3369
01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.300
<v Speaker 1>threads around your brain,</v>

3370
01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:37.530
<v Speaker 1>watts and yeah.</v>

3371
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:38.161
<v Speaker 1>You serious?</v>

3372
01:41:38.161 --> 01:41:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3373
01:41:38.341 --> 01:41:38.730
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3374
01:41:38.730 --> 01:41:39.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3375
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:40.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what he's talking about.</v>

3376
01:41:40.111 --> 01:41:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3377
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:41.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3378
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:44.370
<v Speaker 1>So damn alien trying to turn us into robots.</v>

3379
01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.570
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

3380
01:41:45.571 --> 01:41:47.160
<v Speaker 1>what's the nature of those robots?</v>

3381
01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Robots are going to exist and they exist,</v>

3382
01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:50.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3383
01:41:50.250 --> 01:41:54.240
<v Speaker 1>But should you shoot them into your brain if you're dying of cancer?</v>

3384
01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.613
<v Speaker 1>Would you,</v>

3385
01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:56.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3386
01:41:56.370 --> 01:41:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to see God and see what's up.</v>

3387
01:41:58.980 --> 01:41:59.850
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

3388
01:41:59.950 --> 01:42:01.140
<v Speaker 1>do the nanobots,</v>

3389
01:42:01.141 --> 01:42:01.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3390
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:02.730
<v Speaker 1>the Kurzweil talks about like,</v>

3391
01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:07.290
<v Speaker 1>do we have control as a community over those robots?</v>

3392
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.710
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

3393
01:42:07.710 --> 01:42:11.070
<v Speaker 1>what's the code running those saying are they infallible?</v>

3394
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3395
01:42:11.731 --> 01:42:12.291
<v Speaker 1>what if they crack?</v>

3396
01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:12.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3397
01:42:12.481 --> 01:42:15.130
<v Speaker 1>our fucking tricaster crashes every other podcast.</v>

3398
01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3399
01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's open source or free or not,</v>

3400
01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:20.070
<v Speaker 1>makes no difference to whether it can fuck up your brain.</v>

3401
01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:20.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3402
01:42:20.281 --> 01:42:23.160
<v Speaker 1>What if somebody puts that shit in and then for whatever reason,</v>

3403
01:42:23.161 --> 01:42:26.790
<v Speaker 1>they have a blown fuse and they stomp on the gas and drive right into a tree.</v>

3404
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.100
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the level of risk you're willing to take.</v>

3405
01:42:29.101 --> 01:42:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3406
01:42:29.370 --> 01:42:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you see some of those videos I like,</v>

3407
01:42:30.481 --> 01:42:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I've cried at those videos where like,</v>

3408
01:42:31.891 --> 01:42:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3409
01:42:32.490 --> 01:42:34.250
<v Speaker 1>the woman like here for the first time,</v>

3410
01:42:34.290 --> 01:42:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3411
01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:34.840
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3412
01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:35.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3413
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3414
01:42:35.631 --> 01:42:35.941
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3415
01:42:35.941 --> 01:42:38.280
<v Speaker 1>That's something people seeing color for the first time</v>

3416
01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:40.350
<v Speaker 4>and putting on certain glasses that allow them to see car.</v>

3417
01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:41.131
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3418
01:42:41.131 --> 01:42:42.300
<v Speaker 4>All this stuff's amazing.</v>

3419
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:42.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3420
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:44.610
<v Speaker 4>that did all that stuff is very cool.</v>

3421
01:42:44.611 --> 01:42:45.240
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3422
01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:45.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3423
01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:48.390
<v Speaker 4>in talking to David Sinclair and he was talking about,</v>

3424
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3425
01:42:48.690 --> 01:42:53.690
<v Speaker 4>emerging technologies in with reversing aging and age related diseases.</v>

3426
01:42:54.330 --> 01:42:55.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're,</v>

3427
01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:59.770
<v Speaker 4>we're anting are entering into an incredibly strange time for the,</v>

3428
01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.780
<v Speaker 4>the influence of technology and innovation on,</v>

3429
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:03.840
<v Speaker 4>on human beings,</v>

3430
01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:05.670
<v Speaker 4>on our bodies and our brains.</v>

3431
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:07.380
<v Speaker 4>And we're going to have to decide,</v>

3432
01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:07.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3433
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.823
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

3434
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.370
<v Speaker 4>how far you want to go on this ride next top far rock.</v>

3435
01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Like when are you getting now?</v>

3436
01:43:12.671 --> 01:43:13.504
<v Speaker 1>I lived there,</v>

3437
01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.601
<v Speaker 1>I lived on the beach.</v>

3438
01:43:15.601 --> 01:43:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going,</v>

3439
01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:18.280
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

3440
01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3441
01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:19.300
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

3442
01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:20.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those things like what,</v>

3443
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:21.510
<v Speaker 1>where do you get off?</v>

3444
01:43:21.511 --> 01:43:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

3445
01:43:22.050 --> 01:43:22.351
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3446
01:43:22.351 --> 01:43:23.071
<v Speaker 1>where do you go that?</v>

3447
01:43:23.071 --> 01:43:23.251
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3448
01:43:23.251 --> 01:43:24.084
<v Speaker 1>that's enough.</v>

3449
01:43:24.630 --> 01:43:25.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3450
01:43:25.021 --> 01:43:25.621
<v Speaker 1>like with you,</v>

3451
01:43:25.621 --> 01:43:26.760
<v Speaker 1>you're deleting Facebook,</v>

3452
01:43:26.761 --> 01:43:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you lead to delete Instagram and you go just going to be on mines and that's</v>

3453
01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:31.350
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

3454
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And going other places,</v>

3455
01:43:32.311 --> 01:43:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean these,</v>

3456
01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:37.440
<v Speaker 1>there are alternatives that are getting very big yes.</v>

3457
01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.770
<v Speaker 1>And together like what?</v>

3458
01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Like signal has tens of millions of users.</v>

3459
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:43.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

3460
01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of it.</v>

3461
01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.800
<v Speaker 1>That's like the encrypted messaging app that,</v>

3462
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:47.663
<v Speaker 1>do you know it,</v>

3463
01:43:49.110 --> 01:43:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it's open source.</v>

3464
01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:50.521
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

3465
01:43:50.521 --> 01:43:51.354
<v Speaker 1>Snow</v>

3466
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.810
<v Speaker 4>is on their advisory board or whatnot.</v>

3467
01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:54.650
<v Speaker 4>What is signal?</v>

3468
01:43:54.650 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 4>It's just a messaging APP.</v>

3469
01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:58.880
<v Speaker 4>So a message but like a whatsapp or like a Twitter,</v>

3470
01:43:59.240 --> 01:43:59.690
<v Speaker 4>whatsapp.</v>

3471
01:43:59.690 --> 01:44:02.570
<v Speaker 4>So you have to know the person and then contact them through it.</v>

3472
01:44:02.650 --> 01:44:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3473
01:44:03.130 --> 01:44:03.851
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking,</v>

3474
01:44:03.851 --> 01:44:04.071
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3475
01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:04.980
<v Speaker 3>we're considering a,</v>

3476
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:08.740
<v Speaker 3>using the signal protocol for our messaging system cause our messaging system</v>

3477
01:44:08.741 --> 01:44:09.431
<v Speaker 3>needs an upgrade.</v>

3478
01:44:09.431 --> 01:44:12.320
<v Speaker 3>But all of us together are going to be,</v>

3479
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.830
<v Speaker 3>be able to create sort of like a,</v>

3480
01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:20.160
<v Speaker 3>a group of apps that are like sort of a more open freedom supporting privacy</v>

3481
01:44:22.961 --> 01:44:24.190
<v Speaker 3>alternative and like,</v>

3482
01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:24.820
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

3483
01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:26.890
<v Speaker 3>we're not gonna solve it by ourselves and</v>

3484
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:32.980
<v Speaker 3>it would be way easier if one of these big companies would just switch gears and</v>

3485
01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.210
<v Speaker 3>start doing things the right way.</v>

3486
01:44:34.211 --> 01:44:37.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've spent eight years building this.</v>

3487
01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.360
<v Speaker 3>If one of the big companies,</v>

3488
01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Google,</v>

3489
01:44:41.230 --> 01:44:43.750
<v Speaker 3>Facebook had just been free and open source,</v>

3490
01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:48.130
<v Speaker 3>we would have spent the last seven years building on top of them.</v>

3491
01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:49.001
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3492
01:44:49.001 --> 01:44:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

3493
01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:52.300
<v Speaker 3>they already did something cool that they're sharing with everybody.</v>

3494
01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:53.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

3495
01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:58.650
<v Speaker 3>it's actually closed source project stifle innovation because if you think we</v>

3496
01:44:58.691 --> 01:44:59.530
<v Speaker 3>had to reinvent the wheel,</v>

3497
01:44:59.531 --> 01:45:00.040
<v Speaker 3>we literally,</v>

3498
01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:03.100
<v Speaker 3>we went and built an alternative with much of the similar functionality.</v>

3499
01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:08.320
<v Speaker 3>Think about how how much further the world would be if everyone was building on</v>

3500
01:45:08.321 --> 01:45:10.000
<v Speaker 3>top of more common.</v>

3501
01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:14.890
<v Speaker 4>But you are looking at it in terms of your own personal benefit.</v>

3502
01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:17.830
<v Speaker 4>You're looking in terms of mine's personal benefit.</v>

3503
01:45:17.831 --> 01:45:19.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean you created this thing,</v>

3504
01:45:19.001 --> 01:45:21.460
<v Speaker 4>it's not just pure for altruistic reasons.</v>

3505
01:45:21.461 --> 01:45:22.294
<v Speaker 4>It's a business,</v>

3506
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3507
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:27.750
<v Speaker 4>So if they had established this open source network that was Facebook and he</v>

3508
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.790
<v Speaker 4>just came along and built yours,</v>

3509
01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:31.091
<v Speaker 4>well that,</v>

3510
01:45:31.091 --> 01:45:31.271
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3511
01:45:31.271 --> 01:45:32.260
<v Speaker 4>that would be great for you.</v>

3512
01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:33.760
<v Speaker 4>But why would that be great for them?</v>

3513
01:45:33.761 --> 01:45:34.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>

3514
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:37.840
<v Speaker 4>they're obviously in a business now the problem with the businesses,</v>

3515
01:45:37.841 --> 01:45:41.530
<v Speaker 4>this business is the business of distributing information and then we have to</v>

3516
01:45:41.531 --> 01:45:42.130
<v Speaker 4>decide,</v>

3517
01:45:42.130 --> 01:45:42.431
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3518
01:45:42.431 --> 01:45:47.431
<v Speaker 4>at what point in time do we allow these air quotes overlords to dictate what can</v>

3519
01:45:48.251 --> 01:45:49.480
<v Speaker 4>and cannot be distributed?</v>

3520
01:45:49.481 --> 01:45:50.770
<v Speaker 4>And how did this happen?</v>

3521
01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:52.000
<v Speaker 4>Because in the beginning,</v>

3522
01:45:52.001 --> 01:45:53.110
<v Speaker 4>I bet it didn't happen.</v>

3523
01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:56.920
<v Speaker 4>I bet in the beginning you can just put it on whatever the fuck you wanted and</v>

3524
01:45:56.921 --> 01:45:59.170
<v Speaker 4>then they had to deal with that and then they had to figure out after a while,</v>

3525
01:45:59.171 --> 01:45:59.560
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3526
01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.060
<v Speaker 4>maybe we shouldn't have this on like,</v>

3527
01:46:01.061 --> 01:46:01.450
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3528
01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:03.550
<v Speaker 4>if if we're going to sell advertising,</v>

3529
01:46:03.551 --> 01:46:05.410
<v Speaker 4>we really should maximize the amount of clicks.</v>

3530
01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:05.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3531
01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:06.880
<v Speaker 4>how do we do that?</v>

3532
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:08.380
<v Speaker 4>While we put things in people's feeds,</v>

3533
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:09.223
<v Speaker 4>they want to see,</v>

3534
01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:12.910
<v Speaker 4>we put things that people want to debate about and argue about and political</v>

3535
01:46:12.911 --> 01:46:15.670
<v Speaker 4>things and all sorts of different things that excite them and get them to be</v>

3536
01:46:15.671 --> 01:46:17.860
<v Speaker 4>engaged with the platform that's,</v>

3537
01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:19.000
<v Speaker 4>that's their business.</v>

3538
01:46:19.001 --> 01:46:19.840
<v Speaker 4>The businesses,</v>

3539
01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:25.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's no different in a lot of ways than Amazon or then any other business</v>

3540
01:46:25.661 --> 01:46:26.530
<v Speaker 4>that wants to grow.</v>

3541
01:46:26.650 --> 01:46:27.340
<v Speaker 4>Like how does,</v>

3542
01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:28.750
<v Speaker 4>how do they grow while they grow?</v>

3543
01:46:28.751 --> 01:46:33.751
<v Speaker 4>By maximizing their profits and by maximizing the amount of eyes that get to</v>

3544
01:46:34.541 --> 01:46:37.960
<v Speaker 4>their advertising so they get more clicks and more people get engaged.</v>

3545
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:39.480
<v Speaker 4>That's what their businesses,</v>

3546
01:46:39.490 --> 01:46:42.790
<v Speaker 4>you're deciding by saying if they were open source,</v>

3547
01:46:42.791 --> 01:46:44.620
<v Speaker 4>look how much further along in the world would be.</v>

3548
01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:45.910
<v Speaker 4>They would be further along to,</v>

3549
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they would agree with that.</v>

3550
01:46:47.410 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're there worth fucking cajillions of dollars.</v>

3551
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:51.180
<v Speaker 3>So they figured it out.</v>

3552
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Well it just depends on whether or not you think that people have a right to</v>

3553
01:46:55.981 --> 01:46:58.170
<v Speaker 3>know what is going on.</v>

3554
01:46:58.200 --> 01:46:58.501
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3555
01:46:58.501 --> 01:47:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like food transparency.</v>

3556
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:00.541
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>

3557
01:47:00.541 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 3>we were.</v>

3558
01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:01.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3559
01:47:01.161 --> 01:47:01.290
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3560
01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:02.220
<v Speaker 3>so I'll talk about that.</v>

3561
01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:02.810
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

3562
01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I will talk about that till the end of the time you were interfacing with this</v>

3563
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:09.630
<v Speaker 3>and it's affecting us.</v>

3564
01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:10.380
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3565
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3566
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 3>I fully agree with what you're saying.</v>

3567
01:47:12.241 --> 01:47:15.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm playing devil's advocate by saying that in their position they have a</v>

3568
01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:20.220
<v Speaker 3>business and their business is to make money and they're going to lose because</v>

3569
01:47:20.221 --> 01:47:25.221
<v Speaker 3>of what they're doing because it's not even half post losing active users,</v>

3570
01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:26.220
<v Speaker 3>are they?</v>

3571
01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3572
01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:29.110
<v Speaker 3>but I thought their business went up after the hearing.</v>

3573
01:47:29.111 --> 01:47:30.000
<v Speaker 3>We did it,</v>

3574
01:47:30.001 --> 01:47:31.020
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to last.</v>

3575
01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:31.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3576
01:47:31.290 --> 01:47:31.540
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3577
01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:32.373
<v Speaker 3>you say that</v>

3578
01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:35.370
<v Speaker 3>it's just the game's over.</v>

3579
01:47:35.371 --> 01:47:39.120
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take a long time for us to build it up as you know,</v>

3580
01:47:39.121 --> 01:47:41.760
<v Speaker 3>all of these different organizations and companies working together.</v>

3581
01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:42.593
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

3582
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Linux for instance,</v>

3583
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:48.600
<v Speaker 3>is the operating system that most banks,</v>

3584
01:47:48.650 --> 01:47:50.260
<v Speaker 3>it is the most popular operating system.</v>

3585
01:47:50.261 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 3>The world.</v>

3586
01:47:50.610 --> 01:47:50.830
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3587
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:51.390
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3588
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.630
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3589
01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:51.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3590
01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:52.240
<v Speaker 3>it's open.</v>

3591
01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 3>So it's in your phone.</v>

3592
01:47:53.791 --> 01:47:55.230
<v Speaker 3>It's in everywhere.</v>

3593
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.720
<v Speaker 3>It got there because of that,</v>

3594
01:47:57.721 --> 01:48:00.690
<v Speaker 3>because everyone used it and incorporate it into their product.</v>

3595
01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:01.710
<v Speaker 3>Facebook,</v>

3596
01:48:01.710 --> 01:48:06.540
<v Speaker 3>they are all using free and open source software in their stacks.</v>

3597
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:09.030
<v Speaker 3>They're just not sharing their product with everybody else.</v>

3598
01:48:09.031 --> 01:48:11.190
<v Speaker 3>So they're benefiting from it but not giving back.</v>

3599
01:48:11.970 --> 01:48:13.220
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3600
01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:17.580
<v Speaker 3>I almost feel like I shouldn't even be saying that they should just pivot</v>

3601
01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:18.870
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

3602
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:22.290
<v Speaker 3>that's their only chance to survive.</v>

3603
01:48:23.250 --> 01:48:26.160
<v Speaker 3>So this is based on your estimations of the future?</v>

3604
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3605
01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:32.520
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like things are becoming more open and if there's that possible</v>

3606
01:48:32.521 --> 01:48:36.720
<v Speaker 3>because you engage with a lot of other super nerds and you guys all have the</v>

3607
01:48:36.721 --> 01:48:37.740
<v Speaker 3>similar ideas.</v>

3608
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 3>You just have to look at what's happening with bitcoin.</v>

3609
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:42.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's happening with bitcoin.</v>

3610
01:48:42.210 --> 01:48:45.420
<v Speaker 3>It's become a bitcoin and ethereum and you know,</v>

3611
01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:47.410
<v Speaker 3>lots of other blockchains are,</v>

3612
01:48:47.411 --> 01:48:47.590
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

3613
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:49.290
<v Speaker 3>are growing really fast.</v>

3614
01:48:49.291 --> 01:48:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the,</v>

3615
01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3616
01:48:50.101 --> 01:48:51.180
<v Speaker 3>the price is separate,</v>

3617
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.430
<v Speaker 3>the development energy,</v>

3618
01:48:53.431 --> 01:48:57.240
<v Speaker 3>the number of people who are building apps on top of bitcoin and ethereum is</v>

3619
01:48:57.241 --> 01:48:58.560
<v Speaker 3>growing massively.</v>

3620
01:48:58.590 --> 01:48:58.860
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3621
01:48:58.860 --> 01:48:59.250
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3622
01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:04.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole new infrastructure that's like a common protocol that people can</v>

3623
01:49:04.951 --> 01:49:05.784
<v Speaker 3>build on.</v>

3624
01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:07.860
<v Speaker 3>So that is growing rapidly.</v>

3625
01:49:07.861 --> 01:49:09.420
<v Speaker 3>The price is secondary.</v>

3626
01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:12.240
<v Speaker 3>That's not even what bitcoin and ethereum are really about.</v>

3627
01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.033
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3628
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:14.340
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3629
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.470
<v Speaker 3>it's a decentralized database.</v>

3630
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:19.890
<v Speaker 3>So this is just where the Internet,</v>

3631
01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:21.690
<v Speaker 3>the Internet is meant to be decentralized.</v>

3632
01:49:21.691 --> 01:49:23.070
<v Speaker 3>It sort of started out that way.</v>

3633
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:28.190
<v Speaker 3>And then we moved into this like web to silo system with like just these massive</v>

3634
01:49:29.071 --> 01:49:30.750
<v Speaker 3>companies that are controlling everything.</v>

3635
01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:31.860
<v Speaker 3>But it's gonna,</v>

3636
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:33.180
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna keep waving.</v>

3637
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3638
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:34.471
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3639
01:49:34.471 --> 01:49:35.580
<v Speaker 3>to play devil's advocate,</v>

3640
01:49:35.850 --> 01:49:38.730
<v Speaker 3>the vast amount of users are not using those platforms.</v>

3641
01:49:38.731 --> 01:49:42.720
<v Speaker 3>A vast amount of users are using these controlled platforms like Facebook and</v>

3642
01:49:42.721 --> 01:49:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Instagram and Twitter.</v>

3643
01:49:44.130 --> 01:49:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Like if that's,</v>

3644
01:49:45.241 --> 01:49:45.571
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

3645
01:49:45.571 --> 01:49:46.740
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about,</v>

3646
01:49:46.741 --> 01:49:47.381
<v Speaker 3>I'm just guessing,</v>

3647
01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:48.430
<v Speaker 3>but if you talking about the,</v>

3648
01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:49.360
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3649
01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:53.320
<v Speaker 3>the gross number of human beings that are interacting with each other on social</v>

3650
01:49:53.321 --> 01:49:53.890
<v Speaker 3>media,</v>

3651
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:56.560
<v Speaker 3>they're mostly uncontrolled networks.</v>

3652
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:58.960
<v Speaker 3>You're saying this is not gonna last,</v>

3653
01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:01.980
<v Speaker 3>but there's no evidence that it isn't going to last.</v>

3654
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:03.160
<v Speaker 3>There's tons of evidence.</v>

3655
01:50:03.190 --> 01:50:04.000
<v Speaker 3>What does the evidence,</v>

3656
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Wikipedia,</v>

3657
01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.120
<v Speaker 3>what is happening in card?</v>

3658
01:50:07.121 --> 01:50:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I remember that desk you put in your computer,</v>

3659
01:50:09.131 --> 01:50:10.390
<v Speaker 3>that was your encyclopedia.</v>

3660
01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:12.573
<v Speaker 3>Where is that?</v>

3661
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:13.870
<v Speaker 3>No one uses it.</v>

3662
01:50:14.190 --> 01:50:14.770
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

3663
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:15.190
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3664
01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:16.023
<v Speaker 3>that's different.</v>

3665
01:50:16.150 --> 01:50:17.740
<v Speaker 3>This is not a social media network.</v>

3666
01:50:17.770 --> 01:50:21.610
<v Speaker 3>The social media networks that people are using are almost all controlled,</v>

3667
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:22.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3668
01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3669
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.620
<v Speaker 3>No it's not.</v>

3670
01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:25.120
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take a very,</v>

3671
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:26.500
<v Speaker 3>very long how long?</v>

3672
01:50:28.570 --> 01:50:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I would say 10 years.</v>

3673
01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:33.580
<v Speaker 3>And what do you think is going to be the catalyst?</v>

3674
01:50:33.581 --> 01:50:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Like what's going to cause these people to make this radical shift to open</v>

3675
01:50:36.931 --> 01:50:37.764
<v Speaker 3>source?</v>

3676
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:39.250
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to be,</v>

3677
01:50:39.251 --> 01:50:42.040
<v Speaker 3>we have responsibility to be competitive functionally.</v>

3678
01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Like you know one's does.</v>

3679
01:50:43.501 --> 01:50:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3680
01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:44.473
<v Speaker 3>We just saying we do,</v>

3681
01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:45.281
<v Speaker 3>we're getting,</v>

3682
01:50:45.281 --> 01:50:46.240
<v Speaker 3>we're moving there fast.</v>

3683
01:50:46.241 --> 01:50:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Like we just hired a ton of new developers and it's going to take time.</v>

3684
01:50:50.831 --> 01:50:51.700
<v Speaker 3>We're not there yet.</v>

3685
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:52.180
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3686
01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:57.180
<v Speaker 3>But once we have functionally competitive products that you wouldn't even know</v>

3687
01:50:58.391 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 3>the difference and there's enough people there,</v>

3688
01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:01.960
<v Speaker 3>then it's basically the decision of,</v>

3689
01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:03.213
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3690
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:03.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3691
01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:07.480
<v Speaker 3>am I going to choose the one that respects my privacy and freedom or are the one</v>

3692
01:51:07.481 --> 01:51:07.991
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't?</v>

3693
01:51:07.991 --> 01:51:08.500
<v Speaker 3>And people,</v>

3694
01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:11.560
<v Speaker 3>our kids don't like Facebook,</v>

3695
01:51:11.650 --> 01:51:12.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3696
01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:12.670
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3697
01:51:12.670 --> 01:51:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is sick of it.</v>

3698
01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:15.250
<v Speaker 3>We're just drug addicts.</v>

3699
01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:17.163
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3700
01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:18.513
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3701
01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:22.340
<v Speaker 3>is that what it is that just sucked into this thing where you,</v>

3702
01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:25.630
<v Speaker 3>you constantly want to check and see who's writing what and,</v>

3703
01:51:25.810 --> 01:51:25.991
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3704
01:51:25.991 --> 01:51:27.160
<v Speaker 3>and there's monopolies,</v>

3705
01:51:27.161 --> 01:51:27.880
<v Speaker 3>arguably.</v>

3706
01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:28.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3707
01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:29.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3708
01:51:29.710 --> 01:51:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3709
01:51:30.130 --> 01:51:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Especially when Facebook owns Instagram.</v>

3710
01:51:31.691 --> 01:51:32.524
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3711
01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:34.570
<v Speaker 3>What if they bought Twitter as well?</v>

3712
01:51:35.170 --> 01:51:35.831
<v Speaker 3>They almost did.</v>

3713
01:51:35.831 --> 01:51:38.890
<v Speaker 3>I think Google almost an attorney who steps in and buys everything.</v>

3714
01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Then you look,</v>

3715
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.500
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

3716
01:51:41.650 --> 01:51:42.281
<v Speaker 3>they probably could.</v>

3717
01:51:42.281 --> 01:51:43.114
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3718
01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3719
01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:45.123
<v Speaker 3>they easily could.</v>

3720
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:48.130
<v Speaker 3>They could probably buy everything apple code with cash.</v>

3721
01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3722
01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3723
01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Tim Cook had come in with a big purple pimp suit on,</v>

3724
01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:54.250
<v Speaker 3>just slap down a briefcase pitch.</v>

3725
01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:55.840
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder and like,</v>

3726
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:56.170
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3727
01:51:56.170 --> 01:51:56.561
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

3728
01:51:56.561 --> 01:51:57.910
<v Speaker 3>all these executives,</v>

3729
01:51:58.860 --> 01:51:59.693
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3730
01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Jack seems like a cool person.</v>

3731
01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:02.350
<v Speaker 3>He's a very nice guy.</v>

3732
01:52:02.410 --> 01:52:03.243
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3733
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I just sent so much inconsistency and you know,</v>

3734
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:09.930
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about Bitcoin,</v>

3735
01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:14.860
<v Speaker 3>like it's this important new internet money simultaneous,</v>

3736
01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:15.371
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

3737
01:52:15.371 --> 01:52:18.490
<v Speaker 3>he knows the infrastructure is open,</v>

3738
01:52:19.330 --> 01:52:22.510
<v Speaker 3>but then his platforms are the opposite.</v>

3739
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Why is he so inconsistent?</v>

3740
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:25.511
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's,</v>

3741
01:52:25.511 --> 01:52:28.960
<v Speaker 3>it's just hypocritical to the maximum.</v>

3742
01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:32.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it's partly because it's a giant business,</v>

3743
01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:32.951
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3744
01:52:32.951 --> 01:52:37.060
<v Speaker 3>And I think when you have an obligation to your shareholders and to maximize</v>

3745
01:52:37.061 --> 01:52:39.700
<v Speaker 3>profits and when you're trying to maximize profits too,</v>

3746
01:52:39.701 --> 01:52:40.481
<v Speaker 3>and there's the,</v>

3747
01:52:40.481 --> 01:52:43.600
<v Speaker 3>this universal growth model where every year just has to get a little bit</v>

3748
01:52:43.601 --> 01:52:43.931
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>

3749
01:52:43.931 --> 01:52:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you're fucking up as a CEO.</v>

3750
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.680
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't have to experience that with mines.</v>

3751
01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:50.240
<v Speaker 4>We're one of the cofounders.</v>

3752
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 4>How many people are involved?</v>

3753
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:54.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like 15 of us now.</v>

3754
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:59.050
<v Speaker 4>And do you have like a board we sit around when you make critical decisions such</v>

3755
01:52:59.130 --> 01:52:59.963
<v Speaker 4>stressful as fuck.</v>

3756
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3757
01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:03.610
<v Speaker 3>Luckily we've started off from the point where we're saying,</v>

3758
01:53:03.611 --> 01:53:03.881
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3759
01:53:03.881 --> 01:53:07.180
<v Speaker 3>we're embedding principles into how we're doing things.</v>

3760
01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:12.700
<v Speaker 3>So we're not in a position where we would ever change that,</v>

3761
01:53:12.701 --> 01:53:15.520
<v Speaker 3>that that's for us to do.</v>

3762
01:53:15.521 --> 01:53:18.700
<v Speaker 3>That would just be a total waste of time.</v>

3763
01:53:18.730 --> 01:53:19.563
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3764
01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:24.160
<v Speaker 3>So we're making it harder for ourselves to make money in the beginning.</v>

3765
01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:29.730
<v Speaker 3>We're making it harder for ourselves to grow because we are not gonna compromise</v>

3766
01:53:29.771 --> 01:53:31.930
<v Speaker 3>people's privacy in order to do those things.</v>

3767
01:53:32.170 --> 01:53:34.870
<v Speaker 3>And so we're just going to build up slowly,</v>

3768
01:53:34.871 --> 01:53:36.630
<v Speaker 3>steadily finding it.</v>

3769
01:53:36.631 --> 01:53:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Just get there when we get there.</v>

3770
01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:39.730
<v Speaker 3>How much time a day is this?</v>

3771
01:53:40.630 --> 01:53:42.340
<v Speaker 3>How much of an obligation is this for you?</v>

3772
01:53:45.010 --> 01:53:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Same as any job.</v>

3773
01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:47.021
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3774
01:53:47.021 --> 01:53:47.251
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3775
01:53:47.251 --> 01:53:48.940
<v Speaker 3>it sucks because you know,</v>

3776
01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:51.340
<v Speaker 3>my wife Allie would say like,</v>

3777
01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:56.760
<v Speaker 3>it's too blurred my life because it's like what is pleasure?</v>

3778
01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:58.030
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>

3779
01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's probably happens with you too.</v>

3780
01:53:59.590 --> 01:54:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're on your phone,</v>

3781
01:54:02.110 --> 01:54:07.110
<v Speaker 3>like your family doesn't know if you're working or if you're doing something for</v>

3782
01:54:09.281 --> 01:54:10.114
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

3783
01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:12.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like your work is sort of in the digital realm.</v>

3784
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Partially a lot of them.</v>

3785
01:54:14.530 --> 01:54:17.980
<v Speaker 3>So it's like I just need to put it down like no phones in bed.</v>

3786
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:21.280
<v Speaker 3>These kinds of things like strict lines.</v>

3787
01:54:21.630 --> 01:54:22.463
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3788
01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:23.220
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

3789
01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:24.053
<v Speaker 4>that is huge.</v>

3790
01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:25.290
<v Speaker 4>Strict lines are huge.</v>

3791
01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3792
01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:27.000
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3793
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.610
<v Speaker 4>Putting your phone in a physical place and pushing it away.</v>

3794
01:54:30.150 --> 01:54:30.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3795
01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:31.493
<v Speaker 4>like that's,</v>

3796
01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:32.611
<v Speaker 4>it's huge.</v>

3797
01:54:32.611 --> 01:54:33.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just the,</v>

3798
01:54:33.370 --> 01:54:35.970
<v Speaker 4>the compulsion to look and check,</v>

3799
01:54:36.090 --> 01:54:38.790
<v Speaker 4>like Instagram feeds to see if there's any cool pictures.</v>

3800
01:54:38.791 --> 01:54:40.530
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck am I doing?</v>

3801
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:42.660
<v Speaker 4>Like why am I compelled to do this?</v>

3802
01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:43.980
<v Speaker 4>There's no benefit.</v>

3803
01:54:43.981 --> 01:54:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Like occasionally if I'm bored,</v>

3804
01:54:45.871 --> 01:54:46.950
<v Speaker 4>like I'm in the dentist's office,</v>

3805
01:54:46.951 --> 01:54:47.551
<v Speaker 4>you have 10 minutes.</v>

3806
01:54:47.551 --> 01:54:47.860
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

3807
01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.100
<v Speaker 4>What could see what the fuck's going on in the news?</v>

3808
01:54:50.490 --> 01:54:52.020
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe occasionally,</v>

3809
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:55.290
<v Speaker 4>but there's so much of your time,</v>

3810
01:54:55.291 --> 01:54:56.400
<v Speaker 4>it's dedicated to that.</v>

3811
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:57.570
<v Speaker 4>So much of it,</v>

3812
01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.320
<v Speaker 4>it's so taxing and it's so involved and so many people are doing.</v>

3813
01:55:04.771 --> 01:55:04.921
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3814
01:55:04.921 --> 01:55:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I went to a restaurant the other day and I was looking around and fucking</v>

3815
01:55:07.710 --> 01:55:10.890
<v Speaker 4>everyone was sitting at a table looking at their phone.</v>

3816
01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.671
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3817
01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:13.200
<v Speaker 4>we've ever did this stack game.</v>

3818
01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:14.100
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

3819
01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Just like if you're out to dinner with a bunch of people,</v>

3820
01:55:15.721 --> 01:55:19.870
<v Speaker 4>just everyone's put their phone in a stack in the middle when you could do it,</v>

3821
01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.753
<v Speaker 4>then you pay.</v>

3822
01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3823
01:55:21.930 --> 01:55:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather just,</v>

3824
01:55:22.710 --> 01:55:23.543
<v Speaker 4>just not,</v>

3825
01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:24.230
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

3826
01:55:24.230 --> 01:55:25.063
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3827
01:55:25.230 --> 01:55:28.680
<v Speaker 4>people's people wipe their butts and don't fucking wash their hands.</v>

3828
01:55:28.681 --> 01:55:29.730
<v Speaker 4>And touch their phone.</v>

3829
01:55:29.731 --> 01:55:30.031
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3830
01:55:30.031 --> 01:55:32.370
<v Speaker 4>your phone is filled with all kinds of dirty shit.</v>

3831
01:55:32.610 --> 01:55:37.380
<v Speaker 4>They like done these a swab tests of phones are covered with Ecolab and Pete</v>

3832
01:55:37.381 --> 01:55:38.214
<v Speaker 4>were gross.</v>

3833
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:39.383
<v Speaker 4>I'm not [inaudible],</v>

3834
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:40.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little Germaphobe.</v>

3835
01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:42.120
<v Speaker 4>My fucking hands clean pro.</v>

3836
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:42.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

3837
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:46.860
<v Speaker 4>but I know your phone probably has your butt all over it to just be honest.</v>

3838
01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:48.530
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

3839
01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:49.350
<v Speaker 4>How long have you don't have to,</v>

3840
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:50.250
<v Speaker 4>but I know what you're saying.</v>

3841
01:55:50.251 --> 01:55:51.084
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a good idea.</v>

3842
01:55:51.330 --> 01:55:51.721
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3843
01:55:51.721 --> 01:55:52.260
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3844
01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:53.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3845
01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:53.310
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3846
01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:54.143
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3847
01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:57.420
<v Speaker 4>the guys who run Joe beef in Montreal,</v>

3848
01:55:57.421 --> 01:55:58.680
<v Speaker 4>it's this amazing restaurant,</v>

3849
01:55:59.210 --> 01:55:59.551
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3850
01:55:59.551 --> 01:56:00.780
<v Speaker 4>Fred and Dave and they were,</v>

3851
01:56:00.810 --> 01:56:01.830
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about it,</v>

3852
01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:03.180
<v Speaker 4>but when they go to dinner,</v>

3853
01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:04.380
<v Speaker 4>they shut their phone off.</v>

3854
01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:05.580
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm going to,</v>

3855
01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:05.851
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

3856
01:56:05.851 --> 01:56:07.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm a good guest,</v>

3857
01:56:07.171 --> 01:56:08.040
<v Speaker 4>a good table guests.</v>

3858
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:09.420
<v Speaker 4>I shut my phone off.</v>

3859
01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:10.381
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3860
01:56:10.381 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't engage it on check it.</v>

3861
01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:12.450
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

3862
01:56:12.450 --> 01:56:12.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3863
01:56:12.661 --> 01:56:13.470
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

3864
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:18.470
<v Speaker 4>it's a similar thing to a podcasting in a way in that one of the good benefits</v>

3865
01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 4>of podcasting is that for three hours or two hours,</v>

3866
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:21.960
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck you're doing,</v>

3867
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:26.100
<v Speaker 4>you're going to sit down and you just can engage with a person to see you and I,</v>

3868
01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:27.090
<v Speaker 4>me and bill,</v>

3869
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:28.590
<v Speaker 4>we're just talking right.</v>

3870
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:30.270
<v Speaker 4>And that we're not checking our phone,</v>

3871
01:56:30.271 --> 01:56:31.770
<v Speaker 4>we're not looking at the television,</v>

3872
01:56:31.771 --> 01:56:35.100
<v Speaker 4>we're not looking at the laptop is no distractions.</v>

3873
01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:38.250
<v Speaker 4>And that is one of the rare moments in life where you get to talk to someone for</v>

3874
01:56:38.251 --> 01:56:39.011
<v Speaker 4>several hours.</v>

3875
01:56:39.011 --> 01:56:41.250
<v Speaker 4>And over the last,</v>

3876
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:42.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3877
01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:44.160
<v Speaker 4>nine years that I've been doing this podcast,</v>

3878
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:45.023
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

3879
01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:50.060
<v Speaker 4>it's benefited me tremendously just just in having real conversations with</v>

3880
01:56:50.581 --> 01:56:51.270
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3881
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:53.400
<v Speaker 4>We're just sitting across from somebody for hours.</v>

3882
01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Just talking to them,</v>

3883
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:57.780
<v Speaker 4>like getting better at understanding how people think,</v>

3884
01:56:57.781 --> 01:56:58.390
<v Speaker 4>getting better.</v>

3885
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:59.011
<v Speaker 4>Understanding how,</v>

3886
01:56:59.011 --> 01:57:02.610
<v Speaker 4>I think getting way better at communicating in that,</v>

3887
01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:03.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3888
01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:07.080
<v Speaker 4>knowing when to talk and when not to talk and what questions to ask and try to</v>

3889
01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 4>understand the thought process that another person has and you know,</v>

3890
01:57:11.071 --> 01:57:12.690
<v Speaker 4>you walk out of that with some lessons,</v>

3891
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:13.920
<v Speaker 4>like real legit,</v>

3892
01:57:13.921 --> 01:57:14.880
<v Speaker 4>tangible lessons.</v>

3893
01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:16.410
<v Speaker 4>Those fucking don't happen.</v>

3894
01:57:16.411 --> 01:57:18.360
<v Speaker 4>We staring at your phone while you're talking to people,</v>

3895
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:20.850
<v Speaker 4>they like cuts all that off the conversation.</v>

3896
01:57:20.851 --> 01:57:21.870
<v Speaker 4>Stay shallow.</v>

3897
01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:23.430
<v Speaker 4>You Miss Important points like,</v>

3898
01:57:23.431 --> 01:57:23.471
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3899
01:57:23.471 --> 01:57:23.821
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

3900
01:57:23.821 --> 01:57:24.690
<v Speaker 4>what were we saying?</v>

3901
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:27.540
<v Speaker 4>You do that kind of shit and like then the other person knows you're not</v>

3902
01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:28.180
<v Speaker 4>engaged.</v>

3903
01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:29.013
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

3904
01:57:29.070 --> 01:57:29.903
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

3905
01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:30.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3906
01:57:30.361 --> 01:57:31.290
<v Speaker 4>it's all shades of gray.</v>

3907
01:57:31.291 --> 01:57:35.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's done incredible things for like democratizing the ability to share</v>

3908
01:57:35.971 --> 01:57:36.570
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

3909
01:57:36.570 --> 01:57:40.800
<v Speaker 4>So it's not just these juggernaut media companies are the only places that can</v>

3910
01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:41.820
<v Speaker 4>share information.</v>

3911
01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:44.460
<v Speaker 4>So it's incredible.</v>

3912
01:57:44.670 --> 01:57:46.110
<v Speaker 4>It's crucial.</v>

3913
01:57:46.290 --> 01:57:50.100
<v Speaker 4>We need everyone to have the ability to share and so that you can check in</v>

3914
01:57:50.101 --> 01:57:53.850
<v Speaker 4>because maybe you're more likely to get the reality of what's going on in the</v>

3915
01:57:53.851 --> 01:57:56.400
<v Speaker 4>world from your newsfeed then then the big companies.</v>

3916
01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:57.893
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3917
01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.160
<v Speaker 4>we need management skills.</v>

3918
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3919
01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:00.930
<v Speaker 4>Personal management skills.</v>

3920
01:58:01.110 --> 01:58:01.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3921
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:02.730
<v Speaker 4>And we,</v>

3922
01:58:02.730 --> 01:58:06.270
<v Speaker 4>I think we need to look at them the same way we look at like alcohol consumption</v>

3923
01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:07.950
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3924
01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:09.870
<v Speaker 4>even poor food choices.</v>

3925
01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:13.830
<v Speaker 4>Like you can have a cheat day and eat a bunch of pizza and some ice cream like</v>

3926
01:58:13.831 --> 01:58:14.664
<v Speaker 4>the rock does.</v>

3927
01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.750
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to get hurt,</v>

3928
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:16.913
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3929
01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.890
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time he's probably take care of your meat vehicle.</v>

3930
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:22.380
<v Speaker 4>I think the same thing can be said of your mind.</v>

3931
01:58:22.650 --> 01:58:23.411
<v Speaker 4>Like you can have a day,</v>

3932
01:58:23.411 --> 01:58:25.020
<v Speaker 4>like I have a day a week,</v>

3933
01:58:25.021 --> 01:58:25.231
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3934
01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 4>I will fucking plop down on the couch and I don't give a fuck.</v>

3935
01:58:29.311 --> 01:58:34.311
<v Speaker 4>I just watch bullshit on TV and just relax because I know that I'm red lining it</v>

3936
01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:37.230
<v Speaker 4>six days a week,</v>

3937
01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:37.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3938
01:58:37.921 --> 01:58:40.050
<v Speaker 4>and I'm doing three different things at a time.</v>

3939
01:58:40.051 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 4>I have three different jobs and working out and I'm trying</v>

3940
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.390
<v Speaker 1>to take care of my family and writing comedy material and then let me see some</v>

3941
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.760
<v Speaker 1>document around some wacky fucking cult or,</v>

3942
01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:50.380
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the hell I'm going to watch.</v>

3943
01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:54.910
<v Speaker 1>And I don't feel guilty when I do that because I know that I've kind of air</v>

3944
01:58:54.911 --> 01:58:55.810
<v Speaker 1>quotes earned it,</v>

3945
01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:56.960
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3946
01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that's,</v>

3947
01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:02.380
<v Speaker 1>that's mental management and I think we certainly need,</v>

3948
01:59:02.890 --> 01:59:04.180
<v Speaker 1>we need personal management.</v>

3949
01:59:04.181 --> 01:59:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It comes to the use of electronic devices.</v>

3950
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3951
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Personal challenges.</v>

3952
01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:09.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3953
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Challenge psychology is really fucking interesting to me.</v>

3954
01:59:14.170 --> 01:59:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys do the Doc Tobar thing.</v>

3955
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:18.850
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking about doing it twice a year now.</v>

3956
01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:20.560
<v Speaker 1>I did this one with,</v>

3957
01:59:20.590 --> 01:59:22.780
<v Speaker 1>with some of my friends just going to watch shit.</v>

3958
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:25.900
<v Speaker 1>You are you in it to we,</v>

3959
01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:27.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get in.</v>

3960
01:59:27.690 --> 01:59:29.350
<v Speaker 1>We did one called uh,</v>

3961
01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:31.360
<v Speaker 1>the hundred burpee challenge.</v>

3962
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:33.160
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>

3963
01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done burpees and I did them today because I was coming.</v>

3964
01:59:36.110 --> 01:59:36.371
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3965
01:59:36.371 --> 01:59:36.641
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3966
01:59:36.641 --> 01:59:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I can do burpees tonight,</v>

3967
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:38.560
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

3968
01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:43.560
<v Speaker 1>a hundred for time everyday for a hundred days straight and it's,</v>

3969
01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:47.410
<v Speaker 1>you are drenched after going for time.</v>

3970
01:59:47.530 --> 01:59:48.280
<v Speaker 1>100 burpees.</v>

3971
01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:49.113
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3972
01:59:49.150 --> 01:59:49.871
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

3973
01:59:49.871 --> 01:59:51.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard when it was the best,</v>

3974
01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:55.210
<v Speaker 1>most has been have ever been working out and it was like me and five friends.</v>

3975
01:59:55.211 --> 01:59:58.990
<v Speaker 1>My friend's mom did it too and it was changed my life.</v>

3976
01:59:59.440 --> 01:59:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3977
01:59:59.770 --> 02:00:02.170
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous how to change your life.</v>

3978
02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I felt better than I have ever felt by far.</v>

3979
02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:06.640
<v Speaker 1>And I have it.</v>

3980
02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:08.080
<v Speaker 1>That was like a year ago and I've,</v>

3981
02:00:08.081 --> 02:00:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I've trailed off,</v>

3982
02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think like,</v>

3983
02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>but not just physical challenges like digital ones too.</v>

3984
02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>And like with the ice bucket thing,</v>

3985
02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>that was crazy shit.</v>

3986
02:00:18.850 --> 02:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get in them either.</v>

3987
02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3988
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>just get watching it happen was just really powerful.</v>

3989
02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:26.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3990
02:00:26.531 --> 02:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to throw water on my head during a fucking drought stop.</v>

3991
02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3992
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Everybody stopped.</v>

3993
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not fixing anything.</v>

3994
02:00:33.791 --> 02:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>How about I just write a check.</v>

3995
02:00:35.530 --> 02:00:36.363
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you some money.</v>

3996
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3997
02:00:36.670 --> 02:00:37.241
<v Speaker 1>Film Yourself.</v>

3998
02:00:37.241 --> 02:00:38.074
<v Speaker 1>Writing the check.</v>

3999
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

4000
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4001
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Throw a glass of water in my face when I'm done with the chuck.</v>

4002
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:42.843
<v Speaker 1>Just stop.</v>

4003
02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>But getting communities to sort of pressure each other into doing things in a</v>

4004
02:00:50.261 --> 02:00:50.831
<v Speaker 1>positive way.</v>

4005
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>In a positive way.</v>

4006
02:00:51.590 --> 02:00:52.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4007
02:00:52.450 --> 02:00:52.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4008
02:00:52.631 --> 02:00:56.110
<v Speaker 1>that was what the sober October thing kind of turned out to be about.</v>

4009
02:00:56.710 --> 02:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of lessons learned in that too.</v>

4010
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4011
02:00:59.621 --> 02:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>you learn lessons about your reliance on um,</v>

4012
02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>either substances or things.</v>

4013
02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I learned from the sober October challenge,</v>

4014
02:01:09.381 --> 02:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>the last one was that when you engage in really rigorous physical activity,</v>

4015
02:01:14.351 --> 02:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>six and seven days a week,</v>

4016
02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't give a fuck.</v>

4017
02:01:17.050 --> 02:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't give a fuck.</v>

4018
02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Like all the chatter,</v>

4019
02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.710
<v Speaker 1>the internal chatter,</v>

4020
02:01:20.711 --> 02:01:21.550
<v Speaker 1>it just goes away.</v>

4021
02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>All the negative chatter.</v>

4022
02:01:23.950 --> 02:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like taking a pill.</v>

4023
02:01:25.481 --> 02:01:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't give a fuck pill.</v>

4024
02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

4025
02:01:28.570 --> 02:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>It's really a mate because I think a lot of personal anxiety that people carry</v>

4026
02:01:31.661 --> 02:01:32.620
<v Speaker 1>around with them is,</v>

4027
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>is a physical energy that's not being expressed because I think the body has</v>

4028
02:01:38.141 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>certain demands and certain</v>

4029
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.903
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>

4030
02:01:41.090 --> 02:01:44.690
<v Speaker 4>And in order to have this certain potential,</v>

4031
02:01:44.691 --> 02:01:46.640
<v Speaker 4>like your potential for athletic output,</v>

4032
02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:48.800
<v Speaker 4>you have to have this,</v>

4033
02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:50.270
<v Speaker 4>you have this energy source,</v>

4034
02:01:50.271 --> 02:01:50.660
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4035
02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:53.570
<v Speaker 4>And this is body energy source when not expressed.</v>

4036
02:01:53.571 --> 02:01:55.160
<v Speaker 4>And when you're sitting in a cubicle all day,</v>

4037
02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:56.120
<v Speaker 4>day after day after day,</v>

4038
02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:01.360
<v Speaker 4>they build this like internal anxious feeling intention and that becomes your</v>

4039
02:02:03.051 --> 02:02:04.100
<v Speaker 4>normal,</v>

4040
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:04.910
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4041
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:05.151
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4042
02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:06.530
<v Speaker 4>the normal line,</v>

4043
02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:08.480
<v Speaker 4>the normal frequency in which you operate.</v>

4044
02:02:08.481 --> 02:02:12.770
<v Speaker 4>You operate under this intense sort of anxious state and you feel like,</v>

4045
02:02:12.771 --> 02:02:13.580
<v Speaker 4>well this is life.</v>

4046
02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:14.600
<v Speaker 4>God Damn and I'm depressed,</v>

4047
02:02:14.601 --> 02:02:15.170
<v Speaker 4>or God dammit,</v>

4048
02:02:15.170 --> 02:02:15.921
<v Speaker 4>I'm anxious guy.</v>

4049
02:02:15.921 --> 02:02:16.581
<v Speaker 4>I got anxiety,</v>

4050
02:02:16.581 --> 02:02:17.780
<v Speaker 4>I've got to see a shrink or got to this.</v>

4051
02:02:18.410 --> 02:02:21.530
<v Speaker 4>If you just blow that shit out every day,</v>

4052
02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:22.341
<v Speaker 4>every day,</v>

4053
02:02:22.341 --> 02:02:22.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4054
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:27.300
<v Speaker 4>you burn off 2000 calories and you fucking run for five miles and you do kettle</v>

4055
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:30.410
<v Speaker 4>bells and Chin ups and fucking hit the bag for five rounds,</v>

4056
02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 4>do that shit goes away.</v>

4057
02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:33.590
<v Speaker 4>You don't give a fuck.</v>

4058
02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:35.780
<v Speaker 4>And then you get to look at things with real clarity.</v>

4059
02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:39.530
<v Speaker 4>So there was a lesson learned in that and then did that lesson was only learned</v>

4060
02:02:39.531 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 4>because we decided to challenge each other and push ourselves.</v>

4061
02:02:43.670 --> 02:02:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it would be too draconian to have like a,</v>

4062
02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:47.900
<v Speaker 4>a company,</v>

4063
02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.340
<v Speaker 4>a hundred burpee a day?</v>

4064
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:50.203
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4065
02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:50.691
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4066
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:51.530
<v Speaker 4>You know why man?</v>

4067
02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:53.270
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think you should tell people what to do.</v>

4068
02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:54.030
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

4069
02:02:54.030 --> 02:02:54.201
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

4070
02:02:54.201 --> 02:02:54.441
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

4071
02:02:54.441 --> 02:02:57.620
<v Speaker 4>their job as the job and then everything else is like a cult,</v>

4072
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:59.210
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4073
02:02:59.210 --> 02:02:59.571
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

4074
02:02:59.571 --> 02:02:59.811
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4075
02:02:59.811 --> 02:03:01.580
<v Speaker 4>we're all going to wear white robes.</v>

4076
02:03:01.730 --> 02:03:02.950
<v Speaker 4>We don't need anything about white robes.</v>

4077
02:03:02.970 --> 02:03:03.803
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4078
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:07.490
<v Speaker 4>When do you start fucking everybody and taking their money because that always</v>

4079
02:03:07.491 --> 02:03:08.241
<v Speaker 4>comes next.</v>

4080
02:03:08.241 --> 02:03:08.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4081
02:03:08.361 --> 02:03:09.470
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's in vain.</v>

4082
02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:10.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4083
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:11.030
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

4084
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.661
<v Speaker 4>you can't force people.</v>

4085
02:03:11.661 --> 02:03:12.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like being convinced,</v>

4086
02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:14.210
<v Speaker 4>but it wouldn't be a bad,</v>

4087
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.601
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4088
02:03:14.601 --> 02:03:16.070
<v Speaker 4>the problem is if you were,</v>

4089
02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:17.533
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>

4090
02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:20.240
<v Speaker 4>you could have some sort of a companywide challenge.</v>

4091
02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:22.380
<v Speaker 4>We're giving bonus site if you do know,</v>

4092
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:27.050
<v Speaker 4>because that's what I'm saying is like you would shame them into doing it or you</v>

4093
02:03:27.051 --> 02:03:27.621
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>

4094
02:03:27.621 --> 02:03:28.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4095
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:28.671
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4096
02:03:28.671 --> 02:03:33.671
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another make it seem like they would advance in the company more if</v>

4097
02:03:33.771 --> 02:03:35.200
<v Speaker 4>they played along.</v>

4098
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:36.103
<v Speaker 4>Could be,</v>

4099
02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:37.213
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4100
02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:38.443
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna do it</v>

4101
02:03:42.170 --> 02:03:43.460
<v Speaker 4>because it feels so good.</v>

4102
02:03:43.461 --> 02:03:43.970
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4103
02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:44.540
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4104
02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:44.661
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4105
02:03:44.661 --> 02:03:45.530
<v Speaker 4>you should encourage it,</v>

4106
02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.420
<v Speaker 4>but I almost feel like,</v>

4107
02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:48.303
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4108
02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:49.940
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4109
02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:51.230
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want to shame people.</v>

4110
02:03:51.231 --> 02:03:53.600
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some brilliant people that don't work out at all.</v>

4111
02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:54.553
<v Speaker 4>They're brilliant,</v>

4112
02:03:54.890 --> 02:03:55.491
<v Speaker 4>but they just,</v>

4113
02:03:55.491 --> 02:03:55.760
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

4114
02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:56.690
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

4115
02:03:56.691 --> 02:03:57.524
<v Speaker 4>that's their choice.</v>

4116
02:03:57.790 --> 02:03:58.011
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4117
02:03:58.011 --> 02:04:00.590
<v Speaker 4>it should be your choice to go out like Christopher Hitchens,</v>

4118
02:04:00.591 --> 02:04:03.320
<v Speaker 4>it just fucking drink every day and smoke cigarettes and one day he get cancer</v>

4119
02:04:03.321 --> 02:04:03.621
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

4120
02:04:03.621 --> 02:04:04.454
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4121
02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:05.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4122
02:04:05.151 --> 02:04:07.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is like,</v>

4123
02:04:07.870 --> 02:04:08.421
<v Speaker 4>he mean he,</v>

4124
02:04:08.421 --> 02:04:09.380
<v Speaker 4>the way he described it,</v>

4125
02:04:09.381 --> 02:04:11.030
<v Speaker 4>like burning the candle at both ends,</v>

4126
02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:11.580
<v Speaker 4>it gave,</v>

4127
02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:11.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4128
02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:12.860
<v Speaker 4>a beautiful,</v>

4129
02:04:12.861 --> 02:04:13.694
<v Speaker 4>brilliant light.</v>

4130
02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:14.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4131
02:04:14.181 --> 02:04:16.610
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't have had those ideas if he had done it another way.</v>

4132
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:17.601
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible.</v>

4133
02:04:17.601 --> 02:04:21.630
<v Speaker 4>That's true in most of the madness that we see in,</v>

4134
02:04:21.631 --> 02:04:22.880
<v Speaker 4>in brilliant artists.</v>

4135
02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:23.801
<v Speaker 4>Like it's very,</v>

4136
02:04:23.801 --> 02:04:27.770
<v Speaker 4>it's very possible that that madness would not be expressed if they had their</v>

4137
02:04:27.771 --> 02:04:28.604
<v Speaker 4>shit together.</v>

4138
02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:33.830
<v Speaker 4>There was something that Sam Harris was saying the other day on your show just</v>

4139
02:04:33.831 --> 02:04:34.640
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

4140
02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.600
<v Speaker 4>about the freewill stuff.</v>

4141
02:04:35.601 --> 02:04:36.230
<v Speaker 4>And I think that it,</v>

4142
02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 4>that connects to this information</v>

4143
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:39.390
<v Speaker 3>theory kind of thing.</v>

4144
02:04:39.391 --> 02:04:44.391
<v Speaker 3>So if we're just sort of a conglomerate of these actions and words like flowing</v>

4145
02:04:48.930 --> 02:04:49.280
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4146
02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:51.720
<v Speaker 3>the actions through our body in unique ways.</v>

4147
02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:53.813
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4148
02:04:54.210 --> 02:04:56.370
<v Speaker 3>do you accept his theory on freewill?</v>

4149
02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:57.271
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4150
02:04:57.271 --> 02:05:01.230
<v Speaker 4>well it's not his theory or it's a conventional theory of termism that a lot of</v>

4151
02:05:01.231 --> 02:05:06.150
<v Speaker 4>people are embracing and I think there's definitely some merit to it.</v>

4152
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:07.381
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

4153
02:05:07.381 --> 02:05:11.310
<v Speaker 4>you and I both know that you choose whether or not you decide to do something</v>

4154
02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:11.791
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4155
02:05:11.791 --> 02:05:13.120
<v Speaker 4>You choose whether or not you did.</v>

4156
02:05:13.150 --> 02:05:14.970
<v Speaker 4>Like someone says,</v>

4157
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.600
<v Speaker 4>someone says something to you that's kind of Shitty and you choose whether you</v>

4158
02:05:18.601 --> 02:05:20.310
<v Speaker 4>decide to email them back something shitty.</v>

4159
02:05:20.311 --> 02:05:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Like you have that initial impulse like a little,</v>

4160
02:05:21.961 --> 02:05:22.321
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

4161
02:05:22.321 --> 02:05:23.154
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

4162
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.630
<v Speaker 4>You have that initial impulse,</v>

4163
02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:25.770
<v Speaker 4>you think on it,</v>

4164
02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:26.550
<v Speaker 4>you sleep on it,</v>

4165
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:28.290
<v Speaker 4>but why are you thinking on it and sleeping on it?</v>

4166
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:30.090
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing that because of determinism?</v>

4167
02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing that because you're trying to be a better person and are you</v>

4168
02:05:33.031 --> 02:05:36.600
<v Speaker 4>trying to be a better person because of all the factors that played out in your</v>

4169
02:05:36.601 --> 02:05:37.050
<v Speaker 4>life?</v>

4170
02:05:37.050 --> 02:05:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Like environment,</v>

4171
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:40.740
<v Speaker 4>Jean's life experience,</v>

4172
02:05:40.770 --> 02:05:41.580
<v Speaker 4>all those things,</v>

4173
02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:41.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4174
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:43.200
<v Speaker 4>It means it's really good.</v>

4175
02:05:43.410 --> 02:05:45.060
<v Speaker 4>It's a really good discussion.</v>

4176
02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:47.200
<v Speaker 3>So do you own the words that you're saying right now?</v>

4177
02:05:47.230 --> 02:05:48.063
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>

4178
02:05:48.580 --> 02:05:49.331
<v Speaker 3>Larry Lessig,</v>

4179
02:05:49.331 --> 02:05:50.350
<v Speaker 3>who's on here the other day.</v>

4180
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4181
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:51.910
<v Speaker 3>You guys didn't even talk about this,</v>

4182
02:05:51.911 --> 02:05:54.940
<v Speaker 3>but he basically is one of the founders of creative Commons and this whole</v>

4183
02:05:54.941 --> 02:05:56.710
<v Speaker 3>licensing structure for content.</v>

4184
02:05:56.711 --> 02:05:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Like what we're saying right now,</v>

4185
02:05:57.731 --> 02:05:58.870
<v Speaker 3>you know this is going to be licensed,</v>

4186
02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:02.560
<v Speaker 3>I dunno how you and I'm form right here.</v>

4187
02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:04.840
<v Speaker 3>This discussion is going to be licensed you.</v>

4188
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4189
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4190
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:06.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

4191
02:06:06.490 --> 02:06:08.410
<v Speaker 3>I think you're licensing it in a certain way.</v>

4192
02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4193
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Well you have the ability to license a however you want,</v>

4194
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:11.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4195
02:06:11.610 --> 02:06:12.071
<v Speaker 3>You could say,</v>

4196
02:06:12.071 --> 02:06:12.281
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4197
02:06:12.281 --> 02:06:15.190
<v Speaker 3>anyone can take this and cut it up and remix it.</v>

4198
02:06:15.191 --> 02:06:17.020
<v Speaker 3>Or You could say now it's locked down.</v>

4199
02:06:18.130 --> 02:06:23.130
<v Speaker 3>But he helped create this whole licensing array of like six different licenses.</v>

4200
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:29.140
<v Speaker 3>One says you can do absolutely anything you want with this and other says you</v>

4201
02:06:29.141 --> 02:06:29.651
<v Speaker 3>can share it,</v>

4202
02:06:29.651 --> 02:06:30.640
<v Speaker 3>but you can't make money off it.</v>

4203
02:06:30.710 --> 02:06:31.900
<v Speaker 3>There's a handful.</v>

4204
02:06:31.901 --> 02:06:36.901
<v Speaker 3>And so the free will stuff is connected to how we're dealing with information.</v>

4205
02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.380
<v Speaker 3>And like if you,</v>

4206
02:06:41.381 --> 02:06:42.214
<v Speaker 3>cause if you,</v>

4207
02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:44.870
<v Speaker 3>if you think realistic,</v>

4208
02:06:44.871 --> 02:06:46.210
<v Speaker 3>we don't own what we're saying,</v>

4209
02:06:46.330 --> 02:06:47.170
<v Speaker 3>we're a part of it,</v>

4210
02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:47.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4211
02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:50.500
<v Speaker 3>We're a conduit where unique conduit.</v>

4212
02:06:51.490 --> 02:06:52.890
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

4213
02:06:52.930 --> 02:06:57.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it aligns with how the universe works to really be locking down</v>

4214
02:07:00.011 --> 02:07:01.000
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

4215
02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:05.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that it makes sense probably in certain short term business,</v>

4216
02:07:07.330 --> 02:07:08.830
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4217
02:07:09.250 --> 02:07:12.100
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to open it up to what's really going on.</v>

4218
02:07:12.190 --> 02:07:16.990
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by like locking down information like source code,</v>

4219
02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:19.420
<v Speaker 3>like classified files,</v>

4220
02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:21.370
<v Speaker 3>like our content,</v>

4221
02:07:21.371 --> 02:07:22.091
<v Speaker 3>like music,</v>

4222
02:07:22.091 --> 02:07:23.800
<v Speaker 3>like video and now how does it,</v>

4223
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:27.310
<v Speaker 4>how does this connect to determinism and whether or not you have free will</v>

4224
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:31.100
<v Speaker 3>because it's are,</v>

4225
02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:34.620
<v Speaker 3>are you the creator of your information?</v>

4226
02:07:34.770 --> 02:07:35.603
<v Speaker 4>Mm.</v>

4227
02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

4228
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:36.850
<v Speaker 3>you are certainly,</v>

4229
02:07:36.851 --> 02:07:37.631
<v Speaker 3>if you put in the work,</v>

4230
02:07:37.631 --> 02:07:39.340
<v Speaker 3>like let's say you decided to write a book.</v>

4231
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean you put hundreds and hundreds of hours into this book and edit this book</v>

4232
02:07:46.090 --> 02:07:47.860
<v Speaker 3>and then you release the book and someone says,</v>

4233
02:07:47.861 --> 02:07:48.490
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4234
02:07:48.490 --> 02:07:48.941
<v Speaker 3>you didn't.</v>

4235
02:07:48.941 --> 02:07:49.960
<v Speaker 3>You didn't create that.</v>

4236
02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:50.380
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>

4237
02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:53.500
<v Speaker 3>you're a product of determination and I'm going to just steal your book.</v>

4238
02:07:54.190 --> 02:07:55.390
<v Speaker 3>That's intellectual theft.</v>

4239
02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Intellectual theft is real.</v>

4240
02:07:56.621 --> 02:07:56.821
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4241
02:07:56.821 --> 02:07:59.410
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly real in terms of like creation of content,</v>

4242
02:07:59.750 --> 02:08:00.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4243
02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:05.280
<v Speaker 3>If you're a standup comedian and someone takes your countless hours of work and</v>

4244
02:08:06.641 --> 02:08:07.474
<v Speaker 3>steals it,</v>

4245
02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:09.430
<v Speaker 3>that's intellectual theft for sure.</v>

4246
02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:13.090
<v Speaker 3>And then they try to pawn it off as their own through their own selfish needs.</v>

4247
02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:14.560
<v Speaker 3>There's a selfish means.</v>

4248
02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:18.500
<v Speaker 3>That's why attribution is the key part of the creative Commons licensing</v>

4249
02:08:18.530 --> 02:08:19.363
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>

4250
02:08:19.530 --> 02:08:21.360
<v Speaker 3>Always saying if you come up with a joke,</v>

4251
02:08:21.390 --> 02:08:21.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4252
02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 4>came from here,</v>

4253
02:08:23.050 --> 02:08:24.880
<v Speaker 4>but what if it's a profit?</v>

4254
02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Like say if you wrote a book and I say,</v>

4255
02:08:27.881 --> 02:08:28.061
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4256
02:08:28.061 --> 02:08:29.760
<v Speaker 4>this is a great book written by Bill [inaudible],</v>

4257
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:32.440
<v Speaker 4>give me five bucks for it and putting it up on my site and you to it.</v>

4258
02:08:32.441 --> 02:08:33.101
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

4259
02:08:33.101 --> 02:08:33.491
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4260
02:08:33.491 --> 02:08:34.240
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>

4261
02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:35.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

4262
02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:37.840
<v Speaker 4>somebody makes all the money off of your book because they have a better</v>

4263
02:08:37.841 --> 02:08:40.000
<v Speaker 4>platform to sell your book and they don't give it to you at all.</v>

4264
02:08:40.001 --> 02:08:41.260
<v Speaker 4>And you wrote the book,</v>

4265
02:08:41.290 --> 02:08:42.700
<v Speaker 4>you spent all the time,</v>

4266
02:08:42.701 --> 02:08:43.780
<v Speaker 4>you did all the work.</v>

4267
02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:45.430
<v Speaker 4>I would for certain</v>

4268
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:48.400
<v Speaker 3>and content that I create completely give it away.</v>

4269
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:50.170
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like the guy was never written a book.</v>

4270
02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I've written a book.</v>

4271
02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:52.480
<v Speaker 3>Did you?</v>

4272
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4273
02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

4274
02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:55.810
<v Speaker 3>I've written a lot of content.</v>

4275
02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4276
02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:56.711
<v Speaker 3>But if you've written,</v>

4277
02:08:56.711 --> 02:08:57.191
<v Speaker 3>I give away,</v>

4278
02:08:57.191 --> 02:08:58.024
<v Speaker 3>I give,</v>

4279
02:08:58.360 --> 02:08:59.680
<v Speaker 3>I've not published,</v>

4280
02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:01.150
<v Speaker 3>but the book that you sell,</v>

4281
02:09:01.151 --> 02:09:02.050
<v Speaker 3>like if you were an author,</v>

4282
02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:03.040
<v Speaker 3>but say if you were,</v>

4283
02:09:03.670 --> 02:09:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying people should be forced to do this.</v>

4284
02:09:06.730 --> 02:09:11.730
<v Speaker 3>I can just sometimes I'm just saying that this I think is how creativity happens</v>

4285
02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.800
<v Speaker 3>and I just,</v>

4286
02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:15.673
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

4287
02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:19.870
<v Speaker 3>people deserve to make money on their content.</v>

4288
02:09:20.250 --> 02:09:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4289
02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:22.930
<v Speaker 3>And you deserve to own your stuff.</v>

4290
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:27.990
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that that's actually how the universe works and I don't think</v>

4291
02:09:28.601 --> 02:09:29.560
<v Speaker 3>it's acceptable to say,</v>

4292
02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:29.951
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4293
02:09:29.951 --> 02:09:30.370
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>

4294
02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:30.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4295
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:31.840
<v Speaker 3>free will doesn't exist.</v>

4296
02:09:31.841 --> 02:09:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I own your content.</v>

4297
02:09:33.730 --> 02:09:34.570
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

4298
02:09:34.571 --> 02:09:36.640
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm struggling to see how they're connected.</v>

4299
02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're not the originator,</v>

4300
02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:43.730
<v Speaker 3>then you're not the owner.</v>

4301
02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:46.550
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird argument because you are the originator.</v>

4302
02:09:46.551 --> 02:09:48.530
<v Speaker 4>Stephen King wrote all Steven Qr.</v>

4303
02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.390
<v Speaker 4>You're the unique conduit.</v>

4304
02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:56.860
<v Speaker 3>You are the originator of that specific configuration of information and you</v>

4305
02:09:57.021 --> 02:09:59.060
<v Speaker 3>deserve to be able to do everything you're saying with it.</v>

4306
02:09:59.930 --> 02:10:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that</v>

4307
02:10:03.150 --> 02:10:03.960
<v Speaker 6>Aye.</v>

4308
02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

4309
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.580
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4310
02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:05.820
<v Speaker 3>it's complex.</v>

4311
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4312
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:07.650
<v Speaker 4>it is complex.</v>

4313
02:10:07.651 --> 02:10:10.560
<v Speaker 4>If you're saying that all human beings,</v>

4314
02:10:10.590 --> 02:10:11.423
<v Speaker 4>essentially,</v>

4315
02:10:11.850 --> 02:10:16.850
<v Speaker 4>all of your actions have been determined by a lot of factors that are outside of</v>

4316
02:10:17.971 --> 02:10:18.804
<v Speaker 4>your control.</v>

4317
02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.070
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's genetics,</v>

4318
02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:20.430
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

4319
02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:21.270
<v Speaker 4>life experience,</v>

4320
02:10:21.271 --> 02:10:22.140
<v Speaker 4>education,</v>

4321
02:10:22.650 --> 02:10:23.820
<v Speaker 4>all the different factors,</v>

4322
02:10:24.270 --> 02:10:25.103
<v Speaker 4>your environment.</v>

4323
02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:26.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4324
02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:29.070
<v Speaker 4>is that what's causing you to,</v>

4325
02:10:29.071 --> 02:10:29.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4326
02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:30.360
<v Speaker 4>put out,</v>

4327
02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:31.480
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

4328
02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:33.010
<v Speaker 4>A fucking brilliant record.</v>

4329
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.113
<v Speaker 1>It's part of it,</v>

4330
02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:36.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4331
02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:37.610
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you have 50,</v>

4332
02:10:37.670 --> 02:10:38.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have 50%.</v>

4333
02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Everything else has 50% or there's weed,</v>

4334
02:10:41.211 --> 02:10:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the percentages,</v>

4335
02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:47.630
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a musician and someone like Spotify comes along and says,</v>

4336
02:10:47.631 --> 02:10:49.070
<v Speaker 1>boot didn't even make that dude,</v>

4337
02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:52.550
<v Speaker 1>so we're just gonna put it on Spotify and make millions and give you pennies.</v>

4338
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:54.110
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm advocating.</v>

4339
02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:55.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4340
02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying sampling uses the blues died.</v>

4341
02:10:59.541 --> 02:10:59.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4342
02:10:59.751 --> 02:11:00.351
<v Speaker 1>more than that.</v>

4343
02:11:00.351 --> 02:11:01.070
<v Speaker 1>More than that.</v>

4344
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:01.311
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

4345
02:11:01.311 --> 02:11:01.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4346
02:11:01.730 --> 02:11:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4347
02:11:02.250 --> 02:11:03.350
<v Speaker 1>It was a real plagiarism.</v>

4348
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:04.783
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4349
02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:06.350
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't,</v>

4350
02:11:07.130 --> 02:11:09.410
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that those aren't great records.</v>

4351
02:11:09.411 --> 02:11:10.244
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

4352
02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It is true.</v>

4353
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4354
02:11:11.781 --> 02:11:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4355
02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:13.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a led Zeppelin,</v>

4356
02:11:13.761 --> 02:11:15.080
<v Speaker 1>this legit gray area.</v>

4357
02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:16.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4358
02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I found out this,</v>

4359
02:11:17.110 --> 02:11:17.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4360
02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Bill Burke called me up and left us really disturbed message.</v>

4361
02:11:20.271 --> 02:11:22.610
<v Speaker 1>He was like really bummed out when he watched.</v>

4362
02:11:22.611 --> 02:11:23.900
<v Speaker 1>And Bill's a musician,</v>

4363
02:11:23.901 --> 02:11:24.734
<v Speaker 1>he's a drummer.</v>

4364
02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:29.920
<v Speaker 1>And when he saw videos of led Zeppelin music played and the band that used to</v>

4365
02:11:30.621 --> 02:11:33.230
<v Speaker 1>open for led Zepplin we played it on the podcast.</v>

4366
02:11:33.231 --> 02:11:33.471
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

4367
02:11:33.471 --> 02:11:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4368
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Like they just stole stuff.</v>

4369
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:42.020
<v Speaker 1>They just stole giant chunks and rifts and you know,</v>

4370
02:11:42.021 --> 02:11:42.161
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4371
02:11:42.161 --> 02:11:45.800
<v Speaker 1>and I mean they made it better I guess,</v>

4372
02:11:46.590 --> 02:11:47.420
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4373
02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:47.751
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

4374
02:11:47.751 --> 02:11:49.880
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different thing than Stephen King's book.</v>

4375
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4376
02:11:50.690 --> 02:11:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Because Stephen King had to spend countless hours in front of his laptop trying</v>

4377
02:11:57.141 --> 02:12:01.880
<v Speaker 1>to go over each and every sentence and each and every paragraph and suck you in</v>

4378
02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:03.590
<v Speaker 1>all this work.</v>

4379
02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:04.041
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4380
02:12:04.041 --> 02:12:04.940
<v Speaker 1>they stole stuff,</v>

4381
02:12:04.941 --> 02:12:05.241
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4382
02:12:05.241 --> 02:12:06.560
<v Speaker 1>They sold certain phrases.</v>

4383
02:12:06.561 --> 02:12:11.561
<v Speaker 1>But you think he didn't use a single phrase anywhere in any of his books that he</v>

4384
02:12:12.231 --> 02:12:13.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't pull from something?</v>

4385
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:14.833
<v Speaker 1>We certainly has.</v>

4386
02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4387
02:12:15.190 --> 02:12:16.023
<v Speaker 1>He certainly has.</v>

4388
02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4389
02:12:16.730 --> 02:12:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the same though.</v>

4390
02:12:19.190 --> 02:12:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's similar led Zepplin what?</v>

4391
02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:25.220
<v Speaker 1>They also had to spend countless hours recording that performance to get it to</v>

4392
02:12:25.221 --> 02:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>the level of awesomeness that we heard.</v>

4393
02:12:29.090 --> 02:12:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4394
02:12:29.690 --> 02:12:30.800
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't easy to do.</v>

4395
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:33.380
<v Speaker 1>They just did a bitch ass move and they didn't pay those people.</v>

4396
02:12:34.190 --> 02:12:35.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4397
02:12:35.090 --> 02:12:36.980
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you should be attributing,</v>

4398
02:12:37.130 --> 02:12:38.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're taking ideas,</v>

4399
02:12:38.331 --> 02:12:39.320
<v Speaker 1>put in the footnotes,</v>

4400
02:12:39.321 --> 02:12:39.951
<v Speaker 1>why does it hurt?</v>

4401
02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make your art worse because then they'd have to admit they stole the</v>

4402
02:12:43.491 --> 02:12:45.920
<v Speaker 1>riff for Stairway to heaven from their opening band.</v>

4403
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And then people would go,</v>

4404
02:12:46.911 --> 02:12:47.744
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4405
02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:48.831
<v Speaker 1>And then they would see it.</v>

4406
02:12:48.831 --> 02:12:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Then they would look at led Zepplin differently.</v>

4407
02:12:51.230 --> 02:12:52.100
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4408
02:12:52.101 --> 02:12:54.740
<v Speaker 1>human beings are fucking severely flawed.</v>

4409
02:12:55.090 --> 02:12:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4410
02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I buy that with this,</v>

4411
02:12:58.731 --> 02:13:02.630
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you're saying in terms of like a authors creating content.</v>

4412
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to sell something.</v>

4413
02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:05.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4414
02:13:05.211 --> 02:13:06.044
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4415
02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:07.430
<v Speaker 1>But if they are,</v>

4416
02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:10.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think someone should be able to copy their stuff and sell it.</v>

4417
02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they should either.</v>

4418
02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:16.010
<v Speaker 1>But what do you think it should be able to do?</v>

4419
02:13:16.011 --> 02:13:16.400
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>

4420
02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:16.641
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4421
02:13:16.641 --> 02:13:17.474
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to decide.</v>

4422
02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:17.901
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

4423
02:13:17.901 --> 02:13:18.830
<v Speaker 1>the content creator,</v>

4424
02:13:18.831 --> 02:13:19.100
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

4425
02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:19.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4426
02:13:19.371 --> 02:13:19.971
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

4427
02:13:19.971 --> 02:13:20.804
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4428
02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4429
02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:22.033
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4430
02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:22.491
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

4431
02:13:22.491 --> 02:13:22.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4432
02:13:22.761 --> 02:13:24.770
<v Speaker 1>obviously I play devil's advocate a lot,</v>

4433
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:26.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's how you get to the bottom.</v>

4434
02:13:26.101 --> 02:13:26.901
<v Speaker 1>And these conversations.</v>

4435
02:13:26.901 --> 02:13:28.700
<v Speaker 1>But it is a very complicated issue,</v>

4436
02:13:28.701 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the complicated issue of who you are and why you are</v>

4437
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:35.460
<v Speaker 4>who you are and who you are at this moment versus who you are a decade ago or</v>

4438
02:13:35.461 --> 02:13:36.330
<v Speaker 4>two decades ago.</v>

4439
02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:37.010
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4440
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:38.400
<v Speaker 4>it's all very weird,</v>

4441
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:39.263
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4442
02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:39.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4443
02:13:39.841 --> 02:13:42.450
<v Speaker 4>you go back and think about stuff from high school and you're like,</v>

4444
02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:42.901
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

4445
02:13:42.901 --> 02:13:43.830
<v Speaker 4>what am I really,</v>

4446
02:13:43.831 --> 02:13:44.670
<v Speaker 4>even that person?</v>

4447
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:46.043
<v Speaker 4>Like I think about,</v>

4448
02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:46.431
<v Speaker 4>like I've,</v>

4449
02:13:46.431 --> 02:13:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to my sister about stuff that happened when we were in high school.</v>

4450
02:13:49.381 --> 02:13:49.621
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4451
02:13:49.621 --> 02:13:50.341
<v Speaker 4>you remember that guy?</v>

4452
02:13:50.341 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 4>And he said to say hi and like,</v>

4453
02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:53.400
<v Speaker 4>how's that even me?</v>

4454
02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Do I ever know that person?</v>

4455
02:13:54.570 --> 02:13:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Like is that really me?</v>

4456
02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Cause I,</v>

4457
02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:56.490
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

4458
02:13:56.490 --> 02:13:58.380
<v Speaker 4>if I see them again I'll be like,</v>

4459
02:13:58.410 --> 02:13:59.280
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

4460
02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:00.031
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

4461
02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:01.950
<v Speaker 4>we had a 10th grade science together.</v>

4462
02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4463
02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>

4464
02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

4465
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:07.290
<v Speaker 4>Like I ran into a guy from my high school like a couple of weeks ago and it was</v>

4466
02:14:07.410 --> 02:14:08.243
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

4467
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:09.270
<v Speaker 4>It was so weird.</v>

4468
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.991
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4469
02:14:09.991 --> 02:14:12.690
<v Speaker 4>he remembered some strange story from English class and I was like,</v>

4470
02:14:12.691 --> 02:14:13.111
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

4471
02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:13.980
<v Speaker 4>you remember that?</v>

4472
02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:14.813
<v Speaker 4>Like how weird.</v>

4473
02:14:14.970 --> 02:14:16.000
<v Speaker 4>And while he was talking me,</v>

4474
02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:16.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4475
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:18.660
<v Speaker 4>is that even really me?</v>

4476
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:19.161
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4477
02:14:19.161 --> 02:14:23.610
<v Speaker 4>cause even really talking about me because I don't have any connection to the</v>

4478
02:14:23.611 --> 02:14:25.500
<v Speaker 4>stuff that he's saying and I understand that he has,</v>

4479
02:14:25.501 --> 02:14:26.430
<v Speaker 4>it's a vague,</v>

4480
02:14:26.730 --> 02:14:30.420
<v Speaker 4>distant ghostlike memory in his mind of some,</v>

4481
02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:35.840
<v Speaker 4>some slide images that he's pieced together that he recognizes as a past</v>

4482
02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:37.440
<v Speaker 4>interaction.</v>

4483
02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:40.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's fucking strange.</v>

4484
02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:43.440
<v Speaker 4>It's super strange to like in,</v>

4485
02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:43.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4486
02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:44.641
<v Speaker 4>50 or 20,</v>

4487
02:14:44.641 --> 02:14:45.241
<v Speaker 4>45,</v>

4488
02:14:45.241 --> 02:14:45.910
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

4489
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:46.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4490
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:50.880
<v Speaker 4>if your body can be replaced one piece at a time,</v>

4491
02:14:51.070 --> 02:14:51.480
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4492
02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:52.680
<v Speaker 4>As time goes on,</v>

4493
02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:55.860
<v Speaker 4>then your body literally you could survive,</v>

4494
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:58.890
<v Speaker 4>but your body is going to be like almost completely deaf.</v>

4495
02:14:58.891 --> 02:14:59.641
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4496
02:14:59.641 --> 02:15:00.061
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

4497
02:15:00.061 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4498
02:15:00.570 --> 02:15:00.950
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4499
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:01.720
<v Speaker 4>the boat,</v>

4500
02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:02.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4501
02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:03.113
<v Speaker 4>analogy,</v>

4502
02:15:03.330 --> 02:15:03.640
<v Speaker 4>what was,</v>

4503
02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:04.500
<v Speaker 4>was it Graham Hancock?</v>

4504
02:15:04.501 --> 02:15:05.820
<v Speaker 4>They use that analogy.</v>

4505
02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:11.220
<v Speaker 4>Somebody uses the analogy of a certain boats that are like really ancient boats</v>

4506
02:15:11.221 --> 02:15:14.100
<v Speaker 4>that are on display in every single piece of them from the original boat has</v>

4507
02:15:14.101 --> 02:15:16.320
<v Speaker 4>been replaced because they rotted away and you're like,</v>

4508
02:15:16.321 --> 02:15:16.531
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4509
02:15:16.531 --> 02:15:17.364
<v Speaker 4>what am I looking at?</v>

4510
02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:18.690
<v Speaker 4>What is this really?</v>

4511
02:15:19.290 --> 02:15:19.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4512
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:21.720
<v Speaker 4>And that's kind of us in.</v>

4513
02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:24.060
<v Speaker 4>And once that becomes a physical thing,</v>

4514
02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:25.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4515
02:15:26.250 --> 02:15:28.050
<v Speaker 4>I met the guy who got his uh,</v>

4516
02:15:28.051 --> 02:15:31.080
<v Speaker 4>arm and his leg a bitten off by a shark.</v>

4517
02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:31.651
<v Speaker 4>You're see,</v>

4518
02:15:31.651 --> 02:15:32.970
<v Speaker 4>that guy's got carbon fiber,</v>

4519
02:15:32.971 --> 02:15:33.804
<v Speaker 4>arms and legs.</v>

4520
02:15:33.930 --> 02:15:35.700
<v Speaker 4>John Joseph brought him to the comedy store.</v>

4521
02:15:35.730 --> 02:15:38.010
<v Speaker 4>I met him at the UFC when you gave him tickets.</v>

4522
02:15:38.070 --> 02:15:38.521
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4523
02:15:38.521 --> 02:15:39.354
<v Speaker 4>shook his hand on,</v>

4524
02:15:39.370 --> 02:15:40.680
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

4525
02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:41.670
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>

4526
02:15:41.670 --> 02:15:42.121
<v Speaker 4>Super,</v>

4527
02:15:42.121 --> 02:15:42.901
<v Speaker 4>Super Nice Guy.</v>

4528
02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:44.100
<v Speaker 4>But he's got this uh,</v>

4529
02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:45.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4530
02:15:45.150 --> 02:15:50.150
<v Speaker 4>let's like a carbon fiber hand and forearm that moves around like,</v>

4531
02:15:50.490 --> 02:15:54.480
<v Speaker 4>like a hand and he shakes your hand and then he walks with no limp.</v>

4532
02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:56.840
<v Speaker 4>He's got this carbon fiber audit.</v>

4533
02:15:56.841 --> 02:15:57.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4534
02:15:57.210 --> 02:15:59.550
<v Speaker 4>I think from the knee down the shark bit his leg off.</v>

4535
02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:01.230
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>

4536
02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:01.661
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4537
02:16:01.661 --> 02:16:01.951
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

4538
02:16:01.951 --> 02:16:02.470
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4539
02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:03.660
<v Speaker 4>you're still a person.</v>

4540
02:16:03.810 --> 02:16:04.643
<v Speaker 4>You're still here.</v>

4541
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:06.540
<v Speaker 4>And what there is,</v>

4542
02:16:06.541 --> 02:16:07.530
<v Speaker 4>there's a gentleman right there,</v>

4543
02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:08.400
<v Speaker 4>Paul de Gelder,</v>

4544
02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:09.270
<v Speaker 4>Paul de Gelder,</v>

4545
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:10.110
<v Speaker 4>Super Nice Guy,</v>

4546
02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:11.340
<v Speaker 4>but is a,</v>

4547
02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:16.400
<v Speaker 4>that is a fake arm that he's got from his arm being chopped off by a fucking</v>

4548
02:16:16.471 --> 02:16:17.304
<v Speaker 4>shark.</v>

4549
02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:21.330
<v Speaker 4>So from a see where it is from his right thigh,</v>

4550
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:25.440
<v Speaker 4>like mid thigh down and his right elbow down,</v>

4551
02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:28.890
<v Speaker 4>all that shit chewed off by a shark and he's still jacked.</v>

4552
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:29.783
<v Speaker 4>Look it up.</v>

4553
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:31.083
<v Speaker 3>No excuses.</v>

4554
02:16:31.150 --> 02:16:33.400
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to keep becoming more biological,</v>

4555
02:16:33.401 --> 02:16:33.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4556
02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:37.490
<v Speaker 4>Well with the real concern is I remember a $6 million man.</v>

4557
02:16:38.210 --> 02:16:39.410
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that television show?</v>

4558
02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:39.700
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4559
02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:40.533
<v Speaker 4>Well you're younger than me.</v>

4560
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:44.300
<v Speaker 4>There was a show called the $6 million man and the $6 million man,</v>

4561
02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:49.130
<v Speaker 4>he had been in some sort of a pilot accident and uh,</v>

4562
02:16:49.131 --> 02:16:49.820
<v Speaker 4>the gentlemen,</v>

4563
02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:50.690
<v Speaker 4>we can rebuild him,</v>

4564
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:51.950
<v Speaker 4>we can make him better than,</v>

4565
02:16:51.951 --> 02:16:53.030
<v Speaker 4>he was better,</v>

4566
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:54.080
<v Speaker 4>stronger,</v>

4567
02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:54.740
<v Speaker 4>faster.</v>

4568
02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:56.120
<v Speaker 4>And they given these bionic parts,</v>

4569
02:16:56.121 --> 02:17:00.260
<v Speaker 4>he gave him a bionic arm and they gave him bionic legs and he could run like 60</v>

4570
02:17:00.261 --> 02:17:01.094
<v Speaker 4>miles an hour.</v>

4571
02:17:01.590 --> 02:17:02.930
<v Speaker 4>You would run like crazy fast.</v>

4572
02:17:02.931 --> 02:17:06.230
<v Speaker 4>And he had these artificial arms and aren't artificial leg and they had a bionic</v>

4573
02:17:06.231 --> 02:17:06.561
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

4574
02:17:06.561 --> 02:17:07.394
<v Speaker 4>same shit,</v>

4575
02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:11.210
<v Speaker 4>except she was hot and she had artificial legs and I think she could see things</v>

4576
02:17:11.211 --> 02:17:13.530
<v Speaker 4>and other people couldn't see like one day.</v>

4577
02:17:13.550 --> 02:17:13.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4578
02:17:13.761 --> 02:17:14.511
<v Speaker 4>that was cool.</v>

4579
02:17:14.511 --> 02:17:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Would you would look at that you're like,</v>

4580
02:17:15.590 --> 02:17:16.161
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

4581
02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:16.371
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4582
02:17:16.371 --> 02:17:18.830
<v Speaker 4>we could do like he got in a fight with big foot on the TV show.</v>

4583
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:19.783
<v Speaker 4>It's really stupid,</v>

4584
02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:24.200
<v Speaker 4>but one day people are going to be given the option.</v>

4585
02:17:24.290 --> 02:17:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to now maybe you want to keep your legs or do you want to get these</v>

4586
02:17:28.251 --> 02:17:29.750
<v Speaker 4>legs that allow you to jump over a building?</v>

4587
02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:35.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious if there's really like superhuman projects that are going on where,</v>

4588
02:17:35.430 --> 02:17:40.320
<v Speaker 3>where people actually can have these abilities that,</v>

4589
02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:41.213
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4590
02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:46.400
<v Speaker 3>we know that with classified information it's just we know what that their stuff</v>

4591
02:17:46.741 --> 02:17:49.770
<v Speaker 3>we don't know that are extraordinary projects.</v>

4592
02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:52.680
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

4593
02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:54.720
<v Speaker 3>this being in the future,</v>

4594
02:17:54.810 --> 02:17:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's a disconnect between the state of technology on the planet</v>

4595
02:17:59.101 --> 02:18:03.450
<v Speaker 3>earth right now with like what the public has access to with what the,</v>

4596
02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:03.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4597
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:08.990
<v Speaker 3>black projects have access to and that is really not cool because it's not fair</v>

4598
02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:17.480
<v Speaker 3>for humanity to not understand what is going on.</v>

4599
02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I think that's true,</v>

4600
02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:23.650
<v Speaker 4>but I also think that most of the state of the art stuff is,</v>

4601
02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:26.080
<v Speaker 4>it's peer reviewed,</v>

4602
02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:26.471
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4603
02:18:26.471 --> 02:18:26.741
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4604
02:18:26.741 --> 02:18:30.220
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different people working on these different technologies like</v>

4605
02:18:30.221 --> 02:18:31.054
<v Speaker 4>cern,</v>

4606
02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:31.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4607
02:18:31.391 --> 02:18:33.670
<v Speaker 4>they're working on the large hadron collider or anything else.</v>

4608
02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:36.010
<v Speaker 4>There's so many different people working on it.</v>

4609
02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:38.740
<v Speaker 4>The people that are the forefront of the technology and let's,</v>

4610
02:18:38.741 --> 02:18:40.960
<v Speaker 4>they're all gobbled up by the dark government.</v>

4611
02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:41.730
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

4612
02:18:41.730 --> 02:18:42.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4613
02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:42.480
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

4614
02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:45.400
<v Speaker 4>they're the people at the head of the line kind of understand where the</v>

4615
02:18:45.401 --> 02:18:48.100
<v Speaker 4>technology is that currently for sure for you.</v>

4616
02:18:48.101 --> 02:18:48.640
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

4617
02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:49.840
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what the fuck's going on,</v>

4618
02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:51.250
<v Speaker 4>but I think you're right.</v>

4619
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I think there's probably some government programs where they scoop up the,</v>

4620
02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:55.131
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4621
02:18:55.131 --> 02:18:55.380
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4622
02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:58.040
<v Speaker 4>the wisest and the brightest and you know,</v>

4623
02:18:58.041 --> 02:18:59.230
<v Speaker 4>like they're got Oppenheimer,</v>

4624
02:18:59.440 --> 02:18:59.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4625
02:18:59.741 --> 02:19:02.410
<v Speaker 4>and got him to develop the Manhattan project.</v>

4626
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:04.690
<v Speaker 4>There's probably some shit going on right now.</v>

4627
02:19:05.210 --> 02:19:06.043
<v Speaker 3>What do you think's happening?</v>

4628
02:19:07.610 --> 02:19:08.031
<v Speaker 3>What do you know,</v>

4629
02:19:08.031 --> 02:19:08.241
<v Speaker 3>Bill?</v>

4630
02:19:08.241 --> 02:19:09.074
<v Speaker 3>Tell me.</v>

4631
02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I want there to be huge freedom of information act reform.</v>

4632
02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

4633
02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:17.570
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

4634
02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:19.910
<v Speaker 3>We know that there are trillions going into the black budget.</v>

4635
02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:21.393
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4636
02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:21.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4637
02:19:21.890 --> 02:19:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Trevor Paglen wrote a cool book called,</v>

4638
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:27.140
<v Speaker 3>I think it was him called blank spots on the map.</v>

4639
02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:28.180
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

4640
02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:29.380
<v Speaker 4>it's just talks a lot about the,</v>

4641
02:19:29.470 --> 02:19:30.440
<v Speaker 4>the black budget.</v>

4642
02:19:30.441 --> 02:19:31.310
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

4643
02:19:31.311 --> 02:19:31.551
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

4644
02:19:31.551 --> 02:19:32.840
<v Speaker 4>so we know it exists.</v>

4645
02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:34.333
<v Speaker 4>We know.</v>

4646
02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:36.373
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4647
02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:37.640
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

4648
02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:39.650
<v Speaker 4>it's holding us back.</v>

4649
02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:43.790
<v Speaker 4>But maybe I'm not saying everything should be shared because what if you have</v>

4650
02:19:43.791 --> 02:19:44.630
<v Speaker 4>like a bio weapon?</v>

4651
02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

4652
02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:45.530
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4653
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:45.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4654
02:19:45.710 --> 02:19:46.850
<v Speaker 4>so we need to understand,</v>

4655
02:19:46.851 --> 02:19:51.230
<v Speaker 4>I think that we need to push the threshold with what the public has access to.</v>

4656
02:19:51.231 --> 02:19:52.970
<v Speaker 4>Like we need to go way deeper.</v>

4657
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:54.020
<v Speaker 4>It's complicated.</v>

4658
02:19:54.021 --> 02:19:54.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4659
02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:54.831
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

4660
02:19:54.831 --> 02:19:55.664
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4661
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.720
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4662
02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:57.500
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>

4663
02:19:57.500 --> 02:19:58.333
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4664
02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:02.060
<v Speaker 4>I really appreciate your perspective and I really appreciate your point of view</v>

4665
02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.910
<v Speaker 4>and I really appreciate your ethics and what you're,</v>

4666
02:20:04.911 --> 02:20:06.500
<v Speaker 4>what you're working towards with minds.</v>

4667
02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:08.270
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to.</v>

4668
02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:11.720
<v Speaker 4>I think it is important and as much as I fuck around and play devil's advocate,</v>

4669
02:20:11.721 --> 02:20:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I do that to try to get to,</v>

4670
02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:13.190
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

4671
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4672
02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:17.060
<v Speaker 4>how you're thinking and why and whether or not you've had these arguments in</v>

4673
02:20:17.061 --> 02:20:17.894
<v Speaker 4>your own mind.</v>

4674
02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:18.651
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4675
02:20:18.651 --> 02:20:19.484
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4676
02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:24.580
<v Speaker 4>I think ultimately I've said this before and I'm don't know if it makes sense</v>

4677
02:20:24.621 --> 02:20:24.981
<v Speaker 4>because again,</v>

4678
02:20:24.981 --> 02:20:26.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that smart.</v>

4679
02:20:26.930 --> 02:20:29.600
<v Speaker 4>I really wonder if there's,</v>

4680
02:20:29.660 --> 02:20:33.560
<v Speaker 4>there's bottlenecks for progress that are going to be that we're going to run</v>

4681
02:20:33.561 --> 02:20:34.394
<v Speaker 4>into.</v>

4682
02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:34.980
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

4683
02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:35.813
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4684
02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:41.420
<v Speaker 4>ultimately information is one of the big ones and information also in a lot of</v>

4685
02:20:43.041 --> 02:20:44.060
<v Speaker 4>ways is money.</v>

4686
02:20:44.690 --> 02:20:45.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4687
02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:45.973
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4688
02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:49.440
<v Speaker 4>when we think of money we're,</v>

4689
02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:53.390
<v Speaker 4>we're thinking of ones and Zeros that are being moved around on bank accounts.</v>

4690
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:55.010
<v Speaker 4>It's data.</v>

4691
02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:55.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4692
02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:59.180
<v Speaker 4>it's attributed to different people and you'd get to do more things because you</v>

4693
02:20:59.181 --> 02:21:01.280
<v Speaker 4>have more of these numbers and more of these things.</v>

4694
02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:02.930
<v Speaker 4>But what is it really?</v>

4695
02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 4>It's not gold based anymore.</v>

4696
02:21:04.641 --> 02:21:05.740
<v Speaker 4>It's not a physical material,</v>

4697
02:21:05.770 --> 02:21:10.770
<v Speaker 4>a material ODG object that you're coveting now it's some weird thing and it's</v>

4698
02:21:11.001 --> 02:21:12.950
<v Speaker 4>kind of like information on a database.</v>

4699
02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:15.980
<v Speaker 4>And what if we get to a certain point in time,</v>

4700
02:21:15.981 --> 02:21:16.151
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

4701
02:21:16.151 --> 02:21:16.550
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4702
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:18.590
<v Speaker 4>I sort of feel like in this weird,</v>

4703
02:21:18.591 --> 02:21:19.131
<v Speaker 4>vague,</v>

4704
02:21:19.131 --> 02:21:22.340
<v Speaker 4>abstract way we're moving towards this with all,</v>

4705
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:25.640
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the things that I want to really step back and wonder about this</v>

4706
02:21:25.641 --> 02:21:27.300
<v Speaker 4>trend towards socialism and,</v>

4707
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:29.360
<v Speaker 4>and social democratic thinking.</v>

4708
02:21:29.361 --> 02:21:30.380
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what that is.</v>

4709
02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:30.690
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

4710
02:21:30.690 --> 02:21:34.130
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think that we're moving towards this idea that,</v>

4711
02:21:34.131 --> 02:21:34.670
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4712
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:34.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4713
02:21:34.821 --> 02:21:39.470
<v Speaker 4>we've got a lot of fucking problems that could be cured if you move some of that</v>

4714
02:21:39.471 --> 02:21:41.540
<v Speaker 4>money around and,</v>

4715
02:21:41.541 --> 02:21:41.870
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4716
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:44.270
<v Speaker 4>but should you be able to move some of that money around?</v>

4717
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:45.260
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

4718
02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:50.260
<v Speaker 4>what happens if that money becomes something different than what if people start</v>

4719
02:21:51.081 --> 02:21:56.081
<v Speaker 4>developing social currency instead of financial currency would have your ability</v>

4720
02:21:57.651 --> 02:22:00.200
<v Speaker 4>to do things was based on how much you actually put in.</v>

4721
02:22:00.201 --> 02:22:00.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4722
02:22:00.381 --> 02:22:01.370
<v Speaker 4>we're assuming,</v>

4723
02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:01.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4724
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:06.200
<v Speaker 4>We assume that the way we do things now where if you want to buy a car,</v>

4725
02:22:06.201 --> 02:22:09.800
<v Speaker 4>you have to have $35,000 that's how much a Mustang costs and you've got to bring</v>

4726
02:22:09.801 --> 02:22:11.090
<v Speaker 4>it to the bank and this and that.</v>

4727
02:22:11.091 --> 02:22:12.440
<v Speaker 4>And you can prove alone.</v>

4728
02:22:12.770 --> 02:22:17.570
<v Speaker 4>But what if we get to a time in the future where it's not these pieces of paper</v>

4729
02:22:17.571 --> 02:22:22.571
<v Speaker 4>that gives you material objects but rather your own actions and deeds provide</v>

4730
02:22:23.241 --> 02:22:27.240
<v Speaker 4>you with social currency that allows you to on vacations or allows you to eat at</v>

4731
02:22:27.241 --> 02:22:27.900
<v Speaker 4>restaurants.</v>

4732
02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:31.380
<v Speaker 4>It allows you to do things and there's this running tally that's not outside of</v>

4733
02:22:31.381 --> 02:22:32.520
<v Speaker 4>the realm of possibility.</v>

4734
02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:33.691
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4735
02:22:33.691 --> 02:22:34.580
<v Speaker 4>I think it really</v>

4736
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:39.670
<v Speaker 3>award systems within everything that we're using are gonna are gonna rise up.</v>

4737
02:22:39.891 --> 02:22:40.341
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

4738
02:22:40.341 --> 02:22:42.620
<v Speaker 3>that's it's what we're already kind of doing.</v>

4739
02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:43.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

4740
02:22:43.041 --> 02:22:45.290
<v Speaker 3>we reward tokens for,</v>

4741
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:46.580
<v Speaker 3>for activity.</v>

4742
02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:51.260
<v Speaker 3>We're going to see that rise up in more things</v>

4743
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.870
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

4744
02:22:51.870 --> 02:22:53.880
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is if we're doing it in,</v>

4745
02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:58.470
<v Speaker 4>if it's a social currency and that your own personal behavior allows you to</v>

4746
02:22:58.471 --> 02:23:00.090
<v Speaker 4>access more freedoms or,</v>

4747
02:23:00.330 --> 02:23:02.610
<v Speaker 4>or more goods or more things,</v>

4748
02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:07.940
<v Speaker 4>it would encourage positive behavior and community based behavior because that</v>

4749
02:23:08.551 --> 02:23:10.110
<v Speaker 4>would be the only way to advance.</v>

4750
02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:10.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4751
02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:13.140
<v Speaker 4>obviously this is a long time down the line,</v>

4752
02:23:13.410 --> 02:23:14.640
<v Speaker 4>but when the first cave man,</v>

4753
02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:15.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4754
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:18.570
<v Speaker 4>traded the first fucking shiny rock for the first spearhead,</v>

4755
02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:19.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4756
02:23:19.231 --> 02:23:22.650
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was that they did that started this whole inevitable trend towards</v>

4757
02:23:22.651 --> 02:23:23.484
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

4758
02:23:23.850 --> 02:23:26.760
<v Speaker 4>This is not something that has to be this way forever.</v>

4759
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:27.541
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4760
02:23:27.541 --> 02:23:31.410
<v Speaker 4>And I wonder when we're looking at the distribution of information,</v>

4761
02:23:31.411 --> 02:23:33.810
<v Speaker 4>which is arguably not arguably,</v>

4762
02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:34.853
<v Speaker 4>it's never,</v>

4763
02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:36.990
<v Speaker 4>never been like what we have today.</v>

4764
02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:41.070
<v Speaker 4>There's never been a time in human history where everyone had so much access to</v>

4765
02:23:41.071 --> 02:23:42.660
<v Speaker 4>information that you used to have to pay for.</v>

4766
02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:44.550
<v Speaker 4>He used to have to go to schools.</v>

4767
02:23:44.551 --> 02:23:48.210
<v Speaker 4>You have to use to have to earn your way to the position where you could open</v>

4768
02:23:48.211 --> 02:23:50.850
<v Speaker 4>the very books that had all this information in it night,</v>

4769
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:51.840
<v Speaker 4>get it off your phone.</v>

4770
02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:53.153
<v Speaker 4>It's instant.</v>

4771
02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:54.060
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

4772
02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:58.110
<v Speaker 4>this is a whole different way of interfacing with information and I think this</v>

4773
02:23:58.111 --> 02:24:00.030
<v Speaker 4>is going to affect higher learning institutes.</v>

4774
02:24:00.031 --> 02:24:01.800
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to affect a lot of different things.</v>

4775
02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:06.600
<v Speaker 4>But I wonder if this all can be applied ultimately some day,</v>

4776
02:24:06.601 --> 02:24:06.991
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>

4777
02:24:06.991 --> 02:24:07.711
<v Speaker 4>In our generation,</v>

4778
02:24:07.711 --> 02:24:12.711
<v Speaker 4>but someday to money that people start using social currency and that social</v>

4779
02:24:14.371 --> 02:24:17.850
<v Speaker 4>currency is going to be almost like we have some sort of a,</v>

4780
02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:20.520
<v Speaker 4>a database of social currency in this country,</v>

4781
02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:21.870
<v Speaker 4>distributed database.</v>

4782
02:24:22.310 --> 02:24:27.310
<v Speaker 3>As long as the government can be running on open systems.</v>

4783
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:29.350
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

4784
02:24:29.350 --> 02:24:30.710
<v Speaker 3>the reason we struggle with,</v>

4785
02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:31.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4786
02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.770
<v Speaker 3>trusting the government to distribute wealth is because it's,</v>

4787
02:24:33.771 --> 02:24:34.670
<v Speaker 3>it's so inefficient.</v>

4788
02:24:34.671 --> 02:24:36.560
<v Speaker 3>We want to be deciding where it goes.</v>

4789
02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:36.761
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4790
02:24:36.761 --> 02:24:38.200
<v Speaker 4>they're also corrupt as fuck.</v>

4791
02:24:39.010 --> 02:24:40.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no,</v>

4792
02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:41.350
<v Speaker 4>no doubt about that.</v>

4793
02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:42.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4794
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:43.450
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the day,</v>

4795
02:24:43.451 --> 02:24:44.950
<v Speaker 4>that's a giant problem period.</v>

4796
02:24:44.951 --> 02:24:49.180
<v Speaker 4>If the people that are deciding what we can and can't do with information or</v>

4797
02:24:49.181 --> 02:24:50.140
<v Speaker 4>also corrupt,</v>

4798
02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:54.820
<v Speaker 4>which it means there's laws that allow them to be corrupt but doesn't mean that</v>

4799
02:24:54.850 --> 02:24:55.900
<v Speaker 4>they're not corrupt.</v>

4800
02:24:57.480 --> 02:24:59.320
<v Speaker 3>I feel like every politician,</v>

4801
02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:02.320
<v Speaker 3>the only politicians that I would support at this point,</v>

4802
02:25:02.410 --> 02:25:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I want to be pulling us in a direction like that is making their own position</v>

4803
02:25:08.321 --> 02:25:09.154
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant.</v>

4804
02:25:09.490 --> 02:25:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Basically building open,</v>

4805
02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:16.920
<v Speaker 3>secure voting systems that allow the planet or the country to decide and vote on</v>

4806
02:25:20.711 --> 02:25:21.520
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing.</v>

4807
02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:21.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4808
02:25:21.791 --> 02:25:22.624
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4809
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:23.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4810
02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I just think that we need more accurate representation of the consciousness of</v>

4811
02:25:32.141 --> 02:25:37.141
<v Speaker 3>the communities and it just shouldn't just be these singular people deciding for</v>

4812
02:25:37.961 --> 02:25:39.330
<v Speaker 3>everybody when we should have,</v>

4813
02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:40.450
<v Speaker 3>we have the tech right.</v>

4814
02:25:40.510 --> 02:25:41.890
<v Speaker 3>And by the time they get in there,</v>

4815
02:25:41.891 --> 02:25:45.730
<v Speaker 3>they're so compromised by the special interest groups that are helping them out</v>

4816
02:25:45.731 --> 02:25:48.430
<v Speaker 3>and all the different people that are contributing to their campaign funds.</v>

4817
02:25:49.390 --> 02:25:50.140
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

4818
02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Do you see anybody like that on the horizon?</v>

4819
02:25:53.380 --> 02:25:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I think that there are not specifically right now,</v>

4820
02:25:57.310 --> 02:25:57.581
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

4821
02:25:57.581 --> 02:26:02.581
<v Speaker 3>I don't see anyone talking about open systems and secure voting and completely</v>

4822
02:26:06.611 --> 02:26:09.730
<v Speaker 3>changing the way that we're making decisions.</v>

4823
02:26:10.650 --> 02:26:12.760
<v Speaker 3>But I think that's probably just because they don't know about it.</v>

4824
02:26:12.761 --> 02:26:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I think there will be a lot of politicians who,</v>

4825
02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:18.730
<v Speaker 3>who would be okay with that or want us to move in that direction.</v>

4826
02:26:18.731 --> 02:26:20.470
<v Speaker 3>But I think we need more technologists,</v>

4827
02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:25.420
<v Speaker 3>scientists in these positions building the things that we're using.</v>

4828
02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:26.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4829
02:26:26.841 --> 02:26:29.600
<v Speaker 4>And with an ethic of freedom.</v>

4830
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4831
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:31.063
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4832
02:26:31.390 --> 02:26:32.223
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

4833
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.450
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4834
02:26:33.450 --> 02:26:34.340

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4836
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:35.503
<v Speaker 4>I really appreciate it.</v>

4837
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.780
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4838
02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:36.140

4840
02:26:38.571 --> 02:26:39.680
<v Speaker 3>how they can check it out.</v>

4841
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:41.203
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're now on Google play.</v>

4849
02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:50.240
<v Speaker 3>We are still in the apple store.</v>

4850
02:26:50.330 --> 02:26:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Google play won't let you in?</v>

4851
02:26:51.470 --> 02:26:51.890
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4852
02:26:51.890 --> 02:26:52.670
<v Speaker 3>How come?</v>

4853
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4854

<v Speaker 3>had issues.</v>

4855
02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:55.940
<v Speaker 3>They're scanning the nipple,</v>

4856
02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:56.900
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

4857
