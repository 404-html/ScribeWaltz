00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.370
Hello freaks,
flux going on.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.550
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.310
Squarespace.
And if you've heard the podcast before,

4
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.670
you've heard us talk about it before,
but in a nutshell,

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.190
as simple as we can put it,
it's the easiest way to make a website.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.100
You could do it on your own and actually make a bad ass website.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.050
Even if you are technologically challenged like myself,
it's just super simple.

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.130
They have it down to like a sort of a point and click type of scenario and they

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.000
have so much confidence in it that they allow you to use it without actually

10
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.040
paying for it.
The idea is like they're,

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.680
they're so confident that it makes a bad ass website.

12
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.230
They'll allow you to make your website and then go,
you know what,

13
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:41.190
this is pretty bad ass.

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.920
And then you give them your credit card information and then you actually buy
it.

15
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.990
Um,
so,
uh,

16
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.440
if you're interested in getting a website made and you don't have the funds to

17
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.530
hire someone to do it,
you honestly can do a professional job with this,

18
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.580
including setting up your own online store,
which used to be like very,

19
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:00.600
very difficult to do.
They also have 24,
seven very fast,
uh,

20
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.140
email support.
If you fuck up,
if you panic,
you can't figure it out,
how to do it.

21
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.710
And once you're done,
it'll work on everything and work on an Ipad,

22
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.040
works on android device.
It's a pretty fucking sweet set up.

23
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.300
Use the code Joe and the number nine and save 20% for a limited time.

24
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.890
So that's squarespace.com.
Use the offer code Joe Nine.

25
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.380
And uh,
it's pretty dope ass,
dope ass,
bad ass.
Cool.

26
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.330
Insert whatever cool adjective you would like.
It's um,
it's excellent.

27
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.680
We enjoy it very much so.

28
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.780
So squarespace.com and the code is Joe and the number nine all together as one

29
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:44.530
word.
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com o.
N N.
I.
T.
Um,

30
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.850
if you haven't been there in a while and,
um,

31
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.540
you haven't seen the primal bells that we've added.
Uh,
we have these,
um,

32
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.550
I got the dude's name and I,
I never had it before,
so I'm,
I must,
uh,

33
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.070
recite homeboy's name here.
Give me one second here to find it.
Um,

34
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.940
these primal bells are these kettle bells that we had designed by an artist.
Um,

35
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.830
his name is fuck is this.
They are really cool.
I just want to give him,

36
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.430
just depend on my bookshelf or something like that.
Scare people and go like,

37
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:15.390
well,
I don't think there's caring.
Anyway,

38
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.660
his name is Steven Shubin junior and uh,

39
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.420
he's a bad ass artist and he did a really cool champ,

40
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.750
a really cool gorilla and now an orangutan.
And uh,

41
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:29.751
the rank ten one is a kind of special because five bucks out of every purchase

42
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.870
goes to a fund foundation that's trying to save orangutans,
orangutans or,
uh,

43
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.700
they're in danger of extinction as are,

44
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.880
I think pretty much all primates that are out in the wild these days.

45
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:46.020
It's tough times out there for primates that aren't as smart as us.

46
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.160
They added the pounds,
but they still kept the,
kept the pool.
They just won't,

47
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.280
they won't let go the pool.
But now at least it'll tell you.
So,
uh,
the gorilla,

48
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:57.720
72 pounds,
he running in tanks 54 pounds and the,
the chimp is 36 pounds.

49
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.120
If you've never done any kind of weights or any kind of exercise before,

50
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.190
if you're like,
you know what,
I gotta do something about this body,

51
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.340
I would suggest start very light.

52
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.660
Do not try to be a hero when you do these exercises.
If you can.

53
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.470
I would also suggest hire a trainer to show you how to do it properly.

54
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.483
And if you can,

55
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.380
if he allows you to videotape the session so that you can sort of check the most

56
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:24.040
important thing when you're doing anything physical is your form and making sure

57
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.220
you don't get hurt for no reason.
You will feel so stupid if you get hurt.

58
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.300
And if you get hurt where you could avoid it.
And I've done it,
trust me.

59
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.200
But the big thing is if you do get hurt,
it takes a long time to heal.

60
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.880
It takes months and you know,

61
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.070
and then you're going to get fat again and then you're going to be mad at

62
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:42.640
yourself.
All of that can be avoided.
So go to [inaudible] Dot Com o.

63
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:47.350
N n I t checkout the new primal kettle bells.
Uh,
we have some,
if you,

64
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.170
if you've,
especially if you've got a little experience in using kettlebells,

65
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.230
we have some amazing DVDs by this guy,
Keith Webber,

66
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.300
extreme kettlebell cardio workout.

67
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.500
We have all sorts of shit for what we call total human optimization,

68
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.150
including supplements,
battle ropes,
medicine balls,
shit like that.
Mine.

69
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.250
Use the code.
Deem Rogan,

70
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:10.930
save yourself 10% off any and all supplements.
All right,
Mack lethal here.

71
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.530

Hit The music.
Let's rock this bitch

72
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.273
experience.

73
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.640
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

74
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.190
<v 0>my friend.
Welcome.
Thank you man.
It's an honor to be here.</v>

75
00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:32.930
I read per author all around.
Cool Guy,
video maker,
all sorts of shit.

76
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.250
Motherfucker,
dude,
Jujitsu practitioner that's above.

77
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.500
How long have you been doing that?
Uh,
I'm going on my third year.

78
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.120
Are you enjoying it?
Loving it.
So that's cool.
What's Jim give a shout out to?

79
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.930
Jenny,
Kansas City Brazilian Jujitsu,
which is,
uh,

80
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.100
under the hand Natto Tavares Association and run by black belt,
Jason Birch.

81
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.670
And then HD MMA,
which is run by Jason.
Hi.
Who just want to fight,
uh,

82
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.880
last week.
Jesse,
you have sounds to dude,
man,
Dad,
uh,

83
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.080
Kansas City is really fucking,
uh,
that's a cool town.

84
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.670
It's like one of the underrated cool town.
Very much so.
In fact,
uh,

85
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.880
the New York Post did an article on the top 10 places in the world that are

86
00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:15.830
underrated and it was number three because it's number one.
Uh,
Istanbul,
Turkey.

87
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.210
Get the fuck Outta here.
That's ridiculous.
Kansas City should be number one.

88
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.280
I America by default should get 50 extra points.
I agree.
Yeah.
Why?

89
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:28.370
Cause I'm rude because I'm a rude American.
Amazing Barbecue was,

90
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:32.330
they're friendly people.
A lot of fountains.
There's a lot of culture there.
Jazz,

91
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.140
the barbecue is huge.
He watched an episode of Anthony Bourdain's show.

92
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.510
Where did he go?
Where did he go?
Do you remember?

93
00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:40.950
I don't remember this in a gas station.
Um,

94
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.600
I think one of them was Oklahoma Joe's.
It's one of the most famous one.

95
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:47.710
Very famous kill us in TV cause this is kind of freaking me out.

96
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.600
It's almost like too much to the left.
Too much distraction is that again,

97
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:54.540
it's a four K it's a four K TV.

98
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.480
It's like four times the resolution of a 10 80 HD TV.

99
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.420
And uh,
yeah they're,
they're,

100
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.060
they have a code for if you want to get a 50 inch t just type in Joe

101
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:09.640
rogan@fourkspecial.com and they get for $999.
Beautiful.
This,

102
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.483
if you haven't seen it,

103
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.560
they just send it to us and we don't know how to use it yet.

104
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:16.990
So it just plays this one four k loop that they have this uh,

105
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.060
amazing loop of high definition moving images.

106
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:22.880
But it's all like Japanese girls in nature and it's like,

107
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.180
it's too much short attention span from my add brain and I fucking,

108
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.720
I fucking jot down.
I agree.
That last episode that we did the whole time,

109
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:32.900
I just found myself staring off into space.
It was freaking me out.

110
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:37.901
I love the fact that four k shit is becoming consumer stuff though because once

111
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.680
the camera's getting in the hands of the people,

112
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:42.470
we're going to be able to make our own fucking feature length films that look

113
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:43.670
like the Shit at the movie theater.

114
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.970
There's a weird thing that happens with video as opposed to film that all a lot

115
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:53.210
of people don't like and that it makes you see everything.

116
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.290
You see the background,

117
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:59.000
you see the foreground like it's not like it's a weird kind of quality to

118
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:01.730
watching it and people go,
oh it makes it look fake,

119
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.040
but honestly film looks fake.
Yeah,
that looks like real life.
Right?

120
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.891
Like that video thing.

121
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:12.680
It looks like we're just not used to that and four k and that kind of shit is

122
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:17.681
going to be like super duper high definition detail and galaxy note three has

123
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:22.070
four k they just announced it.
It comes out in like two weeks or,
yeah,

124
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.150
we were just talking about that.

125
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.550
Weren't we talking about that on the podcast yet?

126
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.370
But we're going to be able to just go to like a show film shit and put it on

127
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:33.350
that TV hearted.
Do it off of a phone.
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.
Insane.

128
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.090
That's one problem with apple man.

129
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.410
They're fucking slack and they're so far behind when it comes to screen size,

130
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.490
like we're testing out new screen sizes.
What does it,
2009 you fuck heads.

131
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.090
Are you crazy?
Yeah.
They just jumped up.

132
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.490
They should have jumped on all of this four k all this like a letting allowing

133
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:52.910
Samsung and the companies like this to come out with this kind of mind blowing

134
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.550
shit.
Wayne advanced the style actually they had us,

135
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.630
they had a fucking big thing that you would carry around with a stylist way back

136
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:02.360
in the nineties do you remember that?
Yeah.
What was that called?

137
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:06.580
Like the Apple Queef or something.
It was something really dumb like tier,

138
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.440
I think it had like a name.
It wasn't like a Macintosh,

139
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:15.980
but like something along those lines and it was a,

140
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.840
it was like they had a stylist.
Newton.
Newton.
Yeah.

141
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.140
Can you draw on it too?
Yeah.

142
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.200
When I first came to Hollywood,
I was walking around with this executive,
um,

143
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.070
he,
uh,

144
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.700
was showing me around Disney and he had one of those bad boys and he was so

145
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:38.600
happy with it and I was like,
this is so awkward.
Like you came that around,

146
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.630
but it was pretty dope.
It was pretty star Trek.
I was like,
oh,

147
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.740
that's it right there.

148
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.180
And apparently it hooked up to a keyboard and a stylist or you could attach a

149
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:51.210
keyboard to it somehow or another fucking insane.
Yeah.

150
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.230
Those are probably worth money today or oh yeah.
Yeah.

151
00:08:55.231 --> 00:08:57.870
I think that it goes for like thousands,
thousands of dollars.
Wow.

152
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:02.130
For like just geeks who love him,
like framed up in their house smelling them.

153
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.700
I would just smell it for an hour.
Do I have to like hide this logo?
No,
no wheat,

154
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.630
that stuff.
That Coco Cafe,
they sent it to us.
Oh good.
Oh good.
They're bad ass.

155
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.830
It's the c two o and coconut cafe.
Those guys.
Okay.
Coco cafe.

156
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.190
Coco cafe is dope because it's got,
um,
a little bit of notice.

157
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:20.580
There's a rapper here.
I've started to use wrap colloquium.
Nope.

158
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.210
What did you like your like Quentin Tarantino and black.
Exactly.

159
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.290
Have you ever seen some of that?
What Quentin Tarantino talking to black people?

160
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.090
No.
Oh my goodness.
What is it?
A youtube thing?
Ah,
yes.
Quentin Tarantino,

161
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.840
who is my favorite director and nine to him,
he's my favorite artist.

162
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.870
I mean really bottom line artists.
I'm not shitting on him in any way,

163
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.530
shape or form,
but he's,
he's obviously a crazy person and that's okay.

164
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.120
Most of my best friends are crazy,

165
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.470
but his crazy manifests itself in the fact that some sort of a strange
chameleon,

166
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.920
like I heard him on the Howard stern show and he almost sounded like he was gay.

167
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.370
It's weird.
It's like a feminine,
and this is not saying that Howard's cab,

168
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.170
I never would insult how Bridgestone ever,
but he sounded like almost a feminine.

169
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.350
And then you hear him on the Jamie Foxx show and all of a sudden he was plaque

170
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.101
and I was like,

171
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:12.090
this is really weird because he's hanging out with Jamie Foxx doing radio with

172
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:16.860
Jamie Foxx and he's talking so black,
like so ridiculous.
Well,

173
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:18.320
this is,
I'm going to show you an example.
Oh,

174
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.880
<v 2>it's
really uncomfortable.
We're going to have</v>

175
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.890
<v 3>to get like something we can show the contrast quoted movies in Hollywood were</v>

176
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.480
just hanging out with this black guy.

177
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:40.290
What is the most famous like Yo,
your favorite line from pop fiction?
Uh,

178
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.610
I think probably the most famous line is I'm going to get moody,
but Uis

179
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.030
big says it gets me that's way crazier.

180
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.990
Your fans or pleasing the critics for you?
Oh,

181
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:59.730
interesting question actually.
Oh,
um,
he like almost fucking it up.

182
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.560
I want to,
I want to please my fans.

183
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.700
I don't want to please the critics that I'm a fans,
uh,
the critics,
EMA fans,

184
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.660
I don't give a damn.
I mean,
he's making shit fine.

185
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.080
It's insanity where he would quit if you see him

186
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.370
<v 0>do other interviews where he talks to regular media people like on CNN or Fox</v>

187
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.640
News and none of us ever,
well he almost broke character at first.
He,
he kinda,

188
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:25.710
he was kinda getting into his gay voice and then he went,
oh,

189
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.710
it dropped it a little deeper.
Well,

190
00:11:27.711 --> 00:11:30.560
I think a guy who's that good at making movies,

191
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:35.420
he's that good at capturing human drama.
Right.
He must be just like a sponge,

192
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.021
you know,

193
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:39.240
so she just fits in the mirror and just goes through a Rolodex of characters.

194
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.470
Probably shouldn't be.
Yeah.
Or a better guy looked at.

195
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.300
It's hard for him to differentiate between,
you know,

196
00:11:44.301 --> 00:11:49.070
who he is and who he's talking to.
Didn't he grow up in ingle in Inglewood,
right?

197
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.980
Yeah.
He grew up in,
in the hood.
Why knowledge.
And his thing was when

198
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.200
<v 4>he was younger,
there was a movie theater,</v>

199
00:11:56.201 --> 00:11:59.980
which he now owns and I believe it's in Inglewood and part of the,

200
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.920
like a rundown part of Inglewood and all he did,

201
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.130
his mom would just send him to the theater and all he did was watch

202
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:10.810
blaxploitation films when he was like six years old over and over.

203
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:14.770
So they just played Kung Fu movies and blaxploitation films at this theater.

204
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.150
And that's all he did.
And that's why he,

205
00:12:17.151 --> 00:12:20.990
he like has cooperated that kind of style.
And it's,

206
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.640
it's very fascinating how he kind of regurgitates it into his films.

207
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.530
But he relates,
he on a very deep level relates to black people.

208
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:33.130
I believe.
I believe it.
I believe it.

209
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.700
And [inaudible] name is Jerome and pretend I'm not criticizing him.

210
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.960
I was obviously goofing on him,
but I,

211
00:12:38.961 --> 00:12:43.961
I completely understand that it is probably the very particular type of

212
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.910
weirdness that you get by being so,
uh,

213
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.500
so like in tune to other people's behavior.

214
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.190
It's almost like you can't differentiate between himself and who he's talking
to.

215
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.270
He's talking to someone,
he becomes like them.
Right.
You know,
it's weird.
Well,

216
00:12:58.271 --> 00:12:59.110
there might be like,

217
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.820
it might even be a mechanism for him to process emotions or something like,

218
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.910
if that makes sense.

219
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:07.570
Like maybe there was like a certain character in some of these old

220
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:10.570
blaxploitation films that when he would talk a certain way,

221
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:12.880
he felt like he could convey what he was feeling.

222
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:15.630
So he might adopt that in order to do that himself.
Right?

223
00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:17.860
Like it's almost like when he's talking to Howard Stern,

224
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:22.600
like he was being like very submissive,
submissive to the king,
you know,

225
00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:26.080
and then he was talking to Jamie Foxx is let them know dog,

226
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:31.690
I'm one of the brothers boy.
So,
um,
you know,
whatever it is that makes him,

227
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:33.910
that guy,
you know,
also makes him do that.

228
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.080
But I'm really concerned about him quitting though because,
well,

229
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:43.081
he recently stated that the way that they display films and movie theaters now

230
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:47.470
as quote unquote television in public because they don't show film anymore.

231
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:48.670
It's just all digital.

232
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.290
And he says he did not sign up to do this and he's considering fucking quitting,

233
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.350
just walking on the whole thing,
which would be terrible.

234
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.660
That would be a devastating blow to all of us.

235
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:01.660
And I don't even think people grasp that.
That's interesting.
So he,

236
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.750
the medium is very important to him.
Not just he still,

237
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.130
he films and film.
I mean that's,
he uses tons of film,

238
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:12.640
refuses to switch over,
refuses to adapt.
That's how we came up.

239
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:15.520
And they let them do it because they have to because people see his movies
still.

240
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.820
I would wonder why,
what that a,
what the reasoning is

241
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.150
<v 5>film.
It's a lot cheaper.
I did,
but that was more expensive.
It was now,</v>

242
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.300
but now digital is cheaper.
Really?
Yeah.

243
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.200
Armeen w wait films more cheaper because no one's using it.
So it's cheaper too.

244
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.340
But isn't it still very expensive to digitize all the film and go through that

245
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.880
arduous process of on the foot yet?
You would think so,
right?

246
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.690
As soon as it has to be.
Yeah.
I don't know.
We had Davey on,
uh,
he's doing,

247
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.260
he did a,
he used to be on that show that I did and he's,

248
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.470
they did something with phones.
Yeah.
And he did something with that Vice.

249
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.980
He did a short film that was in a,
a Sundance and

250
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.310
<v 0>they said that they used film because it was cheaper to film on nowadays than</v>

251
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:59.930
using like a really high end digital camera.
That's interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.

252
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:02.540
Well I,
like we were saying like,
it definitely looks different.

253
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.080
Like if you film like you could make a cool film was like really good actors,

254
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:10.410
but to do it on like one of those regular VHS cameras.
Oh yeah.
Fuck.

255
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.360
Even if you had good angles,
it would look too weird.

256
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:16.830
It would look too Mexican soap opera.
You know,

257
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.530
it's a weird thing that's very difficult to describe when you watch like a

258
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:26.420
Mexican soap opera.
I don't watch many of those,
but I will say that you like,

259
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.350
you want that kind of glossy film look,
it just,

260
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.740
it conveys a different message.
I don't know,
like the,

261
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.590
those consumer cam quarters,
they're just,
you know,

262
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.230
everybody had one when they were a kid and they tried to make fucking short

263
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:41.960
films like me and my friends did,
and they just looked like shit.

264
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.900
You could never quite capture the life that you wanted to.

265
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.160
Also a weird thing that it's kind of been established that visual quality,

266
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:50.690
the visual quality of film.

267
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:53.480
It's like what we'd go to expect when we sit in a movie theater where I want to

268
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:58.370
see a film.
Right now I'm getting into watching a lot of older movies lately,

269
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.020
like a,
I watched the Steve McQueen movie lamonds the other day.

270
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.750
I never seen the Monza.
Oh Man.
It's a,

271
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:09.290
it's really interesting because it's almost like a snapshot of the time.

272
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.450
It's not just a film.

273
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.920
It's almost like it's a film that shows you how people lived back then,

274
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.980
like how they walked around and acted.
Because a lot of the movie,

275
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:22.790
like the first 10 minutes of the movie has no dialogue,
at least 10 minutes.

276
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.660
What's the,
like,
what's the setup of the movie where it's about race car drivers?

277
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.400
Steve McQueen's a race car driver and there's another dude,

278
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.720
I don't want to say that.
I can't commit to saying I've seen it,

279
00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:35.090
but it sounds more familiar now.
I couldn't finish it.

280
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.740
I watched it for a little while.
A lot of old films are hard to fucking finish,

281
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.590
man.
I give up on them.
Like I try to always be cool and be like,
oh,

282
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.381
I'm going to watch you know,

283
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:47.150
this fucking old 1972 French movie and then I pop it in and it's just do it five

284
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:50.610
minutes in asleep.
I mean there's something to be said about modern stem.

285
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.880
It was a little better,
you know?
Yeah.

286
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.420
There's some interesting shit that was done.
Like,
uh,

287
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.970
I remember enjoying who's afraid of Virginia Woolf,
which is uh,

288
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.270
basically all I think all takes place in one house.
You know,

289
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:05.540
it's just a conversation between a bunch of people and um,

290
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.640
that's like some old shit.
The Hustler,

291
00:17:07.641 --> 00:17:10.720
I'll still watch the hustle of the hustler.
I'll still watch that watch you end.

292
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.060
Right.
That's a good one though because I like billiards as well.

293
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.230
[inaudible] and watching that that all take place and like how many hours do

294
00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:21.890
they play for the,
on the first fucking where there the first confrontation?

295
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:26.840
Like three days or something like that.
It's like almost two days.
It's just,

296
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.110
there's something epic about it,
but it's,
it's,
that's a good one.

297
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.010
And a lot of those Paul Newman films are exceptions like Hud.

298
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.680
That's another one I like.
Cool Hand Luke.
That's another one.

299
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.000
That was early one was a bad mother fucker.
Very bad motherfucker.
He Salad.

300
00:17:40.001 --> 00:17:43.520
He was barely made any lemons.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean,

301
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:46.880
think about the shitty movies at Paul Newman made.
I,
I really can't.

302
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:50.010
I can't come up with one and I can't come up with,
I don't,

303
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:53.330
I'm not familiar enough with his entire catalog.
I remember still loaned.

304
00:17:53.331 --> 00:17:58.250
Did that comedy movie with his mother.
Oh,
it was a momma from the train.
Yeah,

305
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.240
I know.
That was another one.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This was,
um,
what was it called?
A,

306
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:07.110
this is going to drive me fucking nuts.
Um,
oh.

307
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:08.271
<v 5>And where's it at?</v>

308
00:18:08.271 --> 00:18:10.820
The same woman that was in golden girls that played the old woman,

309
00:18:10.821 --> 00:18:11.900
but she had her brown hair.

310
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.200
<v 0>Oh,
this is going to drive me nuts.
I don't know your Old Lady Trivia question.</v>

311
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.250
How do you know that?
I don't know.
It seems like a reminder.
Yeah,

312
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.760
we'll let's just look up Stallone.
Stallone.
What's it like costs?
Uh,

313
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.550
Oscar.
It was,
it was Oscar.
Oscar was one.

314
00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.820
Let's see.
That's the one that I'm thinking of.
Yeah.

315
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.260
Well he definitely had one called Oscar.

316
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.850
That's not the one I was thinking you were thinking of fuckers momma from the

317
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:42.684
train,

318
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.950
<v 5>but it wasn't throw momma from trying to throw my arms for train.</v>

319
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.680
Was that old gross lady from like Goonies or something like that?
Yeah.

320
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:52.040
<v 0>Oh the that or my mom will shoot stop or my mom will shoot.
Okay.</v>

321
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.110
So he did two comedies in a row.

322
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.260
He did Oscar and then he did stop or my mom will shoot.

323
00:18:57.261 --> 00:19:01.130
That's how retarded people were in the nineties so like,
you know what,

324
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.820
forget all these great comedians we have.
We need to get stood alone up there.

325
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:05.950
They just kept giving him money.

326
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.650
<v 5>My Old Lady Trivia,
look at this.
It was the old lady,</v>

327
00:19:08.651 --> 00:19:12.730
Estelle Getty from golden girls with brown hair.

328
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.460
That's so crazy.
And look at him.
He's like,

329
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.910
<v 7>Ma can't believe we are doing,
what are you doing?</v>

330
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.870
Mild that gun can't even leave you alone for a second.

331
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.720
<v 0>Look at the look on his face,
man.
Oh</v>

332
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.470
<v 7>I can't believe this.
Look a little my gone look.
A big yours is</v>

333
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.560
<v 0>sign.
I think.
Has it been confirmed or or like,</v>

334
00:19:33.561 --> 00:19:38.561
like completely confirmed that he actually started out doing porn cause that's a

335
00:19:38.841 --> 00:19:43.340
real,
yeah,
no,
he did a movie you did like,
what was it like?
Oh,
so it was softcore.

336
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.960
Yeah,
so he wasn't like laying pipe on film or anything.
So it might've been,

337
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.230
might've been laying pipe,
but I'm pretty sure they didn't show it.
If he was,

338
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.180
I think it was like an angle thing.
Okay.

339
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.580
And they wanted to sell it to them for $1 million.
It was like,

340
00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:57.920
well let me give you 10 cents a piece of shit.

341
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.540
<v 7>Well it's got a garden.</v>

342
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.980
<v 0>He's like five,
two and then he,
no he's not,
he's not.
Everybody says that.</v>

343
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.940
Everybody said,
people always say that about Tom Cruise.
I'm I matched alone.

344
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.330
Maybe he had some shit in his shoes but I'm five eight and he was taller than
me.

345
00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:20.050
He was calling me.
I thought he had to stand on a unleased forum in rocky.

346
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.720
That's the other rumor that when he fought Apollo creed,

347
00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.700
they had him stand on a platform.
You know,

348
00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.670
I don't think Carl weathers is very tall.
Really?
No,

349
00:20:27.671 --> 00:20:30.970
they there couldn't have had them stand on a platform because then you would see

350
00:20:30.971 --> 00:20:33.310
his feet because he was in a cage.

351
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.270
But I as far as I mean a a ring rather to my knowledge they allowed in those

352
00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:40.000
shots are from the waist up because Carl weathers is six.

353
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:44.830
Two is listed that he's six two and Stallone was,
if I had to guess,

354
00:20:44.831 --> 00:20:49.650
I would say five 11 five,
10 dudes where lifts in their shoes.
You never know.

355
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.620
Right.
You know,
and they're a website called how tall is still out or is that,

356
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.520
how tall is the low?
What a web,
how many hits they get a day.
There was like a,

357
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:01.720
how tall is Arnold and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Dot.
One of them either Stallone,

358
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.710
Tom Cruise or on Arnold Schwarzenegger has a website dedicated to finding out

359
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:09.040
exactly how tall they are.
Probably Tom Cruise because Tom Cruise,

360
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:14.100
when he did that movie with Brad Pitt did have like a setup where he was like on

361
00:21:14.221 --> 00:21:17.170
an elevated floor,
whereas they would walk their path.

362
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:24.250
Yeah.
Well he played,
uh,
and I don't think that was necessary,

363
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:29.050
but in his mind the character had to be commensurate with Brad Pitt's character.

364
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.430
Right.
You know,
Brad Pitt's character was tall interview with the vampire.
Yeah.

365
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.140
Yeah.
Which was,
you know,

366
00:21:35.141 --> 00:21:39.040
I thought like the best role he ever played when he was fucking amazing.

367
00:21:39.041 --> 00:21:42.700
And Tom Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt,
Tom Cruise,
he fucking nailed it.
I mean,

368
00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:45.610
he's a great actor.
He might do a lot of cheese movies,

369
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.430
but it's got mother [inaudible],
he's got some good ones.

370
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:52.780
I really liked eyes wide shut.
I,
I'm one of the few fans of that movie.

371
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.990
Is there 10 pictures of Tom Cruise being tall?

372
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Like where they've had them like on like,
you know,
so yeah.

373
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:03.910
Appears total understand that why the appears tall.
They have him appearing tall.

374
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:07.020
He's five seven.
She's actually five eight and he's still taller than her almost.

375
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:09.840
Yeah,
but how do they know how to is 5 cent?
How do they know that that's,

376
00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.620
that's not,
he's not actually taller.

377
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.770
Yeah.
But see
I don't budge.
I don't either.

378
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.110
I think this is bullshit.
I got to be,

379
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.740
don't go back to the one would go back to the one was filled.

380
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:31.360
It was with college humor.
Phillip Seymour Hoffman is like six three six.

381
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.570
But that he wasn't even in that one sense.
Yeah,
because he was,

382
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.140
and this guy's Paris cause it's,
no,
it's cause it's mission impossible.

383
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:43.141
He wasn't this guy that's Oh one was a joke when it disguises Phillip Seymour

384
00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.053
Hoffman.
Yeah.

385
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.190
That was a mass that you've never seen any of the mission impossibles with Tom.

386
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.190
They're rough.
Yeah.
I love to watch,
when you see a guy like Phillips,

387
00:22:52.191 --> 00:22:56.070
he hoffmore in and you're like,
man,
I really suck shit.

388
00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.820
He does too much of that shit,
man.
And he doesn't fucking half too.
I bet he does,

389
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.400
but he's got a mortgage.
You know,
you want to go see the movies,

390
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.800
they want to put him in every movie at this point.

391
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.310
I mean there's not a fucking movie where he doesn't have some sort of weird role

392
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.170
method actory role.
You know,
he's awesome.
He's the best.
He played Truman Capote,

393
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:17.080
Ian,
he's fucking,
he's six two and Truman Capote.
He was like five,

394
00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:20.470
five wasn't real and he spent as far,
as far as I know,

395
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:24.460
he spent I think like a year and a half and never broke character.

396
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.030
And his real life always talked like Truman Capote's that's so gross.

397
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.710
It's fucking,
those people needed to help.

398
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.020
Daniel Day Lewis sleeping outside when he made last of the Mohicans.

399
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:37.930
You slept in a fucking 10.
I don't know if that helped us performance,

400
00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:39.220
but whatever.
Yet.

401
00:23:39.221 --> 00:23:43.660
Daniel Day Lewis was a boxer for a whole year for when he played that a Irish,

402
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.990
the IRA guy,
and he was a boxer.

403
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.400
He looked like rather good and that's really good.
Yeah,
it was really good.
Yeah.

404
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.710
I think he looked like he was the best as far as actors portraying boxers.

405
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.920
It was the most accurate like non boxer is trying to cross over and like not

406
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:04.100
Marky mark or fucking Sylvester Stallone or anybody like yeah we'll get,

407
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:07.380
they say that Marky mark has some professional boxing experience but right.

408
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:08.840
There's a,
there's a,

409
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.980
there's a way that people throw punches when no one's ever punched them.
Right.

410
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.570
And there's a way that people throw punches when they've actually known how to

411
00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:18.510
box and they're totally different.
The way that people throw punches when they,

412
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.890
they not worried about being punched back.
They have this open wide,

413
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:26.450
I'm fucking going to kill bill.
Where as if you watched Daniel Day Lewis,

414
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:30.360
he put through punches like a boxer getting punched.
Exactly.

415
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.860
Looking for openings is guard when tight.
Some like intense sparring point.

416
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.320
Oh he did.
He lived as a boxer for like a year.
Dude.
He's fucking nuts.

417
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:42.590
So you can so easily like getting like wake up at four in the morning and John

418
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.480
[inaudible] and it was an excellent,

419
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.210
I don't think anybody really drinks I eggs anymore cause that's just another

420
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:50.480
thing that was just out.
I think you could get,
you get really sick.
Yeah.

421
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:54.880
You can get fucking salmonella from it,
right Simon?
I think.
Yeah,
you can do it.

422
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.750
Yeah.
There's a lot of fucking weird shit and eating raw animal flesh.
Yeah.

423
00:24:58.751 --> 00:25:01.820
It's not a good idea.
Yeah.
Can you get trick analysis?
No,

424
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:04.640
that's only from predators,
right?
Are Scavengers.

425
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.320
<v 5>It's Vegan cheese.
Good for you.</v>

426
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.830
I had a lot of vegan cheese the other day and it did not digest right.

427
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:10.940
Like it really fucked me up.

428
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.570
<v 0>Depends on who's making it and what they're using to make it with.</v>

429
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.550
I think a lot of them when you have vegan cheese on things,
they use that.
Um,

430
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.410
what is it called?
Yeast
nutritional yeast.

431
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.960
I think it's called,
but I heard that stuff's not very good for you.

432
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.710
<v 5>Yeah,
it came out like fireballs,
like undigested fireballs,
a blob.</v>

433
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.573
It was like astro.

434
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.510
<v 0>Well,
the rest of the best,
uh,
cheese for you,</v>

435
00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:39.340
apparently the easiest digest is non homogenized pasteurized cheese that you get

436
00:25:39.341 --> 00:25:40.174
in Europe.

437
00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.300
They have a completely different kind of cheese because they don't have to

438
00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:46.900
pasteurize and the [inaudible] their milk.
So if you have cheese,

439
00:25:46.901 --> 00:25:48.640
it's made with a raw milk.
It's like,

440
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.370
it's got a lot of different enzymes and different qualities to it.

441
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.290
Apparently it tastes a lot better too.
Yeah.

442
00:25:53.291 --> 00:25:55.320
Everything I'm gonna fucking cheese of stuff or no,

443
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.990
we were talking about Daniel Day Lewis eggs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can't trick analysis.

444
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.780
And he's a weird one trick analysis.

445
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:06.040
A 90% of all cases of tricking osis come from people eating bear meat.

446
00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.830
I don't know what,
what,
what is tricky though?

447
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.030
Because I don't know what that chicken house,
this is what they always worry,

448
00:26:10.031 --> 00:26:14.260
you always worry about getting from pork and it's uh,
I've had tricky noses.

449
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:19.110
You have it was traveler's diarrhea,
is that that the same thing or,

450
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.840
I don't think so.
I was on my ass for like a week and a half.

451
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.840
It was fucking awful.
I hate a bratwurst and was,

452
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:31.120
I'm not like exaggerating traveler's diarrhea.
See if it's chicken houses,

453
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.180
because if it is,
I've had it and it's fucking miserable.

454
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.510
Digifit to go on pedialyte and like just when I was after,

455
00:26:37.511 --> 00:26:40.750
after actually I got to the point where I checked myself into the hospital and

456
00:26:40.751 --> 00:26:44.550
they put me in an ivy because I was so on fluid.
Dude,

457
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:49.350
no exaggeration.
I would go to the bathroom a hundred times a day.

458
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.020
I mean it got to the point where I would just stay in there because my body was

459
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:55.230
trying to push it out.
I've been there,
but now for a week it was four days,

460
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.460
so fucking gnarly,
man.
It was terrible.
Terrible.

461
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.840
I had to get like this very sensitive aloe vera toilet paper because I was just

462
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:09.150
fraud.
Here's what it is.
Td or traveler's diarrhea.
You have TD.

463
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:13.620
Oh,
thank God you abbreviated it.
I would have been offended by the word diarrhea.

464
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.510
So the most common illness affecting travelers each year between 20 to 50% of

465
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:22.530
international travelers and estimated 10 million persons develop diarrhea.

466
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:27.030
The onset of TD usually occurs within the first week of travel,
but blah,
blah,

467
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:30.990
blah,
blah,
blah.
High risks.
As nations are developing countries,
Latin America,

468
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:34.210
Africa,
the Middle East and Asia and funny,
the Middle East,

469
00:27:34.211 --> 00:27:36.120
they call it developing country.

470
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.550
Is this from water or is this from the like the meat that they uh,
or her.

471
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.690
Y'All show,
I'll show.
It doesn't really say here.
You still use toilet paper.

472
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.340
I just use wet wipes.
Toilet paper to flush those wet wipes.
I do

473
00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.270
clog up your toilet.
I know we've talked about this,

474
00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:56.310
but I've been doing it for like 10 years,
seven years.

475
00:27:56.311 --> 00:27:58.980
The other thing is I travel and tour a lot so I don't,

476
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.250
I can never think to get him.
I always forget them if I,
if I do,

477
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.820
I mean I like him.
I get it.
You got to throw them away and not flush them.

478
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.030
They feel much better.
I mean if you're in a hotel and you don't give a fuck in,

479
00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:11.700
you want to be an asshole,
flush them.
But trust me,
dude,

480
00:28:11.701 --> 00:28:14.280
they're going to come back to haunt you or whoever he owns your house.

481
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:17.140
That's the real problem.
If you don't own your house,
you're like,
who cares?

482
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.790
Damage the plumbing in your house on it.
Like no,

483
00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:25.440
not necessarily with all these stinky butt wipes it next to your toilet.

484
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.690
It's like a little cat litter box for you.
That's what it is.

485
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:33.030
It's a little box for you.
Lord have mercy.
Um,
I have a bad day.
Oh,

486
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.200
I cleaned my but like a gentleman so I could probably put a garden hose in
there.

487
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.560
I'm going to install one of those a day toilets here.
I know you have one.

488
00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:44.820
I just have to bring it in to what causes traveler's diarrhea.
Diarrhea.
Okay.

489
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:46.800
Infectious agents are the primary cause.

490
00:28:46.801 --> 00:28:50.430
Bacterial and end tow pathogens.

491
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.370
Cause approximately 80% of the diseases of the cases,

492
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.150
most common causative agent isolated in countries surveyed has been and to row

493
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:05.160
oxygenic Asher,
a Shia Kolai.
Hmm.

494
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.140
Type of Kolai.
Yeah.
Fuck those little assholes.
It's not fun.

495
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.010
I'm sure.
So how'd they get rid of it?
They gave me is down the pipe.
Yeah,

496
00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:16.470
they gave me some medicine and it and it cleared it out.

497
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:20.310
But the Jack Your your intestinal flora for like a long time but I don't know.

498
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.600
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Um,
when you,
uh,

499
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.150
look healthy people have a certain amount of like see this shit.

500
00:29:27.151 --> 00:29:30.430
I drink Kombucha.
You ever had any of us know?
I've seen it.

501
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.310
So it's a probiotic drink and it actually has live organisms that you're

502
00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:40.311
digesting and a live organisms like I'm just in much in the same way that yogurt

503
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:43.820
has acid awfulness,
which is milk culture cultures.

504
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.130
When you have live bacteria that you ingest or probiotics,

505
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.890
it actually helps fight off diseases and helps,
uh,

506
00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.560
it can actually regulate your mood.
It makes your,

507
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.230
your immune system far stronger.
Really?
Yeah.

508
00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:01.410
They say that the acidophilus bacteria that the staff was flora rather actually

509
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:06.160
fights off.
Like when you contact like something with your hands,

510
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:10.300
the acidophilus flora is an aggressive flora and it's on your skin and it

511
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:13.660
actually will keep other things from infecting you as easily.

512
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.550
Do you think that's the next raw egg though?

513
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.200
Like in like 10 years are going to be like,
yeah,

514
00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:21.040
he was drinking bacteria for awhile while yeah,
I mean,
no,
no,
no.

515
00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:24.670
Because your body's filled with bacteria.
That's your whole body.

516
00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:28.240
Your body needs bacteria for everything needs bacteria for digestion.

517
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:30.850
These bacteria to,
I mean it's,
you're you,
you're an,

518
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.100
you're an entire ecosystem of bacteria.

519
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.520
There's more eco lie living in your gut than they've ever been people ever.

520
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.180
And you have to have that.
Not only do you have to have that,
you have to have a,

521
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.180
a series of different kinds of bacteria inside of you.

522
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.260
So when you take antibiotics,
if you take antibiotics on a long scale,

523
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.790
like if you take like some hardcore shit,
they tell you,

524
00:30:49.791 --> 00:30:52.540
you always take acidophilus when you were recovering from that,

525
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.290
they want you to take in healthy bacteria and try to repopulate your gut.

526
00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.270
Like we have this I isolated idea of the human body that it's just a one,

527
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.830
but it's,
it's an ecosystem.

528
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:07.480
Like your body relies on a bunch of different shit to stay alive in you.

529
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.740
A fucking Louie.
It's kind of weird.
Yeah,
it's very weird.
But this stuff's big.

530
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:16.630
This,
this a Kombucha and that regulates the intestinal flora.
Again,
sick man.

531
00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.240
It's incredible how well it works.
Keep me from getting sick.

532
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.570
I travel a lot and I almost never get sick.
Yeah,
so do,

533
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:26.680
I mean I found that just washing my hands and taking multivitamins keeps me from

534
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:28.960
getting sick.
That's a big one.
Washing the hands.

535
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.030
The hands are the worst man because you,

536
00:31:31.031 --> 00:31:34.600
you shake so many people's hands as I'm sure you do with your fans and stuff and

537
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:38.150
you don't want to be a dick.
And then the worst is if you rubbed your iron,

538
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.060
knows you're fucked.
Well,

539
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:43.180
I also think it's good for your immune system is shaped that many people's
hands.

540
00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.960
I think you can get all that bacteria cause your immune system something to do.

541
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.500
I think your body gets used to being around other people.
They've,

542
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.590
they've shown that people who grow up in households where the parents are like

543
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:55.780
really obsessed with cleaning those,

544
00:31:55.781 --> 00:31:59.590
those kids a lot of times develop allergies easier than kids who grew up in a

545
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:02.110
house with like two cats and two dogs.

546
00:32:02.111 --> 00:32:06.820
And as usual folks have done no testing any of these theories,

547
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.790
but I'm throwing out and they make sense to me.

548
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.620
I think that it's true because there's a lot,

549
00:32:11.621 --> 00:32:13.150
I'm not sure if you've done your own research.

550
00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:18.210
There's a lot of third world countries that are below the equator that have a

551
00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:22.930
lot of people that are infected with hookworms and none of them have asthma or

552
00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:23.710
allergies.

553
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:28.710
And there was a guy that had this debilitating asthma and he did a research on

554
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:35.560
it and found that hookworms if you're infected by hookworms will prevent asthma.

555
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:40.830
And he went to Malawi and walked through a fucking latrine and tried to infect

556
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:43.280
himself with hookworms,

557
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:46.730
got infected and it cured his asthma and then he tried to start a company

558
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.760
selling fucking hookworms to people you can watch.

559
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.650
This was on this American life.

560
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:55.360
It's one of the craziest things I've ever heard is hilarious and he,

561
00:32:55.361 --> 00:32:58.690
he got shut down.
He's not able to do it.
You can totally fucking Google is,

562
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.850
I don't remember the negative aspects of having hookworm in your body.

563
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:03.950
I'm not really sure.
I'm not,
I mean I don't know.

564
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:08.300
Is most people in third world countries just have them.
It's they just,
yeah,

565
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:09.350
they're infected by them.

566
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:14.530
But what you're saying is true because allergies and asthma aren't present in a

567
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:15.710
lot of those countries.

568
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.720
Like you can't find asthma and in certain parts of South America and Africa,

569
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.570
we went to Cameroon.
That's right.
Cameroon.
Wow,
that's fascinating.

570
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.030
But it totally makes sense.
It totally makes,

571
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.610
it really is a whole ecosystem.

572
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:32.090
You came around the issue and you need those antibodies and you need all that

573
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:36.540
bacteria.
Yeah,
we've overstepped analyzed our country.
Yeah.
Yeah,

574
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.390
we certainly have.
And you know,

575
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.380
people worried about their kids touching things and you really need to touch

576
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:44.780
things.
You know,
you need to get your body out there.

577
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.250
I love that George Carlin bit where he talks about how we used to swim and shit

578
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.480
and that's why he never got sick because they swim in the Hudson,

579
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.910
the Hudson swam in raw sewage and shit,
so they never got sick.
Yeah.

580
00:33:56.911 --> 00:34:00.650
That's an amazing thing about New York.
If you go around New York and like if,

581
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.240
especially if you're in a helicopter or anything,

582
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:04.730
when you get to look down and see the water or look over the bridge,

583
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:09.590
it's dirty as fuck.
I mean,
and no one is trying to fix it.

584
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.820
No one is saying like,
we,

585
00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:14.420
what we really need to do is make this water crystal clear so our children can

586
00:34:14.421 --> 00:34:18.470
swim in it.
They're like,
it's never going to happen.
Ooh.

587
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.650
It's fucking terrible for it.
I mean,
I'm sure someone does crazy kids,

588
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.660
but it's really bad for you.

589
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.900
Apparently there's parts of Brooklyn where more oil has spilled off of Brooklyn,

590
00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:34.190
then the Exxon Valdez,
let me,
let me pull that up.
Brooklyn,

591
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:39.200
because it was a,
an article that I was reading a about yachters

592
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.510
toxic water.
I think it was a vice thing.

593
00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:47.523
<v 8>MMM.</v>

594
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.700
<v 0>Sounds like something they would want to brag about though,</v>

595
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.060
is I don't think it's a brag thing.
It was a,

596
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:59.310
I can't find it.
That whole picture looks disturbing.
Isn't that?
That's,

597
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.600
this is a hookworms face.
Yeah.
They leave their evil as fuck.

598
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:08.730
They look like something from the movie alien.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here it is.

599
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.960
His name was Jasper Lawrence and he's,
he uh,

600
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.340
infected himself with hookworms to treat severe allergies.

601
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.120
This is in the fucking news and it worked and it completely worked.

602
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:28.590
So he tried to start a company and the,
uh,
the FDA shut them down.

603
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.080
That's so crazy.
Yeah.

604
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.213
<v 8>Wow.</v>

605
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.980
<v 0>The FDA classified his kits as pharmaceuticals,
told him he was under</v>

606
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.860
<v 9>investigation.
He then fled the United States.</v>

607
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.660
Apparently though people that purchased the hookworms that came from his body

608
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:49.980
were having trouble administering them cause they would try to inject them into

609
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:53.860
their veins.
It was the only way to administer them.
Sorry.

610
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.480
It was so nasty.
Yeah.
We had just put it in your butt hole.

611
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.490
We had this infectious disease expert on,
um,
the,
uh,
Joe Rogan questions.

612
00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:04.590
Everything's show and he told me that people in,

613
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.250
when you come to like tropical countries,
I said,
everybody has something.

614
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.080
Everybody is infected with something.

615
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.560
He was explaining all these different diseases that were not exactly sure about,

616
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:16.980
like when they talk about toxo plasma and different parasites and all these

617
00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:21.690
different things that he's like 100% of the people that live in these places are

618
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:26.240
infected with something.
There's no way to avoid it.
It's fucking nuts.
He's like,

619
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.370
that's the reality of being a human being in a tropical climate.
And I was like,

620
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:32.970
wow.
Like you can't get away from something there.

621
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.380
You just exist with it.

622
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:37.070
Just because of the climate is so conducive to incubating all,

623
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.890
all the bacteria and wonder.
I don't know.
You know?
I don't know.
I mean,

624
00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:41.970
I'm sure that's part of it.

625
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:45.000
I'm sure also it's gotta be part of it that some of this stuff is passed on

626
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:49.230
through mother and son and mother and daughter.
I would have assumed some of it,

627
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.160
you know?
I don't know.
I don't know how that works.
Do they?
I mean,

628
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:56.490
do do like things like pathogens,
they,
that they get passed on.

629
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.920
I have no children.
Yeah,
I imagine so.

630
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.880
I have no idea where it fucking jungle diseases and shit.
Terrifying.
Man.

631
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.750
I'm scared of the fucking jungle.
But whenever you get hot,

632
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.320
when you get hot and moist,
you what you get is competition.

633
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.950
The reason why the jungle so fucking scares cause there's so much life and when

634
00:37:13.951 --> 00:37:17.460
you get at any place that has condensed life and uh,

635
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.110
just complete isolation from human,

636
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.830
like influence,
like no,

637
00:37:23.831 --> 00:37:28.200
no one's going in there and the building shopping malls and there's no roads

638
00:37:28.201 --> 00:37:31.360
everywhere.
And you know,
trees aren't getting default there.

639
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:35.880
They're cutting down trees to log.
But what is,
what is Forrest is forest.

640
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.730
Jungle is jungle.
There might be killing the jungle,

641
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.290
but once you actually get into the jungle,

642
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.050
the amount of competition in that chunk goes insane.

643
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.960
There's fucking ants killing everything they have.

644
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.160
I asked that March an army so strong can hear them walking.

645
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:55.370
They have all sorts of different army ants and poisonous and incredible amounts

646
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:59.470
of toxic spiders,
snakes.
And then there's of course there's Jaguars.

647
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.020
It's this incredibly dense.
Oh it's crazy.
Yeah.

648
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:08.040
Well you're dealing with the in the rain forest is incredibly dense life like

649
00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:11.040
everything,
insect life,
reptile life,
animal life,

650
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:14.430
all of it like coalescing together.
And you just have an immense,

651
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.700
immense amount of competition.
When you have an immense amount of competition,

652
00:38:17.701 --> 00:38:19.770
you're going to have diseases,
you're going to have problems,

653
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:22.460
you're going to have,
you know,
the amount of moisture there,
that heat,

654
00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:25.300
the carcasses are going to rot and just,
you know,
all the,

655
00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:29.220
all the things that feed off of carcasses and the diseases,
infectious,
airborne,

656
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.250
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah in the water,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I mean,

657
00:38:32.251 --> 00:38:36.100
they have fucking,
they have parasites at swim up your,
I've

658
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.090
<v 0>heard about that.
Yeah,
and bite the shit out of you.</v>

659
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.930
You have to cover the head of your cock when you piss because they're attracted

660
00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:47.950
to urine and they find when you're in the water,
if you try to pee in the water,

661
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:52.860
they fucking swim up stream.
They find your piss whim up through it.
So they,

662
00:38:52.861 --> 00:38:55.420
they,
they sense your piss and they go after.
Exactly.

663
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:57.970
And They'd go up Your pee hole.
What's the fish?

664
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.190
There's a fish that has human teeth.
Have you seen this,
this and they,

665
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.150
they will bite your testicles off.
Of course there will.
Yeah.

666
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.260
You ever seen that shit to fucking fit?
They have a human fucking teeth man.

667
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.240
They look very human like,
yeah,
it's fucking crazy.
There was a monkey in a zoo.

668
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.440
Uh,
it was it in China that ripped off some babies balls,
man.

669
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.950
Ripped off eight months old testicles balls.

670
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.450
And this is a fucking country monkey.

671
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.750
It was just a piece that he could grab and Yank off.

672
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:30.080
He probably is already yanked off people's balls.
So is that real?
Yeah,

673
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.770
that's real.
That's so strange.
You can find one.

674
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:34.960
There's one where it actually shows them there.
Yeah.
Look,

675
00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.940
if those teeth are better than some comics,
I know.

676
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.460
Look at the roof of his mouth that has multiple layers.
Oh,
that's so freaky.

677
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.850
They have found these in lakes in Illinois because these were native to

678
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.470
Massachusetts.
What is the,
uh,
what's the fish called?
It's a p.

679
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.460
What is it begins with a p.
Uh,
that's so weird.
Look at that photo.

680
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:01.960
That's so fucking weird.
Worst blow job ever.

681
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.980
Or best or best.
Yeah.
Oh,
creeps.
What does it call it?
What is it?

682
00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.730
Uh,
on,
I want to say it's like a pico fish.

683
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.700
Sheep shed sheep said,
I don't think the sheep's head.
Yeah,

684
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.950
that's what I said.
Yeah.
That's a sheep said it's awesome.
Convict fish.

685
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:26.200
I guess there's probably more than one fish that has.
Oh,
totally.
Yeah.

686
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:30.590
I guess you see that volcano that they found in the middle of the Pacific Packer

687
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.390
Fish Taco I think is related to the [inaudible].
Okay.

688
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.780
I think it's like a cousin of the Purana.
Oh yeah.
That's completely different.

689
00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:39.620
You're right.
All right.
Sheep shed cause a poke.

690
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.200
Who was one of those fish that you can,
you can actually buy.
And uh,
I remember,

691
00:40:44.201 --> 00:40:48.880
um,
when I had Paranas like,
uh,
like you couldn't get it,

692
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:53.590
it was very hard to get them in a store,
but you'd get a pocket on a store.
Um,

693
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.060
the,
um,
what was I going to say?
Oh,
the fucking volcano.

694
00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:00.640
Did you hear about that volcano?
They found him in the middle of the Pacific.
No,

695
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.863
just found it.

696
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.030
The largest volcano ever discovered on earth and they believe in the entire

697
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:10.390
solar system.
It's just in the middle of the Pacific.

698
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:15.570
It's this enormous volcano that's as big as New Mexico and it's in the middle of

699
00:41:15.581 --> 00:41:19.020
the Pacific Ocean.
That's fucking incentive.
They didn't even know it exists.

700
00:41:19.021 --> 00:41:20.680
How the fuck did they not know?

701
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:25.450
We don't know much about the bottom of the ocean apparently.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's it.

702
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.000
We still keep discovering shit about earth.
I mean,

703
00:41:28.001 --> 00:41:30.820
it's kind of a testament to help big and crazy places,

704
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.010
but a lot of people think we've seen everything and we

705
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.380
<v 9>have it all tracked and we fucking don't.
Well,</v>

706
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:40.730
that's the argument for things like big foot.
But this,

707
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.360
this is some real shit.
What is out there?
Whatever the hell that thing is.

708
00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.610
That's actually probably an argument against bigfoot is that they can't find big

709
00:41:47.611 --> 00:41:50.380
foot,
but they can find this in the middle of the ocean.
Actually,

710
00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:53.350
that's a terrible idea because it's so big.
Um,

711
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.580
it dwarfs the previous record holder,
Huh?

712
00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.700
Mona Loa used to be the world's largest volcano,
but this,

713
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:06.560
uh,
this one,
uh,
monologue is this.
Oh,

714
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:10.310
it's actually 25% smaller than Olympus Mons on Mars,

715
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.890
which is the biggest volcano in earth source system.

716
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.890
So it's a little bit smaller.
It's one of the largest in the solar system,

717
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.750
but the largest on earth,

718
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:23.530
it's 400 miles wide and 2.5 miles tall.

719
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.950
It erupted,
uh,
for a few million years during the early Cretaceous period,

720
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:32.540
about 144 million years ago,
but it's since been,
uh,
been extinct.

721
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.490
Wow.
That's nuts.
So it almost became another Hawaiian essentially,

722
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.130
but it's even bigger.
When did they find them in Hawaii?
Like a week?

723
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.500
<v 0>Well,
maybe they're just trying to grow a new Japan real quick.</v>

724
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.180
This might not be a bad idea.

725
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.850
Using chem trails sends him fucking harp signals down to the bottom of the ocean

726
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.000
and try to crack that fucker to the top.
And you scared at all about that Shit,

727
00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:59.390
man.
I know this is supposed to be a conversation about rap and your book.
No,
no,

728
00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:04.340
we don't.
We don't get to talk about rapport.
My blood scared of Fukushima,
dude.
I,

729
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.100
uh,
that the hard thing is that,
I don't know Fukushima man.

730
00:43:08.101 --> 00:43:09.050
I don't know what Fukushima,

731
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:13.790
the nuclear disaster in Japan last aware of that last podcast.
Joe,

732
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:16.490
I was freaked out about it cause we talked about it so much.
But then the,

733
00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:20.030
all the shit that people sent me on Twitter,
now I'm just like,
Oh man,
it's her.

734
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:23.360
So there's two sides of it.
It's like big legs.
When did this,

735
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.520
I've been on tour.

736
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:29.880
Is that you didn't ask him about the Japanese nuclear meltdown.
How long?

737
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.940
How long ago is it?
This is like,
people get so mad at you right now.

738
00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.620
You have fuck another American.

739
00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:40.580
So obsessed with his own bullshit that doesn't understand one of the mass

740
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:44.100
extinction events.
It's world's ever known.
I know a lot about extinction events.

741
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.660
Just,
I don't,
I don't know.
Have you been watching breaking bad?
2011.

742
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.700
See the last one though?
2011.

743
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.020
<v 9>Um,
the,
um,
the,
the tsunami and earthquake,</v>

744
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:59.510
Japan Fukushima power plants went down and they didn't have a backup.

745
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:03.410
And if,
you know how,
I didn't know how nuclear worked until this,

746
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.920
but the way it works is you have to keep those things cool nuclear power.

747
00:44:06.921 --> 00:44:11.921
Apparently it was just a big fire that works and creates a steam and the steam

748
00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:16.340
power generators.
Right.
And they pour water into it and the Wa,

749
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.970
that's why they're always near the water.
The water is like it.

750
00:44:18.971 --> 00:44:23.030
If it hits the steam or a,
it hits the,
uh,
the nuclear plant somehow or another,

751
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:24.410
the,
the,
the,
the fusion,

752
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:28.420
the energy heats up the water and that powers the generators.
Like it's,

753
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.860
it's way more primitive than I thought it was.

754
00:44:30.861 --> 00:44:33.830
I thought it somehow another extracting the energy from the nuclear power and

755
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.540
they put it into tubes or some shit and then it comes into,

756
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.280
I didn't know how it does well when,

757
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.090
when they do that they have to keep these rods cool.

758
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.500
They have to constantly keep them cool.

759
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:48.000
This nuclear energy and when the power goes out they're fucked.

760
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:53.160
They're really,
really fucked.
They had backup for like eight hours.
They had like,

761
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:54.480
when the tsunami hit him,

762
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.150
it killed their generator and it killed their backup generator.

763
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.260
And so they couldn't cool it off.
And once you can't cool it off,
it's done.

764
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.110
Like you never can cool it off again.
They don't know how to cool it off.

765
00:45:04.111 --> 00:45:08.730
So if essentially they have this place that remains hot for hundreds of

766
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.840
thousands of years,
it's contaminated and so they don't know.
Honestly,

767
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:14.460
that's a lot of it is theoretical.

768
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.830
They don't even know where it is right now because it's,
it's,

769
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:19.170
it's melted through its containment hole,

770
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.760
so it's going further and further into the earth.
Jesus,
so holding it's,

771
00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:27.030
it's Matt.
No.
Yeah.
Now that I,
yes,
I am scared about that.

772
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:31.890
That's fucking terror and it's leaking millions and millions of gallons of

773
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:34.560
radioactive water into the ocean.

774
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.100
It showed a measurable increase in the radioactivity and fish.

775
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.080
Right now they say it's with intolerable levels.

776
00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:43.770
It's like 3% increase and radioactive isotopes,

777
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.380
but it's dangerous.
It's fucking dangerous.

778
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.320
<v 0>I've been eating mad fists lately just because I feel like one day I won't be</v>

779
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:50.370
able to,
she'd eat it.

780
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:54.960
Maybe you get super powers and we know that is some scary shit.

781
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:58.800
I feel like very inadequate as a human for not knowing about that,
but it's,
well,

782
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:03.090
you shouldn't feel inadequate,
but it's kind of shocking that no ones.
Well,

783
00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:06.960
you live in Kansas City.
No one's worried about fish.
Yeah.
Worried about catfish,

784
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:11.360
catch catfish,
catfish.
I fucking hate catfish catfish.
That's always,

785
00:46:11.361 --> 00:46:14.670
those shows are reaching in and grabbing them with their hands.

786
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.920
When you grow up in Kansas City,
everybody's always,

787
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.140
let's go to the lake this weekend and we're going to go,

788
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:22.920
and that's what you do is you fucking go cat fishing and they have fucking

789
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:26.130
whiskers that they beat you with.
And if you hold them and they're just,

790
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.310
they're like pig.
Well,
just trying to stay alive.
I understand that.

791
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:33.660
I'm just saying I'm not a fan of them.
I'm not a fan of them.
Yeah.

792
00:46:33.661 --> 00:46:36.830
A catfish is delicious and you can catch them with your hands.
Yeah.
Yeah.

793
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.630
And then they beat you with their fucking whiskers that those shows where they

794
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:43.590
reach the hand into the mouth and grab them and pull them out of the lake.

795
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.750
That is the most ridiculous shit ever.

796
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.590
That's the best way to catch these fucking things with chloroform work on

797
00:46:49.591 --> 00:46:54.420
catfish.
I don't think it would work underwater.
No.
I mean,
yeah,
the um,

798
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.740
the,
the size of these fucking cat fur,
so they pull out with our hands.

799
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.030
I mean there's some,
there's some,
I don't know if you've ever seen like the,

800
00:47:01.031 --> 00:47:03.450
the ledge because you like,
you know,
legendary animals.

801
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:06.510
There's like 400 pound cat fish swimming through rivers and shit.

802
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.050
Ever seen some of these pictures of these?
He's like mega catfish.
I mean,

803
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.400
<v 9>do you this giant ones?
Huge.
They caught one recently.</v>

804
00:47:13.401 --> 00:47:16.370
There was a some world record one that caught in some other country,

805
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.940
but someone put a video up on youtube and it's seriously looked like the guy was

806
00:47:19.941 --> 00:47:20.930
pulling in a hiphop.

807
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.490
He caught it with a rod and reel Wa pull it,
pull it up,

808
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.980
pull up world record cat fish caught like the most recent one.
It's insane.

809
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.210
<v 0>It's like,
it looks like it's like eight,</v>

810
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:33.940
nine feet long and it looks like a hippo look.
Literally.

811
00:47:33.941 --> 00:47:38.290
It looks like he's pulling in a hippopotamus.
It's enormous.
And it's a catfish.

812
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.490
Yeah.
Where was it?
Where were no conflicts down or some shit?
I don't know.

813
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.130
I have no idea.
It was just a bunch of strange,

814
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:48.430
strange languages that I don't understand.
Fuck Catheters.

815
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.340
That's something I'd be like,
oh look at this one.
That's probably Thailand.

816
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:54.850
Thailand has a lot of giant ones.
Yeah,

817
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:59.170
but there's a video of a guy pulling one in on a rod and reel video of a guy

818
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:04.030
pulling in the world record.
It's just in this,

819
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.500
these are just rivers,
man,

820
00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:11.660
<v 6>Tokyo Electric Power.</v>

821
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.170
<v 0>Why do you have two videos playing at the same time?</v>

822
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.540
You have volume playing Tokyo power.
We don't need to hear that music man and,

823
00:48:18.541 --> 00:48:21.960
and I hear it.
It's really important.
When we moved him he said,
man,

824
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.453
you got to really,

825
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:24.703
<v 6>and then Anna,</v>

826
00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.920
<v 0>look at that rod polling.
Jesus Christ.</v>

827
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.090
Scoot ahead so you can actually see the fish.

828
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.740
What did it do to way better hearing you do it.

829
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.370
This is not,
the fish does not the one.
This is not the world record one,

830
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.610
but it's pretty God damn bag.

831
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.840
The size of that fucking thing is calling me with his hands.
What the fuck.

832
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:54.760
Oh,
that's not even close to us.
Conveniently rested on his deck.

833
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.720
Oh,
I just happened to stick my dick in his cap fish's mouth after conquering it.

834
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:03.690
Did they caught that at Kentucky kiss or what's that called?
You know,

835
00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:04.600
it's really fucked up.

836
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.150
That's not even the craziest animal that lives in fresh water.

837
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:11.210
You ever seen an alligator Gar?
A white alligator gar.
Oh,

838
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.740
to pull that up.
There's videos of these people catching these things.

839
00:49:14.741 --> 00:49:19.030
They apparently live,
uh,
in some places in the south.
Like Texas has a,
uh,

840
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:22.090
lakes that have them and there's,
these things are enormous.

841
00:49:22.091 --> 00:49:24.640
They grow like nine feet long.
They look like dinosaurs.

842
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:27.780
They look like swimming dinosaurs,
their teeth.
They're like giant Parana.

843
00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:32.560
If your teeth are filled with these crazy fucking sharp teeth and uh,

844
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.860
I think they eat them.
I think that eat,
I'm like on swamp people.

845
00:49:35.861 --> 00:49:37.600
I think they smoked and they smoke them,

846
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:42.640
but it's a crazy look in dinosaur evil ancient fish.

847
00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.460
You're on it.
Look at this fucking thing.

848
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:54.560
Fish.
Is this somebody catching one?

849
00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:01.220
Yeah.
What is with these fishermen with a fucking shitty music behind their fish

850
00:50:01.221 --> 00:50:02.054
videos.

851
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.273
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

852
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.510
<v 0>Where do you see that thing?
Well that's not even that big one</v>

853
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.100
till that music to stop.

854
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:15.900
<v 6>Okay.</v>

855
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.950
<v 0>Go to a,
Oh my God,
look at that thing.</v>

856
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:25.080
That's the shit show a good photo of one because some of them see the Jesus

857
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.540
Christ Jesus Christ.
Wow.

858
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.390
I mean that's a native American freshwater fish,

859
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:34.490
man of God and it's probably been in this state for,
you know,

860
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:39.290
millions of years looked like that.
That is terrifying.
And they're huge.

861
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:43.520
I mean these things get enormous.
What's the world record alligator car?

862
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:47.000
What's fun to how big they good did that photo that you,

863
00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:49.520
I said that you tweeted the other day with the,
the,

864
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:54.910
the mountain lion eating a deer on the side side of the road at some into deer

865
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:57.620
on the side of the road in Santa Monica.

866
00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.770
Right in the Santa Monica Mountains.

867
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:04.730
Like people were driving by and they passed it and like what the fuck you ever

868
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:08.060
seen the video of the Komodo dragon eating the water buffalo?
Yes.

869
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.360
That's like one of the best.
They measure from the alligator.

870
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:15.620
Gar is the largest freshwater fish found in North America and measures between

871
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:19.760
eight and 10 feet fucking long.
God dammit.

872
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:24.350
If you pull up a photo that says world record alligator Gar,

873
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:28.580
do that on a,
on um,
on Google image search.

874
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:31.520
Okay.
Bing,

875
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:37.160
you contrarian music being with my windows phone.
I give zero fucks.

876
00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:42.230
Look at this thing.
This is one of the world record ones.
Oh my gosh.

877
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.430
That's an alligator brother.
That's the world record.
I'll get,

878
00:51:45.431 --> 00:51:47.930
I'll look at the picture on it.
He just pulled up.
Look at that though.

879
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.830
This is just got captured last week.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

880
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.730
That's the world record alligator.
They just captured it misses even sippy.
Yeah.

881
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.380
Not even world record.
I believe it.
Just Mississippi record,
right?
Yup.

882
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.950
But what's crazy is the state record,
they broke twice in a day.

883
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.520
One person got one that was over 700 and never won some,

884
00:52:07.521 --> 00:52:11.450
someone else got one that was even larger than that.
It was over 700 pounds.

885
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:15.260
So two of them in a day that broke the previous state record.
It's curious.

886
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.610
When I was a kid,

887
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:19.730
I used to live in Florida and I lived in a place called Gainesville and

888
00:52:19.731 --> 00:52:23.060
Gainesville.
I played it.
I played a show in Gainesville college there.

889
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.570
It's also where I think Ted Bundy did all his killing.
Yeah.
Um,

890
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:30.200
there was a lake called Lake Alice and it was filled with alligators,

891
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.970
alligators there all the time.
We used to feed him.

892
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.310
We used to throw marshmallows in and they would like,

893
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.580
they would eat the marshmallows and occasionally people's dogs,

894
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.730
like someone would fuck up and they'd be walking the dog too close to the,

895
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:45.170
to the water.
They're just jump out,
grab him,
snap him up.
Yeah.

896
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:48.280
I thought you meant like you through marshmallows and occasionally somebody
stole

897
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.220
rude.
No.
Um,
but uh,
they,

898
00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:57.110
they were scarce like you,
you weren't allowed to hunt them.
They were like,

899
00:52:57.111 --> 00:52:58.310
there are a protected species.

900
00:52:58.311 --> 00:53:00.590
That's why they were telling us not to feed the marshmallows.

901
00:53:00.591 --> 00:53:04.220
At one point in time they put up a sign because apparently the alligators had a

902
00:53:04.221 --> 00:53:05.690
hard time digesting the marshmallow.

903
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.710
Like they were concerned with the alligators,
their population.
But now,

904
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.620
now they're everywhere.
They just infested.

905
00:53:12.621 --> 00:53:15.260
They have these people on those swamp shows.

906
00:53:15.261 --> 00:53:17.240
You ever watch those swamps shows and like a history channel,

907
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:22.420
they have like a 500 tag limit so they can kill 500 of them in a fucking season.

908
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:25.680
So they're just driving around swamp,

909
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:30.210
shooting rifles in there's water to a day.
Jesus.
Yeah.

910
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.060
Well I think,
I don't know how long their season lasts.
Oh yeah.

911
00:53:33.061 --> 00:53:35.640
That's way more than two a day.
Then depending,
I think they have,

912
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:41.010
I think they have a season,
but like some animals when they get too crazy,

913
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:42.630
they stopped the season thing and they just say,

914
00:53:42.631 --> 00:53:45.900
you could do whatever the fuck you want.
Like wild pigs in Texas.

915
00:53:45.901 --> 00:53:47.920
There's a thing that they put out today.
Uh,

916
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:52.650
it was on my Twitter that they hired a guy to start trapping them in the city of

917
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:53.484
Dallas,

918
00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:58.680
that they have to start trapping wild hogs in the city of Dallas,
I think.

919
00:53:58.681 --> 00:54:01.050
Cause they're like in the,
in their way into the city.

920
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.930
Wild pigs in Texas are so bad right now.

921
00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:07.950
There's more than 11 million wild pigs and in Texas alone right now apparently.

922
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.530
Have you ever been to South Africa?
No.
Okay.

923
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:15.360
So we did a tour in South Africa and we were driving from Cape Town to

924
00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:18.630
Johannesburg or driving,
no driving around Johannesburg.

925
00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:21.540
And there is a guy,
uh,

926
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:26.810
pretty much every 20 miles or so that is employed by the state that walks around

927
00:54:27.481 --> 00:54:31.590
with a whip and he whips baboons off the street because they fuck with people's

928
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:35.970
cars.
Pat Boone's our little fucking thugs,
man.
They will like,

929
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.680
they'll break into your car and,

930
00:54:37.681 --> 00:54:42.030
and take all your cds and break them and Piss all over your car and fuck your

931
00:54:42.031 --> 00:54:45.210
shit up and just leave it there.
They do it on purpose.

932
00:54:45.211 --> 00:54:49.200
So they pay a guy to walk around and whip baboons to keep them out of people's

933
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:51.210
cars.
Dude,
they're goons.

934
00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:57.330
You know what's really weird about baboons is there kind of like part dog right

935
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.730
there.
Like,
you know,
they're,
they're a,
they're a primate,

936
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.820
but they look kind of dog like,
like when they open up their mouth and they,

937
00:55:03.821 --> 00:55:05.970
they like,
they bare their teeth or they,
you know,

938
00:55:05.971 --> 00:55:10.080
they're barking or something like that.
They have like a dog face.
Yeah.
You know,

939
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.440
pull up a pictures of baboons,
baboons,
teeth.
They're freaky looking fucking,

940
00:55:14.441 --> 00:55:18.540
I'm gonna fucking there.
They're crazy man.
Everywhere.
That's not a backbone.

941
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.470
Pumped picture of Babylon.
Um,
the,
um,

942
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:23.911
the,

943
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:27.270
they have a real problem with them breaking into people's hotel rooms to like,

944
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:29.460
they've,
uh,
they've broken into like,

945
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:32.880
they figured out how to open sliding glass doors and shit.
No breaking appealing.

946
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:36.510
If you leave them open,
they'll break in the hotel room just ransacked your shit.

947
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.420
Yeah,
they fucked your shit up.
Look at it.
Oh,
he's sticking his ass up.

948
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:43.500
We can send kids.
They're,
they're,
they're rude.

949
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:46.470
They're smarter than good ones that showed baboons teeth

950
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:53.760
get something that shows baboons teeth.
They're freaky looking animals,
man,

951
00:55:53.761 --> 00:55:57.330
though.
They're almost like a dog monkey hybrid.

952
00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:01.260
They're everywhere in South Africa.
They are,
they'll walking down the sidewalk.

953
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:05.100
So if you're out for a jog or something,
you might encounter a backbone.
Dams.

954
00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.610
Yeah.
What did they do about them?
They,

955
00:56:06.611 --> 00:56:09.720
they try to have somebody come around and regulate them,

956
00:56:09.721 --> 00:56:13.290
but I don't think that they're completely successful,
so I don't know.

957
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.950
Think you can scream at one or something and it'll run away from you,

958
00:56:16.951 --> 00:56:19.560
but maybe not though,
right?
Maybe not.
You never know.

959
00:56:19.561 --> 00:56:22.530
They are in India recently got killed.
Look at that thing.

960
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:27.310
Some mayor got killed by a pack of monkeys.

961
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:31.690
A mayor of a town in India.
Do monkeys are fucking ruthless.
Yeah.

962
00:56:31.691 --> 00:56:33.100
Put up a couple more of those pictures.

963
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:40.430
It's so weird.
That's a real animal man.
Look at their fucking teeth,

964
00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.250
but it's like very almost dog.
Like,
you know,
it's a primate like,

965
00:56:46.251 --> 00:56:48.890
but it's long and like flake or something.
Yeah.

966
00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:53.900
I'm so glad we don't have shit like that here.
I mean we have our art,

967
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:56.900
we have bears.
Bears are scared and there was a pretty bad,

968
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:59.960
did you hear about that event last week or it was two weeks ago.

969
00:56:59.961 --> 00:57:04.420
We're seven people got bitten yet.
Bear.
Yeah.
Was like,
what the fuck?
Yeah.

970
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:05.960
In one day.
Yeah.

971
00:57:05.961 --> 00:57:09.660
Bears are a bears are pretty scared and they're huge too and,

972
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.920
and fucking fast.
So you can't outrun them.

973
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.510
Oh yeah.
Recent.
Yeah.
That's cool.

974
00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:21.560
That's real too.
They pulled their,
uh,
their,
their lips back.

975
00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:24.890
Do they do that with their hands or does it,
does it just pull punches?
Does it?

976
00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:29.170
Jesus man does it when they wide open their mouths.
Scariest vagina.
Eric,

977
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.820
what a creepy looking animal man.

978
00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:34.170
<v 6>Okay.</v>

979
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.840
<v 0>Yeah.
It was a couple of days,
a couple of day period.</v>

980
00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.980
We're seven people were mauled by bears in America.

981
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:43.010
<v 6>Okay.</v>

982
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:47.450
<v 0>Yeah.
I think it's weird,
man.
It's getting really weird.
Yeah.</v>

983
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.900
Yeah.
Things are kind of nuts,
man.
I don't know.
I'm,

984
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:52.400
I'm just scared of shit like that.

985
00:57:52.401 --> 00:57:55.400
And I guess in Kansas City we don't really have to worry about stuff like that,

986
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:59.540
which is nice.
We don't have bears or planned on staying there.
I don't know,
man.

987
00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:00.920
I'm probably going to have to move,

988
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:04.700
probably have to move out here because of some of the stuff that's going on.
Um,

989
00:58:04.701 --> 00:58:09.380
my wife definitely wants to move out here because of a Showbiz type style.

990
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:12.170
Yeah.
Your wife wants to get the fuck out of Kansas City.
Yeah.

991
00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.210
She doesn't like it.
I don't know.
She,

992
00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:18.620
she was getting ready to move to England and I kind of interrupted her plans and

993
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:20.780
married her and put a baby in her.

994
00:58:20.781 --> 00:58:23.720
So now that stuff is going so well.

995
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:28.720
She wants to go to either of the coasts but just not stay in Kansas City,

996
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:32.270
which is something to consider because it's getting to the point where it's hard

997
00:58:32.271 --> 00:58:37.190
to do ship from there till you got to live in California.
Got Weather.
We Women,

998
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:40.940
Oh women,
whether we in and out Burger.
That's right.
In and out.

999
00:58:40.941 --> 00:58:43.580
Burger is pretty nice.
Yeah.
He's not your gluten free.
You can get that.

1000
00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.300
The protein style where they give it to you.
I'm too big slabs and lettuce.
Yeah.

1001
00:58:47.301 --> 00:58:50.420
She's gluten free.
Yeah.
She'd love that.
It'll,

1002
00:58:50.421 --> 00:58:52.630
it'll stink up your car though for days and days.
Right.

1003
00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.060
This is what that smell of in and out.
It's impossible to get out of your car.

1004
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:59.450
It's weird.
So even as you clean your car up,
you're like,
where is it?

1005
00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:04.700
How is it in here?
You know,
I ate in the box,
you know,
with that clean the box,

1006
00:59:04.701 --> 00:59:06.740
I picked the box up,
a drone in the garbage and get in my car.

1007
00:59:06.741 --> 00:59:09.230
It still smells like in and out.
Do you like living out here?

1008
00:59:09.231 --> 00:59:12.860
And I mean cause you've lived quite a few places,
right?
You bounced around.

1009
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:15.710
There's so many people there.
That's an issue,
right?

1010
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:20.090
But the good thing about too many people is you get a lot of cool people because

1011
00:59:20.091 --> 00:59:22.280
there's so many fucking,
and

1012
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.740
<v 9>it's so,
there's a lot of creative people that live here.</v>

1013
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.720
So like you can cultivate,

1014
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.440
like we've got a great group of friends now and it's like all of our friends are

1015
00:59:30.441 --> 00:59:33.740
comics and people that we know that a creative that live inside of La.

1016
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.780
And so in that sense it's a great place to live.

1017
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.660
You can find a lot of interesting,
cool people here,

1018
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:41.790
but the numbers are so big when you,

1019
00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:45.770
you're dealing with something like they think there's 20 million people in the

1020
00:59:45.771 --> 00:59:49.400
greater Los Angeles area.
When you're dealing with numbers that are that big,

1021
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:54.830
I think you sort of almost like a,
you don't appreciate people as much.

1022
00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:56.660
I think they're all,
they're overwhelming to you.

1023
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.280
Whereas if you go to a small town,

1024
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.730
what I like about like driving in a place like boulder or something like that,

1025
01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:04.940
as people wave to you,
like if you're passing on a row,

1026
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:06.650
spendable and places like that.

1027
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:09.380
That's the same with Kansas city is friendly to each other.

1028
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.290
This is less pressure,
right?
There's a,

1029
01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:15.290
there's a real pressure that comes from volume of people and I feel it on the

1030
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:17.480
highway and I think it's responsible for road rage.

1031
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:21.590
Most road rage and you're not seeing road rage and empty roads and road rage is,

1032
01:00:21.591 --> 01:00:25.000
a lot of it is like dark chapters.
There's road rage and empty roads too.
Yeah.

1033
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:27.470
Well that's just assholes,
right?
Yeah.
That was probably a bad example,

1034
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:32.740
but my point being that there's less people that are clogging up the world less,

1035
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:33.950
you know,

1036
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:37.610
you're not constantly being slowed down everywhere you go buy a high volume of

1037
01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:39.110
people.
I think you appreciate them more.

1038
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:44.450
Do you feel that there's an overabundance of maybe kind of like what we were

1039
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:46.520
talking about before the show and not to say any names,

1040
01:00:46.521 --> 01:00:51.521
but creative people that are getting in the way of maybe people that have a

1041
01:00:51.621 --> 01:00:53.480
genuine voice.
Oh,

1042
01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:57.490
you people that have figured out a way to exist in the system even though,
yeah.

1043
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.880
Yeah.

1044
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.880
And maybe are preventing other people that would otherwise have opportunities.

1045
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.390
I don't know.
You know,

1046
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.140
we were talking about a specific example of a comedian that we know that sucks,

1047
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:14.210
that somehow or another has carved out some sort of a small life and Hollywood,

1048
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:18.630
but B,
while being incredibly bad.
I think this,
that's,

1049
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.450
those are rare.
It's rare.

1050
01:01:20.451 --> 01:01:23.510
I think most people that actually get through and you know,

1051
01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:27.740
you might not enjoy them,
you know,
like it might not be your style,

1052
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.320
but like there's a lot of music that's not my style,

1053
01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:32.100
but it's other people fucking love it.
Right.

1054
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.750
And there's that weird pretentious thing where you go,
no,
it fucking sucks.

1055
01:01:35.751 --> 01:01:39.600
Period.
It might suck to you,
but like to someone the Smith,

1056
01:01:39.601 --> 01:01:43.510
so the greatest band ever.
Yeah,
a lot of cow.
Lot of people,

1057
01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.210
a lot of people think that I don't like them.
No,
that's not my style.

1058
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:52.100
But I appreciate that they obviously are great to those people.
That's how it is.

1059
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:57.020
But then there's also other folks that get through as writers and that's where

1060
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:58.310
it gets really weird.
See,

1061
01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:02.070
that's one of the reasons I would come here is is to parlay what I'm doing and

1062
01:02:02.071 --> 01:02:04.040
to writing.
Well,
you're a funny writer,
Dude.

1063
01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:05.780
You wouldn't have to worry about what we're describing.

1064
01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.680
We're describing as people that somehow or another get jobs as writers that

1065
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:12.800
aren't funny at all.
And I've seen it,
man,

1066
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:16.070
I've seen it on large scale and you know what happens?

1067
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:19.100
A lot of times it gets really weird like Sitcom writers they have.

1068
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.330
And so it'll be one guy who's the really funny guy and the other guys,

1069
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:27.120
the guy bounces shit off who doesn't talk that much,

1070
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:31.020
but they work as a team because the one guy was a really funny creative guys

1071
01:02:31.021 --> 01:02:33.060
kind of dysfunctional and can't really do it on himself.

1072
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.530
He can't type or something like that.

1073
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:38.400
And so they have like these two men teams and they're monsters.

1074
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.280
And it happens a lot where you have these two man teams,

1075
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:44.040
these guys started out together.
But there's one guy,
he's really talented.

1076
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.360
I did this um,

1077
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.570
pilot like way back in the day I had a development deal to do a show.

1078
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:51.930
And there was these two guys that worked on a very successful Sitcom and this

1079
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:53.430
guy branched off on his own,

1080
01:02:53.431 --> 01:02:58.100
separated from his partner and got this fucking deal.
And it was a giant deals,

1081
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:01.020
millions of dollars.
I mean,
he was the guy.

1082
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:05.190
And so the people that gave me this development deal wanted me to meet with him.

1083
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:08.910
So I go into it homeboys office,
first of all,
he's wearing bowling shoes,

1084
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:13.800
which is a bad sign because those,
those bitches are not comfortable.

1085
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.780
So it's one thing if you're wearing,
you know,

1086
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:19.370
you like wearing a high top converse and you're 90 years old,
uh,

1087
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.110
you're eccentric,
you know,
but there are at least they're comfortable to wear.

1088
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.640
If you wearing bowling shoes,

1089
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.770
I assume you're trying to be wacky and I get grossed out.
Yeah.
You know,

1090
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:31.170
so I was thinking this guy is,
this is a,
this is a weird sign.

1091
01:03:31.171 --> 01:03:35.320
And then he's just not funny.
Like in talking to him,
he's,

1092
01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:38.940
it doesn't seem particularly interesting.
It doesn't seem particularly sharp.

1093
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.650
There's like,
does nothing.
I'm not,

1094
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:42.780
I mean like maybe he pours it all out in his writing.

1095
01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:46.130
Maybe he's his bland guy and when he writes,
you're like,
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1096
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.400
So they give me the script after this guy's done with it and is one of the worst

1097
01:03:50.401 --> 01:03:55.170
pieces of Shit I've ever read in my life.
And the guy eventually faded away.

1098
01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:56.004
And disappeared,

1099
01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.080
but for a long time he was considered to be one of the best writers in Hollywood

1100
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:04.080
because he was a part of a team on a successful show.

1101
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.310
And then as he branched out this gigantic development deal,

1102
01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:10.230
you got this huge push in the beginning and then he disappeared.
Yeah,

1103
01:04:10.231 --> 01:04:13.640
I've heard that people in Hollywood kind of fail upwards.
They,

1104
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:15.300
they are a part of things that,

1105
01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.500
and they just managed to make it to a certain point without ever really doing

1106
01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:23.820
anything.
It's kind of a cliche,
you know,
is that,
is that more of a cliche?

1107
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.240
I think it's happened before,
but it's a nepotism thing.

1108
01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:30.060
People that are really good at networking and like show business,

1109
01:04:30.061 --> 01:04:34.800
I guess producers or you know,
as executives may be more so than anything else.

1110
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.140
But as far as like people that are producing like writers or something like
that,

1111
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.460
not really.
See,
my biggest fear is,

1112
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.590
and I can't talk about the network or anything,

1113
01:04:43.591 --> 01:04:46.230
but this is obviously getting optioned into something.

1114
01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:50.970
And one of my biggest fears is being afflicted with shitty writers.
Oh,

1115
01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:54.120
it'll happen.
Because my biggest and,
and I don't understand still,

1116
01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:59.121
I cannot possibly grasp the logic why they won't let me write it because it's,

1117
01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.380
it's my shit.
But who won't let you ride it?

1118
01:05:01.381 --> 01:05:03.720
The people you're doing the deal with everybody.
They're just going,
no,

1119
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:07.830
we'll find you a writer.
And which is fine because maybe this particular person,

1120
01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:12.120
whoever they decide to choose or people will actually produce a teleplay that's

1121
01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:15.930
amazing.
And take Teledyne.
Yeah,
these are,

1122
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:18.040
these are words that I've

1123
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.360
<v 4>been hearing of late,
um,
teleplay but I'm also</v>

1124
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.910
<v 9>worried that then it's going to come back in and it's going to be a piece of</v>

1125
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:28.160
shit and it's going to take every,
all the heart and soul that I put into it and,

1126
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:32.350
and just make it sterile.
It's very possible.
It is.

1127
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:35.740
I haven't had good luck in trying to turn things into TV shows.
It's hard.

1128
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:37.450
It's also hard when you're dealing with,

1129
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.490
it's a huge process when you're dealing with more than one person because you're

1130
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:44.890
dealing with more than one division,
you know?
I mean,

1131
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:46.780
I found that even on the Scifi show that I did,

1132
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:49.510
there was like people that were saying we should do it like this or we should do

1133
01:05:49.511 --> 01:05:50.440
it like that.
And I'm like,

1134
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.890
and there's all these different points of view and a lot of times that fucks

1135
01:05:53.891 --> 01:05:56.800
things up.
Letting you know Louis Ck has the best deal ever,

1136
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.770
the best deal because steel is basically,
they said,

1137
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:00.940
we're not going to give you any money,

1138
01:06:00.941 --> 01:06:03.430
but you can do whatever the fuck you want and we'll air it.
It's so,

1139
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:04.301
well they give them money,

1140
01:06:04.301 --> 01:06:08.260
but I mean it was such a smart small thing on their part to trust.

1141
01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:11.410
Like here you get a guy who's a comedic genius and he said,

1142
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:13.210
well what do you do about this?
What do you trust him?

1143
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:16.630
You trust him to do something funny and we give them money.
I would love that.

1144
01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.531
That's what you need.

1145
01:06:17.531 --> 01:06:20.320
I think honestly that's what everybody gets on the Internet.

1146
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.130
I mean it really is what it is.

1147
01:06:22.131 --> 01:06:24.070
So the things that have become successful from the internet,

1148
01:06:24.071 --> 01:06:27.430
like your videos are all things that you've created on your own and they found

1149
01:06:27.431 --> 01:06:30.640
their audience and that's really what someone needs to understand.

1150
01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:34.440
Like you got to be famous from the Internet.
You got your,

1151
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:38.500
I found out about you from your work,
from your mind,

1152
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:43.110
then pushed out to the universe and you put it together.
You,

1153
01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.570
you filmed it like this pink

1154
01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.130
<v 4>cake rap thing that everybody knows about.
Yeah,
this is,</v>

1155
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:51.760
<v 10>yeah,
that shit look like my bra fairs.</v>

1156
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:53.800
I gotta remember to flip the Motherfucker rover out there cooking it,

1157
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:56.680
but 30 seconds,
ladies love me.

1158
01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:01.570
I got my buddies said to do one of the fast route to the speech.
So I said,
okay,

1159
01:07:01.571 --> 01:07:02.680
but I'm a speeded up real,
real,

1160
01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:05.830
real fast on the whole damn bottle is gone and I'm challenging Busto Watsky and

1161
01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:07.000
twist to it and he give you kids,

1162
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:12.080
<v 4>oh,
come on,
Cook Whitney me now getting drunk way.
If this took me,</v>

1163
01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.300
because I probably did over 200 takes because there's a particular part where I

1164
01:07:17.301 --> 01:07:22.220
kept fucking the words up.
It's coming up in a second,
so it took me two nights.

1165
01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:24.920
He's looking for another 80 you got to go that he can beat up.
I always did.

1166
01:07:24.921 --> 01:07:27.740
He was man enough to get inside the octagon and you get them in the [inaudible]

1167
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:30.500
front kick to the face just by me throwing my feet up.
We can,
we got baby please.

1168
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:31.160
Pizza right here.

1169
01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.170
I'm giving it to the minute because it took her back to the pancreatitis limited

1170
01:07:33.171 --> 01:07:34.520
on the minute.
You've got to beat up there.
We got this.

1171
01:07:34.521 --> 01:07:39.521
Don't do that like it and it just got to the point where I had to just start

1172
01:07:39.771 --> 01:07:44.570
hammering screwdrivers like half and half orange juice and vodka because I

1173
01:07:44.571 --> 01:07:48.910
could,
I kept fucking that.
That makes it better.
Screwdrivers makes it better.
No,

1174
01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.920
it made it worse.
That was fine.
I was just frustrated

1175
01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:56.720
with the micro machine.
Here's another one.
Here's another.

1176
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:58.520
<v 10>Vito went up a little literally,
you know better.</v>

1177
01:07:58.521 --> 01:08:01.110
You battling anybody with a better you ahead of you like me to read about it on

1178
01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:03.180
the edge of with an item without a rebound to bring about about it though.

1179
01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:08.460
<v 4>Boom.
On the king bed and get up to,
there must be so hard to do live.</v>

1180
01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:11.640
It's,
it's,
as long as I get proper vocal

1181
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.040
<v 9>gold and,
uh,
warm ups,
warm ups,
then I'll be fine.
Like</v>

1182
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.610
<v 4>if I just try to go out there and do that,
it's not happening.
I mean it's,
it's,</v>

1183
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.390
it's you gotta stretch like,
you know,
before you train Jiu Jitsu or something,

1184
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:26.720
you got to,
you know,
20,
30 minutes of warming up.
It's that similar concept.

1185
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:31.700
I do that.
No,
uh,
before shows,
I make sure I have conversations before show.

1186
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:36.680
Do you ever do like scales and go,
Oh yeah,

1187
01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:39.890
but I also stretched my mouth and I'm like,
yeah,
you have to.
You have to.

1188
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:42.910
And it's a lot of stretching my tongue in my cheeks out and,

1189
01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:44.420
and talking and make the one,

1190
01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:49.340
the crucial thing is making sure I'm extremely hydrated because that'll,

1191
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:53.750
that'll make my mouth very,
uh,
kind of juicy and lubricated,

1192
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.070
juicy,
juicy in a little budget.

1193
01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.230
Keep talking to get my pants off.
But I found that the Internet is um,

1194
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:02.443
you know,

1195
01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.310
in particular like what Google is doing right now trying to destroy network TV

1196
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:11.700
with Google fiber I found a couple of years ago and where this is all from where

1197
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:16.930
Bennett is coming from is that we're kind of all as artists taking control back

1198
01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:22.640
and um,
you know,
like you'd do with this podcast,
what I do with my videos,

1199
01:09:22.641 --> 01:09:27.470
what I did with my blog and we create all this shit that they,

1200
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.310
you know,
the suits will try to take in and repackage for networks.

1201
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:36.370
And I think that the thing with Louis is they let one through that didn't have

1202
01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:40.220
to go through the filter of all the executives and the suits and it's awesome.

1203
01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:42.800
It's so fucking awesome.
Yeah.
Is because they said,
all right,

1204
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:45.860
well we're just going to let this guy do it.
We'll look at what you're doing.

1205
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:47.610
Right.
And look at how,

1206
01:09:47.611 --> 01:09:50.940
how would you have done that if you had a bunch of people telling you what to
do?

1207
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:54.260
I wouldn't,
I couldn't,
even if I had one person telling me what to do.

1208
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.390
I mean I like the autonomy and I think that's why there's so many voices that

1209
01:09:59.391 --> 01:10:03.710
are emerging because we're getting these like singular very creative versus or

1210
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:07.040
voices that are coming.
You know what you do.
Perfect example.

1211
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:10.820
Well this podcast would have never been like this if we had a producer or a

1212
01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:15.170
network.
There was no the stage we've seen your way that we could say that.

1213
01:10:15.171 --> 01:10:17.720
Could we say that?
Use some more g rated words.

1214
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:22.300
Advertisers aren't going to like when you see the flesh using the fleshlight or

1215
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.400
this motherfucker just having him hang around level every five so we get the

1216
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:32.600
James Franco instead.
Well there would be like,
you know like we,
we,
we've,

1217
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:35.610
we've done studies and oh that's,

1218
01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:39.200
well that's one of the things like in one of the projects I have is as,

1219
01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:42.680
I'm very certain that it's going to have to go through a fucking focus group and

1220
01:10:42.681 --> 01:10:46.640
I've of course I've never had that happen to anything I've ever done.
It's weird.

1221
01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.810
It's weird.
Focus groups are struggling.
I mean,
what is like you've had,

1222
01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.030
what are like some of the comments that you get?
I mean,

1223
01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:57.710
you get like very bizarre fucked up comments and quite honestly if something's

1224
01:10:57.711 --> 01:11:01.640
good they like it.
I mean that's,
that's the reality of focus groups.

1225
01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:04.160
People don't like it.
They don't,
they look to like say,
well you know,

1226
01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:05.000
fuck a focus group,

1227
01:11:05.001 --> 01:11:08.870
but if you got a good product to focus group is most likely going to like it.

1228
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:13.580
You know,
it's,
the problem is you shouldn't have to do it that way,
right.

1229
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.790
<v 9>The way you develop a show,
it's like,
wait the way you do,
I'll up anything.</v>

1230
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.930
It's like you create it,
you put it out there,
you get feedback,

1231
01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.850
you work it and tweak it and you continue and then when you start out,

1232
01:11:23.851 --> 01:11:27.120
it's not going to be the same thing it is a year from now or six months from
now,

1233
01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.490
you're going to get it together.
Like for me,

1234
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.360
there's like a whole process from the beginning of,
uh,

1235
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.000
coming up with a bit and then what,
what the bid actually becomes in six months.

1236
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.790
And if I had a judge it based on the first time I ever did it on stage,

1237
01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.190
it would probably,
most bits would probably never make it.

1238
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.460
Absolutely it would die off.
They they,
they're just not ready.

1239
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.250
And when you're on a television show,

1240
01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:51.060
everybody wants the beginning product to be the final product and it's not,

1241
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:54.630
it takes fucking forever.
Go Watch the first episode of the Sopranos.

1242
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.540
It was a comedy.
It was a comedy.

1243
01:11:57.541 --> 01:12:02.541
It was a slap stick over the top comedy where Ed Falco had a fucking machine gun

1244
01:12:03.331 --> 01:12:05.700
and her daughter was trying to climb into the window at night.

1245
01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:09.120
She's out there with an AK 47 pointing it at her.
Yeah,

1246
01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:12.580
because metro was trying to sneak back at,
she had snuck out of the house.
Yeah,

1247
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:15.330
exactly.
It was a joke.
It was a hilarious,

1248
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:19.680
like loopy over the top mob show and then it became this intense,

1249
01:12:19.681 --> 01:12:23.970
incredible drama and one of the most realistic shows in human history,

1250
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:25.530
but it didn't start out like that.

1251
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:28.530
It's weird to see shows kind of take that evolution.

1252
01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:30.780
I think that like eastbound and down has done that.

1253
01:12:30.781 --> 01:12:35.670
That went from a very funny comedy and now it's kind of like this drama show,

1254
01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.980
Toronto [inaudible].
Have you seen any of the recent seasons?
I haven't.

1255
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:42.150
Like I can't.
I,
I liked that guy.
I think he's fucking awesome,

1256
01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:45.400
but I can only watch that show in like short,
right.
Well,

1257
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.360
the second season and in particular,
the third season,
dude,

1258
01:12:48.361 --> 01:12:51.120
it was a fucking romantic comedy was what are we doing?

1259
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:55.350
Is this is distracting us was showing it scene from Sopranos.
Joey Diaz.
Oh,

1260
01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:58.680
he's in,
it wasn't in the Sopranos.
It was on mad TV.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1261
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.100
Um,
yeah.
Look,

1262
01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:06.750
I think it's hard to get someone to be willing to let you do your thing and put

1263
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:10.170
it on TV,
but that's the only way it's ever going to be your thing.
You have to,

1264
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.820
you just have to,
it's something you have to go through.

1265
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:15.870
It's just hard to do it on a place like FX.
But you could do it on Vimeo.

1266
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.690
You know,
you could do it on youtube when,

1267
01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:22.840
that's the beautiful thing about the Internet and that's why you're here.
Yeah,

1268
01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:26.850
no,
that is why I'm here.
That's also why you're there.
That's why you're there.

1269
01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:29.940
You're representing you.
You're representing Mack lethal.
I mean,

1270
01:13:29.941 --> 01:13:33.480
you hear the boom,
you made it.
There it is.
Everybody likes it.
Go good.

1271
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:36.630
Here I am the guy who does that well.
We want to change all that.

1272
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.360
We want to throw in a bunch of other people that you don't even know and get a

1273
01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:41.820
bunch of guys who have a totally different sensibility and listen,

1274
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:44.750
we know how to make some Shitty TV shows we've done in the past and we would

1275
01:13:44.751 --> 01:13:48.200
like to take your amazing original idea and turn it into a piece of shit that

1276
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:50.870
you're going to pull your fucking hair out and we're going to give you nine

1277
01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:55.260
writers and they're all dick heads.
He's seen this.
Joe,

1278
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.710
what is it?
It makes a Kanye west song out of nothing but like hair.
Oh,

1279
01:13:58.711 --> 01:14:01.850
you haven't seen this?
Yeah,
he loops it.

1280
01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:06.600
Is it Dana white followed me on Twitter because of this.

1281
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:16.770
<v 12>It's took like a week.
What looper do you use by that is uh,</v>

1282
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:20.250
the fucking rolling six oh six loop machine.

1283
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.600
It has infinite loops.
And then I have one where I use my phone,

1284
01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.300
which is a program called everyday

1285
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.420
and you're doing all this by just pressing the loop.

1286
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:37.170
She and making noises with a hairdryer and for people who are listening to this

1287
01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:40.650
at home going,
what the fuck am I listening to?
You have to see it.

1288
01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:45.920
This is a Niggas in Paris by Kanye and Jay Z had no idea how to check it out.

1289
01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:51.390
You know what ball tell hard that my whole head shiny so it's easy to find

1290
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:54.510
what's real gang to am I fucking like me.
Could you please remind me?

1291
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.980
Bulk sell hard.
That shit's great.

1292
01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:58.060
Got to sweep all the hair when the trash again got above it.

1293
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:58.831
Got to keep it really short.

1294
01:14:58.831 --> 01:15:00.860
I got to shave it or I'm looking like employee car dash she gets to,

1295
01:15:00.861 --> 01:15:01.271
you got my ball.

1296
01:15:01.271 --> 01:15:04.500
Bad ass like Dana white when I wrote up on your pitchy gas and it's like Prius

1297
01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:07.230
and I bet you when I'm high as fuck,
like I'm Nick Diaz and never get rehab.

1298
01:15:07.231 --> 01:15:10.100
I'm getting cinematic with it.
Anybody want to try to fuck with you

1299
01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:12.840
better get them in a river.

1300
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:15.940
<v 4>You did another one where you looped where uh,</v>

1301
01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.240
you were making noises with your mouth and with the phone.
Yeah,

1302
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:22.690
that's the one I talk about.
I mentioned your name in your mind.

1303
01:15:22.691 --> 01:15:23.890
So open like I'm Joe Rogan.

1304
01:15:23.891 --> 01:15:27.970
I use this program called everyday looper and I probably made this guy fucking

1305
01:15:27.971 --> 01:15:30.280
happening.
You did it with your phone?
Yeah,
I did it with this.

1306
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:33.360
This is the program right here.
Wow.
Um,
and it,

1307
01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:38.020
it just infinitely loops and basically I use this thing called apogee where I

1308
01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:41.350
could plug it into my phone and record an acoustic guitar.

1309
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:45.010
And then I made a lot of noises with my mouth and just looped them,
whistled,

1310
01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.540
harmonize with the muscle.
And then,

1311
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.600
and then I did a song over it and I just have found that in 2013 it,

1312
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:54.040
it's,
it's not enough,

1313
01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.270
especially if you're not going to get radio play and you're not going to get on

1314
01:15:58.271 --> 01:16:02.370
MTV.
If you want to stand out,
you have to use new forms of,

1315
01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.610
of making songs,
use technology.
Um,
you know,

1316
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.320
hair products,
whatever it is,

1317
01:16:08.321 --> 01:16:10.840
you have to do things that are pushing the envelope.
Yeah.

1318
01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:13.480
And we've already done everything.
We've already written.

1319
01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:16.600
Every song we can possibly write with all the instruments that we have.

1320
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.220
So what I'm trying to do is incorporate pancakes or incorporate my iPhone or

1321
01:16:21.221 --> 01:16:23.050
incorporate hair products,
whatever it is.

1322
01:16:23.051 --> 01:16:26.530
It's going to push the envelope and make it stand out a little bit more.
Yeah.

1323
01:16:26.531 --> 01:16:27.510
This is it right here,
right?

1324
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:28.413
<v 1>Yeah.
This is it.</v>

1325
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:40.010
This is crazy.
And then you bust out a guitar in the middle of this

1326
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.710
poor guy that makes this

1327
01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:51.030
<v 13>everyday looper program has to owe me fucking $250,000 for how many of these</v>

1328
01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:53.360
assaults since.

1329
01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:58.200
So you make this and that's all you have to do is do that once and then it
loops.

1330
01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:00.240
They didn't put it up.
Then I add another one to it

1331
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.240
and you can stack them over top of each other too in this program.
Second,

1332
01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:09.260
you can go out to like,
can you do and all this in real time.
Yeah.

1333
01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.170
And then I harmonize right

1334
01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:14.670
here.

1335
01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:28.270
Oh,
we stopped.

1336
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:31.720
Never protest.
Protested a dead soldiers.

1337
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.390
I'm losing my hair,
but it'll be Scott.

1338
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:40.160
Never judge the woman for taking that on the woman's view with a fallen

1339
01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:41.093
sometimes.

1340
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.680
And I mean sometimes I might even text message while I drive,

1341
01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:51.010
but I've never,
thanks God.
When a question is your birth child,

1342
01:17:51.011 --> 01:17:54.260
the shuck and Jive,
what's it to you?

1343
01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.870
You got something so sick just brushed under Google with so ugly,

1344
01:17:58.900 --> 01:17:59.733
brutal

1345
01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.950
<v 4>bow.
What this was in sandy hook happened.
I'm from Kansas City,</v>

1346
01:18:05.951 --> 01:18:08.320
so on 20 minutes away from Topeka,
Kansas,

1347
01:18:08.321 --> 01:18:13.321
where the Westboro Baptist churches we've experienced for our whole lives,

1348
01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:19.120
the Phelps family,
the roper family,
always protesting.
Um,
you know,

1349
01:18:19.121 --> 01:18:23.170
like if a soldier dies in Afghanistan and they have a funeral for him,

1350
01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:27.190
they will protest it and say that God is the reason that it happened because

1351
01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:30.460
America is a fag enabling country.

1352
01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.800
So Sandy Hook happened and all the children were,
were,
you know,

1353
01:18:35.801 --> 01:18:40.280
executed and they were going to go out there and protest the fucking candlelight

1354
01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:44.650
vigil for all the children,
um,
that were shot in that tragedy.

1355
01:18:44.651 --> 01:18:49.390
So I made a song,
but I,
I'm very,
very stern in,

1356
01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:52.600
austere in,
in.
I don't like to make songs.

1357
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:56.090
If I feel I'm benefiting off of a tragedy,
it has to be completely genuine.

1358
01:18:56.091 --> 01:18:59.050
And this is just not,
I was getting ready to have a baby in two months.

1359
01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:01.920
So it was just something that I really connected with.
Um,

1360
01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:05.950
and I kind of had that idea laying around of using my phone and the whistle on

1361
01:19:05.951 --> 01:19:10.570
the guitar.
So then I,
I just put the lyrics over it.
And,
uh,
I actually,

1362
01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.830
one of the greatest accomplishments of that song is I met and I'm now friends

1363
01:19:14.831 --> 01:19:19.230
with Megan Phelps Roper,
who was the most outspoken of the,

1364
01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:23.860
the Westboro Baptist church up until about a year ago where she decided that she

1365
01:19:23.861 --> 01:19:27.730
no longer agreed with the ideal she was indoctrinated with and left the charge

1366
01:19:27.731 --> 01:19:31.170
and is now exiled from the church.
So she was the most vocal she was on.

1367
01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:36.040
She was like their social media,
a person that would be on Twitter.

1368
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:40.520
She argued with Kevin Smith a lot on Twitter,
um,
and made a lot of webs,
uh,

1369
01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:41.890
youtube videos.

1370
01:19:41.891 --> 01:19:45.250
And in websites to promote the Westboro Baptist church and everything they stand

1371
01:19:45.251 --> 01:19:48.410
for.
So what happened?
How did she a snap out of it?
She,

1372
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:50.740
there's a very long and interesting article,

1373
01:19:50.741 --> 01:19:53.110
I can't remember the website that it is,

1374
01:19:53.111 --> 01:19:58.111
but she explains that she hit a ceiling at one point and realized that her

1375
01:19:58.751 --> 01:20:03.751
family does not have exclusive rights to decide what is and isn't right or wrong

1376
01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.090
and her whole thing is she,

1377
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:11.190
she just feels like they represent hate and they don't represent love and that

1378
01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:15.180
she just kind of grew up and realized she was indoctrinated as a child.
Wow.

1379
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:19.140
That's a fascinating case.
Yeah.
So she,
an interesting document she wrote me.

1380
01:20:19.141 --> 01:20:23.370
Oh totally.
And she wrote me a very,
very long email that said,

1381
01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:28.400
I just wanted to know if you would forgive me and I wanted to apologize to you

1382
01:20:28.651 --> 01:20:31.320
for anything that I ever said.
And she never said anything about me,

1383
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:35.000
but she saw that video and,
and just said it.

1384
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.570
It hit home and I miss my family a lot and I've been exiled by them and we

1385
01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:44.690
developed a friendship over it and now she's on kind of a mission to find out

1386
01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:48.810
who she is and what she thinks and what she feels.

1387
01:20:48.811 --> 01:20:52.810
But she knows she doesn't agree with the FAM,
but they don't,
if you leave their,

1388
01:20:52.811 --> 01:20:55.260
their ideals,
they fucking exile you.

1389
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.130
She hasn't talked to any of her family and like a year.
Wow.
Well she's lucky.

1390
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.830
Fuck them.
Fuck them.

1391
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:04.260
Just the idea that you could grow up in an environment like that and be

1392
01:21:04.261 --> 01:21:06.330
indoctrinated to that thinking.
It's very real.

1393
01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.810
There's children right now that if they're protesting,

1394
01:21:09.811 --> 01:21:13.110
which I'm sure that they are,
have signs that say,
you know,

1395
01:21:13.111 --> 01:21:17.910
American troops dying is a blessing from God because America is a fag enabling

1396
01:21:17.911 --> 01:21:22.590
country.
Yeah.
It's all,
um,
you've,
you've seen Jesus camp.
I love it.
Yeah.

1397
01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:25.200
That takes,
that takes place in independence,
Missouri,

1398
01:21:25.201 --> 01:21:29.130
which is 20 minutes the opposite way.
That lady that speaks in tongues.

1399
01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:33.180
The fucking,
the weird chick that has the,
the camp,
the uh,

1400
01:21:33.181 --> 01:21:35.010
I don't remember what her name is.
She has the curly hair.

1401
01:21:35.011 --> 01:21:37.560
She's kind of frumpy and she'll randomly start going there.

1402
01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:40.830
Scott can speak in tongues.
She's an independence Missouri.

1403
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:41.970
That's right up the street.

1404
01:21:41.971 --> 01:21:46.971
We have the biggest population of evangelists and where I live and that's maybe

1405
01:21:47.641 --> 01:21:52.050
one of the reasons why I stay because I'm not around a bunch of like progressive

1406
01:21:52.051 --> 01:21:56.370
creatives.
I'm around against very volatile,
non tolerant people,

1407
01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.260
intolerant people and that's why you stay.

1408
01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:02.730
It's maybe one of the reasons because I feel like it fuels some of the stuff

1409
01:22:02.731 --> 01:22:06.390
that I do and I'm in a different environment than a lot of musicians and writers

1410
01:22:06.391 --> 01:22:09.660
are.
So it gives you a different perspective.
Gives me a different perspective.

1411
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:10.643
Yeah,

1412
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:14.970
that sounds like a nice excuse for staying and kind of,

1413
01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:20.130
there's some good things about it.
Yeah.
It's cheap.
Rent,
clean water.

1414
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:24.690
Our evangelists.
Well,
I think because of the Internet,

1415
01:22:24.691 --> 01:22:27.690
we've talked about this on the show many times before that I think there's

1416
01:22:27.691 --> 01:22:30.630
pockets of cool people all over the place.
Everywhere because of the Internet.

1417
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.820
Yeah.
Everywhere.
Yeah.
It didn't use to be,

1418
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:36.780
it really starts with what kids are exposed to.
Kids are exposed to this.

1419
01:22:36.781 --> 01:22:39.120
They stay in the neighborhood that grow up become parents.

1420
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:42.120
What were they exposed to as a developing as they're becoming a human being?

1421
01:22:42.121 --> 01:22:45.360
What?
What made them think that this is something to aspire to.

1422
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.900
If you grew up around a bunch of Fred Phelps type characters can really fuck

1423
01:22:48.901 --> 01:22:53.130
your perspective.
Sure.
But nowadays you get so much more input.

1424
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.600
You're getting like this woman I'm sure had a lot of it had to be fueled by her

1425
01:22:57.601 --> 01:23:00.150
media appearances and the feedback that she got from that,

1426
01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:03.300
but a lot of it had to be fueled by the Internet itself.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1427
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:06.040
Small town kids all across America that will get to

1428
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:09.910
<v 9>listen to podcasts now and read blogs and get to watch documentaries on their</v>

1429
01:23:09.911 --> 01:23:13.810
computer and be turned on to something by on Twitter where they'd never would

1430
01:23:13.811 --> 01:23:14.180
have had

1431
01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:18.110
<v 4>oh before they were so isolated in and all they heard was the ideals that were</v>

1432
01:23:18.111 --> 01:23:19.640
shoved down their throats constantly.

1433
01:23:19.641 --> 01:23:22.420
So I think that it's a great thing for just the,

1434
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:26.720
the evolution of the youth mind because they're going to be able to break away a

1435
01:23:26.721 --> 01:23:31.130
lot earlier.
Like when we came,
I came up in a fucking Presbyterian family.

1436
01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.810
My parents were,
were religious,

1437
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:37.870
and I didn't leave the faith and stop believing until I was 23 when I lost my

1438
01:23:38.961 --> 01:23:42.110
mom.
And I think that forced me to confront the idea of death.

1439
01:23:42.111 --> 01:23:43.460
And I realized I wasn't afraid of it.

1440
01:23:43.461 --> 01:23:47.420
And it sent me on this whole spiritual journey where I realized,
you know,

1441
01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.610
I'm 32 so this is nine years ago,
nine years at,

1442
01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:53.600
this was nine years ago as a three days ago,

1443
01:23:53.601 --> 01:23:58.580
September 7th,
2004 and up until that point,

1444
01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.550
I was blindly faithful.

1445
01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.400
I just believed because that's what you do when Kansas,
that's what,

1446
01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:06.141
that's what you do.

1447
01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:10.040
You go to church and you believe in Jesus and atheists are weird.

1448
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:14.570
Satan worshipers.
And so I feel,
yeah,
so then I,
I,

1449
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:18.080
I lost my mother and I think what that forced me to do,
and this is,

1450
01:24:18.630 --> 01:24:21.650
we didn't have a whole lot of Internet access for the information that we do
now,

1451
01:24:21.651 --> 01:24:26.651
but what it forced me to do was just confront the idea that religion exists

1452
01:24:27.081 --> 01:24:31.520
solely predicated upon the idea that people are afraid of death and no longer

1453
01:24:31.521 --> 01:24:32.330
existing.

1454
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:36.290
And because we have no ability to explain what has happened up until this point

1455
01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:40.010
and you know,
their history becomes very murky the further you go back.

1456
01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:43.880
So fascinating.
Yeah.
No Presbyterian.

1457
01:24:43.881 --> 01:24:46.790
What exactly does that I,
you know what?
I don't know.

1458
01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:51.950
We have in Kansas City we have evangelists,
Methodists,
Lutherans,

1459
01:24:51.951 --> 01:24:56.660
Presbyterians,
Catholics,
no Muslims,
no Islams,
no Muslims,

1460
01:24:56.661 --> 01:25:00.260
no Buddhist,
none of that shit.
All dangerous.
That's a,
lots of Jesus.

1461
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:03.620
Huge churches,
huge places for Jesus.

1462
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:06.520
<v 9>I grew up,
I was Catholic until I was in first grade.</v>

1463
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.380
So for what happened in first grade,
they cured me.
They cured me of Catholicism.

1464
01:25:11.381 --> 01:25:15.550
I went to first grade Catholic school and it was just so crazy.
I knew that,

1465
01:25:15.551 --> 01:25:18.360
that there was all bullshit.
I knew they were all out of their mind.

1466
01:25:18.361 --> 01:25:21.010
I didn't want have anything to do with Catholicism before that.

1467
01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:24.670
My parents broke up when I was a little kid and I was very insecure when I was

1468
01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:27.270
like five.
My parents broke up and uh,

1469
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:29.200
we were still living in New Jersey at the time.
I'm,

1470
01:25:29.201 --> 01:25:31.870
all of a sudden we were in an apartment and we went live with my dad anymore.

1471
01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:35.650
My Dad was really violent.
It was like,
it was a lot going on that was really bad.

1472
01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:38.560
And so I was really religious as a small boy.

1473
01:25:38.561 --> 01:25:40.720
I thought that God was going to take care of everything and that would be the

1474
01:25:40.721 --> 01:25:42.760
secret.
There'll be a,
God would take care of everything.

1475
01:25:42.761 --> 01:25:44.690
And I don't know who else was telling me that.

1476
01:25:44.691 --> 01:25:49.110
I probably my grandmother or something.
Well,
I went to a Catholic school,
uh,

1477
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:55.020
our lady of chest to Hova was the name of the place and it was so fucking nasty

1478
01:25:55.601 --> 01:26:00.550
and joy lists and they were so evil that I knew it was bullshit,
a new,

1479
01:26:00.551 --> 01:26:02.140
it was all lies.
I just,

1480
01:26:02.141 --> 01:26:06.020
this woman who the nun was such a fucking ratchet current,

1481
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:10.850
she helped me so much and just giving me no way out of it.

1482
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:12.920
It was no way but to abandon it.

1483
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:18.000
She was so nasty and Shitty and I just got to see the,

1484
01:26:18.001 --> 01:26:21.800
the machine underneath.
Uh,
this was what she was promoting.

1485
01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:24.250
So did you become an atheist in first grade?
No,

1486
01:26:24.251 --> 01:26:27.860
I would never say I was an atheist.
I'm not an atheist today.
Um,
what I am,

1487
01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:31.010
I like the term agnostic,
but what I,

1488
01:26:31.011 --> 01:26:33.830
what I am is a person who hasn't died yet.
Right.

1489
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:35.480
And I think anybody who hasn't died yet,

1490
01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:38.510
it's just talking shit about what comes now.
That's a very,

1491
01:26:38.511 --> 01:26:41.210
very good way of looking at it.
Especially if you've done mushrooms.

1492
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:45.170
If you've done,
done,
done a lot of mushrooms,
if you've done psychedelics,

1493
01:26:45.171 --> 01:26:47.040
if you've done dimethyltryptamine,
it's actually,

1494
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.170
I have definitely done diamond field tryptamine too.

1495
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:54.110
Once it gives me at least the ID.
And,
and I'm not saying that.

1496
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.870
Here's a,
is an important point about psychedelics.

1497
01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.170
It's not necessarily real.

1498
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.260
Like what you're seeing when you're having a psychedelic experience,

1499
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.150
it doesn't mean you went to another dimension.

1500
01:27:05.151 --> 01:27:06.530
Even though it feels like another dimension.

1501
01:27:06.531 --> 01:27:09.590
It doesn't mean you're talking to intelligent entities that give you the secret

1502
01:27:09.591 --> 01:27:11.840
of life and the secret of happiness.
It doesn't mean that.

1503
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:17.350
But whether or not you really are or are not traveling to other dimensions when

1504
01:27:18.411 --> 01:27:21.350
you're on psychedelics,
the experience is exactly the same.

1505
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:25.400
So it really is as if,
whether or not it's true,

1506
01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.480
but it is as if you are traveling to another dimension and interacting with

1507
01:27:29.481 --> 01:27:34.481
intelligent beings and intelligent beings that give you truth and honesty and,

1508
01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:39.890
and see through all your bullshit and see through your behavior and can explain

1509
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:43.310
how to live this life in a happy way to you.
And if you listen to them,

1510
01:27:43.311 --> 01:27:46.940
it actually works.
Doesn't mean it's not a figment of your imagination.

1511
01:27:46.941 --> 01:27:47.774
It might be,

1512
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:52.400
but the point is that even if it really is just your imagination,

1513
01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:56.270
there's no difference in the actual experience itself than if it was really

1514
01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:59.090
happening.
Yeah,
I compare it is the same,

1515
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.110
but do you think that because when people talk about like when I smoked DMT,

1516
01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:06.980
the one time that I did and it was spellbinding,

1517
01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.360
I mean fucking,
when you talk about going to another dimension,
you really do.

1518
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:14.570
And I don't think it's,
it's like a figment of your imagination.

1519
01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:18.650
I just think you inter parts of your consciousness that you are unable to access

1520
01:28:18.651 --> 01:28:23.300
unless you're,
unless you do hallucinogens.
It's all speculation.
I,
I've,

1521
01:28:23.301 --> 01:28:27.500
I've come to the understanding that there's a lot of people that try to define

1522
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:30.920
psychedelic experiences and they tried to say,
well,
this is what's happening.

1523
01:28:30.921 --> 01:28:31.730
And some,

1524
01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:35.870
a lot of them are like really intelligent people who are skeptics and they're

1525
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:39.620
kind of debunking the psychedelic experience.
And I,

1526
01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:41.660
I've come to the realization that no one knows.

1527
01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:45.110
No one knows and no one will know it unless we have a much,
much,

1528
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:50.111
much deeper understanding of the actual human mind and consciousness itself.

1529
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:54.650
When they start having the ability to transport consciousness into other

1530
01:28:54.651 --> 01:28:58.160
external devices like a,
an artificial body or something like that.

1531
01:28:58.460 --> 01:28:59.870
Things that people like Ray Kurzweil,

1532
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:02.220
I believe we're going to be able to do some day,
then

1533
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.280
<v 4>maybe they'll have a deeper understanding of what exactly the psychedelic</v>

1534
01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.170
experiences.
But until right now,

1535
01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:09.960
right now what we know is there's some chemicals that go into some,

1536
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:13.530
they pass through the blame brain blood barrier and then it's this really

1537
01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:17.790
unpredictable pattern of images and experiences and feelings come up and we

1538
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:18.870
don't really know what it is.

1539
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:22.890
But we do know that those experiences also happen when you're about to die.

1540
01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.950
We know that those experiences happen in,
you know,

1541
01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:28.440
people that are going through near death experiences.

1542
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:29.930
So it's like sort of the same time,

1543
01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:32.490
I've always wondered if that's what a near death experience was.

1544
01:29:32.491 --> 01:29:36.120
It's maybe the body thought it was going to shut down permanently and released

1545
01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:38.220
all the DMT and then maybe revived.
So,

1546
01:29:38.221 --> 01:29:41.550
but you still get to experience that could be,
I've always thought of that.

1547
01:29:41.551 --> 01:29:43.830
Like what if you shoot yourself in the head?
If you shoot yourself in the head,

1548
01:29:43.831 --> 01:29:48.340
it's like you don't get a chance to go to the next level.
Lasted all addie.
Yeah.

1549
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:51.690
Or is it so good that it recognizes as the bullet hits your skull,

1550
01:29:51.691 --> 01:29:56.220
it just bursts out.
It's just,
it's just like over link.
Yeah.
Fucking amazing.

1551
01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:59.430
One thing I will say about psychedelic experiences,

1552
01:29:59.431 --> 01:30:01.170
and I've heard you talk about this before,

1553
01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:06.171
is invariably they always take me and guide me and hold me over any issues that

1554
01:30:09.091 --> 01:30:12.360
I have in my life.
And it's like a fucking giant magnifying glass.

1555
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:15.930
And last time I ate mushrooms,
it was about three years ago and I had some,

1556
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:17.280
some issues going on with,

1557
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:21.360
I felt like I wasn't working hard enough and I wasn't treating Sir some of my

1558
01:30:21.361 --> 01:30:26.361
friends and contemporaries with enough respect and I ate mushrooms in within

1559
01:30:26.611 --> 01:30:28.680
like 10 minutes.
It was on an empty stomach.

1560
01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:33.330
I was having terrible fucking panic attack.
And you know,

1561
01:30:33.331 --> 01:30:34.650
some people call it a bad trip,

1562
01:30:34.651 --> 01:30:37.680
but I think it's actually a good experience because it was necessary and

1563
01:30:37.681 --> 01:30:42.060
therapeutic for me in variably this happens and if I have no issues going on,

1564
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:47.020
I don't necessarily feel that way.
So it's,
it's good for,
for those things.
I,

1565
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:50.730
I agree totally that,
that uncomfortable feeling.
It's very important to me.

1566
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:52.830
It's a terrible one.
It's actually happening,

1567
01:30:52.831 --> 01:30:54.870
but it's such a growth experience when it's,

1568
01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:57.070
when you go through it and when it's done,
it's,

1569
01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.010
it's like getting off of a roller coaster.

1570
01:30:59.011 --> 01:31:01.670
You just kind of feel euphoric and relaxed and,

1571
01:31:01.671 --> 01:31:04.530
and you come out with a different piece of mind.

1572
01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:08.510
And I've always,
I've,
anytime I've ever done them,

1573
01:31:08.511 --> 01:31:10.650
I found any issues in my life that I had,

1574
01:31:10.651 --> 01:31:14.640
I could resolve in a healthier way or at least had a better perspective on them.

1575
01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:18.270
Yeah,
those uncomfortable moments.
It's almost like,
you know,
you have a,

1576
01:31:18.271 --> 01:31:21.600
a subconscious and it just sort of gets filled.

1577
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:25.380
There's subconscious gets filled with this one bullshit thing that it's like

1578
01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:30.630
then once you kill off the consciousness and enter into the psychedelic state,

1579
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:31.710
it's like,
look man,

1580
01:31:31.711 --> 01:31:34.680
we've got a backlog of bullshit that you've been saving up here in this

1581
01:31:34.681 --> 01:31:38.240
warehouse.
What do you want to do with it?
And you're like,
no,
it was all there.

1582
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:38.700
Well,

1583
01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:43.700
I have a friend that was very heavily for seven eight years addicted to

1584
01:31:44.011 --> 01:31:48.870
Oxycontin and tried to kick 30 40 different times.
Didn't work.

1585
01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:53.460
So he went down to Saint Kitts and did Ibogaine therapy.

1586
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:58.790
And what I've heard about Ibogaine in comparison to even DMT or acid is it

1587
01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.160
fucking

1588
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:04.600
<v 0>digs excavates everything that you have from when you were a child,</v>

1589
01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:09.190
even everything that you have,
the deepest,
darkest shit that you have buried,

1590
01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:13.360
covered in cobwebs,
and it brings it all out and it resets your body.

1591
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:17.560
And people will come away.
Not only not addicted to painkillers,

1592
01:32:17.561 --> 01:32:21.520
but he stopped smoking cigarettes,
stop drinking caffeinated beverages,

1593
01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:25.030
stopped eating any artificial sweetener or corn syrup,

1594
01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:30.360
and just experienced a very terribly painful memories from his childhood.

1595
01:32:31.571 --> 01:32:36.520
And it almost cleanse him out entirely.
And that's what Ibogaine does,

1596
01:32:36.521 --> 01:32:41.170
is it essentially resets your entire existence on a physical,
mental,

1597
01:32:41.171 --> 01:32:45.550
and emotional level.
And so many people are,
you know,
of course it's illegal here,

1598
01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:50.290
but so many people are being saved from opiates and other addictive substances

1599
01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:53.770
with it.
Yeah,
it's really kind of stupid.
It's not just kind of stupid.

1600
01:32:53.771 --> 01:32:57.390
It's incredibly stupid that it's illegal and it's incredibly infant tile.
This,

1601
01:32:57.391 --> 01:32:59.800
this country that we live in is really trapped.

1602
01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:05.330
We are absolutely trapped by money and were trapped by influence of the people

1603
01:33:05.441 --> 01:33:07.300
with money that want to continue making money.

1604
01:33:07.301 --> 01:33:10.780
So they've stopped a bunch of things from being available and psychedelics being

1605
01:33:10.781 --> 01:33:15.620
a big one because there's so consciousness changing and they can affect the,
the,

1606
01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.720
they can affect so much of the system,
whether it be financial,

1607
01:33:19.721 --> 01:33:21.520
whether it be political,
governmental,

1608
01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.080
when you incorporate something that can radically change consciousness,

1609
01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:30.220
almost instantly,
like your friend immediately kicks cigarettes,

1610
01:33:30.221 --> 01:33:34.180
kicks oxies becomes as different person.
Those type of radical shifts,

1611
01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:38.290
you apply them to a population and the number one issue that you're going to

1612
01:33:38.291 --> 01:33:40.850
have is you're not gonna be able to lie to those people's easily anyway.

1613
01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:44.770
Absolutely.
People are lying to themselves.
They're easy to lie to,

1614
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:47.200
and as soon as they're not lying to themselves anymore,

1615
01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:50.300
they'll recognize when you're lying to them.
You know,
it's,

1616
01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:54.520
I'm really good at spotting bullshit artists and one of the reasons I'm really

1617
01:33:54.521 --> 01:33:57.180
good at spotting bullshit artists is cause I don't pull shit.
You know,

1618
01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:01.240
I tried to be very nice.
I try to be as nice as I can as much as I can.

1619
01:34:01.241 --> 01:34:04.840
I really do put a lot of effort into that,
but I'm not hearing it.

1620
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:07.300
If you're full of Shit,
you're do,
you're not helping yourself.

1621
01:34:07.301 --> 01:34:09.400
You're not helping me.
I'm not trying to be mean to you,

1622
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:10.930
but I'm just saying that's nonsense.

1623
01:34:10.931 --> 01:34:13.840
You know it's nonsense and I know it's nonsense.
Let's just stop right here.

1624
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:17.890
That's probably why you like psychedelics because they don't tolerate bullshit.

1625
01:34:17.891 --> 01:34:21.190
There's no bullshit,
no bullshit at all.
There's no bullshit in a pot Brownie,
bro.

1626
01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:25.460
Pot Brownie is of psychedelic.
As far as I'm concerned,
they are psychedelic code.

1627
01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.970
The first time I ever ate a pot Brownie,

1628
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.600
it was one of those like ignorant experiences where you,

1629
01:34:30.601 --> 01:34:34.120
you eat one and you're like,
you know,
an hour goes by and you're just kinda like,

1630
01:34:34.150 --> 01:34:38.800
Eh,
this is kind of mellow.
So you eat another one and then two,

1631
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:42.580
three hours later your fucking eyes are dilating.
I puked.
I mean it was crazy.

1632
01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.180
I mean,
did you trip?
Yeah.
Bottom line.
You fucking trip.
You trip.
It's a real,

1633
01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:47.650
it's a real psychoactive substance.

1634
01:34:47.651 --> 01:34:50.040
We've talked about it ad nauseum on the show before,

1635
01:34:50.050 --> 01:34:52.840
before was in the interest of people that have never heard it before.
There's a,

1636
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.290
there's a chemical called 11 hydroxy metabolite.
It's produced by your liver.

1637
01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:58.490
When you eat pot,
it's five times more psychoactive

1638
01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:01.940
<v 9>than THC.
It's a completely different experience and it's not available to you</v>

1639
01:35:01.941 --> 01:35:03.290
psychoactively when you smoke it.

1640
01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:07.550
So that's why like I've given brownies to people before and they go do this was

1641
01:35:07.551 --> 01:35:10.640
fucking laced man.
There's something else in here,
man.
No,

1642
01:35:10.641 --> 01:35:14.860
that is what had happened.
That it is what happens when you get a hold of,
of,

1643
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:16.560
of an edible marijuana products,

1644
01:35:17.490 --> 01:35:20.280
<v 4>70 years old and hadn't smoked weed or,</v>

1645
01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:22.680
or anything since the 60s.

1646
01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:26.370
And within the last three or four months,
uh,

1647
01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:30.660
my step mom is having a lot of nerve pain in her back and she asked,

1648
01:35:30.661 --> 01:35:33.390
they asked if I could acquire some marijuana for them.

1649
01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:35.640
So I got him a little bit to smoke and they enjoyed it.

1650
01:35:35.850 --> 01:35:39.360
And his friend that he plays acoustic guitar with,

1651
01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.600
they smoked one night and to return the favor,

1652
01:35:42.601 --> 01:35:47.490
he gave him my dad some cookies and my dad ate a cookie and my step mom ate a

1653
01:35:47.491 --> 01:35:50.040
cookie and it was the most fucking disaster is

1654
01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:52.780
<v 9>du Du,
Du,
Du,
Du,
Du.</v>

1655
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.460
I mean phone call at two in the morning,

1656
01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.540
just like you need to come save us.
Come take us to the hospital.
I mean,

1657
01:36:00.541 --> 01:36:05.280
it was awful.
And I was like,
what did you do?
We ate pot cookies.
You're fine.

1658
01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.820
Go to sleep.
It will eventually fade.
Just go over there and give him a hug.
Yeah.

1659
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:12.840
Where was he driving distance from you?
Yeah,
he's driving business from me.

1660
01:36:12.841 --> 01:36:15.120
He'll give him a hug.
He's all right.
He's all right.

1661
01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:16.860
That's when you break out the fake thing.

1662
01:36:16.861 --> 01:36:20.910
Like just drink a cup of milk and within 30 minutes everything will be fine.

1663
01:36:20.911 --> 01:36:24.000
Like you have to almost trick.
Right.
I have heard those before.

1664
01:36:24.001 --> 01:36:28.850
Like I've heard coffee that coffee is one of the best at for killing Brown hot

1665
01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.720
pot Brownie Buzz Xanax.
Mm.
I wouldn't fuck with that.

1666
01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:37.110
Xanax.
That sounds like there's not enough like literature.

1667
01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:41.540
I don't think I would add that because I know that um,

1668
01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.240
people have done Mao inhibitors,
uh,

1669
01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.770
and they've taken them with Iowasca to like try to up the effects or with

1670
01:36:49.771 --> 01:36:53.190
mushrooms or a different things to try to up the effects.

1671
01:36:53.191 --> 01:36:58.020
And it's disastrous like chemical pharmaceutical,
Mao inhibitors.
Cause you know,

1672
01:36:58.021 --> 01:37:02.370
Iowasca is a combination of orally active DMT DMT,

1673
01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:05.150
which becomes orally active because of this thing called harming,

1674
01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:06.650
which is an Mao inhibitor.
It's,

1675
01:37:06.651 --> 01:37:11.550
it's really an incredible chemical concoction that they figured out how to do
in,

1676
01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.210
in the Amazon where they take the leaves of one plant and the vine of another

1677
01:37:15.211 --> 01:37:18.960
and they combine the two of them because Mano Aiming Oxidase,

1678
01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:23.400
which is Mao kills DMT in the gut.
So when you eat it,

1679
01:37:23.401 --> 01:37:26.220
normally it gets squashed before it ever gets into your blood system.

1680
01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:31.100
But this stuff is an Mao inhibitor so it eat it.

1681
01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:35.490
Yeah.
So people have tried to fuck around and go,
Oh hey,
you know,

1682
01:37:35.491 --> 01:37:40.290
my mom's on Mao inhibitors for x disease,
whatever.
I'll just take those with it.

1683
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:42.060
And,
and apparently it's,

1684
01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.880
it's like the worst experience you could ever have in your life.

1685
01:37:44.881 --> 01:37:48.840
Like at a is your memory of I don't like move your toes and shit like that.

1686
01:37:48.841 --> 01:37:53.310
Like it can really fuck with you.
I wouldn't fuck with Xanax and pop brown is,

1687
01:37:53.311 --> 01:37:56.280
unless you really know it didn't fuck with Xanax in general.

1688
01:37:56.310 --> 01:38:01.200
<v 0>That is a severely dangerous drug that uh,
I mean there was,
you know,</v>

1689
01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:05.340
anything that will kill you if you withdraw from it.
I mean it,
it,
you know,

1690
01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:06.740
my wife has a friend,

1691
01:38:06.741 --> 01:38:10.710
it's very religious and a very anti truck would not do drugs.

1692
01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:13.920
Christian Science Christians,
I don't even drink a Mormon.

1693
01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:17.460
We don't even drink and uh,
take Xanax every night.

1694
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:20.423
Exactly.

1695
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:24.910
Like my wife will be having conversations with her and bill just drift off into

1696
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:29.790
like blah,
Blah talk knows this and she's like,
hello,
are you there?

1697
01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:34.200
Like what's going on over there?
Oh No,
no.
Nothing.
And just tell me Xanax,

1698
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:40.010
Xanax,
what they describe to people that are,
have a fear of flying.
Yeah,

1699
01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.730
cause my,
my uh,
sister takes it before.
Well yeah.

1700
01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.600
Well we're dom Irrera takes it every day.
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.

1701
01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:51.960
Dom as a Xanax issue,
he takes it every day.

1702
01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.960
He looks at it like recreationally or,
or a little bit of both.

1703
01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:57.270
He's got some sort of a prescription,
but he's,

1704
01:38:57.271 --> 01:39:01.470
he likes to booze with it so that shit is,
that's even more dangerous than,

1705
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:05.870
than like opiates or,
or meth because if you quit those too abruptly,

1706
01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:10.920
any Benzo,
I think it's Benzodiazepine team is how you say it.
Xanax,
Klonopin,

1707
01:39:10.921 --> 01:39:14.790
shit like that.
If you quit those too abruptly,
you,
your body will shut down.

1708
01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:19.310
Yeah.
What the fuck,
man.
And they're everywhere.
And they're like,

1709
01:39:19.311 --> 01:39:24.310
what are the most prescribed drugs?
Yeah.
All the popular drugs,
you know,

1710
01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.480
Adderall,
oxy,
Xanax,
these are,

1711
01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:30.000
these are the things that they're the absolute worst for you,

1712
01:39:30.001 --> 01:39:31.530
but they're the most popular.
Yeah.

1713
01:39:31.531 --> 01:39:33.840
Those are the ones that bring in all the money in.

1714
01:39:33.841 --> 01:39:38.040
And that's why Ibogaine is illegal because if people start taking Ibogaine,

1715
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:39.910
then they're going to stop taking all those other drugs.

1716
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:44.340
It's also because they don't even want to open up the dialogue for schedule one

1717
01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:45.750
substances,
any,

1718
01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:49.740
any of these drugs that were made illegal during the sweeping,

1719
01:39:49.741 --> 01:39:53.060
psychedelic legislative legislative,
uh,

1720
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:55.290
acts of a 1970.

1721
01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:58.980
That's when the a psychedelic drug laws were passed.

1722
01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.960
They were just trying to stop the hippie movement.

1723
01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:03.740
They were like trying to squash everything.
So they made everything illegal.
Well,

1724
01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.780
a lot of people don't realize that before 1970 acid was legal,

1725
01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:11.810
mushrooms were legal.
These,
you could get ahold of these four,
1970,
1970.
Yeah.

1726
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:16.540
Yeah.
Let's,
uh,
let's pull it up.
A psychedelic drug act of 1978

1727
01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:23.010
drug act.
That'd be so awesome.
If it was illegal,

1728
01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.650
well it would change the world and it did change the world.

1729
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:29.700
And there's a reason why if you go and listen to buddy Holly and then you listen

1730
01:40:29.701 --> 01:40:31.510
to Jimi Hendrix,
you know,
you,
you,

1731
01:40:31.511 --> 01:40:35.430
you're only dealing with a 10 year difference and it might as well be a billion,

1732
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:40.200
you know,
I mean,
listen to Voodoo child and listen to love,
love me,
do,
and uh,

1733
01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:42.210
and realize that this is,
you're just,
you're,

1734
01:40:42.211 --> 01:40:45.420
you're dealing with just a few not to love,
love me do isn't a great song.

1735
01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.100
But the early Beatles stuff,
it's like so simplistic.
It's so different,
you know,

1736
01:40:50.101 --> 01:40:54.040
and then listen to the white album,
you know,
listen to this.
Some of the shit

1737
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.380
<v 9>that they did once,
they were obviously trippin,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

1738
01:40:57.381 --> 01:40:59.050
It in through the bathroom window.
I mean,

1739
01:40:59.051 --> 01:41:03.250
they had some just really varying strange tunes.

1740
01:41:03.251 --> 01:41:08.251
They develop this different sort of sound and I think it changed pop culture.

1741
01:41:09.071 --> 01:41:13.930
It changed human beings.
We went from this father knows best society to,
you know,

1742
01:41:13.931 --> 01:41:15.670
to the freak brothers.
I mean,
it really,

1743
01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:18.760
it opened up all these weird doors that they were absolutely terrified.

1744
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:22.330
Classically substances like that,
uh,
make better music.

1745
01:41:22.331 --> 01:41:25.120
And then in certain cases when artists sober up,

1746
01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:29.260
their music always suffers in a prime example.
I'm not trying to shit on him,

1747
01:41:29.261 --> 01:41:32.450
but Eminem used to be on a lot of like drugs and mushrooms and,

1748
01:41:32.451 --> 01:41:34.300
and made like some amazing shit.

1749
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:37.930
And then he sobered up and he started becoming like a fucking long distance

1750
01:41:37.931 --> 01:41:41.080
runner or something.
And now it's just like sterile.

1751
01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:45.330
I'm sorry if you heard his new song.
Yeah,
he phoned fallout one in,

1752
01:41:45.670 --> 01:41:49.180
I think there's an issue,
um,
with human beings,
uh,

1753
01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:53.800
where there's a wild recklessness that enables a certain amount of creativity to

1754
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:54.940
the to happen.

1755
01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:59.020
And then you also get a bunch of success and then you,

1756
01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:03.550
you lock yourself in and you separate yourself from society and you become more

1757
01:42:03.551 --> 01:42:04.390
disconnected.

1758
01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:07.510
And then you sort of like hide from people who have more and then you're,

1759
01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:11.860
the extent of your social experiences shifts.
Things become very different.

1760
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:13.480
Like it happens with a lot of rich comics,

1761
01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:17.720
their social experiences shift and then they'd take less chances and you know,

1762
01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:20.260
something that you really have to like fight off.
Yeah.

1763
01:42:20.261 --> 01:42:23.860
They become much more comfortable in and surround themselves with people that

1764
01:42:23.861 --> 01:42:27.700
are going to validate,
maybe,
you know,
shitty.
You're not fleshed out material.

1765
01:42:27.730 --> 01:42:31.570
Yeah.
It was this,
Brian,
I saw this,
uh,
on this,
is that,

1766
01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:33.910
what was he like two nights ago?
It was he bored.

1767
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:38.520
<v 5>I,
yeah,
he was trolling.
I think he's,
yeah,
that's what I've heard is he,</v>

1768
01:42:38.670 --> 01:42:41.210
he just wasn't like making faces the whole time he has.

1769
01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:43.250
He's like something I would do.
Yeah,
it does.

1770
01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:49.270
<v 9>Yeah.
Here's,
you know,
when we announced on the UFC,
they announced once,
um,</v>

1771
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:53.200
that Ronda Rousey and Misha Tate,
we're going to be the coaches.

1772
01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:56.980
It was cats and Ghana originally,
but she got injured.
Um,
and,
uh,

1773
01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.200
like they announced it on TV and I was making all these crazy faces and so many

1774
01:43:02.201 --> 01:43:05.500
people thought it was,
I was being disrespectful that I didn't,

1775
01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:09.850
I mean they just decided to put it into that frame and decided that what I was

1776
01:43:09.851 --> 01:43:14.050
like,
I was like,
what women,
what do you like?
That was my point of view,

1777
01:43:14.051 --> 01:43:17.680
which wasn't at all.
It was women and men together.
First of all it was like,
Whoa,

1778
01:43:17.681 --> 01:43:20.350
Ronda Rousey is going to host and then it was like,
wait a minute,

1779
01:43:20.351 --> 01:43:22.870
women and men are going to be in the house together.
That's fucking crazy.

1780
01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.930
Like that was what I was saying,
but people just decide that,
you know,

1781
01:43:27.931 --> 01:43:30.230
w w uh,
facial expression is,

1782
01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.370
<v 5>you know,
you make the best facial expression.</v>

1783
01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.390
I told somebody online that if they,
somebody took off your last TV show,

1784
01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.950
they just took all the times you've made like those crazy eyes,
you know,

1785
01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:43.810
and stuff.
If the edit it all into one video of chesty making eyes,

1786
01:43:43.811 --> 01:43:46.360
it would be the coolest video on the road.
Those people,
Deb

1787
01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.650
<v 9>believed in the things that I was mocking.
Got So mad at me.
Facial expressions,</v>

1788
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:54.110
what were you,
everything,
every that that's the problem with doing that show.

1789
01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:57.170
I really enjoyed doing that show on it and then [inaudible] was really awesome

1790
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.960
to work with.
They're great people and I really liked those guys.

1791
01:44:00.230 --> 01:44:02.750
But the real problem with doing that show is it's,

1792
01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:06.650
unless you're talking about a real subject,
like um,
the transhumanism,

1793
01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:11.480
like the idea of a technology replacing human bodies and things along those

1794
01:44:11.481 --> 01:44:13.550
lines.
Sure.
Or infectious diseases.

1795
01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.290
Something that was real that we actually could study.

1796
01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:17.600
Then you're talking to the same type of people,

1797
01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:21.890
these really nutty white guys who believe in a bunch of nutty shit that is

1798
01:44:21.891 --> 01:44:25.880
probably pretty easily disproved,
right.
If it,
if it's not easily disproven,

1799
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:28.400
it's at the very least marginalized fairly quickly.

1800
01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:31.400
Like there's things that cannot be disproven,
like alien life,

1801
01:44:31.401 --> 01:44:34.640
which I believe in chorus.
Yeah.

1802
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:36.860
Kind of be stupid.

1803
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:39.770
Not only do I believe in it just because a lot of people think that I,

1804
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:42.620
I didn't believe in it from doing that Shell.
They were like,
you know,
Oh,

1805
01:44:42.621 --> 01:44:43.431
you know,
he fucking,

1806
01:44:43.431 --> 01:44:45.680
you think you're above it and you don't even believe in aliens.

1807
01:44:45.681 --> 01:44:48.110
You know how stupid that is?
Like that's not true at all.

1808
01:44:48.111 --> 01:44:50.690
I absolutely believe that there could be alien life out there.

1809
01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:54.980
I absolutely believe is most likely alien life.
In fact,
Neil degrasse Tyson,

1810
01:44:54.981 --> 01:44:59.930
when he was explaining infinity,
and this is was such a mind fuck,
but he said,

1811
01:44:59.931 --> 01:45:04.931
infinity is so enormous that not only has everything on earth in it,

1812
01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:10.240
his exact order has happened on another planet somewhere else in the universe,

1813
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:14.990
but it's happened in infinite number of times in the exact order.

1814
01:45:15.110 --> 01:45:18.800
That's how big infinity is.
Then in Finney literally has no end.

1815
01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:23.510
So if it can happen here,
and if this,
these words and these stumbles,

1816
01:45:23.511 --> 01:45:25.340
these Oms,
these you,
uh,

1817
01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.630
these have taken place and the exact same order,
the exact same move,

1818
01:45:29.631 --> 01:45:34.040
like there's been an incarnation of this podcast in this comp right now,

1819
01:45:34.041 --> 01:45:34.874
I'm just showing here.

1820
01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.250
I'm touching my fingernails to get it for no reason whatsoever.

1821
01:45:37.251 --> 01:45:40.450
I've done that somewhere else in the universe of the exact same time.

1822
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:43.280
Had a fucking insane,
yeah.
That's how big infants,

1823
01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.600
it's so big that it eventually it,
it overlaps and it happens again.

1824
01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.370
They exact pattern of what's happening.

1825
01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:53.060
Not only that it happens in infinite number of times.
That's fucking crazy.

1826
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:55.800
Cause I've heard that podcast and I,

1827
01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:58.880
the one that I thought was nuts was when he talks about if you go through a

1828
01:45:58.881 --> 01:46:03.170
black hole and then you watch the fucking universe slowly and that's,

1829
01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:06.300
that one's a little crazier.
Yeah.
All of it's crazy.
Well there's the,

1830
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:10.430
the thing that these quantum guys are saying now is that inside every black hole

1831
01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:13.070
is potentially a whole nother universe and that would,

1832
01:46:13.071 --> 01:46:16.070
a black hole may be is a doorway to another universe and these other

1833
01:46:16.071 --> 01:46:18.350
universities might have completely different laws of physics.

1834
01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:21.110
They may be completely and they might be exactly the same.

1835
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:22.790
It might just be a fractal thing.

1836
01:46:22.791 --> 01:46:26.120
We're inside every black hole is another universe with hundreds of billions of

1837
01:46:26.121 --> 01:46:30.140
galaxies and inside each one of them is another black hole.
They found out,
like,

1838
01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:34.100
I think it was the beginning of the 21st century or close to it,

1839
01:46:34.101 --> 01:46:38.030
they found out that inside every,
um,
when you look at a galaxy,

1840
01:46:38.031 --> 01:46:41.300
the center of every galaxy has a supermassive black hole that's like,

1841
01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.020
I think it's one half of 1% of the entire mass of the galaxy.

1842
01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:46.610
So the bigger the galaxy,
the bigger the black hole,

1843
01:46:46.611 --> 01:46:49.890
the exist in every single galaxy.
And they were like,
well,
this is madness.

1844
01:46:49.891 --> 01:46:52.620
Like we didn't even know this before and now we have to figure out why it's

1845
01:46:52.621 --> 01:46:55.170
there.
And so the most recent theory,

1846
01:46:55.171 --> 01:46:58.620
and they back it up with that crazy goodwill hunting math where they have a

1847
01:46:58.621 --> 01:46:59.454
chalkboard and,

1848
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:04.170
and ends and with fucking pen Jada's in the top of them.
And you're like,

1849
01:47:04.171 --> 01:47:05.520
I don't even know what the fuck you're drawing.

1850
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:08.970
But they say that that's what their calculations have,
uh,

1851
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:14.030
have sort of revealed is that most likely every galaxy has a gateway to another

1852
01:47:14.491 --> 01:47:15.360
universe inside of it.

1853
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:18.990
<v 4>Now,
come on,
man.
Everybody knows that the earth is only 7,000 years old.</v>

1854
01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:23.700
Of course,
that's,
that's what you're,
you're growing up around,
right?
100%.

1855
01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:28.320
And I'm talking like family members and I have had this discussion where they

1856
01:47:28.321 --> 01:47:32.460
say,
you know,
no,
it's about seven,
6,000,
900 something years old.

1857
01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:37.800
Humans are fucking older than that,
but that's what they believe.

1858
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.290
They believe it's called young earth.
Young Earth Christians.

1859
01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.400
They believe in a young earth.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Right?
Absolutely.

1860
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:47.310
What the fuck man did you more ronic man,

1861
01:47:48.490 --> 01:47:53.110
<v 9>there's,
um,
there was this a recent discovery that they just found,
um,</v>

1862
01:47:53.230 --> 01:47:56.860
uh,
I wanna say somewhere in South America,
they're like drilling for,

1863
01:47:57.010 --> 01:47:59.290
I put it on my Twitter,
I'll try it,
see if I can find it real quick.

1864
01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:03.460
But they found these armadillos that are the size of cars.

1865
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:07.570
They found these things that were living like just,
you know,
just the few,

1866
01:48:07.630 --> 01:48:11.140
you know,
few thousand years ago,
14,
20,000 years ago,

1867
01:48:11.141 --> 01:48:15.280
plus they found all this crazy shit that they didn't even know existed.

1868
01:48:15.281 --> 01:48:19.930
All these fossils and this is just one exploratory drilling where they were

1869
01:48:19.931 --> 01:48:22.680
trying to uh,
get to,
uh,
to,

1870
01:48:22.690 --> 01:48:25.790
to find out if there's like oil or something somewhere and they're like,
whoa,

1871
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.660
leash.

1872
01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:30.140
<v 4>I think a lot more of that is going to happen.
I mean,
what course three days ago,</v>

1873
01:48:30.141 --> 01:48:34.010
like you were saying,
the biggest volcano in the solar system was discovered.

1874
01:48:34.011 --> 01:48:36.640
So you have to wonder what else is going to be found.
Yeah.

1875
01:48:36.650 --> 01:48:39.710
We said it was not as big as the one on Mars,
but like super big,

1876
01:48:39.711 --> 01:48:44.380
like really close Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
So imagine knowing all this and,

1877
01:48:44.381 --> 01:48:48.500
and having the will to have this type of infinite imagination for what the

1878
01:48:48.501 --> 01:48:53.360
universe is and then being told that Earth is 7,000 years old and to get your

1879
01:48:53.361 --> 01:48:56.990
clothes on because we're going to Sunday school.
I mean,
that's what it,

1880
01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:01.370
that's what it's like living there.
Yeah.
And the thing is that all those people,

1881
01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:04.790
those all people,
those,
they can be cured to all those.

1882
01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:09.710
If you separated the mall and got them all,
here it is Venezuela's Jurassic Park.

1883
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:15.080
<v 9>Um,
if you took all those people and gave them psychedelic experiences and,</v>

1884
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:19.040
and brought them around people that they trusted,
that were,
you know,

1885
01:49:19.041 --> 01:49:22.520
that had been experienced and removed from it and someone who could tell them,

1886
01:49:22.521 --> 01:49:25.970
listen man,
you've just fallen into a bad pattern.
Right?
You're wrong.

1887
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.520
You're wrong.
God doesn't hate fags.
You know,
this,
this,

1888
01:49:28.521 --> 01:49:29.680
there's no such thing as a fag.

1889
01:49:29.681 --> 01:49:33.200
It's like there's gay people and straight people as humans and everybody has

1890
01:49:33.201 --> 01:49:33.860
like a different,

1891
01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:36.140
there's a reason why your hair is red and this guy's hair is black.

1892
01:49:36.141 --> 01:49:38.750
It's just genetics.
It's roll the dice.
Sometimes they turn out gang.

1893
01:49:38.751 --> 01:49:39.584
It's nothing wrong with it.

1894
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.840
Like what was your worth is apparently four point whatever billion years old.

1895
01:49:45.231 --> 01:49:48.190
You're wrong about that.
It's been around and we've been

1896
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:53.190
<v 0>here for I think one 18000th of a percentage for as long as earth has been</v>

1897
01:49:54.041 --> 01:49:57.790
around.
Human beings have existed.
That's how fucking short we've been here.
Yeah.

1898
01:49:57.791 --> 01:49:58.390
We're,

1899
01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:01.390
when you ever see those science shows where they show you the history of the

1900
01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:05.950
Earth,
Oh my God.
Like right here.
And then there's all know the Triassic area.

1901
01:50:05.951 --> 01:50:09.940
And I'll do all these other areas.
I mean we're,
we're like a few thousand years,

1902
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.090
but we're changing everything.
And that small amount of time is

1903
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:17.890
7,000 years,
man.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's not,

1904
01:50:17.891 --> 01:50:20.740
it's a 7,000 years of what human civilization.
That's what they think.

1905
01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:24.420
They think that,
you know,
a talking snake in a fucking tree and,
uh,

1906
01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:30.090
a woman and a man who,
uh,
ate an apple.
And then there was,
you know,

1907
01:50:30.130 --> 01:50:33.190
the best part about the Bible,
I'm not sure how many times you've read it,
but it,

1908
01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:38.610
we have Adam and eve and Cain and Abel and,
and then it jumps like,

1909
01:50:38.770 --> 01:50:43.120
like a couple hundred years and it never explains all the fucking incest that

1910
01:50:43.121 --> 01:50:45.490
had to have happened in order to get to that point.

1911
01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:49.600
Because if you start with two people who have children,
I mean,

1912
01:50:49.601 --> 01:50:51.890
how else are they going to breed humans?
Yeah.

1913
01:50:51.891 --> 01:50:56.720
I just have a whole bit about Adam and eve.
Did you
the ideas,

1914
01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.550
it's pretty silly.
Yeah.
And that's,

1915
01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:03.010
and I think that having a son in February is what has made me go,
okay,

1916
01:51:03.011 --> 01:51:07.240
maybe we should get out of here because I went through it and I know how it

1917
01:51:07.241 --> 01:51:08.080
affected me,

1918
01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:11.920
but I'm not sure if I want him to be exposed to some of the shit that I was

1919
01:51:11.921 --> 01:51:14.920
exposed to.
The process of becoming a parent,

1920
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:17.430
you want to start with nerf from the world texting your kitchens,

1921
01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:20.620
things that made you awesome.
Utfo man,

1922
01:51:22.150 --> 01:51:22.850
Brian,
pull,

1923
01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:27.760
pull this up cause there's a bunch of crazy photographs says out of the oil

1924
01:51:27.761 --> 01:51:31.900
emerges.
Venezuela's Jurassic Park.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's it.

1925
01:51:32.230 --> 01:51:36.550
I mean this is a really small sample that these guys pulled up.

1926
01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:41.140
These paleontologists have found treasures rivaling the bountiful oil,

1927
01:51:41.141 --> 01:51:43.840
a giant armadillo the size of a Volkswagen,

1928
01:51:43.841 --> 01:51:48.010
a crocodile bigger than a bus and a saber tooth.
Tiger oil company,

1929
01:51:48.011 --> 01:51:48.910
surveys of the soil.

1930
01:51:48.911 --> 01:51:53.911
I've uncovered a trove of fossils dating from 14,000 to 370 million years ago.

1931
01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:59.580
Many of the 12,000 recorded specimens from the different areas and now captain,

1932
01:51:59.590 --> 01:52:04.590
a tiny office of office of the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research.

1933
01:52:05.081 --> 01:52:08.480
This is incredible.
The strong smell of,
Whoa,

1934
01:52:08.481 --> 01:52:12.820
look at that guy holding that fucking skull.
This is amazing.

1935
01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:15.550
A strong smell of oil fills the room.

1936
01:52:15.551 --> 01:52:19.780
It's the sky opens a drawer of a fine filing cabinet to reveal that tar stain

1937
01:52:19.781 --> 01:52:24.781
femur of a giant six ton mastodon from 25,000 years ago.

1938
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:30.010
I got one tattooed on my hand.
Well,
how big is six tons?
It's a he.
That's 18 yeah.

1939
01:52:30.011 --> 01:52:34.570
18,000 1512 six no,
twelve thousand twelve thousand twelve thousand pounds.

1940
01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:39.580
Yeah.
There's a ton is 2000 pounds to 12,000 pound animal.
Oh my God.

1941
01:52:39.581 --> 01:52:43.060
How big is that?
Probably was a 12th how it makes her valuable.
Regular elephant.

1942
01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:47.660
How many tons?
A couple.
I don't know.
Maybe more than that.
Right.

1943
01:52:47.690 --> 01:52:51.950
You think big gala,
big ass elephant.
I don't know.
Just probably looked that up,

1944
01:52:51.951 --> 01:52:55.850
but this is pretty incredible stuff cause this is not like they went digging

1945
01:52:55.851 --> 01:52:59.600
looking for fossils.
They're looking for oil and they're finding this shit.

1946
01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:04.760
It's amazing.
Really,
really,
really,
really amazing.
Okay.

1947
01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:09.260
Let's also lacking is reliable indication that man hunted.

1948
01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:14.500
The mega fauna that we're finding and lacking are also our human fossils,

1949
01:53:14.541 --> 01:53:18.020
which is really interesting.
It's about twice the size by the way,

1950
01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:23.120
that Mastodon is about the twice the size of a,
of a big African elephant.

1951
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.580
Yeah,
about six tons.

1952
01:53:25.581 --> 01:53:29.810
So like a King fucking African elephant is six times and they were just walking

1953
01:53:29.811 --> 01:53:34.280
around.
They were just wondering around,
well,
you know,

1954
01:53:34.281 --> 01:53:37.380
then you think about like mega saurus or,
or how,

1955
01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:41.880
how many fucking tons of that those way,
you know,
mega stores.
What's a mega mega,

1956
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:44.990
this is like the giant fucking version of a tyrannosaurus,
hold on,

1957
01:53:44.991 --> 01:53:47.210
I'm going to tell you how much these way.
And she's us

1958
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:52.520
a giant tyranosaurs.
Yeah,
but they were like way bigger.
Hold on.

1959
01:53:52.521 --> 01:53:53.300
I'm going to tell you,

1960
01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:58.100
I think they believe that what was going on was that at one point in time the

1961
01:53:58.101 --> 01:54:01.940
uh,
the earth had a different oxygen level than it has today.

1962
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:06.410
Like during the Jurassic period before the meteor impact there.

1963
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:08.030
It was a much richer,

1964
01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:13.060
dense environment and I think it made it easier for animals to grow big and also

1965
01:54:13.101 --> 01:54:17.600
easier for them to move around.
That makes sense.
At the mega stores.

1966
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:22.850
Uh,
I don't think that's it.
That's it.
No,
here I'm going to meg us or us.

1967
01:54:22.851 --> 01:54:27.340
Is that a new one?
He eats through mega low source.
Sorry.
Mega low.

1968
01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:28.400
Yeah.

1969
01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.400
You know another weird thing about dinosaurs men is that we only find like what

1970
01:54:33.441 --> 01:54:34.430
made a fossil,

1971
01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:37.970
when you really stop and think about how difficult it is to actually make a

1972
01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:42.050
fossil,
especially in an area where something is eating everything.

1973
01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:45.320
I mean if you live it in the ancient dinosaur days,

1974
01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:48.320
how long did it body sit around before somebody fucking shoot it down?

1975
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:50.150
Oh fuck yeah.
And Shit it out.

1976
01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.050
Like you have to die in a mudslide in order to be preserved.
Like everything.

1977
01:54:54.051 --> 01:54:56.900
Just get it got eaten.
Those conti dinosaurs.

1978
01:54:56.901 --> 01:55:01.850
I mean nature is so good at like figuring out how to get rid of bodies.

1979
01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:05.750
Have you ever seen those videos of what happens when an elephant dies in Africa?

1980
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:09.830
No.
It's incredible.
It's incredible how quick if there's,

1981
01:55:09.831 --> 01:55:13.490
they have time lapse videos of hyenas eating an elephant and how quick.

1982
01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.020
It just becomes nothing.
It's like a couple of days,
a huge ass out.
Okay,

1983
01:55:18.021 --> 01:55:21.860
here you go.
The biggest,
this is a Argentino saurus.

1984
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:26.330
Now this is the biggest dinosaur ever.
Biggest documented dinosaur ever.

1985
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:31.570
120 feet from head to tail and weighed 100 tons.

1986
01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:38.300
100 fucking tons.
God Damn,

1987
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:39.770
that's insane.

1988
01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:43.620
Just one vertebrae of an Argentino source has over four feet thick.

1989
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:49.320
Imagine the poop one vertebrae is four feet thick.
Four feet.

1990
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:52.550
That's this wide.
That's a vertebrae.
Yeah,

1991
01:55:52.890 --> 01:55:57.030
four feet thick of vertebrae.
Holy Shit.

1992
01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:03.000
It's amazing that those things were around for hundreds of millions of years to,

1993
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.810
that's what,

1994
01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:08.190
what's the most amazing thing is we think of earth and we think of us.

1995
01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:13.250
We can't even imagine an earth without us know our earth is is like we just got

1996
01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:17.620
here.
Yeah,
just got here,
Tom.

1997
01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.530
I'm going to pull up time lapse videos.

1998
01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:24.850
<v 8>Look at that fucking thing.
Man.
Oh my God.</v>

1999
01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.500
<v 0>Is that one of the verses?
Yeah,
there's a</v>

2000
01:56:32.410 --> 01:56:35.320
silence.
Silence because even though this is an audio podcast,

2001
01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:39.110
we're standing at dinosaur pictures,
by the way.
We're 12 what'd you say,

2002
01:56:39.111 --> 01:56:43.510
you 32 I'm 46 we're a little children were,
were,
were grown up little children.

2003
01:56:43.511 --> 01:56:48.100
Yeah.
Pull up time lapse video.
A elephant devoured in seconds.

2004
01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:49.420
High powered,
uh,

2005
01:56:49.630 --> 01:56:53.890
high speed time lab shows seven days of animals feeding on an elephant carcass.

2006
01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:57.610
It's fucking crazy.
In seven days it's gone.

2007
01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:02.680
And that's an elephant.
And that's Africa.
That's not even dinosaurs.

2008
01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:07.840
Dinosaurs.
You compare a Hyena to a dinosaur.
I mean,
Shit.
T rex,

2009
01:57:07.841 --> 01:57:11.080
they believe was most likely actually a scavenger.
Yeah,
I've heard that.

2010
01:57:11.170 --> 01:57:14.620
I've heard that t rex was a scavenger.
They don't know that though for a fact.

2011
01:57:14.621 --> 01:57:17.800
They're still trying to figure it out because they also have to take into

2012
01:57:17.801 --> 01:57:21.850
consideration the fact that the bodies could move differently then because the

2013
01:57:21.851 --> 01:57:23.200
oxygen level was different.

2014
01:57:23.530 --> 01:57:26.530
The problem they have with it is they look at the body of that thing and they go

2015
01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:28.180
help fucking big as that.

2016
01:57:28.210 --> 01:57:31.620
And also trying to figure out how it walked in because they have that they,
they,

2017
01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:36.070
there's other speculations that they would walk through rivers and they would

2018
01:57:36.071 --> 01:57:40.120
use the tail to balance their large,
you know,
their heads were fucking huge.

2019
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:43.390
So they would walk through rivers and then they would go to the land and

2020
01:57:43.391 --> 01:57:46.720
scavenge to pull up the video.
Yeah.
He look at it.

2021
01:57:46.721 --> 01:57:51.220
Look how quick these things look at.
That's a Leopard Leopard Jack.

2022
01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.900
Cause this is after seven days.
There's leopard,
right?
Jaguars South American.

2023
01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:59.500
Yeah,
towards African.
Jaguar has black too.
I think some of them are,

2024
01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:04.450
I think some of them are actually a,
they have spot.
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ.

2025
01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:09.410
This Nina.
Yeah.
That's a Hyena.
Hyenas go to war I.
Ean is a monsters.
They,

2026
01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:10.700
they're scary fucking animals.

2027
01:58:10.710 --> 01:58:14.860
You've seen the video of the fucking pack of Hyenas fighting the lions and the

2028
01:58:14.861 --> 01:58:19.210
one where the hyenas starts like barking and,
and stop crying.

2029
01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:21.580
The whole gang shows up there.
There's a,

2030
01:58:21.581 --> 01:58:24.730
there's a Hyena that's getting bested by a couple of lines.
Yes.

2031
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:28.840
So you've seen that it goes,
a male lion shows up the giant one who kills hyenas.

2032
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:33.310
Well then the fucking Hyena goes and starts barking and like 40 hyenas come from

2033
01:58:33.311 --> 01:58:36.040
the mountains and then they go and fuck these lions up.
Yes,

2034
01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:40.870
they fuck up the female lions and this is one male line that's enormous that

2035
01:58:40.871 --> 01:58:42.840
they like a nickname for him.
You know,
he,

2036
01:58:42.841 --> 01:58:46.510
you comes with thunder or some crazy shit like that and he comes in and just

2037
01:58:46.511 --> 01:58:49.750
fucks up all these hygienists and kills them and snaps their backs.
Shit.

2038
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:53.100
Have you ever seen the video of the uh,
the,
this is one of my favorite youtube.

2039
01:58:53.170 --> 01:58:54.580
I'm sure you've seen this,
but it's the,

2040
01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:59.010
the bees that get addicted to alcohol and then the,

2041
01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:02.770
the worker bees will rip their legs off so they can no longer be a part of the

2042
01:59:02.771 --> 01:59:05.950
hive.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Very nice.

2043
01:59:07.570 --> 01:59:11.800
Fuck the wild.
That's all I have to say.
Fuck all that shit.

2044
01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:15.640
Pull up a lion's versus hyenas.
It's the very first video.

2045
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.400
This is a,
a confrontation between two eternal African enemies.

2046
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:24.610
See when I was a kid,
I used to think hyenas were like a nice,
like dogs,

2047
01:59:24.611 --> 01:59:28.150
like you could go up and
they're so evil.

2048
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:32.260
There's a story of a woman who was,
um,
she was a trainer.

2049
01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:35.560
She would train hyenas and uh,
one day she got limp,

2050
01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:39.100
so like twisted her ankle and these hyenas that had been listening to her and

2051
01:59:39.101 --> 01:59:42.660
following her directions couldn't resist and just dove on her,

2052
01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:47.620
grab a hold of her calf and clamped down on her,
took schunk off of her.

2053
01:59:48.250 --> 01:59:50.080
When they find,
if they see you're limping,
they,

2054
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.780
they literally came out and help us.
They can't help it.

2055
01:59:52.810 --> 01:59:55.270
That's what their instincts are for.
They're the cleanup crew.

2056
01:59:56.920 --> 02:00:01.720
This isn't a good video.
This isn't the one we wanted as one that has,
uh,
the,

2057
02:00:01.721 --> 02:00:06.010
the actual confrontation lions versus hyenas.
Terrible fight.

2058
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:11.080
That's it.
Yeah.
That's it.
Yeah.
They,
uh,
that's a hard world,
man.

2059
02:00:11.081 --> 02:00:14.980
It's a hard fucking scrabble world living out there with lions and hyenas.

2060
02:00:15.010 --> 02:00:20.010
But my point being is that we were not really totally sure of how many different

2061
02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:22.300
animals were alive.

2062
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:25.990
We only have what got trapped in mud and we have a good amount of those over the

2063
02:00:25.991 --> 02:00:28.270
course of hundreds of millions of years of dinosaurs.

2064
02:00:28.271 --> 02:00:32.200
But it's very possible that a few slip through and we just,
we're eating.

2065
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:37.470
The craziest thing to think is that 99% of all documented animals are extinct.

2066
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.050
And then history.
That's incredible.
That's incredible.
It is incredible.

2067
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:47.550
Up to a hundred different species alone go extinct per day in the rain forest

2068
02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:52.180
because there's so many different pods of the rain forest where just an isolated

2069
02:00:52.181 --> 02:00:54.280
species could be living like a mutant,

2070
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:59.160
a grasshopper or something and they go extinct every single day.
Yeah.

2071
02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:04.030
And when they find something like this,
uh,
this crazy Venezuelan,

2072
02:01:04.031 --> 02:01:06.940
Jurassic Park type thing,
and they find all these new animals,

2073
02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:11.440
it's like you really have to wonder how many of these have not been found.

2074
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:11.681
I mean,

2075
02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:16.681
how many they found that hobbit guy just to a few years ago and the early two

2076
02:01:16.691 --> 02:01:19.930
thousands.
I believe it.
What does that Lucy,
is that with them?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2077
02:01:19.931 --> 02:01:22.960
Lucy was an ancient and actual ancient hominid.
Uh,

2078
02:01:22.961 --> 02:01:27.220
that was like the ancestor to man.
This is a completely different branch of,

2079
02:01:27.221 --> 02:01:30.670
of the the,
the,
the primate tree.
This is like these humanoids,

2080
02:01:30.671 --> 02:01:31.930
this little hobbit things.

2081
02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:37.170
They live on this place called the island of Flores and as recently as 14,000

2082
02:01:37.451 --> 02:01:40.220
years ago,
these motherfuckers,
there were three

2083
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:43.220
<v 9>foot tall tiny people.
They use stone tools.</v>

2084
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:46.520
They had like a little tiny brains and little tiny bodies,

2085
02:01:46.670 --> 02:01:49.850
but they looked fairly humanlike.
Yeah.

2086
02:01:49.851 --> 02:01:51.920
They were like little hobbit people and they were,

2087
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:56.910
there were a real animal that lived alongside human beings through most of our

2088
02:01:57.830 --> 02:02:01.710
<v 4>Jesus Christ.
They might even still be alive.
That's what's interesting to see it.</v>

2089
02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:05.930
You know what?
I don't,
it was 10 years ago maybe or maybe not even that long,

2090
02:02:05.931 --> 02:02:10.931
where the helicopter over the Amazon found that small tribe of people that had

2091
02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:13.880
turned out to be a hoax.
That was a hoax.
Yeah,
the one,

2092
02:02:13.881 --> 02:02:18.230
they're painted red and you're fucking belly.
That was a hung out.
Jesus Christ.

2093
02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:20.150
That's terrible.
I loved that.
I loved that.

2094
02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:24.090
I loved that story where they were like holding the,
going,

2095
02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:27.350
trying to shoot their arrows.
At the helicopter.
It was at universal studios.

2096
02:02:27.650 --> 02:02:30.890
Jesus.
No,
it wasn't a university studios was good.
It was a hoax.

2097
02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:33.760
I don't know why they hoaxed it.
Why?
No,
no,
no.
That's

2098
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:36.640
<v 9>find out Amazon natives hoax.</v>

2099
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:39.880
They didn't realize that we host most,

2100
02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:44.110
<v 4>uh,
googled show ever.
I can't believe that.
I don't know.</v>

2101
02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:48.610
Focus Fukushima.
And what does it feel good and Amazon hoax.

2102
02:02:48.690 --> 02:02:48.931
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

2103
02:02:48.931 --> 02:02:52.920
There's a lot of shit you don't know son Damn man on that fake on uncontacted

2104
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:57.210
Amazon tribe is a hoax.
Oh,
it turns out it's not entirely true.

2105
02:02:57.211 --> 02:02:58.920
The photographer that took the picture,

2106
02:02:59.250 --> 02:03:04.250
Jose Carlos has admitted that the tribe has in fact been known about since 1910

2107
02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:09.690
he created the hoax in order to call attention to the dangers of the logging

2108
02:03:09.691 --> 02:03:10.524
industry.

2109
02:03:11.010 --> 02:03:12.600
<v 4>Okay.
Okay.
But still,
okay.</v>

2110
02:03:12.601 --> 02:03:15.720
So let's say that it is true that they've only been known about since 19.

2111
02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:17.300
There's still real and,

2112
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:21.150
and that still means that there's certain things that we probably have no idea

2113
02:03:21.151 --> 02:03:25.420
are alive right now.
I mean,
even other forms of smaller forms of humans or,

2114
02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:29.610
uh,
people that are further back and the evolutionary tree.

2115
02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.970
Yeah.
You know,
I mean there could be a small island,

2116
02:03:32.971 --> 02:03:34.710
but those little fucking habit people,
like you were saying,

2117
02:03:34.770 --> 02:03:35.690
that's what they're saying

2118
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:40.500
<v 9>is that this a homo floresiensis that's the actual uh,
animal,</v>

2119
02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:44.730
the actual human being that existed,
it was three feet tall and uh,

2120
02:03:44.731 --> 02:03:46.920
they lived off the island of Flores in Indonesia.

2121
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:51.950
Well there's an animal that are a thing that they call the Orang Pendek that

2122
02:03:51.961 --> 02:03:54.630
these locals have been describing for decades.

2123
02:03:54.631 --> 02:03:56.670
And it's exactly like this hobbit thing,

2124
02:03:56.970 --> 02:04:00.990
little three foot tall human being that until when they discovered this,

2125
02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:05.640
I think they discovered it in like,
I want to say like 2003 or something.

2126
02:04:05.850 --> 02:04:09.420
Two Studies.
Okay.
2005 and 2007.

2127
02:04:09.810 --> 02:04:11.760
So it's really fucking recent.

2128
02:04:12.330 --> 02:04:15.990
And up until then they thought this Orang Pendek was just bullshit.

2129
02:04:16.530 --> 02:04:21.180
But the Orang Pendek now they think might be this homo floresiensis that's

2130
02:04:21.181 --> 02:04:25.800
living in very small isolated numbers and hiding from people.
Because if it's,

2131
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:30.750
if it's smart enough to be using tools and you're dealing with the jungle,

2132
02:04:30.751 --> 02:04:32.730
this thing might actually be still alive.

2133
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:36.150
And he relation to bigfoot cousin.

2134
02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:40.520
This is really cousin cause bigfoot can play basketball and all he could do was

2135
02:04:40.521 --> 02:04:45.420
be a jockey.
It's um,
yeah,

2136
02:04:45.690 --> 02:04:50.280
these,
they actually,
okay.
Sumatra is where,
uh,
they,
they find it.

2137
02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:54.650
I don't think it's,
it's,
I think it's very possible that this thing is real.
The,

2138
02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:55.450
the uh,

2139
02:04:55.450 --> 02:04:59.490
animals allegedly been seed in documented for at least 100 years by forest

2140
02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:01.110
tribes,
local village villagers,

2141
02:05:01.290 --> 02:05:04.560
Dutch colonists and Western scientists and travelers.

2142
02:05:04.561 --> 02:05:08.710
Consensus among witnesses is that the animals are ground dwelling bipedal

2143
02:05:08.730 --> 02:05:12.150
primate that is covered in short for and stands,

2144
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:14.670
which we in 30 and 60 inches tall.

2145
02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:19.620
It's basically the same size or rang Penn deck is what it's called.

2146
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.790
I mean,

2147
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:25.790
knowing that this animal used to be real as recently as 14,000 years ago and

2148
02:05:25.831 --> 02:05:29.580
lived alongside human beings really makes me wonder,

2149
02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:33.400
it's kind of fascinating and again,
it's look completely fascinating.

2150
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:36.420
Thousand fucking five.
That's a blink ago.
Let's even,
that's

2151
02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:42.030
so recent.
There's so much shit we don't know about what was here.

2152
02:05:42.031 --> 02:05:43.890
It's kind of weird when you stop and think about it.

2153
02:05:44.250 --> 02:05:48.570
You live your life and you're just kinda going on momentum.
Momentum,

2154
02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:50.130
going to school,

2155
02:05:50.131 --> 02:05:55.020
graduating and having a family doing your thing and then all around you is this

2156
02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:58.660
world that has sort of been established and you have this idea of what it is and

2157
02:05:58.661 --> 02:06:01.350
know,
you know that used to be the pilgrims and they came here and this,

2158
02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:06.480
when you really start getting the big picture of how recently we got here,

2159
02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.340
how much change has taken place,

2160
02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:13.230
how 200 300 years ago there was fucking nobody here,
no cities,

2161
02:06:13.410 --> 02:06:17.610
no nothing.
And then you realize 200 years ago,
it's just two lifetimes in a row,

2162
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.640
two lifetimes in a row ago,
there's fucking slavery,

2163
02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:23.580
there's people riding around on wagon trains and shit.

2164
02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:27.840
200 years before that and nothing.
So in four lifetimes,

2165
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:31.140
zero American Indians,
they didn't even have horses back then.

2166
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:34.080
A lot of the American Indians before the Europeans came,

2167
02:06:34.081 --> 02:06:38.580
they were fucking just complete like nomadic tribal people,

2168
02:06:38.581 --> 02:06:41.820
bows and arrows wandering around,
persistent hunting.

2169
02:06:41.821 --> 02:06:44.250
Sometimes it's madness.
And,

2170
02:06:44.251 --> 02:06:48.180
and what's even more maddening is thinking about a lifetime from now.

2171
02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:53.070
What's going to happen.
I mean it's,
it's fucking skynet,
man.
Total recall.

2172
02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:55.590
Like it.
That's where it's going.
I feel it coming.

2173
02:06:55.591 --> 02:07:00.310
Sometimes I feel it coming when I get high.
I know that sounds so stupid,
but no,

2174
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:06.510
but I'm serious.
I get,
there's a feeling I get sometimes I'm going gonna try to,

2175
02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:09.330
I'm going to try to say this in a way that's going to make as much sense as

2176
02:07:09.331 --> 02:07:09.751
possible,

2177
02:07:09.751 --> 02:07:12.570
but there's a feeling I get sometimes when I get really high and I start

2178
02:07:12.571 --> 02:07:14.670
contemplating things,
especially if I get in the tank,

2179
02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:16.890
I get this feeling like something's coming.

2180
02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:20.940
I get this feeling like we're going like as a,
as a society,
as a culture,

2181
02:07:20.941 --> 02:07:25.680
we're going to be overwhelmed by a new version of what we're experiencing now.

2182
02:07:25.890 --> 02:07:28.800
A new version of technology that's shaping our lives right now,

2183
02:07:29.070 --> 02:07:31.760
but a virgin that's so immersive and so the,

2184
02:07:31.761 --> 02:07:36.761
the drags us into it and makes us become a part of it so deeply that we may

2185
02:07:37.751 --> 02:07:39.280
never have a life like this again.

2186
02:07:39.310 --> 02:07:43.390
And sometimes I really like take into account the life that we do live that you

2187
02:07:43.391 --> 02:07:46.090
can just shut off your phone,
that you can just get in your car.

2188
02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:49.780
Turn the radio off and just hear the engine is you drive up Mulholland and do

2189
02:07:49.781 --> 02:07:51.640
whatever the fuck that might be gone.

2190
02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:54.970
There might be a time where Mac lethal can never disappear,

2191
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:58.210
that you will always be tracked.
I mean,
you will always,

2192
02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:01.510
someone will always know where you are.
You will always be in touch.

2193
02:08:01.511 --> 02:08:04.750
You will always be connected.
You'll be always on,
you know,

2194
02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:09.670
that is 100% comment.
Yeah,
that's coming at freaks me out,
man.
It freaks me out.

2195
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:14.620
Yeah.
That's um,
but I think it's inevitable,
but it's still freaks me out.

2196
02:08:15.010 --> 02:08:16.000
I mean,
no,
I mean I think,

2197
02:08:16.001 --> 02:08:18.870
I think we're closer to it than probably most people do.
I mean,

2198
02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:20.200
I think that could probably do that.

2199
02:08:20.230 --> 02:08:23.500
We could probably do some variation of that now.
Well,

2200
02:08:23.550 --> 02:08:26.860
I think you and I may be a little more in tuned to it because we spent so many

2201
02:08:26.861 --> 02:08:31.000
time,
so much time using the internet.
Both benefited from it.
Um,

2202
02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:34.800
being shocked by it,
but seeing you to just the experiences,

2203
02:08:34.810 --> 02:08:37.710
the amount of shit that you interact with because of the Internet.

2204
02:08:37.711 --> 02:08:41.470
It's so different than our parents.
It's so hard.

2205
02:08:41.490 --> 02:08:45.580
They had no access to.
We have access to everything at the snap of a finger.

2206
02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:50.560
And there's this perception that the world has gotten worse and as a darker,

2207
02:08:50.561 --> 02:08:55.060
more exploitative place.
And I don't necessarily believe that's true.

2208
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:59.650
I just believe that we're exposed to every facet,
every artery of the world now.

2209
02:09:00.010 --> 02:09:04.090
And we just now see how sick of a place it is.
And it's,

2210
02:09:04.091 --> 02:09:07.600
it's made us hyper connected to everything that's always happened here.

2211
02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:11.110
And when our parents were here and before the Internet,

2212
02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:12.670
they didn't have that type of access.

2213
02:09:12.671 --> 02:09:17.260
They lived in more of a Pleasantville type of bubble.
And it's,
it's,

2214
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:20.350
it's terrifying and fascinating equally.
Well,

2215
02:09:20.351 --> 02:09:23.320
I have a love hate relationship with,
um,

2216
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:28.260
what's going on right now with our culture as far as,
uh,
the influence of,
um,

2217
02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:32.060
uh,
very aggressive progressive people.
Um,

2218
02:09:32.110 --> 02:09:36.960
whether it is a feminist like radical feminism or whether it's,
um,
you know,

2219
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:40.330
veganism or I'll make fun of that stuff a lot.

2220
02:09:40.330 --> 02:09:44.710
But there's a part of me that recognizes that what we're seeing with,
uh,

2221
02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:47.260
with whether it's radical feminism or you know,

2222
02:09:47.261 --> 02:09:50.830
fighting against transphobia or fighting against homophobia or any of these

2223
02:09:50.831 --> 02:09:52.870
things.
Well,
what we're seeing is a,

2224
02:09:52.871 --> 02:09:57.871
is a culture that's become aware of the imbalances in a way that's never been

2225
02:09:59.081 --> 02:10:00.650
possible before.
There's a,

2226
02:10:00.651 --> 02:10:04.720
a level of communication that's never been possible for massive communities of

2227
02:10:04.721 --> 02:10:09.370
online people who are,
whether they're progressive or feminists or you know,

2228
02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:13.390
Anti Trans phobic or transgender supportive.
They've,

2229
02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:17.890
they've formed like these aggressive communities that sometimes they're a bit

2230
02:10:17.891 --> 02:10:21.870
misguided in their approach,
attacking people for beliefs that they believe,

2231
02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:24.310
whether it's humor or whatever they feel like doesn't,

2232
02:10:24.490 --> 02:10:26.980
like I read this blog where this one person was like,

2233
02:10:27.330 --> 02:10:31.690
I'm attacking all trans phobic humor online.

2234
02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:35.390
And then,
um,
and part of me was like,
okay,
I see what she's doing.

2235
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:38.200
Or She's trying to,
um,

2236
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:42.560
expose what she feels is gross behavior,

2237
02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:47.740
but she's exposing it and she is saying humor and she's saying that it's lazy

2238
02:10:47.991 --> 02:10:52.520
and it's this and that.
And that's when I got to go,
okay,
look,
everybody's funny.

2239
02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:56.630
You know,
I'm funny.
I,
I in my head,
I don't have any hair on it.
I used to,

2240
02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:57.560
I shaved it.

2241
02:10:57.561 --> 02:11:00.770
I have a scar in the back of my hand for where I had a hair transplant operation

2242
02:11:00.771 --> 02:11:02.660
where they take the hair and they put it,
I you stupid.

2243
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:05.210
You had a hear transplant hair turns.
Yeah,

2244
02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:10.070
when I'm like in the 90 [inaudible] and then they slice out of the back of your

2245
02:11:10.071 --> 02:11:13.640
head like a piece of meat and then they take the hairs and they put them in

2246
02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:19.070
individual plugs.
So wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
What?
How did that work?
It doesn't,

2247
02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:21.740
it doesn't work very well.
How many works a little?
I had hair obviously,

2248
02:11:21.741 --> 02:11:23.210
but it was starting to fall out still.

2249
02:11:23.211 --> 02:11:25.880
Like the other hair was starting to fall out.
Say now I'm left with these,

2250
02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:28.910
what I described it as like taking a bunch of healthy people,

2251
02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:32.300
move them to a neighborhood where everyone's dying.
She's stupid idea.

2252
02:11:32.301 --> 02:11:35.300
So they eventually die too?
No,
no,
no.
They don't die.

2253
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:37.310
They stay permanently cause they're the Harris from the back of your head.

2254
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:40.400
The hairs on the back of your head are genetically programmed to stay.

2255
02:11:40.670 --> 02:11:42.050
It's why when dudes go bald,

2256
02:11:42.051 --> 02:11:45.230
they still have that like weird sure thing at the back of their head.

2257
02:11:45.650 --> 02:11:48.190
And that's where the logic comes from,
where they can move that here and yeah.

2258
02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:51.710
So but why doesn't it,
I don't understand why it doesn't work.
It does work.

2259
02:11:51.711 --> 02:11:53.540
It just doesn't work good enough.
It's not good.

2260
02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:55.130
And the rest of the hair wants to fall out.

2261
02:11:55.131 --> 02:11:58.770
So I was using Rogaine for that and I was using Propecia before,

2262
02:11:58.771 --> 02:12:02.630
but pro leisure kill Mondraker really is your crew.
And my bigger song,

2263
02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.650
it didn't kill my Dicky,
but it didn't make my Dickies happened.

2264
02:12:05.670 --> 02:12:09.320
You ever tried to,
this is what I have.
Yeah,
that's it.
It works kind of.

2265
02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:13.010
It puts it out.
I found that nioxin cause I have male pattern baldness too.

2266
02:12:13.011 --> 02:12:16.340
I just wear a hat and grow it out back here.
So it looks like I'm sexy as shit,

2267
02:12:16.341 --> 02:12:17.510
but it,
it,

2268
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:21.710
it gave me little baby hairs like it you can get a little bit,

2269
02:12:21.711 --> 02:12:24.770
but they weren't real hairs.
They were paid going,
it's going,
it's gone.

2270
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:28.280
If it's going,
it's going,
it's Outta here.
You can do some stuff to keep it on.

2271
02:12:28.281 --> 02:12:31.130
But man,
it's tough action.
And uh,

2272
02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:34.010
I always tell people that the back of my head is a public service announcement.

2273
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:36.170
Like if you could look at my scar and you could go,

2274
02:12:36.171 --> 02:12:39.470
do you want one of those stupid things that there's to remind you don't do what

2275
02:12:39.471 --> 02:12:43.870
I did and I'm happy like this.
I like having a shaved head.
It's,

2276
02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.980
it's very liberating to me.
I know.
It's nice.

2277
02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:50.750
Is it true that Anderson Silva hair will not grow or is that him trolling?

2278
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:55.280
Did he really burn all his hair off of his head with the hair product and when

2279
02:12:55.281 --> 02:12:58.150
he was 20 years old and has no idea.
I never been heard that.
But no,

2280
02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.320
he says that as he says,
he doesn't shave his head.

2281
02:13:00.321 --> 02:13:03.470
He says he burnt all his hair off.
Oh,
he might be trolling.
He trolls a lot.

2282
02:13:03.471 --> 02:13:06.050
I know he travels a lot with it.
He said,
you know,
he had stuff,

2283
02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:09.460
Steven Seagal in his camp.
Now he's going to bring in Chuck Norris.
Saw that time,

2284
02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:14.210
not the Chuck Norris isn't a excellent martial artist and was a legit world

2285
02:13:14.211 --> 02:13:14.631
champion.

2286
02:13:14.631 --> 02:13:17.840
And if I was going to take martial arts instruction from people I've fucking for

2287
02:13:17.841 --> 02:13:21.330
sure would take martial arts instructor and he trained with Nora.
John,
Jack,

2288
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:25.190
Michelle.
Oh yeah.
He's a black belt under John.
John Badass.
Then how do you feel,

2289
02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:29.750
what do you think about Weidman silver too?
I Dunno.
Um,
my point,

2290
02:13:29.751 --> 02:13:32.790
what I was getting at before that we got really sidetracked,

2291
02:13:33.150 --> 02:13:36.420
but I would be happy to talk to my,
I,
you,
my point is,
I make fun of myself.

2292
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:38.390
You know,
I make fun of everybody and if you're,

2293
02:13:38.391 --> 02:13:40.860
you're going to call someone Trans phobic cause they make fun of certain

2294
02:13:40.861 --> 02:13:41.640
trainees.

2295
02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:44.670
There's a fucking guy who's 50 years old is six foot five is playing women's

2296
02:13:44.671 --> 02:13:48.690
college basketball.
If you don't make fun of that,
you're an asshole.
Okay.

2297
02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:52.170
And if he doesn't realize that he looks ridiculous being six foot five 50 year

2298
02:13:52.171 --> 02:13:56.610
old man competing with 18 year old girls and pretending he's a girl or you know,

2299
02:13:56.611 --> 02:14:00.780
being a female now I understand that,
but the fact that you get a reset,

2300
02:14:00.810 --> 02:14:03.750
he did all his college credits,
we played all his college sports as a male,

2301
02:14:03.810 --> 02:14:05.460
but then when you change gender,

2302
02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:09.660
you get a reset and you're allowed to go in with zero.
That's overly progressive.

2303
02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:12.960
It's overly progressive and my opinions on,

2304
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:15.660
there's a woman that has been competing as an MMA fight of Allen,

2305
02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:18.240
we have as a male is 30 years.
Shit,

2306
02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.320
it's total bull shit because his it,

2307
02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:25.680
its body is fuck fuck.
It's a man's body.
Well not only that,
there's changes,

2308
02:14:25.681 --> 02:14:29.070
there's an absolute changes that take place,
but the,

2309
02:14:29.071 --> 02:14:32.280
those science that everyone's like trying to quote like the really super

2310
02:14:32.281 --> 02:14:35.550
progressive people who are like,
you know,
there's good science to support that.

2311
02:14:35.550 --> 02:14:38.940
You know,
you really become a woman.
You lose your bone density.
No there's not.

2312
02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:40.290
There's not,
not only that,

2313
02:14:40.291 --> 02:14:43.890
there's the amount of science that you are getting is all coming from either

2314
02:14:43.891 --> 02:14:48.570
transgender or doctors or people who are in involved in the transgender

2315
02:14:48.571 --> 02:14:51.060
procedure or monitoring what happens to a person.

2316
02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:55.710
There's never been a documented study of taking a male athlete that's been a

2317
02:14:55.711 --> 02:15:00.450
male for 30 plus years comparing.
They're the skills that they learned as a male,

2318
02:15:00.451 --> 02:15:02.760
by the way,
with a completely different muscle structure,

2319
02:15:02.761 --> 02:15:06.210
completely different bone structure.
The mechanical frame is different.

2320
02:15:06.211 --> 02:15:09.360
The shape of the torsos different that the whiteness of the shoulders,

2321
02:15:09.361 --> 02:15:12.180
the size of the hand,
the hips,
and the reaction time.

2322
02:15:12.210 --> 02:15:13.650
The big one is the reaction time.

2323
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:17.670
And this one that I want to hear people quoting,
there's been a 10% it's studied,

2324
02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:20.880
studied 10% variation between men and females.

2325
02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:24.930
Men have a 10% quicker reaction time.
Crazy.
When it comes to striking.

2326
02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:27.960
That is a big deal.
That is a gigantic deal.

2327
02:15:28.050 --> 02:15:30.840
That might be the difference between Roy Jones Jr being the top of the world and

2328
02:15:30.841 --> 02:15:35.190
Charlie Jones Jr getting knocked.
Sure.
Yeah.
10% is big and you know,

2329
02:15:35.191 --> 02:15:38.670
and but in,
in talking about this,
I became transphobic too.

2330
02:15:38.671 --> 02:15:40.560
A lot of these super ultra progressive people.

2331
02:15:40.561 --> 02:15:43.860
And that's why I say that I have this love hate relationship with this idea

2332
02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:45.870
because I think the love is I am,

2333
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:50.850
I am all for everyone being able to be themselves.

2334
02:15:50.851 --> 02:15:54.030
I'm all for you being whatever you want to be,

2335
02:15:54.031 --> 02:15:58.890
whether it's transgender or gay or you know,
cross dressing.

2336
02:15:58.891 --> 02:16:01.860
And I have a friend who works with a crossdresser and he's not gay,

2337
02:16:02.130 --> 02:16:05.250
but he at work is a woman.
And when he goes home,

2338
02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:08.130
he changes and he goes home and it becomes a man again.

2339
02:16:08.130 --> 02:16:10.920
And he has a family and everything and doesn't want to have a sex change

2340
02:16:10.921 --> 02:16:11.754
operation.

2341
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:14.670
But he wants to wear women's clothes at work and he wants to be referred to as a

2342
02:16:14.671 --> 02:16:17.230
woman.
And so they don't,
you know,

2343
02:16:17.231 --> 02:16:21.960
sh they work for a big company and it's a gigantic corporation.
They allow it.

2344
02:16:22.110 --> 02:16:25.410
It's a very progressive company.
And I think that's bad ass who gives a shit.

2345
02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:28.350
If a guy wants to wear a dress,
you know,
I want to wear a purse.

2346
02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:32.560
I wish I could wear a fucking purse.
But you know,
I get mocked.
I think,
um,

2347
02:16:33.350 --> 02:16:34.430
I think the,

2348
02:16:34.431 --> 02:16:37.990
the love hate relationship that I'm talking about is that people are realizing

2349
02:16:37.991 --> 02:16:41.290
that they do have a say because of this new electronic media,

2350
02:16:41.470 --> 02:16:46.150
because of the fact that you can post a blog that,
you know,

2351
02:16:46.151 --> 02:16:50.490
start to debate and,
and,
and exposes people to these ideas.
Like,

2352
02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:54.580
here's one of them that's been coming up a lot recently and it's that having sex

2353
02:16:54.581 --> 02:16:58.450
with a drunk person is rape and it's,
it's,
uh,

2354
02:16:58.750 --> 02:17:03.400
it's there.
I mean,
there you are.
So not necessarily,

2355
02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:07.960
so if you're drunk in another person's drunk,
so which one is guilty then?
Both.

2356
02:17:08.770 --> 02:17:13.510
So you're,
it's you're raping.
Oh my God.
Listen,

2357
02:17:13.511 --> 02:17:17.710
I'm not joking around,
man.
It's an inch.
But here's what I love about it.
Okay.

2358
02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:21.300
What I love about it is I don't necessarily agree with it and why,

2359
02:17:21.301 --> 02:17:24.250
why don't look,
there was a,
there's a man named Michael Shermer.

2360
02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:27.820
Michael Shermer is a very famous skeptic and he's being charged by this other

2361
02:17:27.821 --> 02:17:32.510
guy was just radical male feminist.
He's being charged with rape.
Um,
we,

2362
02:17:32.530 --> 02:17:36.170
in his blog he says that he has,
has taken advantage of the,

2363
02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:40.360
what the language is very strange that this guy uses to describe the situation

2364
02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:42.640
where he says,
and he didn't,
he wasn't even told to him.

2365
02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.640
It was told to someone else and then told to him.
So it's all very sketch,

2366
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:50.290
but the languages that Michael Shermer got her into a position where she was

2367
02:17:50.291 --> 02:17:52.450
unable to consent and then had sex with her.

2368
02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:55.480
I don't know exactly what that means,
what,

2369
02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:00.430
what they're implying by all the other corroborating stories is that he likes to

2370
02:18:00.431 --> 02:18:01.264
get women drunk.

2371
02:18:01.870 --> 02:18:06.280
And there was another woman who said that she met him at a party and he kept her

2372
02:18:06.281 --> 02:18:10.030
wine glass full and she got drunker than she ever used to and she was really

2373
02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:10.811
embarrassed by that.

2374
02:18:10.811 --> 02:18:13.870
And somehow or another she blames him for the fact that she got drunk,

2375
02:18:13.871 --> 02:18:17.020
but they're trying to isolate a pattern that this guy does,

2376
02:18:17.050 --> 02:18:21.370
which is apparently get women drunk and have sex with them.
And my point is,

2377
02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:24.970
first of all,
there's a broad spectrum of what is drunk.

2378
02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:28.480
And if you say that having sex with anyone who's drunk is rape,

2379
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:32.140
what if they have one drink and they're kind of tipsy and they get horny and

2380
02:18:32.141 --> 02:18:35.110
they love you and they're attracted to you?
Is that still rape?

2381
02:18:35.350 --> 02:18:39.250
Like that's bananas.
If it's two drinks,
what is it?
Okay.

2382
02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.750
If it's six shots and a beer and you're fucking a hundred pounds,

2383
02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:46.600
yes.
I would say that's rape.
Like you,

2384
02:18:46.601 --> 02:18:50.140
if you're sober and that person's fucked up and you go,
hey,
don't worry about it.

2385
02:18:50.141 --> 02:18:53.500
Just lie down here.
Oh,
well are your parents coming off?
Hey,

2386
02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:57.130
well as my dick in your mouth,
don't consider that.
That's rape.
You're,

2387
02:18:57.590 --> 02:19:00.790
if you're sober and you're taking advantage of someone who's not unconscious,

2388
02:19:00.890 --> 02:19:05.230
that's fine.
If someone conscious yeah,
low lying on the bed,
blacking out,

2389
02:19:05.231 --> 02:19:06.850
and you're taking their pants off.
I think that's right.

2390
02:19:06.851 --> 02:19:10.390
But I think it's hard to quantify,
you know,

2391
02:19:10.391 --> 02:19:12.640
if they have six shots and a beer,

2392
02:19:13.130 --> 02:19:16.360
if they have an alcohol tolerance that's through the roof.
I mean,
how do you,

2393
02:19:16.450 --> 02:19:18.280
how do you discern between what's,

2394
02:19:18.670 --> 02:19:21.640
what their alcohol tolerance is and how much they can handle?
A good point.

2395
02:19:21.670 --> 02:19:25.120
It's a good point.
The idea is that after a certain point,
you're impaired,

2396
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:26.770
you're impaired,
period.

2397
02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:31.220
And for you to take advantage of that person in that state that's akin to rape.

2398
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:35.840
And what is interesting about this is even though I don't agree with that,

2399
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:40.870
the blanket statement is that they forced the debate now and they've forced this

2400
02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:47.140
really age old problem of creepy dudes getting women drugged and then having sex

2401
02:19:47.331 --> 02:19:48.800
with them,
which is fucking rape.

2402
02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:52.810
How many people have you talked to that are female that think their drink got

2403
02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:56.690
mickied?
I've,
I've been a part of it.
I've seen it happen to a date.

2404
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:59.480
I took a girl out.
We were,
it was one of my shows,

2405
02:19:59.510 --> 02:20:04.460
one of my old shows when I was about 22 years old,
a girl that I was with.
Um,

2406
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:09.250
uh,
a guy approached her and gave her a drink and she was talking to him and she,

2407
02:20:09.310 --> 02:20:13.700
she ended up on her ass.
I mean,
couldn't think,

2408
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:17.200
couldn't see straight,
couldn't stand up straight and it drove me.

2409
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:21.350
I had no idea what was going on with her.
But within like a matter of 15 minutes,

2410
02:20:21.351 --> 02:20:25.430
completely fucking in Nibr,
he aided,
unable to,
uh,
speak,

2411
02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:29.100
had to carry your home,
woke up the next day,
had no idea what happened.

2412
02:20:29.101 --> 02:20:33.530
She got fucking roof feed.
Fucking roofie.
It does.
And it happens all the time.

2413
02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:36.380
It's not just Ruthie's is GHB.

2414
02:20:36.381 --> 02:20:41.270
They slipped GHB into people's drinks and a Cox amount.
It happens all the time,

2415
02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:42.200
all over the world.

2416
02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:46.700
And it's sort of a thing that we know about but isn't discussed that often.

2417
02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:47.450
And I,

2418
02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:50.990
what I like about what these radical feminists have done is they've opened up

2419
02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:54.260
this conversation.
Sure.
Now people are talking about it and they're debating it.

2420
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:57.890
Whether or not it's true.
Well,
what is that rape?
That's rape,
not it's not rape.

2421
02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:00.650
And in that argument they forced the dialogue,

2422
02:21:00.651 --> 02:21:04.340
which I think is brilliant and it's a real legit dialogue and it's an important

2423
02:21:04.341 --> 02:21:07.580
subject because there are people that do drug people and take advantage of

2424
02:21:07.581 --> 02:21:07.791
people.

2425
02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:12.290
But to call anytime a two consenting adults have a few drinks together and then

2426
02:21:12.291 --> 02:21:15.290
have sex to call that rape I think is fucking crazy.

2427
02:21:15.291 --> 02:21:19.490
I mean like my wife and I will get a little tipsy together and my raping,

2428
02:21:19.491 --> 02:21:20.311
my wife,
dude,

2429
02:21:20.311 --> 02:21:25.311
this woman on Twitter literally had a campaign and a blog post about it saying

2430
02:21:26.241 --> 02:21:29.480
that people are sad on Twitter when they found out that the rapists,

2431
02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:34.340
because they disagreed with her and this blanket statement of any time like even

2432
02:21:34.341 --> 02:21:37.730
if it's your spouse,
why do that if they can't consent?

2433
02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:40.160
And what she's saying is if you're drunk,
you can't consent.

2434
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:42.860
It's a fascinating argument.
I don't agree with it,

2435
02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:47.030
but it's fascinating that it's made people angry.
It started this debate,

2436
02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:50.660
it's got people talking and that puts the energy on this very real issue.
Sure.

2437
02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:53.270
But another guy had an incredible point,

2438
02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:55.820
like how could it possibly be that that's the only time where you're not

2439
02:21:55.821 --> 02:21:57.500
responsible for your actions is sex.

2440
02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:01.640
If I get you drunk and then you decide to get in a car and drive home,

2441
02:22:01.730 --> 02:22:05.390
is it my responsibility?
If you come over my house and we're both the same age,

2442
02:22:05.391 --> 02:22:08.510
we drink wine together and you get in your car and you slam into a tree,

2443
02:22:08.810 --> 02:22:13.090
did I force you to drive drunk?
If you're a man,
no.
If you're a woman denied,
no.

2444
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:16.490
Well,
how if were both drinking and then sex is involved,

2445
02:22:16.491 --> 02:22:19.190
how are we not both responsible for,
you know,

2446
02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:21.830
this situation is considered aiding and abetting.

2447
02:22:21.890 --> 02:22:25.650
I got in trouble when I was 17 years old.
I got adjudicated

2448
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.240
<v 4>of two felonies,</v>

2449
02:22:27.450 --> 02:22:31.380
which is basically means I was 17 and not old enough to be convicted of them.

2450
02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:36.450
And we were at a party on the first night of spring break at a house party with

2451
02:22:36.451 --> 02:22:38.370
a bunch of my friends.
I went to an alternative school.

2452
02:22:38.371 --> 02:22:42.330
So there were a little more edgy,
like Mexican and black gangster kids and,

2453
02:22:42.331 --> 02:22:46.710
and we were all there and there was a car on the driveway and a girl came into

2454
02:22:46.711 --> 02:22:49.710
the party and said,
there's two skinheads outside in this car.

2455
02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:54.920
So 1516 of these dudes went outside and surrounded this car and about four metal

2456
02:22:56.851 --> 02:23:01.851
tpx bats came out of this garage and they beat all the windows out of the car,

2457
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:06.420
jumped on the windshield,
cracked it,
got the guys out,

2458
02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:10.860
beat shit out of them with bats,
with bats.
Now here's,

2459
02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:12.030
here's where it gets fucked up.

2460
02:23:12.090 --> 02:23:16.800
So there was some like Swat team test mission going on about two blocks away and

2461
02:23:16.801 --> 02:23:18.000
they heard what was going on.

2462
02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:22.830
So we're all standing there watching these kids beat the ever living fuck out of

2463
02:23:22.831 --> 02:23:26.910
these skinheads.
And I don't even know if they were skinheads,
but all the sudden,

2464
02:23:26.911 --> 02:23:30.510
like 2030 cops rolled up in bulletproof vests,

2465
02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:34.530
fucking black fatigues on machine guns and shit.
Well,
here's what's fucked up.

2466
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:37.710
I never laid a single finger on any of these kids.

2467
02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:41.250
And I got in trouble because I had a cell phone in my pocket and I didn't call

2468
02:23:41.251 --> 02:23:43.710
the cops and they called it aiding and abetting.

2469
02:23:44.130 --> 02:23:46.110
And that's the same fucking logic.

2470
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:50.820
And I never understood because our argument was,
well,

2471
02:23:50.821 --> 02:23:53.610
if I would have pulled my phone out to call the police,

2472
02:23:53.970 --> 02:23:57.480
maybe one of the kids with the bats,
what bat would have hurt me or hitting me.

2473
02:23:57.481 --> 02:24:00.370
You know,
it's,
it's very convoluted and fucking,

2474
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:05.130
<v 9>I don't think that's the same logic because,
um,
you,
you,</v>

2475
02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:09.230
you can't be responsible for keeping track of how many drinks and other adults

2476
02:24:09.231 --> 02:24:11.740
has.
Especially like at a party.

2477
02:24:11.770 --> 02:24:14.560
If someone's having a party at your house and you're all drinking together,

2478
02:24:14.561 --> 02:24:16.090
and maybe you might not even know,

2479
02:24:16.091 --> 02:24:18.970
but Mike had some whiskey and you didn't see him and he got fucked up and you

2480
02:24:18.971 --> 02:24:21.230
thought he only had one glass of wine,
you'd be fine.
Fine.

2481
02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:24.460
I don't think that's aiding and abetting.
I think if you're at a bar,

2482
02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:25.690
I think it becomes an issue.

2483
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:29.480
<v 4>But I think that my point was if you see that they're,</v>

2484
02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:34.540
they're drunk and then they get into Reichle and you don't proactively try to

2485
02:24:35.121 --> 02:24:37.250
prevent them or try to keep them there.

2486
02:24:37.450 --> 02:24:39.610
<v 9>That's an interesting question.
I wonder what your responsibility is.</v>

2487
02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:41.950
Who they're coming from your house.
Yeah,
it might.

2488
02:24:41.951 --> 02:24:44.530
You might have some responsibility if you actually gave them the alcohol,

2489
02:24:45.430 --> 02:24:50.380
but I just said great.
Where I draw issue,
because there has to be,

2490
02:24:50.381 --> 02:24:53.920
at some point people have to have personal accountability.
Absolutely.

2491
02:24:53.950 --> 02:24:56.980
And there's no personal responsibility for all adults.

2492
02:24:56.981 --> 02:25:00.940
Not just because you're a woman,
you're you,
you get to skirt it.
Nope,

2493
02:25:00.970 --> 02:25:04.900
no pun intended.
Because the fact that you're a woman,
it's not,

2494
02:25:04.901 --> 02:25:06.190
that doesn't make any sense to me.

2495
02:25:06.370 --> 02:25:10.060
If you're at a party and you have some drinks with someone and someone keeps

2496
02:25:10.061 --> 02:25:13.540
pouring you drinks and then you try to accuse them of getting you drunk or than

2497
02:25:13.541 --> 02:25:14.410
you normally would,

2498
02:25:14.411 --> 02:25:17.470
and you use that as sort of a corroboration that this guy likes to get women

2499
02:25:17.471 --> 02:25:20.620
drunk.
Like,
man,
you've made some fucking crazy leaps there.

2500
02:25:20.890 --> 02:25:24.820
It sounds to me like a guy's offering you drinks you apparently said yes to

2501
02:25:24.821 --> 02:25:28.150
because you like drinking.
Exactly like there's some madness there.
There's,

2502
02:25:28.151 --> 02:25:32.950
there's some madness,
but it does in the thing I like about it,

2503
02:25:32.951 --> 02:25:37.600
it does open up this debate of people being fucking creepy and drugging people

2504
02:25:37.601 --> 02:25:40.930
and treating them as less than human so that they can just shoot loads into
them.

2505
02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:41.621
So you like,

2506
02:25:41.621 --> 02:25:45.490
as long as all of these issues have an open and somewhat passionate dialogue

2507
02:25:45.491 --> 02:25:49.510
going on that that's more what you're interested in does.
They don't though.

2508
02:25:49.511 --> 02:25:52.870
That's what's interesting.
These progressive blogs,
the free thinking blog,

2509
02:25:52.871 --> 02:25:53.710
this guy puts it on,

2510
02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.970
they stifle even civil debates so quickly and harshly.

2511
02:25:58.150 --> 02:26:02.380
Anybody who thinks that this Michael Shermer guys being unfairly accused and he

2512
02:26:02.381 --> 02:26:04.780
doesn't have his day in court.
And what about his point of view?

2513
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:09.010
You're supposed to be skeptical and yet you've taken this second hand account of

2514
02:26:09.011 --> 02:26:13.990
a situation and posting it as evidence without talking to the other person and

2515
02:26:13.991 --> 02:26:17.260
everyone knows that personal experiences and the memories of personal

2516
02:26:17.261 --> 02:26:20.500
experiences are extremely inaccurate.
Not only that,

2517
02:26:20.501 --> 02:26:22.840
there's a lot that happens when people sober up,

2518
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:26.470
they start attaching a bunch of remorse and all kinds of other shit that things,

2519
02:26:26.471 --> 02:26:30.640
and sometimes people have a psychological ailment where forces them to cause

2520
02:26:30.641 --> 02:26:35.410
other people or blame other people for their own shortcomings.
There's a lot,

2521
02:26:35.411 --> 02:26:37.480
we all know a lot of people that do that.
Yes.

2522
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:42.220
And so you have to take into account all those things when you're using a

2523
02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:45.400
personal account of a situation.
I've learned that the hard way.

2524
02:26:45.610 --> 02:26:49.000
I've backed people up before it and then found out that there are probably full

2525
02:26:49.001 --> 02:26:51.490
of Shit,
you know,
later on like you're like,
oh,

2526
02:26:51.491 --> 02:26:54.850
well why didn't you fucking tell me that?
Like you didn't,
you left that out man.

2527
02:26:55.180 --> 02:26:58.180
So this guy I think fucked up and doing this in a big way,

2528
02:26:58.420 --> 02:27:03.070
but he did open the debate and the debate is being like really,

2529
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:05.230
uh,
passionately argued.

2530
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:09.010
I think he's also fucking up and showing why he did it in the first place by

2531
02:27:09.011 --> 02:27:12.220
stifling any civil discourse on his own blog,

2532
02:27:12.221 --> 02:27:16.210
calling them trolls and saying they're too stupid to enter into this debate.

2533
02:27:16.211 --> 02:27:19.660
Has all sorts of Ad Hominem attacks and anybody who has even a civil

2534
02:27:19.661 --> 02:27:22.630
disagreement,
I mean the,
the,
the people that they've shown,

2535
02:27:22.631 --> 02:27:27.310
like a couple of people have made videos of this showing how ridiculous the

2536
02:27:27.311 --> 02:27:31.540
banning of people that disagree with no disrespectful language at all.

2537
02:27:31.541 --> 02:27:36.040
Just band,
you know,
from this guy's boy,
everyone is like super ultra supportive.

2538
02:27:36.220 --> 02:27:39.520
And then I've looked on other boards and it's entirely the opposite.

2539
02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:42.430
Everyone is completely skeptical of this and,

2540
02:27:42.730 --> 02:27:46.780
and saying that this is White Knight Horse Shit to the extreme and that this

2541
02:27:46.781 --> 02:27:50.620
guy's an attention whore and this is not skeptical.
This is not,

2542
02:27:50.621 --> 02:27:53.920
there's nothing skeptical or free thinking about this and that this is,

2543
02:27:53.950 --> 02:27:58.450
this is also a problem with blogging about something is that you're,

2544
02:27:58.510 --> 02:28:01.000
you're not getting a dialogue.

2545
02:28:01.150 --> 02:28:05.140
You're getting one person who gets to express themselves in a,

2546
02:28:05.450 --> 02:28:10.090
we're rambling,
verbose way.
Whereas if you're having a dialogue,

2547
02:28:10.091 --> 02:28:12.490
someone can have a statement,
then someone could say,

2548
02:28:12.491 --> 02:28:16.210
well that's not true because of this.
And then we'll go,
oh,
I thought that,
no,
no,

2549
02:28:16.211 --> 02:28:17.440
this was actually the case.

2550
02:28:17.441 --> 02:28:22.280
And now you've got a dialogue where you're trying to reenact the information as

2551
02:28:22.281 --> 02:28:24.860
it actually took place.
You're dealing with multiple parties.

2552
02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:28.070
That's the only way to get a really accurate assessment of what happened.

2553
02:28:28.071 --> 02:28:30.920
And even then it's skewed.
People,
they,
they'll,

2554
02:28:30.921 --> 02:28:33.040
the one person will be more passionate.
They,

2555
02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:35.740
although there will be better at describing things,
the other person may,

2556
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:38.330
maybe their memory's not as good and it's,
it's,
it's hard.

2557
02:28:38.331 --> 02:28:43.110
It's hard to recreate a situation completely accurately and you don't do it.

2558
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:47.000
And a third hand account on a fucking blog,
you just don't,
you don't get.

2559
02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:50.050
And to pretend that you do is asinine.
And it,

2560
02:28:50.051 --> 02:28:54.950
it shows me that you're using your fucking ego and your ego has been involved in

2561
02:28:54.951 --> 02:28:55.784
this discussion.

2562
02:28:55.880 --> 02:29:00.140
Your ego to the point where you want your point to be absolutely correct and an

2563
02:29:00.141 --> 02:29:05.030
inarguable,
and that's bullshit.
But that's 99% of blogging.
Yeah.

2564
02:29:05.031 --> 02:29:07.360
But it shouldn't be that way when you're talking about a guy who was an

2565
02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:10.640
[inaudible] guy's a professor,
the guys who professor and the support him,

2566
02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:14.150
the blog is called free thinking.
I mean,
it's like,
it's so silly.

2567
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:16.190
It's like everything that free thinking isn't it?

2568
02:29:16.191 --> 02:29:19.640
It's like here you just have failed an intelligence test in a massive,

2569
02:29:19.641 --> 02:29:23.840
massive way because you think,
and the arguments are so strange.
One of them,

2570
02:29:23.841 --> 02:29:25.400
I saw a,
I've seen several,

2571
02:29:25.401 --> 02:29:28.190
this one theme that keeps repeating itself over and over again as it,

2572
02:29:28.191 --> 02:29:30.260
even if this guy's unjustly shamed,

2573
02:29:30.470 --> 02:29:35.000
like it may be necessary to protect women to unnecessarily shame people who are

2574
02:29:35.001 --> 02:29:35.834
innocent.

2575
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:40.460
And I saw that and I said that's crazy thinking cause it's never necessary to

2576
02:29:40.461 --> 02:29:45.290
unnecessarily shame somebody that's not,
you don't,
you don't like throw out.

2577
02:29:45.291 --> 02:29:47.630
That's like which trial shit.
You know,

2578
02:29:47.631 --> 02:29:52.490
you don't throw out accusations of witchcraft unnecessarily so that you find the

2579
02:29:52.491 --> 02:29:57.290
necessary witches and abolish them from your community.
Like that's no,
never.

2580
02:29:57.560 --> 02:30:01.520
It's never okay to unnecessarily accuse someone of something they didn't do.

2581
02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:06.380
So if they get unduly or unjustly accused,
it's okay if a few women are safe.

2582
02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:07.281
No it's not.

2583
02:30:07.281 --> 02:30:11.900
It's a massive injustice against one person who is unjustly accused of a crime

2584
02:30:11.901 --> 02:30:14.480
that he absolutely didn't commit.
I'm not saying that he did or he didn't,

2585
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:16.160
but that's a possibility as well.

2586
02:30:16.250 --> 02:30:19.520
And it's not being considered at all by any of these people and they're basing

2587
02:30:19.521 --> 02:30:23.570
it on personal accounts and the guy's creepy and this and that.
Like maybe he is,

2588
02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:27.290
he may,
he may very well be,
but as a person who calls yourself free thinking,

2589
02:30:27.291 --> 02:30:31.820
you Ho you have a responsibility and absolute responsibility to be objective

2590
02:30:31.821 --> 02:30:34.400
about this idea and you're not being objective about it.

2591
02:30:34.401 --> 02:30:39.100
You're looking at it through this massive,
uh,
progressive,
uh,

2592
02:30:39.130 --> 02:30:43.910
ideological standpoint.
Fucking crazy man.
Yeah,

2593
02:30:43.911 --> 02:30:46.340
it's interesting.
It's,
it's,
it's,
but I,
I like it.

2594
02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:49.460
What I like about it is not that this guy is,
I'm being unjustly accused.

2595
02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:54.760
What I like about it is that we're having these really interesting dialogues now

2596
02:30:55.250 --> 02:30:57.980
that I don't think took place on a large scale before.

2597
02:30:58.100 --> 02:31:01.550
And I find it along with all the other things that are shaping human culture

2598
02:31:01.551 --> 02:31:03.780
because of the Internet.
I find it all to be really,

2599
02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:07.190
I hate to say it sounds pretentious potential say so stimulating,

2600
02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:09.080
but it is kind of stimulating.
It's stimulating it.

2601
02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:13.580
It's fascinating and it's all like bubbling up around us and changing at a rate

2602
02:31:13.581 --> 02:31:15.770
that I don't think we're even recognizing,
man.

2603
02:31:15.980 --> 02:31:20.070
I think the rate is so rapid and so massive.
93

2604
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:24.170
<v 0>94 whenever the Internet became popular for the wild west man.
Yeah,</v>

2605
02:31:24.690 --> 02:31:26.200
I mean everybody has

2606
02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:30.300
<v 4>platform and everybody has a voice and the ability to do it in a different or</v>

2607
02:31:30.301 --> 02:31:31.134
original way,

2608
02:31:31.170 --> 02:31:34.960
and it's all about if they can draw the attention to themselves and it's

2609
02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:39.030
redistributing the power of,
of who has a voice and who doesn't,

2610
02:31:39.540 --> 02:31:42.300
and that's the,
it's the fucking wild west all over again.

2611
02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:45.000
<v 0>The roaring twenties of the digital era.
That's what I've been calling it.</v>

2612
02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:48.360
That's how it feels to me.
Yeah,
man.
It's like it's,
it's new,

2613
02:31:48.361 --> 02:31:52.500
it's uncharted and it's alive.
It's electric and all these different people,

2614
02:31:52.501 --> 02:31:55.500
whether I agree with them or not,
whether I think they're flawed or not,

2615
02:31:55.501 --> 02:31:59.510
and a lot of them are flawed and I'm flawed too,
but this,
this input and this,

2616
02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:03.210
these new ideas that are encouraging all of this debate and all this discussion,

2617
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:08.070
I think it's amazing.
I think it's,
it's one of the most amazing events in our,

2618
02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:12.280
in our entire history,
the history of our culture crowning achievement as far as,

2619
02:32:12.281 --> 02:32:16.790
yeah,
I mean honestly,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I think it's,
we're,

2620
02:32:16.791 --> 02:32:20.490
we're dealing with one of the most unique times in human history and it's just

2621
02:32:20.491 --> 02:32:24.900
sort of snuck up on us and Mac lethal.
You're a part of it,
bitch.
I love it.

2622
02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:28.830
You are right.
Everybody was,

2623
02:32:28.831 --> 02:32:31.930
all those youtube people with their crazy edits do it.
Couldn't,

2624
02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:35.760
<v 4>like there are major record labels that would pay that.</v>

2625
02:32:35.761 --> 02:32:40.761
Look at my youtube channel is just an invaluable resource that would pay

2626
02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:45.000
millions of dollars to be able to get the amount of subscribers I have because

2627
02:32:45.001 --> 02:32:47.460
they can't do it because people aren't interested in them.

2628
02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:51.660
People aren't interested in these huge record labels are these huge entities

2629
02:32:51.661 --> 02:32:53.550
that that produce,
you know,

2630
02:32:53.551 --> 02:32:57.750
homogenized generic music anymore and it's,

2631
02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:02.070
it's really rebellious.
And for example,

2632
02:33:02.370 --> 02:33:07.370
Russell sentence just launched a youtube channel called all def digital and he's

2633
02:33:09.151 --> 02:33:14.151
essentially throwing millions of dollars all over the place to try to beef up

2634
02:33:14.371 --> 02:33:17.400
his internet presence and be a part of this.

2635
02:33:17.490 --> 02:33:21.540
And I don't think he's going to be very successful doing it.
Why,
how come he's,

2636
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:24.000
I mean he's just had a touch,
uh,
you know,
his,

2637
02:33:24.001 --> 02:33:29.001
his time was in the 80s and the early nineties when he could promote in New York

2638
02:33:29.761 --> 02:33:33.600
City and wheat paste flyers and posters to walls and,

2639
02:33:33.601 --> 02:33:38.601
and throw parties and he doesn't understand the internet and how it works.

2640
02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:40.080
And you know,

2641
02:33:40.081 --> 02:33:45.081
the Internet requires a lot of humility and patience and constantly evolving and

2642
02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:50.820
constantly engaging in dialog,
a creative dialogue being free thinking.

2643
02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:54.630
And I don't think that people like that understand that.
That's interesting.

2644
02:33:54.650 --> 02:33:58.440
There was a lot of people that are trying to capitalize off of youtube right now

2645
02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:02.800
because youtube and Google have launched Google fiber.
Do you want,

2646
02:34:02.801 --> 02:34:04.230
do you guys have Google fiber out here?

2647
02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:09.660
<v 0>Do we have a fat hundred megabyte up and down per second connect that we had to</v>

2648
02:34:10.151 --> 02:34:14.530
have installed like a high speed business lines.
Yeah,
it's dope.

2649
02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:18.310
So I think Google fiber is a megabytes

2650
02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:21.590
<v 4>a second,
right?
Is it a thousand megs?
A second?
I think so.
He's,</v>

2651
02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:24.340
it's a thousand megabytes a second.
Well here's what they did.

2652
02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:29.460
There's a place called Wyandotte county in Kansas City and it's like this kind

2653
02:34:30.131 --> 02:34:34.960
of like white trash,
lower middle class area of Kansas.

2654
02:34:34.961 --> 02:34:37.630
It's a very odd place for them to do this,

2655
02:34:37.631 --> 02:34:41.800
but this is where they beta tested Google fiber and everybody in the county has

2656
02:34:41.801 --> 02:34:42.370
it.

2657
02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:47.370
And essentially what they're doing is for $150 a month that they connect their,

2658
02:34:47.531 --> 02:34:47.831
their,

2659
02:34:47.831 --> 02:34:52.831
their fiber cable to your house and you get a thousand megabyte per second up

2660
02:34:53.561 --> 02:34:54.394
and down,

2661
02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:59.400
you get 700 something original youtube channels that are directly accessible by

2662
02:34:59.861 --> 02:35:03.640
your television.
And then you get all the network TV channels and a phone.

2663
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:08.270
And essentially what they're trying to do is topple over.
Network TV is,

2664
02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:10.120
so about a year ago,

2665
02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:15.480
Google through like $70 billion at like 700 800 different people to create

2666
02:35:16.810 --> 02:35:21.310
original content on youtube for rail,
Williams,
CNN,

2667
02:35:21.311 --> 02:35:25.990
all these different people got these billion dollar investments and they said,

2668
02:35:26.050 --> 02:35:30.070
make us new content,
make us content that is going to shut down cable TV.

2669
02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:31.960
And that's what everybody's doing right now.

2670
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:36.850
So it's a fucking very fascinating and very exciting time.

2671
02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:40.840
I'm waiting for someone to come along and do like a game of Thrones online.
Oh,

2672
02:35:40.841 --> 02:35:41.674
that's going to happen.

2673
02:35:42.370 --> 02:35:45.580
Especially because we're going to have four k accessibility now.
I mean,

2674
02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:47.830
your phone on your phone,

2675
02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:51.220
you're going to be able to use your Samsung Galaxy and fucking film game of

2676
02:35:51.221 --> 02:35:54.460
Thrones,
season five.
I mean,
it's on,
it's on.

2677
02:35:54.461 --> 02:35:58.150
And that's what I love about all of this is I,
when I was coming up,

2678
02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:00.940
I knew that I was maybe a little too weird,

2679
02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:04.300
maybe a little too different to ever have a song on the radio.

2680
02:36:04.301 --> 02:36:07.450
I don't have the sex appeal that some of these,
you know,

2681
02:36:07.451 --> 02:36:12.250
preppy Douche bag rappers have or I'm not edgy enough for whatever it is.

2682
02:36:12.430 --> 02:36:16.690
So I always knew I was going to have to connect with people one by one and build

2683
02:36:16.691 --> 02:36:21.691
my own empire in the late nineties this was just creating my own music at my

2684
02:36:22.361 --> 02:36:26.920
house,
sending off $1,000 getting a thousand cds manufactured in,

2685
02:36:26.921 --> 02:36:31.390
selling them out of the trunk of my car and one by one building my own fan base.

2686
02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:34.750
Then as the two thousands progressed and the Internet got bigger,

2687
02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:39.760
I realize people are getting online to listen to and find out about new music.

2688
02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:42.550
So I jumped on that shit a long fucking time ago.

2689
02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:44.920
Never sought out trying to make a radio single,

2690
02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:47.020
never tried to get on a major record label.

2691
02:36:47.021 --> 02:36:50.110
I've had major record label deal offers in the past couple of years.

2692
02:36:50.111 --> 02:36:51.910
I've turned down because the money isn't good enough,

2693
02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:56.470
but I always knew that a visual Bragg was that a humble brag?

2694
02:36:57.570 --> 02:37:00.810
Sorry about that.
Let me take that back.
[inaudible] humble brags or,
okay.
Okay.

2695
02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:03.250
Five part of life.
Fine.
Yeah,
they were on my Dick.

2696
02:37:05.050 --> 02:37:09.690
So I just always knew that independent music with the,

2697
02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:14.170
with the Internet,
when Sean Parker created Napster and we realized,

2698
02:37:14.171 --> 02:37:18.820
found out that they could take a very,
uh,
heavy,
uh,

2699
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:23.810
big sized Wav file and compress it down to a three or four megabyte MP3.

2700
02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:28.850
That was the death of the music business as we knew it then there was no way

2701
02:37:28.851 --> 02:37:30.440
record stores were going to stay open.

2702
02:37:30.441 --> 02:37:33.320
There was no way records and cds we're going to sell like they used to.

2703
02:37:33.321 --> 02:37:36.740
And it was only a matter of time before the Internet got more exposure,

2704
02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:40.790
got faster,
people got on new computers and could download music.

2705
02:37:40.791 --> 02:37:44.000
And once that happened,
it changed the game,
completely revolutionized it.

2706
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:48.410
So all these major record labels and all these huge platinum selling artist were

2707
02:37:48.411 --> 02:37:51.440
completely shut down.
And then people like me had a lane.

2708
02:37:51.441 --> 02:37:55.220
And while we're not as big as,
you know,
some of these huge artists,

2709
02:37:55.221 --> 02:37:57.140
backstreet boys or whoever the fuck people,

2710
02:37:57.141 --> 02:38:00.110
like a mortal technique who I know you've had on here or me,

2711
02:38:00.350 --> 02:38:05.350
we're able to use things like youtube to directly connect to our fans and that's

2712
02:38:05.631 --> 02:38:10.010
what's so exciting about Google fiber is it's,
it's making it even better.

2713
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:13.490
We're going to be able to put money into the shit that we do and have fucking

2714
02:38:13.491 --> 02:38:18.491
big semi decent productions and we don't have to rely on any major record label,

2715
02:38:19.431 --> 02:38:23.870
any television network,
anything.
It's fucking wild west man.

2716
02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:26.540
Yeah,
yeah.

2717
02:38:26.541 --> 02:38:29.360
Well we're getting real legitimate sponsors now.

2718
02:38:29.390 --> 02:38:33.760
We're going to look real companies and stamps.com they don't have a choice where

2719
02:38:34.050 --> 02:38:34.880
I they're going to go,

2720
02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:37.670
well not only that and we were refused to do like a real commercial,

2721
02:38:37.671 --> 02:38:38.930
like I don't really read it.

2722
02:38:38.931 --> 02:38:42.000
I just sort of say I say their points but I say it the way I want to do it and

2723
02:38:42.001 --> 02:38:44.550
that only do it in the beginning.
I won't interrupt any of this.

2724
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:47.720
They wanted to stop.
Like,
there's a lot of guys that are doing it now.

2725
02:38:47.721 --> 02:38:50.780
They're doing it like a TV show.
They stop every 15 minutes.
Hey,

2726
02:38:50.810 --> 02:38:53.390
that's an interesting point medically.
So you know,
what else is interesting?

2727
02:38:53.391 --> 02:38:54.350
Stamps dot.
Tom,

2728
02:38:54.351 --> 02:38:57.800
if you have a business and they're doing it that way and I don't want to do it

2729
02:38:57.801 --> 02:39:01.040
that way.
Well you don't have to.
We don't have to because we didn't.

2730
02:39:01.460 --> 02:39:05.140
And because it's sort of became something very popular without that.
Yeah.

2731
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:07.940
And you've got,
as long as you have the people paying attention,

2732
02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:09.740
that's all that matters.
You're,

2733
02:39:09.741 --> 02:39:12.500
you're directly connected to them and you don't need them.

2734
02:39:12.890 --> 02:39:14.750
You just don't need them.
And that's what it is.

2735
02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:20.080
I've used youtube and Facebook and Twitter to do is just get my weird music out

2736
02:39:20.241 --> 02:39:24.380
there and my weird blogs out there and a lot of people liked them and that's

2737
02:39:24.381 --> 02:39:27.950
what's so fucking cool about it.
Yeah.
I liked him.
This is very cool about it.

2738
02:39:27.951 --> 02:39:31.460
Yeah.
I mean,
I appreciate it.
We're both a part of that,
um,

2739
02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:34.900
sort of thing where people found something that they just liked.
I,

2740
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:36.260
I've done a lot of different things,

2741
02:39:36.261 --> 02:39:39.020
whether it's fear factor and news radio or the UFC or what have you,

2742
02:39:39.021 --> 02:39:43.250
but I don't really use any of those things to promote this podcast.
I never have.

2743
02:39:43.251 --> 02:39:48.251
This podcast sort of kind of found itself pretty organically and that just,

2744
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:53.090
you know,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't know how it happened.
It just sorta happened.

2745
02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:57.260
Do you feel that from your days on fear factor too,

2746
02:39:57.261 --> 02:40:01.190
now that you've had several stages of,

2747
02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:06.220
of reimagining your image or maybe the people you've exposed yourself in

2748
02:40:06.771 --> 02:40:09.410
different platforms so people learned more about who you are?

2749
02:40:09.411 --> 02:40:11.690
Like because when I used to see you on fear factor,

2750
02:40:11.691 --> 02:40:14.910
I would have never guessed that you would fucking get in an isolation tank and

2751
02:40:14.911 --> 02:40:17.790
take four grams of mushrooms and,
and think about,
you know,

2752
02:40:17.791 --> 02:40:19.920
all of us having a collective conscious or something.

2753
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:22.920
But then the more I learned about you through youtube because you are on youtube

2754
02:40:22.921 --> 02:40:27.210
real early and I would just see these videos and be like,
dude,
this dude is dope.

2755
02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:29.610
And he's into like some cerebral shit.

2756
02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:34.640
And do you feel like this has helped people understand you better as a person?

2757
02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:37.950
Well,
tell me,
explain me better.
I mean we,
we,

2758
02:40:37.951 --> 02:40:41.300
everyone loves to pigeon hole and if I didn't know me I would certainly pigeon

2759
02:40:41.301 --> 02:40:45.630
hole me.
Yeah,
that happens.
Fucking meathead Douche bag,
making people eat bugs.

2760
02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:49.710
I wouldn't want to listen to me talk about anything philosophical or anything

2761
02:40:49.711 --> 02:40:50.400
that I think,
uh,

2762
02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:55.260
but one of the things about doing something like a fear factor where you,
you,

2763
02:40:55.261 --> 02:40:58.800
you gained financial freedom is you also gain the freedom to speak your mind

2764
02:40:58.801 --> 02:41:00.760
because you're not worried about the repercussions.
I've,

2765
02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:05.800
I always had standup comedy and I made money on fear factor and then I've always

2766
02:41:05.941 --> 02:41:09.510
had the UFC.
I don't have to worry about speaking my mind.

2767
02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:13.560
And that has allowed me to have some freedom.

2768
02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:18.000
And then doing a podcast allow me to have a platform where I get to express

2769
02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:22.440
myself,
people fucking whatever weirdness.
And then we were,
no one's perfect,

2770
02:41:22.441 --> 02:41:24.270
you know,
everyone has flaws.
Everyone had.

2771
02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:28.260
We changed from day to day depending upon our stress level and what emotional

2772
02:41:28.261 --> 02:41:31.980
shit we're dealing with our personal life,
our business life or what have you.

2773
02:41:32.170 --> 02:41:36.840
That we very,
we all have a a lot of variation and in our behavior,

2774
02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:40.980
but when you talk to someone or you hear someone talk for hours and hours and

2775
02:41:40.980 --> 02:41:43.380
hours and hours over the course of x amount of years,

2776
02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:47.120
you get an idea of who the fuck they are really.
Do you really do get,

2777
02:41:47.140 --> 02:41:48.030
they can't hide.

2778
02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:50.890
You can't hide three hours a day every fucking day you're going to expose

2779
02:41:50.891 --> 02:41:53.580
yourself and in in that,

2780
02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:58.680
I think there's never been a vehicle ever that's allowed people to get to know

2781
02:41:58.681 --> 02:42:01.260
people like they can off of the Internet,

2782
02:42:01.310 --> 02:42:06.000
like what they can from podcasts has never existed and before artists used to be

2783
02:42:06.001 --> 02:42:08.370
almost flawless,
the,

2784
02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:13.440
you couldn't see their flaws and and people gravitated towards that and now it's

2785
02:42:13.801 --> 02:42:17.880
almost like people are more drawn towards people that do have flaws that they

2786
02:42:17.881 --> 02:42:19.230
sometimes disagree with.

2787
02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:23.220
It's like an elevated version of what a rock star used to be because a rock star

2788
02:42:23.221 --> 02:42:27.840
used to be this a theory or creative sexual being that there could do no wrong.

2789
02:42:28.170 --> 02:42:33.170
But I think that we elevated beyond that and now people want to know that this

2790
02:42:33.391 --> 02:42:36.150
mother fucker might say some shit that I'm going to disagree with sooner.

2791
02:42:36.151 --> 02:42:38.970
Like Louie,
how he's,
he,
he can't stop eating and he's,

2792
02:42:38.971 --> 02:42:41.580
he's Chubby and the little how to shape and balding,

2793
02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:44.430
but that's what people gravitate towards.
Now.
It's an,

2794
02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:48.960
it's like the anti image and it,
that's fucking amazing to me.

2795
02:42:48.990 --> 02:42:53.310
That's what I love about all this shit is that we're going above and beyond what

2796
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:56.730
people treat as a people.
Uh,

2797
02:42:57.630 --> 02:42:59.420
people worshiped or idolized.
We're,

2798
02:42:59.421 --> 02:43:02.670
we're taking it to a different level and connecting on a much more intimate and

2799
02:43:02.671 --> 02:43:05.790
personal level.
Absolutely.
That's a really good point.

2800
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:08.640
I think the idolization and the,
the,

2801
02:43:08.641 --> 02:43:11.980
the rockstar analogy is perfect because we always thought they could

2802
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.880
<v 9>do no wrong.
They are so perfect.
And we always thought like,
oh my God,</v>

2803
02:43:15.881 --> 02:43:18.670
you're star struck when you meet them.
I can't,
I'm not worthy.
I'm not worthy.

2804
02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.580
And then you realize somewhere along the line that that's just a person.

2805
02:43:21.610 --> 02:43:26.610
And when you are exposed to all a person's flaws and ups and downs and you

2806
02:43:26.711 --> 02:43:30.580
realize there's a,
there's a very empowering thing to other people about.

2807
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:34.000
I love talking about when I was a loser.
I think it's really important.

2808
02:43:34.001 --> 02:43:38.860
I talk about like all the times I was a pussy or scared or I didn't have any

2809
02:43:38.861 --> 02:43:43.840
courage,
was social anxiety or you know,
just just really had no self esteem.

2810
02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:46.840
I think it's super important to talk about those times so that people can

2811
02:43:46.841 --> 02:43:47.950
realize like,
oh,

2812
02:43:47.951 --> 02:43:52.951
this isn't a guy who was successful always and always been confident and always,

2813
02:43:53.561 --> 02:43:56.620
he's different than me.
I can't relate to that kind of thinking.
No,

2814
02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:59.230
I used to get nervous talking to the bank teller.

2815
02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:03.130
I'd get tongue tied going to the bank,
you know,
especially when I was broken,

2816
02:44:03.131 --> 02:44:07.240
I was depositing a $50 check or something like that,
you know?
I'd get nervous.

2817
02:44:07.270 --> 02:44:08.550
I like legitimately nervous.
Yeah.

2818
02:44:08.670 --> 02:44:12.540
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
I think that that's maybe one of the things is,</v>

2819
02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:14.310
is as a rap artist,

2820
02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:18.270
people have connected to my shit because I all talk about,
you know,
my,

2821
02:44:18.390 --> 02:44:21.270
my insecurities are all become vulnerable and yeah,

2822
02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:25.020
I'm a rapper when that's not supposed to happen in rap.
Sure.
White rapper.
Yeah,

2823
02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:28.720
that too.
He got a little more flexibility there.

2824
02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:30.160
I know,

2825
02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:33.640
<v 9>I know.
Yeah.
I think,
I think it's beautiful.
It's,
it's again,
like everything else,</v>

2826
02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:36.970
it's sort of exposing things in a way that it's never been possible.

2827
02:44:36.971 --> 02:44:39.400
This is the Charlie Sheen one.
What does the Charlie Sheen

2828
02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:44.740
<v 14>best known?

2830
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.560

Dream on punk bitch.

Charlie Sheen,

2838

five foot nine with the hard on clean blink desires.

2839
02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:23.830
Any keyword aids is women had cocaine or people are great.
Okay.
Charlie Sheen.

2840
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:26.300
Charlie Sheen.
Yes.

2841
02:45:27.570 --> 02:45:30.930
<v 9>Especially now that he's Sorta like leveled out of psalm on Doctor Oz the other</v>

2842
02:45:30.930 --> 02:45:31.220

2843
02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:34.830
<v 4>Am I getting,

He was looking at how dare you?
No,
no,
no,</v>

2844
02:45:34.831 --> 02:45:36.460
no,
no.
Let me hear.

2845
02:45:36.540 --> 02:45:39.900
Doctor Oz was going to have me on his show because uh,

2846
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:42.640
his people enjoyed my pancake rap.

2847
02:45:42.641 --> 02:45:46.810
I also did an at chick filet rap when chick-fil-a had that whole anti gay thing,

2848
02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:47.231
whatever.

2849
02:45:47.231 --> 02:45:52.231
I did a rap video where I remade a chick fil a sandwich and use the recipe so

2850
02:45:52.241 --> 02:45:55.060
people didn't have to go to chick filet and support their hands like they
causes.

2851
02:45:55.270 --> 02:45:59.470
So they hit me up and they were like,
we love your food,
your food wraps.

2852
02:45:59.471 --> 02:46:04.420
We would love to have you on here to make like a strawberry banana smoothie or

2853
02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:09.290
something healthy and promote healthy eating and do like a cool fast rap and you

2854
02:46:09.291 --> 02:46:10.220
know,
we'll fly you out.

2855
02:46:10.221 --> 02:46:13.430
You'll do it for free because it's great exposure and you'll love it and you're

2856
02:46:13.431 --> 02:46:16.430
excited about this.
And I'm like,
okay,
yeah,
that's great.

2857
02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:19.640
So we book all this travel and get ready to do this.

2858
02:46:19.641 --> 02:46:21.800
And then they cancel it because of texts from Bennett.

2859
02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:24.860
And because they were just like,
we don't want to be affiliated with that.

2860
02:46:24.890 --> 02:46:28.280
And we'll explain texts from Bennett just texted one and it's fucking hilarious.

2861
02:46:28.420 --> 02:46:30.140
What,
why,
why do they have a problem with texts?

2862
02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:32.780
And I'm quoted on your book cover,
right?
Yeah.

2863
02:46:32.781 --> 02:46:35.810
It just says hilarious because I didn't hilarious.
That's what I say.

2864
02:46:35.811 --> 02:46:36.644
I just sent it again,

2865
02:46:37.610 --> 02:46:41.420
what's explain texts from Bennett to people and texts from Bennett is a blog

2866
02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:46.480
about my cousin who is a 17 year old crip wigger crip.

2867
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:48.103
That's illiterate.

2868
02:46:48.170 --> 02:46:52.850
That sends me text messages that are accidentally genius.

2869
02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:55.820
Um,
and it's a real dude.
It's a real dude.

2870
02:46:57.620 --> 02:46:59.450
I wasn't even sure if it was a real dude.

2871
02:46:59.451 --> 02:47:02.150
Here's the thing about texts from Bennett is,
oh,
that's Mercedes.

2872
02:47:02.151 --> 02:47:06.560
That's his girlfriend.
Well Ben,
it just broke my Drake CD.
Can you borrow me?

2873
02:47:06.561 --> 02:47:07.400
Know the copy.

2874
02:47:07.730 --> 02:47:10.970
He says Drake color coordinates his outfit to match his bowl of fruit loops.

2875
02:47:10.971 --> 02:47:13.970
That's his girlfriend.
Your pull up,
pull up Ben and himself.

2876
02:47:14.330 --> 02:47:18.800
I hate my girlfriend was here.
These are all very soon I'll tell you.
Oh,
this is a

2877
02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:24.910
keep going.
I'll,
I'll,
we'll find a good one.
Okay,
well listen,
the point is your,

2878
02:47:24.911 --> 02:47:29.440
your,
your cousin,
your cousin Bennet.
Yes.
Is he get a piece of all this?
Yes,

2879
02:47:29.530 --> 02:47:33.490
he does.
Yes.
W how do you,
how do you,
like what do you do with them?

2880
02:47:33.491 --> 02:47:38.200
Do you get them fucked up on mad dog?
2020 Tom.
Hey,

2881
02:47:38.201 --> 02:47:42.520
once you send me a text,
right.
We worked it out for my aunt,
his mother,

2882
02:47:42.690 --> 02:47:46.260
and we'd say we'd take care of,
I take care of his aunt instead of him.
Oh,

2883
02:47:46.270 --> 02:47:49.510
he worked it out with you that way.
I worked it out with him that way.
It was,

2884
02:47:49.511 --> 02:47:53.310
it was,
it was your,
your call.
It was willing to do that.
Yeah.

2885
02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:57.340
I don't have a choice.
So,
because here's the deal.
I said here,

2886
02:47:57.341 --> 02:48:01.930
I'm going to write a book about this blog that has blown up unbeknownst to you.

2887
02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:03.250
It's a real book.
So I'm going to right.

2888
02:48:03.251 --> 02:48:06.280
Well this is a real book that it came out on Tuesday and a novel.

2889
02:48:06.690 --> 02:48:09.980
It's a fucking novel.
It's it.
And it's Simon and Schuster released it.

2890
02:48:09.981 --> 02:48:11.650
It's in fucking bookstores right now.

2891
02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:16.660
Just came out and I got to tell the recount of recount the summer where they

2892
02:48:19.091 --> 02:48:21.670
came to live with me and a network,

2893
02:48:21.671 --> 02:48:25.980
which I can't say has expressed serious interest into optioning it.

2894
02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:29.470
And how gross is that statement?
You just went Hollywood on us.

2895
02:48:29.530 --> 02:48:33.520
I didn't mean no harm.
Cause expressed serious interest.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

2896
02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:36.520
We're back in the Kevin Bacon moved.
Kevin make a movie about,

2897
02:48:36.521 --> 02:48:40.870
what was that movie called?
It's a great fucking movie.
Flatliners is it good?

2898
02:48:40.871 --> 02:48:43.570
Maybe?
No,
no,
no,
that's not it.
So Kevin Bacon movie about Hollywood.

2899
02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:48.820
What does the ground,
nothing confidential.
Don't be stupid.
Just try to find it.

2900
02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:50.770
Kevin Bacon movie about Hollywood.

2901
02:48:55.330 --> 02:48:57.610
Yeah.
You should use two hands because I am,

2902
02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:01.590
and I can do it quicker than you don't edit changing cameras.
Oh,

2903
02:49:01.820 --> 02:49:05.170
you could stop that for a moment.
I can't find the name of it,

2904
02:49:05.171 --> 02:49:08.220
but it was a really good movie and it's the,
the movie where

2905
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:10.200
<v 0>Teri Hatcher look,
the hottest.</v>

2906
02:49:11.010 --> 02:49:16.010
Teri Hatcher was so ridiculously hot back then that a girl that I was dating

2907
02:49:17.431 --> 02:49:19.980
actually got mad that I said she was hot,

2908
02:49:20.250 --> 02:49:23.820
which I always find to be the big picture.
Yes,
the big picture.

2909
02:49:24.780 --> 02:49:29.100
It's a great movie.
It's a great movie about Hollywood,
about how it's all,

2910
02:49:29.101 --> 02:49:31.560
and they would say that strong interest in optioning.
I didn't,

2911
02:49:31.650 --> 02:49:35.220
I didn't mean it like that.
It's like you're a director.
That's funny.
Mike,

2912
02:49:35.221 --> 02:49:37.200
our waiter as a director too,
aren't you Mike?

2913
02:49:37.201 --> 02:49:42.130
And like when he applies for a job as a server at a restaurant,

2914
02:49:42.131 --> 02:49:45.280
and it's like,
the idea is that everybody's trying to,
you know,

2915
02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:49.610
make it in show business,
but geriatric was so hot and that movie.
And,
uh,

2916
02:49:49.650 --> 02:49:54.240
someone said,
uh,
how hot was his check?
I go,
I go from a one to 10,

2917
02:49:54.241 --> 02:49:58.500
10 being Teri Hatcher in that movie and the,
what is it?

2918
02:49:58.650 --> 02:50:01.320
A big picture.
Like,
oh,
that's about as hot as a human being has ever been.

2919
02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:04.920
And my girlfriend goes,
fuck you.
You know,
whoa.

2920
02:50:05.970 --> 02:50:09.660
You want to pretend you're hotter than Teriyaki,
sir?
Go right ahead.
You know,

2921
02:50:10.170 --> 02:50:15.090
so in the book get mad at me.
She actually got mad at me.
I was like,

2922
02:50:15.091 --> 02:50:19.550
wow,
this one's not going to last.
The,
the book is,
is basically at,

2923
02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:22.290
it's about my cousin and his literate text messages,

2924
02:50:22.291 --> 02:50:26.550
but it goes above and beyond that and hardworking Kansas City rep or mass.

2925
02:50:26.551 --> 02:50:31.530
Holy Shit.
That was a problem.
And His name is Bennett.
Oh God.
Who wrote that?
Yeah,

2926
02:50:31.531 --> 02:50:34.950
I don't know him and his name is Ben should have approval of all that shit,
dude.

2927
02:50:34.951 --> 02:50:36.750
Yeah.
I wish I did those crack heads.

2928
02:50:37.710 --> 02:50:41.280
They get ahold of it and confuse the shit out of everything.
It's hilarious.

2929
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:45.950
The Hay was quick.
The um,
the,
the,

2930
02:50:46.470 --> 02:50:49.500
there's a Twitter handle for it too,
right?
Is it text from Venice?
Yeah.

2931
02:50:49.501 --> 02:50:54.480
It's texts from with note with no.
Oh,
Ben is still up on that.
The Twitter,

2932
02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:58.260
the thing that is,
it's big.
It's big on Tumbler.
Yeah.

2933
02:50:58.261 --> 02:51:02.940
Texts from Bennett.
How come there's no,
Oh,
uh,
not enough characters.

2934
02:51:03.090 --> 02:51:07.400
What?
Yeah.
Twitter wouldn't allow it.
Hmm.
It's way bigger on top.

2935
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:09.000
I don't want to do a humble brag again.

2936
02:51:09.030 --> 02:51:14.030
It's too bigger presence on tumbler because it's just pictures of the text

2937
02:51:15.301 --> 02:51:19.100
messages.
I can't have a hard time filing year.
Oh,
tech's ass.

2938
02:51:19.101 --> 02:51:22.980
The ask from Bennett.
Oh,
did I fucked it up.
Techs from Bennett,
right?
Yeah.

2939
02:51:22.990 --> 02:51:27.960
Text from Bennett.
Oh,
I'm falling out.
Of course I am.
Yeah.
These are funny,

2940
02:51:27.961 --> 02:51:31.440
man.
They're really funny.
I didn't know that it was a real guy.

2941
02:51:31.441 --> 02:51:34.860
I thought you were just bullshitting first I thought this Bennett guy was like a

2942
02:51:34.861 --> 02:51:37.470
real guy and then I thought it was,
oh,

2943
02:51:37.471 --> 02:51:40.650
it's a character that someone created and then to hear you say that it's

2944
02:51:40.651 --> 02:51:45.420
actually your cousin.
What if your cousin dies?
Oh,
he will.
At some point.

2945
02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:47.150
I was like,
Shit.
My Dad says like,

2946
02:51:47.151 --> 02:51:51.720
you've got to keep your dad alive in order to keep that empire going.
Yeah,

2947
02:51:51.721 --> 02:51:54.540
I think that it's going to be done now because he,

2948
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:59.630
he knows about it and only text messages me to ask if any girls have hit me up

2949
02:52:00.410 --> 02:52:03.930
to have sex with him.
He wants to kick groupies,

2950
02:52:04.470 --> 02:52:07.090
so that's hilarious.
It's probably,
it's probably done.

2951
02:52:07.091 --> 02:52:10.330
This book is kind of exiting that [inaudible] we're going to see if there's

2952
02:52:10.570 --> 02:52:15.100
other,
you know,
platforms I can put it on,
but it's pretty much done.
I've,
I've,

2953
02:52:15.101 --> 02:52:18.280
well that's awesome that you did the first thing.
All you,

2954
02:52:18.430 --> 02:52:22.420
that's the going to be most likely the best representation of this is what you

2955
02:52:22.421 --> 02:52:23.350
just did in this book.

2956
02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:27.040
So if anybody wants to buy it [inaudible] it's Simon and Schuster texts from

2957
02:52:27.041 --> 02:52:29.890
Bennett.
It's available on Amazon.
Is it?

2958
02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:32.080
Do you have an audio version of it and audible,
man,

2959
02:52:32.081 --> 02:52:34.640
I'm hoping that we get to do that.
Do you think that your,

2960
02:52:34.641 --> 02:52:38.110
your cousin would read it?
That would be in fingers crossed.

2961
02:52:38.170 --> 02:52:41.890
That would be the shit.
That would be so good.
I think it'd be,

2962
02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:44.800
I think it'd be bigger than than,
than this.
I think it'd be hilarious.

2963
02:52:44.890 --> 02:52:45.800
It would be the best.
Yeah.

2964
02:52:45.801 --> 02:52:49.210
If you could actually just get them to just only get him to read off all the

2965
02:52:49.211 --> 02:52:53.020
text and then you do all the stuff in between and that would be awesome.

2966
02:52:53.050 --> 02:52:56.800
Just give him a day's work.
Sit Down in a studio.

2967
02:52:57.070 --> 02:53:01.270
I would love fucked up in the next box or something.
Like,
no,

2968
02:53:01.271 --> 02:53:04.750
you don't want to distract him.
No,
no,
no.
It's always a gift.
Yeah.

2969
02:53:04.770 --> 02:53:09.180
You got to pay him.
He did it.
Jujitsu class ones.
Really?
Yeah.
What?
How,

2970
02:53:09.220 --> 02:53:14.110
how's The meth out?
16 year old.
It handles Jujutsu puked.
Yeah.
Quite quick.

2971
02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:18.820
That's the thing,
man.
Methods.
They have zero cardio.
They just can't have,
yeah.

2972
02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:21.610
Even if they're on Meth,
it gets,
um,

2973
02:53:22.030 --> 02:53:25.420
have you ever seen someone like a guy who thinks he's in shape and then they go

2974
02:53:25.421 --> 02:53:28.570
to Jujitsu class and watch?
Yeah.
It happens all the time.
It's amazing.

2975
02:53:28.571 --> 02:53:32.230
And it happens all the time.
That's sometimes me.
If I'm on the road for too long,

2976
02:53:32.231 --> 02:53:35.060
I'm like,
ah,
back in Jujitsu.
And then I'd get out there and,
and,

2977
02:53:35.061 --> 02:53:39.670
and my endurance is like,
like,
you know,
30% what it was.
Yeah.
It sucks.

2978
02:53:39.671 --> 02:53:42.640
Get yourself some shroom tech sport.
Sun Power you up.

2979
02:53:42.641 --> 02:53:43.810
I don't know what does that,
we'll get it.

2980
02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:47.620
I'll give you something before we leave.

I'm,

3012
02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:43.700
I'm starting to do one of the things that happened with doing this TV show.

3013
02:55:43.970 --> 02:55:46.630
I haven't been doing as much standup as I should.
And uh,

3014
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:51.180
I had one rusty set this weekend.
Saturday night late show soup.
Sorry.

3015
02:55:51.290 --> 02:55:54.440
Book Soup is what you,
the club is.
Yeah,
no,
that's the,
that's the bookstore.

3016
02:55:54.470 --> 02:55:58.230
Where's it at?
It's a,
where's it at Bradley?
Hold on,
hold on.

3017
02:55:58.250 --> 02:56:01.070
I'll find out books to book soup.

3018
02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:03.830
I'm going there right now doing a Q and a and signing books.

3019
02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:08.750
It's on a 88 one eight sunset boulevard,
West Hollywood,
California.

3020
02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:11.480
And the number is (310) 659-3110.

3021
02:56:11.481 --> 02:56:16.290
If you want to call them and say nice to rate me,
what's he going to do that?

3022
02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:20.660
Um,
so anyway,
the Ontario Improv,
I just booked it,
uh,
because I'm,

3023
02:56:20.661 --> 02:56:24.890
I'm trying to do way more stand up now.
I had a great fucking time in prayer.

3024
02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:27.830
Every show,
except the late show Saturday night was a little slippery.

3025
02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:29.930
So if you went to that show,
my apologies.

3026
02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:34.730
Some trying about an a bunch of new shit and sometimes it gets tangled up.
Um,

3027
02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:38.540
but I just booked Ontario Improv October 4th,
fifth,

3028
02:56:38.541 --> 02:56:40.640
and sixth for the weekend.
Uh,

3029
02:56:40.670 --> 02:56:42.740
Tommy Segura is going to be with me on the fourth and the fifth,

3030
02:56:42.741 --> 02:56:45.380
and then the sixth on a,
I don't know who I'm going to have book,
so it's,

3031
02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:49.370
it's pretty last minute.
So Ontario Improv,
it's all on my Twitter,

3032
02:56:49.610 --> 02:56:53.690
which is Joe Rogan.
And we'll see you guys tomorrow with the Duncan Trussell.
Uh,

3033
02:56:53.691 --> 02:56:56.390
that's it.
Uh,
a big e and a hug and a kiss.
Say y'all ma.

3034
02:57:07.310 --> 02:57:07.510
<v 15>Hmm.</v>
