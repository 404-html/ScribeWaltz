1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and boom.</v>

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice hat I've told you already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but live,</v>

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a nice.</v>

5
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

6
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of Indiana Jones,</v>

7
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's not quite that cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>You're like in the middle of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing on the edge.</v>

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>What can I have a really fat head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this website called like </v>

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>big heads.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a website,</v>

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a total website for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get my friend Paul Burke Chrysler a </v>

12
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then put his hat on.</v>

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.301
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe how big his head was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was like an inch gap over in </v>

14
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I had a big head.</v>

15
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

16
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know your head,</v>

17
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>your head size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know your head size?</v>

18
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>

19
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>so it turns out if you know your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

21
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>that that number comes from somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you what it is?</v>

22
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you measure the circumference of </v>

23
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get a tape measure,</v>

24
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>like you mentioned your waistline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do it around your head and take that</v>

25
00:00:56.521 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>number divided by Pi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's your hat size.</v>

26
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seems complicated.</v>

27
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Abide by to your waist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty two is what you're wasting.</v>

28
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>It just is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Just why it can't just be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumference,</v>

30
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it turns out to be.</v>

31
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is if you're dividing</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Pi,</v>

32
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>you're getting the diameter of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circle that has the same dimension as,</v>

33
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>as the circumference of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have an oblong head,</v>

34
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>then what it's doing is finding out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the circle is.</v>

35
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>The diameter of the circle that has that</v>
<v Speaker 1>same circumference is your head.</v>

36
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what that's doing for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever.</v>

37
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Whether that helps the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hat maker.</v>

38
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>So immediately I started thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Akroyd and siren and live as a cone </v>

39
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>head within India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tall hat for that to get it.</v>

40
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>So do you still doing stand up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

41
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Constantly loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And they caught you a few months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were emceeing some MMA,</v>

43
00:01:58.411 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was.</v>

44
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always doing that.</v>

45
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Kept some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then stayed in shape because I'm,</v>

46
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fat Slob,</v>

47
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day,</v>

48
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:13.011
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like some street credit back </v>

49
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:19.431
<v Speaker 1>then you exercise at all now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I don't have the energy </v>

50
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

51
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.510
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to find the test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You back in the day looking at you it.</v>

52
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>How much do you weigh back then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

53
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on once.</v>

54
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

55
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 6,190</v>

56
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>pounds in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh exactly.</v>

57
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I have big thighs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>other wrestlers would have skinnier </v>
<v Speaker 1>thighs and things.</v>

59
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>So I was also taller than anyone I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestled.</v>

60
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:44.331
<v Speaker 1>So since we're the same height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it meant they had bigger muscles </v>

61
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because we're the same weight.</v>

62
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sorry,</v>

63
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>did I say that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taller but with the same weight.</v>

64
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>So that means they have bigger muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Because none of us have fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

66
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>So I had to do things that my lankiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>would enable me to do and to accomplish </v>

67
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:02.211
<v Speaker 1>that they couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have long reach this sort of scoop </v>

68
00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:02.211
<v Speaker 1>an ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

69
00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It's great advantages to having long </v>
<v Speaker 1>limbs in martial arts space,</v>

70
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.880
<v Speaker 1>particularly in wrestling grappling </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the leverage.</v>

71
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also if you're quick and with Linda and </v>

72
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.331
<v Speaker 1>I was both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they got me in their grip it was </v>

73
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>hard for me to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of exercise do you do these</v>

74
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.220
<v Speaker 1>days?</v>

75
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying.</v>

76
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm in I'm good,</v>

77
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>but I've just got so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to like make the time.</v>

78
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>When you become a little bit for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own food,</v>

80
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of food documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>trying to get you to eat differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I'd watched the wall.</v>

82
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I've binged on them one weekend while I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing other stuff and I got hungry.</v>

83
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 1>No one of one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys,</v>

84
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to lose 100 pounds or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

85
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>so every 15 pounds he lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put a bowling ball up on the counter </v>

86
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what I'm not carrying around </v>

87
00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.890
<v Speaker 1>with me because of bowling balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 15 pounds.</v>

88
00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

89
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:04.261
<v Speaker 1>He's measuring awaiting bowling balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something because we say I'm </v>

90
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>three pounds less than two pounds.</v>

91
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't hit you emotionally the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bowling ball does after you've lost 15</v>

92
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>pounds because no one wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying that around.</v>

93
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>So psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was quite potent.</v>

94
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>That is potent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we do need to.</v>

95
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I usually use like plates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of weight plates or Dumbbell.</v>

96
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

97
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.140
<v Speaker 1>that works too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

99
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:28.261
<v Speaker 1>I started doing intermittent fasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty recently where I only allow </v>

100
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>myself to eat 10 hours in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

101
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.430
<v Speaker 1>10 out of the 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

102
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>So I had a terry crews on my radio show </v>
<v Speaker 1>on start talking that boys,</v>

103
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>my boys ripped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks great.</v>

104
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He's still and he's like 47 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

105
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:46.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's so he doesn't eat until 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>noon and that he doesn't eat until after</v>

106
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>10:00.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

107
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten minutes that he doesn't need after </v>

108
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.850
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a 10 hour thing.</v>

109
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And so he has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's watching everyone else have brunch </v>

110
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.940
<v Speaker 1>and breakfast and so he's got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome that.</v>

111
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.250
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a little bit of fasting each </v>

112
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.521
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intermittent fast just to keep the </v>

113
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:05.521
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at the end of the day,</v>

114
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:10.021
<v Speaker 1>it's really just discipline that it also</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces your body to burn fat instead of </v>

115
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and when it forces your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body to burn fat,</v>

116
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>that state of Ketosis is actually easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain because you don't.</v>

117
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't get hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Then there's no rollercoaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

119
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>the crash that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the carbohydrate crash that you get,</v>

120
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>is that outside of the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility for,</v>

121
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can totally.</v>

122
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm a ketosis guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything involving science,</v>

123
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

124
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I once got raked over the coals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not by everyone,</v>

125
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>but I tweeted once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

126
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>if there was a diet book written by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist who will contain one sentence,</v>

127
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 1>consume calories at a lesser rate than </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a greater rate,</v>

128
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>consumed calories at a lesser rate than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you burn them.</v>

129
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>That is sort of true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one sentence.</v>

130
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Do know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated than that and </v>

131
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>everyone just try to get all this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that and one of the great </v>

132
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.761
<v Speaker 1>things of physics when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do physics is all the details </v>

133
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:10.481
<v Speaker 1>are just cut off the window dressing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get down to the window itself and </v>

134
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>that's what the analysis works on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have rarely seen you attacked,</v>

135
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but I did see you attack when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrating a Sir Isaac Newton's </v>

136
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.140
<v Speaker 1>birthday.</v>

137
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

138
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>people were so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People lost their mind lost in mind when</v>

139
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

140
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>incorrect in the date of Jesus's </v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday.</v>

141
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>That is not the date of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus did not.</v>

142
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Was Not born on the 25th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

143
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Plus I didn't even mention that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>so what I said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

145
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>that to this day is my highest retweeted</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet.</v>

146
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you remember,</v>

147
00:06:46.501 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>it was actually a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

148
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>so it was on December 25th comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

149
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>You've got to transform the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happy Birthday on this day.</v>

150
00:06:56.361 --> 00:07:01.361
<v Speaker 1>Long ago a child was born who by age 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>were transformed the world.</v>

151
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Happy Birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac Newton,</v>

152
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>born December 25th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

153
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:08.980
<v Speaker 1>40 to 79,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>retweets.</v>

154
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Thousand life people just lost them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mad they're angry.</v>

155
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

156
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking the truth here.</v>

157
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he transformed civilization by boy.</v>

158
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Actually he did it by the time he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>26.</v>

159
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>

160
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:30.071
<v Speaker 1>it's provocative because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting the Jesus is going to end </v>

161
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:32.621
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought I'd share it some extra </v>

162
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>actual truth with people and so some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people celebrate it deeply.</v>

163
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Religious people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One had a headline,</v>

164
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>St Neil degrasse Tyson is trolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians on Christmas Day.</v>

165
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said Newton at least has the benefit </v>

166
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>of actually having been born that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later on it,</v>

167
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 1>it's actually more subtle than that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newton because he was on the Julian </v>

168
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.461
<v Speaker 1>calendar which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 10 days shifted from the </v>

169
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Gregorian calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you ask what would his birthday be</v>

170
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.910
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be January fourth,</v>

171
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 1>December 25th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

172
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>But when he was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother was celebrating Christmas.</v>

173
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>So that's really what matters for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet.</v>

174
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 1>This is a bizarre thing anyway because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a real Christian,</v>

175
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:16.661
<v Speaker 1>you would understand that the birthday </v>
<v Speaker 1>was shifted in order to comply with </v>

176
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:17.100
<v Speaker 1>pagan religion.</v>

177
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It landed.</v>

178
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

179
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're a well read guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

180
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So if you give me a minute to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain that.</v>

181
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So December 21st we know his first day </v>
<v Speaker 1>of winter,</v>

182
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 1>shortest day of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what makes it short?</v>

183
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Shortest daylight of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what makes it short?</v>

184
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.280
<v Speaker 1>The arc of the sun across the sky is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

185
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:43.030
<v Speaker 1>The Sun doesn't get very high and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't stay up for very long and it's </v>

186
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>been coming a lower and lower arch every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day on route to December 20.</v>

187
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:51.251
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient peoples were worried about </v>

188
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:53.891
<v Speaker 1>this because everyone worship the sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it made your crops come and he </v>

189
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>gave you warmth and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

190
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 1>if this keeps going lower and lower in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky,</v>

191
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.940
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lose the sun entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>December 21st the sun slows down and it </v>

192
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 1>stops this load.</v>

193
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.290
<v Speaker 1>This drop in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's moving across the sky from day to </v>

194
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that stopping of the sun is solstice.</v>

195
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 1>That Latin stationary son like </v>
<v Speaker 1>armistice,</v>

196
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.470
<v Speaker 1>stationary arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the end of the first world </v>

197
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.470
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weather November 11th,</v>

198
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>that was armistice solstice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

199
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 1>so the movement of the sun lower in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sky stops,</v>

200
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean it's going to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

201
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>It takes a few days for it to slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop and then reverse.</v>

202
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

203
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 1>it is coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's celebrate that,</v>

204
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:41.270
<v Speaker 1>and that's a few days after December 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First was about December 25th of Pagan </v>

205
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>holiday celebrating the return to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>

206
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is trying to take foothold </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there were were pagans once roamed</v>

207
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.550
<v Speaker 1>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put celebrations that match.</v>

208
00:09:51.551 --> 00:09:56.551
<v Speaker 1>There's just so that the the shift is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not as hard for you and the unknown </v>

209
00:09:56.551 --> 00:10:01.161
<v Speaker 1>birthday of Jesus within a signed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pagan Day of celebration to make that </v>

210
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>transition easier for the Pagans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become Christians.</v>

211
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it remained Christmas day and ever since</v>

212
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the birth of Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speculated birthday of Jesus is like</v>

213
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.670
<v Speaker 1>the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spring.</v>

214
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

215
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 1>there's some passages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>of course in the new testament that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference with the sheep were doing plus</v>

217
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense of being taken by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romans,</v>

218
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.840
<v Speaker 1>which is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mary goes to the manger,</v>

219
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>the animals are not in the manger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not at the.</v>

220
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.850
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's secondary evidence for that.</v>

221
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:30.730
<v Speaker 1>It's probably happened in the spring now</v>

222
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.330
<v Speaker 2>with the advent of commercial space </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel.</v>

223
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.000
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems,</v>

224
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 2>seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems inevitable,</v>

225
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love you.</v>

226
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Love your Segues d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that it's possible that </v>

227
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.891
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could even offer up a flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth believer tour where you take them,</v>

228
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 2>like at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take them up to Alaska where it's light.</v>

229
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:58.670
<v Speaker 2>So 23 hours of calling into you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this at tweeting me constantly </v>

230
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 2>telling me constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

231
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 2>call me a sellout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sellout around earth sellout.</v>

232
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Like as if there's some round earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>money while you're on the payroll </v>

233
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.210
<v Speaker 2>checks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting some ground earth,</v>

234
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Earth Pale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or for your show,</v>

235
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've seen the basketball </v>
<v Speaker 2>player who graduated from Duke,</v>

236
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:22.490
<v Speaker 2>from Duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was hitting the news the last </v>

237
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.490
<v Speaker 2>couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the leaves that dinosaurs are fake</v>

238
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 2>and that the world is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

239
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.270
<v Speaker 2>so here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

240
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you have.</v>

241
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 2>As an educator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about this.</v>

242
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

243
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what matters.</v>

244
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.660
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a free country.</v>

245
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>People should be able to think what ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>

246
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.060
<v Speaker 1>whenever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provided it doesn't subtract away from </v>

247
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.250
<v Speaker 1>someone else's rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

248
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:51.850
<v Speaker 1>So thinking the earth is flat doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>harm anyone unless you to run for office</v>

249
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 1>or you want some position of power over </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

250
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.930
<v Speaker 1>That's when it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thinking of elevator banks where they </v>

251
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:03.990
<v Speaker 1>have numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a photo essay of what elevators </v>

253
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.590
<v Speaker 1>look like inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's just,</v>

254
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gears.</v>

255
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

256
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:12.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

257
00:12:12.111 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

258
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

259
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even that Geeky.</v>

260
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Just what are the numbers on the panel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

261
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.280
<v Speaker 1>without the 13 you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

262
00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

263
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 1>So about 80 percent of buildings taller </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 12 stories don't have a 13th floor.</v>

264
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this tricks a deck of phobia is </v>

265
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.140
<v Speaker 1>again in a free country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

266
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be afraid of the number </v>
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>

267
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 1>go right ahead.</v>

268
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.380
<v Speaker 1>It just seems to me you should not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tasked with designing elevators.</v>

269
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>If that's your fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find something else to do.</v>

270
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Holding aside the fact that I'm a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared that in this 21st century United </v>

271
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.640
<v Speaker 1>States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have people walking among us afraid </v>

272
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 1>of the number 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

273
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you keep to yourself,</v>

274
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.660
<v Speaker 1>don't harm others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think what ever you want so that the </v>

275
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 1>rubber hits the road is you now have </v>
<v Speaker 1>power over others.</v>

276
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the failure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational system actually manifests.</v>

277
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all societies and cultures </v>

278
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:17.640
<v Speaker 1>collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweat,</v>

279
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that they don't know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a 13th floor and that you're </v>

280
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.611
<v Speaker 1>just calling it the fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take my sharpie cross out the </v>

281
00:13:23.611 --> 00:13:23.611
<v Speaker 1>14th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 13th floor.</v>

282
00:13:23.611 --> 00:13:28.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not fooling anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you see it on an elevator and </v>

283
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.020
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see no,</v>

284
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.100
<v Speaker 1>13 and plus they try to fake you out.</v>

285
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>So they go one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

286
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

287
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

288
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:32.830
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

289
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:33.460
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

290
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

291
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to go to the next road</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin to for the 14th.</v>

292
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 1>So you'll see 12 and right next to 14 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some other,</v>

293
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 1>some modern buildings will put their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

294
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:50.850
<v Speaker 1>their heavy machinery like the h vac on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 13th floor so that there's no </v>

296
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:53.880
<v Speaker 1>residency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

297
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.750
<v Speaker 1>But they could still say it's the 13th </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor and then there's the 14 foot.</v>

298
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody ever have a dummy 13th </v>
<v Speaker 1>button where you press it?</v>

299
00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Speaker 1>It never lights up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't get it.</v>

300
00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I can't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

301
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

302
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you just put it there to satisfy me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still nobody lives there.</v>

303
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.680
<v Speaker 1>That's to Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the 20 percent of people </v>

304
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:12.680
<v Speaker 1>that make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what a great building.</v>

305
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile there is no 13th slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a dummy button.</v>

306
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Remember that twilight zone episode with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mannequins?</v>

307
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.070
<v Speaker 1>They went up to the 11th floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is no 11th floor.</v>

308
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.230
<v Speaker 1>And the mannequins come to life at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

309
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that.</v>

310
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.360
<v Speaker 1>They leave the store floors and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>all go up to 11 and have a cocktail </v>

311
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:30.730
<v Speaker 1>party and they vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one of them is going to go out and</v>

312
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 1>become human for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A twilight zone was so good.</v>

313
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 1>There was the best television there ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like still to this day ever because </v>

314
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 1>so many great premises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great premises,</v>

315
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>great actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Cinematography,</v>

316
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 1>and it was in black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so shadows were completely dark.</v>

317
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Shadows don't have much meaning when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're filming color because everything </v>

318
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>is just there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in black and white</v>

319
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 2>shadows create moods and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I watched to serve man.</v>

320
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 2>The other hadn't seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't.</v>

321
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I had it on the Dvr and played lurch on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Adams family.</v>

322
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a great one because it was just</v>

323
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:13.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had all the elements of people going,</v>

324
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:18.260
<v Speaker 2>they seem nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem nice and they solve all of our</v>

326
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 2>war and our God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was great.</v>

327
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was the,</v>

328
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.680
<v Speaker 1>the invaders do to remember this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew this was a.</v>

329
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.580
<v Speaker 1>This was a one woman performance and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot who it was.</v>

330
00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:35.960
<v Speaker 1>It was it not agnes morehead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these women of that era,</v>

331
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll come to me in a minute and she's </v>

332
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 1>living alone in a farm house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no electricity.</v>

333
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.610
<v Speaker 1>She's got a farm and she's alone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some alien spacecraft lands on her roof </v>

334
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:54.010
<v Speaker 1>and it's got these devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has got these saws and blazers cutting </v>

335
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.701
<v Speaker 1>through things and she's freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got the pan in the pots and the </v>

336
00:15:57.701 --> 00:15:59.460
<v Speaker 1>rolling pin and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she'd get the gun,</v>

337
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.180
<v Speaker 1>the shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's attacking this thing is,</v>

338
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:07.390
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's got lights and the thing and </v>

339
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 1>it's this tiny little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like three inches across.</v>

340
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that's the thing that's</v>

341
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:13.830
<v Speaker 1>attacking her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she finally comes.</v>

342
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:14.770
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the little,</v>

343
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>the little robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

344
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

345
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 1>and then I got to give you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

346
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Forty years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give the punchline.</v>

347
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she actually successfully damages the</v>

348
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 1>thing and then you zoom in on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

349
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:35.291
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear a radio transmission </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the aliens that are inside and it </v>

350
00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

351
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

352
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

353
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Houston</v>

354
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.610
<v Speaker 2>giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's trying to attack us?</v>

355
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.090
<v Speaker 2>We need help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Send backups.</v>

356
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was great.</v>

357
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

358
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.790
<v Speaker 2>We were the invaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was us landing on her home on some </v>

359
00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:57.580
<v Speaker 2>other planet or some parallel earth from</v>
<v Speaker 2>some other dementia.</v>

360
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just a art we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

361
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

362
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.340
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

363
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.940
<v Speaker 2>So she's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's another planet?</v>

364
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.970
<v Speaker 2>She's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the giant where they're saying </v>

365
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant attacking us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the whole show you or have her point</v>

366
00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:13.720
<v Speaker 2>of view the these aliens are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt her.</v>

367
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.200
<v Speaker 2>When they were just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was our space probe just trying to </v>

368
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.070
<v Speaker 2>explore it's environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it possible that it's like </v>

369
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:25.711
<v Speaker 2>another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's us in another dimension and they </v>

370
00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.070
<v Speaker 2>are landing on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excepted it.</v>

371
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:28.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

372
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were speaking English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parallel evolution.</v>

373
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the definition of infinity </v>
<v Speaker 2>that somewhere some.</v>

374
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.780
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there is really an infinity,</v>

375
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>there is not only a you and an I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a uni and everybody else </v>

376
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.051
<v Speaker 2>we've ever met in all the exact events </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the exact same order have gone down </v>

377
00:17:49.051 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This conversation</v>

378
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 1>except except there is how many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this,</v>

379
00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:00.140
<v Speaker 1>but often it's mind blowing when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn that some infinities are bigger </v>

380
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.971
<v Speaker 1>than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan just lean two feet away from </v>

381
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:10.920
<v Speaker 1>the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all affinities are the same size.</v>

382
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>It's infinity then it's infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

383
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't you remember when you were a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

384
00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:17.940
<v Speaker 1>what's the biggest number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

385
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:19.640
<v Speaker 1>a million or a million and one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

386
00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about a billion?</v>

387
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Speaker 1>A billion and one knew the annoying kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>was added.</v>

388
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:23.610
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>

389
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:24.690
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about infinity,</v>

390
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.440
<v Speaker 1>infinity and one day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

391
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 1>turn to offending anyone and affinity or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same number?</v>

392
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the.</v>

393
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of,</v>

394
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 1>of counting numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one,</v>

395
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.670
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

396
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.200
<v Speaker 1>up to infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

397
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers you would use to count </v>

398
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:45.290
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's infinite.</v>

399
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:50.180
<v Speaker 1>The number of irrational numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the numbers that you cannot represent</v>

400
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 1>as a fraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

401
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.840
<v Speaker 1>That there's more there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of those than there are counting </v>

402
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.540
<v Speaker 1>numbers by far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are orders of infinity.</v>

403
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Then there are more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are more transcendental numbers.</v>

404
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Then there are irrational numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a transcendental numbers?</v>

405
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's a number that you'll never </v>
<v Speaker 1>find as a solution to,</v>

406
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.420
<v Speaker 1>to an Algebraic equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Pi is a transcendental,</v>

407
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.250
<v Speaker 1>number B is a transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

408
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.280
<v Speaker 1>these are magic numbers that show up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics and there's turns out </v>

409
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.850
<v Speaker 1>there's like an even bigger infinity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those than there is of these other two </v>

410
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 1>classes of numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they use the,</v>

411
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

412
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hebrew letter,</v>

413
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:38.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

414
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

415
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ranking.</v>

416
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:42.430
<v Speaker 1>So as I left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one left,</v>

417
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 1>two left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three elephants.</v>

418
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I think there are five levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity.</v>

419
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.330
<v Speaker 1>So my point is I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's infinite universes to </v>

420
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.171
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean there's infinite </v>

421
00:19:54.171 --> 00:19:55.341
<v Speaker 1>conversations that have happened and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to really explore the depths of </v>

422
00:19:55.341 --> 00:19:59.301
<v Speaker 1>infinities before I say and agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that this conversation has happened </v>

423
00:19:59.301 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>a million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an infinite number of times in just this</v>

424
00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:07.581
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except you have a different engineers </v>

425
00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.211
<v Speaker 1>sitting next to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a or an infinite number of times where </v>

426
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:09.211
<v Speaker 1>it's been Jamie too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

427
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In principle.</v>

428
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the argument that's given,</v>

429
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.300
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there's some nested </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinities in there that deserve some </v>

430
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.081
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My explanation is not handling this </v>

431
00:20:21.081 --> 00:20:21.081
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

432
00:20:21.081 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I've said,</v>

433
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>as I say in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

434
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.420
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

435
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.460
<v Speaker 1>epigraph of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

436
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.690
<v Speaker 1>of the book booked is not available yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a copy,</v>

437
00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:33.150
<v Speaker 1>ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Astrophysicists for people in a hurry.</v>

438
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Astrophysics for people in a hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to say,</v>

439
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say astrophysics for people </v>

440
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:43.170
<v Speaker 1>in a hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

441
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 1>A quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to say,</v>

442
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're in a hurry.</v>

443
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the EPA,</v>

444
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.510
<v Speaker 1>the EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the EPA,</v>

445
00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:51.511
<v Speaker 1>Graham on that is the universe is under </v>
<v Speaker 1>no obligation to make sense to you that </v>

446
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 1>that's Rasha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did that before.</v>

447
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.580
<v Speaker 1>And so it makes sense to you that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is under no obligation to make </v>

448
00:20:59.580 --> 00:20:59.580
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

449
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's okay if your brain hurts when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>say there's a ranking of infinities,</v>

450
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.200
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't say that doesn't make </v>

451
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:07.200
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore it is not true.</v>

452
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I definitely wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what confuses me is the word </v>

453
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.550
<v Speaker 1>infinity because I had always taken the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word infinity to mean something that has</v>

454
00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:17.551
<v Speaker 1>no end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can something that has no end be </v>

455
00:21:17.551 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 1>larger than something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way they do that mathematically,</v>

456
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the way to demonstrate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically is used.</v>

457
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 1>You map one item in the set of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity to corresponding items in the </v>

458
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 1>set or the oven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other infinity.</v>

459
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>So you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take the one and you map it to </v>

460
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 1>like the first transcendental number six</v>
<v Speaker 1>a to two.</v>

461
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.330
<v Speaker 1>The second you just keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that mathematically what</v>

462
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you find that one infinity outstrips the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other infinity.</v>

463
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you left with more,</v>

464
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.260
<v Speaker 1>with more numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that shows you that you have a bigger</v>

465
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:50.230
<v Speaker 1>infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you find,</v>

466
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:55.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new NASA announcement that's </v>

467
00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:58.351
<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Monday that's supposed to be </v>

468
00:21:58.351 --> 00:21:58.750
<v Speaker 1>announced or types of plans tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exoplanet is a Wednesday,</v>

469
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.170
<v Speaker 1>a Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

470
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not authorized to have juicy </v>

471
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me invent some juicy details that it</v>

472
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:10.480
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So NASA.</v>

473
00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.480
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's been good at segwaying lately.</v>

474
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:14.660
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just jumping in,</v>

475
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 1>jumping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get that red.</v>

476
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

477
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:24.181
<v Speaker 1>I'm flying back to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for fitting this in show it </v>

478
00:22:24.181 --> 00:22:24.320
<v Speaker 1>opened this place up at three in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning for you,</v>

479
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.070
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

480
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>

481
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:26.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel the love.</v>

482
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.190
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

483
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.130
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

484
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.520
<v Speaker 1>here's some things that could be because</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA is saying that it's,</v>

485
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stunning new announcement.</v>

486
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could be more than the fact that we</v>

487
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 1>already know that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

488
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.320
<v Speaker 1>there are earth like planets orbiting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goldilocks zone of the nearest star </v>

489
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 1>to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proximate Century.</v>

490
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Can you do better that than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me?</v>

491
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:52.750
<v Speaker 1>NASA?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

492
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Unless you got some extra stuff you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to tell us.</v>

493
00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Like what's been a cottage industry in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of years is the </v>

494
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.301
<v Speaker 1>observation of planet atmospheres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the planet passes in front of the </v>

495
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:10.921
<v Speaker 1>host star life from the host star passes</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the atmosphere and it is all and</v>

496
00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:15.370
<v Speaker 1>the light signatures altered by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry of the atmosphere.</v>

497
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.730
<v Speaker 1>So depending what the chemicals are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll influence the spectrum that you </v>

498
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.370
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>

499
00:23:21.371 --> 00:23:26.371
<v Speaker 1>you can say what the chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>composition of the atmosphere of that </v>

500
00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:26.371
<v Speaker 1>star is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain,</v>

501
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain combinations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements that we would call biomarkers.</v>

502
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't look down to the surface of the</v>

503
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 1>planet and look at cities if there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>

504
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.670
<v Speaker 1>But there are consequences in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere to there being life on the </v>

505
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 1>surface such as is there oxygen there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think when I was watching star</v>

506
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:47.660
<v Speaker 1>trek when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I saw it in real time.</v>

507
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:49.210
<v Speaker 1>That's an old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a.</v>

508
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:54.310
<v Speaker 1>When it first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>original series star trek characters </v>

509
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.940
<v Speaker 1>never wore spacesuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

510
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.100
<v Speaker 1>You ever wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

511
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you ever thought about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

512
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.370
<v Speaker 1>What happens is they visit planets that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have nitrogen,</v>

513
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>oxygen atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim.</v>

514
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.580
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's what our atmosphere is.</v>

515
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they find planets with nitrogen,</v>

516
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 1>oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go down,</v>

517
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:12.401
<v Speaker 1>they don't need a space suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've actually thought about that and </v>

518
00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:15.371
<v Speaker 1>that's their solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that must mean there'd be planets </v>

519
00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:15.371
<v Speaker 1>that you could find that.</v>

520
00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

521
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 1>we have oxygen on earth only because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is life on earth.</v>

522
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Not any kind of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photosynthesizing life,</v>

523
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.190
<v Speaker 1>we have life that takes sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns it into chemical energy,</v>

524
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 1>into itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into wood,</v>

525
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 1>into plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of its byproducts is oxygen.</v>

526
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Oxygen is chemically active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you took away all plants tomorrow,</v>

527
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.340
<v Speaker 1>that oxygen would slowly get absorbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemically into the environment and then</v>

528
00:24:46.341 --> 00:24:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you would not have oxygen there to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewed by aliens.</v>

529
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:54.371
<v Speaker 1>Trying to see if we have life here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty surprising to people to </v>

530
00:24:54.371 --> 00:24:54.940
<v Speaker 1>note that we're mostly nitrogen in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

531
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're.</v>

532
00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.700
<v Speaker 1>We're 78 percent nitrogen in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere.</v>

533
00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Toy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what happens if you have too </v>

534
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.451
<v Speaker 1>much oxygen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have like let's say 50 percent </v>

535
00:25:04.451 --> 00:25:06.880
<v Speaker 1>oxygen and that part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knew.</v>

536
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 1>What happens is like a forest fire would</v>
<v Speaker 1>never go out.</v>

537
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because oxygen feeds combustion and so </v>

538
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.850
<v Speaker 1>you could basically burn all vegetation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world if the oxygen went above </v>

539
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.391
<v Speaker 1>certain thresholds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you needed high enough so that you </v>

540
00:25:22.391 --> 00:25:26.021
<v Speaker 1>can still have oxygen metabolism but not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so high that it's bad for lightening </v>

541
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.890
<v Speaker 1>triggered forest fires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point is so,</v>

542
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.190
<v Speaker 1>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if in this,</v>

543
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:35.290
<v Speaker 1>if I don't know the announcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just guessing here because it's </v>

544
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 1>been a cottage industry the last couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years,</v>

545
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:40.690
<v Speaker 1>let's find these biomarkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have unstable chemistry going on </v>

546
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.410
<v Speaker 1>in that atmosphere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you do,</v>

547
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.740
<v Speaker 1>it means something's generating it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain combinations of chemistry tells </v>

548
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.120
<v Speaker 1>you there's likely to be life of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind.</v>

549
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of decades ago,</v>

550
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:57.131
<v Speaker 1>we had speculation of other planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we really didn't have any tangible </v>

551
00:25:57.131 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 1>proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

552
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.020
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime I give a public talk,</v>

553
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are in your gigs,</v>

554
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 1>asked who he was born since 1995.</v>

555
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

556
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

557
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your audience leans young.</v>

558
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So there'll be some fraction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience will raise their hand.</v>

559
00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.240
<v Speaker 1>And so what I do is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I night them as generation exoplanet </v>

560
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.660
<v Speaker 1>because 1995 was the first year that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a planet outside of our own solar </v>

561
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.551
<v Speaker 1>system was discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have been alive only during a </v>

562
00:26:27.551 --> 00:26:28.400
<v Speaker 1>time where we've known each other star </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

563
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 1>So crazy generation x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I want to start that </v>

564
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:33.860
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

565
00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 1>That's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

566
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

567
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living out here.</v>

568
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It's 20 was 24 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was 22 years ago.</v>

569
00:26:39.771 --> 00:26:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

570
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>If you stop and think about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a short period of time that is,</v>

571
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 1>and in that period of time when there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rising through 3000 exoplanets,</v>

572
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 1>this was the advance of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not just science events,</v>

573
00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:56.490
<v Speaker 1>that's engineering and technology and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>telescope quality and imaging quality.</v>

574
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Speaker 1>And it is a lot that goes on to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance of science.</v>

575
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not just how clever you are in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Einsteinian way.</v>

576
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know good engineers to build a </v>

577
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 1>device to make the measurement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how we discovered gravity waves.</v>

578
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Now what's your take on that planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to be outside the Kuyper</v>

579
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 1>belt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's planet planet nine so far.</v>

580
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:21.470
<v Speaker 1>All the data look convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they've done is they've looked </v>

581
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 1>at other objects in the Kuiper belt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at.</v>

582
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Speaker 1>These are colleagues of mine at Caltech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

583
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

584
00:27:26.491 --> 00:27:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Mike Brown who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

585
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I get blamed for killing Pluto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was an accessory for sure,</v>

586
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely didn't kill blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dude killed Pluto,</v>

587
00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.420
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He found another object that was </v>

588
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.411
<v Speaker 1>basically the size of pluto out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So either you make that a planet where </v>

589
00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you demote Pluto.</v>

590
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And how much smaller is Pluto there </v>
<v Speaker 1>onsite?</v>

591
00:27:44.611 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Our Moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

592
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:47.250
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't get me started.</v>

593
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Our movement has five times the mass of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pluto.</v>

594
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the moon,</v>

595
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Pluto was lame from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

596
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 1>We thought it was big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wanted it to be big.</v>

597
00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:57.970
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

598
00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we made it,</v>

599
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:03.951
<v Speaker 1>one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the nine and its size didn't </v>

600
00:28:03.951 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 1>settle out until the late 19 seventies </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we had better and better,</v>

601
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:11.241
<v Speaker 1>more accurate ways to measure its size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when we learned it's small </v>

602
00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:11.310
<v Speaker 1>even compared to our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But granted,</v>

603
00:28:11.311 --> 00:28:16.311
<v Speaker 1>we have a big moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not going to think our </v>

604
00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:16.490
<v Speaker 1>moon is a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not going to think that</v>

605
00:28:16.491 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Pluto was a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

606
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.050
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just tell you how they did.</v>

607
00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:20.790
<v Speaker 1>So they found these other objects out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

608
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.570
<v Speaker 1>the same team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a constant team back together,</v>

609
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.460
<v Speaker 1>pronounce his last name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Jan and Mike Brown,</v>

610
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.360
<v Speaker 1>but both at Caltech and they found these</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects in the outer,</v>

611
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.930
<v Speaker 1>so the Kuyper belt of icy bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which Pluto is a member.</v>

612
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 1>You track their motion and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

613
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.570
<v Speaker 1>if I add up all the gravity that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting them and they should move this</v>

614
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

615
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 1>They move another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different way.</v>

616
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:51.230
<v Speaker 1>So either Newton's laws of gravity are </v>
<v Speaker 1>failing in the outer solar system or </v>

617
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.341
<v Speaker 1>this some object out there whose gravity</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have yet to reconcile with the </v>

618
00:28:55.341 --> 00:28:56.520
<v Speaker 1>motions of these objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they said,</v>

619
00:28:56.521 --> 00:29:01.521
<v Speaker 1>let's assume Newton is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What object we have to put out there at </v>

620
00:29:01.521 --> 00:29:06.081
<v Speaker 1>what distance and what size to influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement of these copper belt </v>

621
00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:08.160
<v Speaker 1>objects in the way we see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they do this to bodes law.</v>

622
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

623
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.870
<v Speaker 1>We're way pat went up later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for remembering boats law,</v>

624
00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:17.871
<v Speaker 1>but both law was a early a measure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you might find a new planet and it</v>

625
00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:19.760
<v Speaker 1>was based on mass and gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

626
00:29:19.761 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both law was a simple arithmetic tool.</v>

627
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:28.010
<v Speaker 1>All it did was basically double the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance with a certain additive </v>

628
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.290
<v Speaker 1>parameter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double the distance of the planet.</v>

629
00:29:29.291 --> 00:29:31.020
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

630
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

631
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.650
<v Speaker 1>and there was a little a factor in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helped the inner planets come out.</v>

632
00:29:36.651 --> 00:29:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's look at Maurice.</v>

633
00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Maurice was like two and a half times </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth's distance from the sun.</v>

634
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes after Mars?</v>

635
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jupiter is five times or assistance.</v>

636
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Saturn is 10 times two and two and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half to five to 10.</v>

637
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.460
<v Speaker 1>So bolds law is just a simple arithmetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme.</v>

638
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not based in any known physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was only based on the solar system.</v>

639
00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.410
<v Speaker 1>It's under social system itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

640
00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:04.411
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it worked and yet you have to fudge </v>

641
00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:05.250
<v Speaker 1>your way to get mercury to work in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't,</v>

642
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 1>didn't have pluto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pluto wasn't a planet in any way,</v>

643
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 1>but anyhow it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a flood Gigi way.</v>

644
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 1>That was mostly right by accident and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was in like,</v>

645
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 1>what year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

646
00:30:16.571 --> 00:30:18.270
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

647
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 1>1800 spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

648
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.500
<v Speaker 1>So now we have advanced computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>programming,</v>

649
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.680
<v Speaker 1>very high precision modeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're saying there's got to be a </v>

650
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680
<v Speaker 1>planet somewhere here in this arc of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky,</v>

651
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:34.710
<v Speaker 1>let's look for it because we think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's effected the orbits of </v>

652
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.171
<v Speaker 1>these other objects and that is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely noble way to discover a </v>

653
00:30:37.171 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how Neptune was discovered.</v>

654
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And because everyone looked at the orbit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Uranus and said,</v>

655
00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uranus is not following Newton's laws.</v>

656
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Newton's laws don't work that far </v>

657
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:50.640
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never been tested that far.</v>

658
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:50.640
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

659
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's assume it works and ask what would</v>

660
00:30:52.871 --> 00:30:57.871
<v Speaker 1>have to influence it and whether it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult mathematical calculation </v>

661
00:30:57.871 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 1>because you're not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the object.</v>

662
00:30:58.121 --> 00:30:59.590
<v Speaker 1>What's the gravity field?</v>

663
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.890
<v Speaker 1>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the gravity field I need.</v>

664
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Where must the object be and how massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>must've be.</v>

665
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a much harder mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem to solve.</v>

666
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And so once the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

667
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the errant orbit of Uranus was known and</v>

668
00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:23.131
<v Speaker 1>calculated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started looking for another planet </v>

669
00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's how they discovered planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neptune.</v>

670
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now when they're looking at this </v>

671
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.830
<v Speaker 1>planet nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope I said that right?</v>

672
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement of Uranus's orbit was not </v>

673
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.490
<v Speaker 1>following proper laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they infer the presence of Neptune.</v>

674
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:35.470
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look here tomorrow night.</v>

675
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And they look there and they found it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

676
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a brilliant display of.</v>

677
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going back to the 19th century.</v>

678
00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:46.120
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

679
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.870
<v Speaker 1>people were bad ass at every </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation's got their bad ass.</v>

680
00:31:49.871 --> 00:31:54.871
<v Speaker 1>Scientists know how much further out </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the known solar system is this </v>

681
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:59.220
<v Speaker 1>unknown planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not quick to call it planet nine </v>

682
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.570
<v Speaker 1>because so far it's 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>times farther away from the sun than the</v>

683
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:02.050
<v Speaker 1>earth is.</v>

684
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.000
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sorry you're not in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

685
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.060
<v Speaker 1>You're not in the hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

686
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling like Colin Connecticut,</v>

687
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:12.370
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling it.</v>

688
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's something massive,</v>

689
00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like six times the mass of the.</v>

690
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what mass they were assigning </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

691
00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:20.170
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would.</v>

692
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.020
<v Speaker 1>If that were in our solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we?</v>

693
00:32:22.021 --> 00:32:27.021
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would label it as a planet and it </v>

694
00:32:27.021 --> 00:32:29.221
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation that it was some sort of a </v>

695
00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:29.480
<v Speaker 1>burnt out star that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that mass.</v>

696
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

697
00:32:30.041 --> 00:32:30.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

698
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.430
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be thinking you if that's what</v>

699
00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:37.431
<v Speaker 1>I think you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got good memory too long ago in a </v>

700
00:32:37.431 --> 00:32:39.440
<v Speaker 1>galaxy far away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm talking about 19 seventies people</v>

701
00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 1>looked at the extinction record on earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every 20,000</v>

702
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:45.230
<v Speaker 1>years they found a little blip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little dip,</v>

703
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:50.590
<v Speaker 1>and the fossil record where we lost some</v>
<v Speaker 1>species and people were wondering why </v>

704
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:55.450
<v Speaker 1>could there have been some flux of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comets raining down periodically on the </v>

705
00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:01.750
<v Speaker 1>earth wreaking havoc on the ecosystem </v>
<v Speaker 1>rendering species extinct in these </v>

706
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.750
<v Speaker 1>periodic intervals.</v>

707
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:06.550
<v Speaker 1>So if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some double star to the </v>

708
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 1>sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some binary star system.</v>

709
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.840
<v Speaker 1>So they invoked it and then they called </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

710
00:33:11.841 --> 00:33:14.630
<v Speaker 1>They gave him a name or they called it </v>
<v Speaker 1>nemesis when God gave it a name.</v>

711
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And so you know what period?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orbital period.</v>

712
00:33:17.841 --> 00:33:22.841
<v Speaker 1>That object must have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to match the extinction </v>

713
00:33:22.841 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 1>periodicity and so it's got to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>

714
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:26.930
<v Speaker 1>year period and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people look for it,</v>

715
00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:31.931
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't find it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>reanalyze the extinction records and it </v>

716
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:34.550
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to fudge it to make it look like</v>

717
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 1>it was periodic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically we've abandoned the idea of</v>

718
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:41.170
<v Speaker 1>net of nemesis and aren't binary star </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems really common.</v>

719
00:33:41.171 --> 00:33:46.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than half the star as you've seen </v>

720
00:33:46.171 --> 00:33:46.171
<v Speaker 1>the night sky or binary or multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

721
00:33:46.171 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iconic image from Star Wars,</v>

722
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 1>the original star wars movie before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbered them,</v>

723
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would star wars for?</v>

724
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

725
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that that,</v>

726
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that desert planet that Luke was on and </v>

727
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.270
<v Speaker 1>he comes out after visiting his was </v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

728
00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.110
<v Speaker 1>The step parent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

729
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:05.970
<v Speaker 1>his adoptive parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember whoever,</v>

730
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:11.030
<v Speaker 1>wherever he was visiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes out and you see a double </v>

731
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.331
<v Speaker 1>sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically the only accurate </v>

732
00:34:13.331 --> 00:34:15.550
<v Speaker 1>science and the entire series star wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

733
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy taking a part of gravity </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity and how many people got mad at </v>

734
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I stopped coming.</v>

735
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:29.891
<v Speaker 1>Come movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to Piss people off when I </v>

736
00:34:29.891 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 1>watched your movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having those thoughts anyway,</v>

737
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.190
<v Speaker 1>so I might as well share them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people if you're interested.</v>

738
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.620
<v Speaker 1>So I did just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people.</v>

739
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:38.510
<v Speaker 1>The last time I did it was for Star </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wars,</v>

740
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.790
<v Speaker 1>the force awakens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars seven.</v>

741
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I had a series of tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.790
<v Speaker 1>one of them was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bba,</v>

743
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:50.850
<v Speaker 1>a smooth rolling metal spherical ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have skidded uncontrollably on </v>

744
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:51.920
<v Speaker 1>sand.</v>

745
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 1>People got angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone tweeted back,</v>

746
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.710
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

747
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.310
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

748
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

749
00:35:01.821 --> 00:35:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to get people angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just here to enlightened,</v>

750
00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:07.370
<v Speaker 1>to help people enhance their movie going</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

751
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 1>But to the extent that is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing this,</v>

752
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying I don't.</v>

753
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm an educator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was being nice.</v>

754
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't tweeted about a movie since</v>

755
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:19.860
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop.</v>

756
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:24.861
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I have tweets I can post about </v>

757
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:25.880
<v Speaker 1>arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please give us a little bit of a shutter</v>

758
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:26.690
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

759
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got to give it a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

760
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.930
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I see a movie that starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

761
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoiler alert,</v>

762
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.330
<v Speaker 1>starts out with a sick kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

763
00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:33.140
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

764
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

765
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.240
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

766
00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 1>it's very not about the kid.</v>

767
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's what I keep is totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>not about the kid.</v>

768
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Jamie hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

769
00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just give it a chance.</v>

770
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.890
<v Speaker 1>But anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just stopped.</v>

771
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>

772
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people need to know the gravity.</v>

773
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:55.260
<v Speaker 1>That was good that you explained that </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is it's not plausible,</v>

774
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 1>those two satellites on anywhere near </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

775
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh.</v>

776
00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:58.860
<v Speaker 1>We're said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

777
00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:03.861
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the international space station </v>

778
00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:04.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'm on the Chinese space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just jet pack my wave.</v>

779
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me lady.</v>

780
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Hey Lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how far away these are from </v>

781
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.391
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just jet around from one space </v>

782
00:36:17.391 --> 00:36:17.391
<v Speaker 1>station to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

783
00:36:17.391 --> 00:36:20.780
<v Speaker 1>can't do it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tens of thousands of miles from one </v>

784
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:20.780
<v Speaker 1>another for goodness sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

785
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

786
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember the tweet?</v>

787
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It was like 15 tweets and I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was when I realized like the press </v>

788
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.840
<v Speaker 1>was reading my movie tweets and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweets.</v>

789
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.040
<v Speaker 1>There's now a couple of years ago when </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity came out with Sandra bullock </v>

790
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:36.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

791
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.090
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

792
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 1>what's the dude's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Clooney.</v>

793
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:45.000
<v Speaker 1>So I tweeted it and they got talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about on the,</v>

794
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.940
<v Speaker 1>on the today show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set the set,</v>

795
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.980
<v Speaker 1>the weekend today show on NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it was talked about on NBC nightly </v>

796
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.301
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then my tweets were talking about on </v>

797
00:36:56.301 --> 00:36:56.301
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weekend update.</v>

798
00:36:56.301 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like the NBC Trifecta and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

799
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.620
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had not,</v>

800
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:05.340
<v Speaker 1>that was not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't seek this if fine,</v>

801
00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:10.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are reacting this way because that </v>

802
00:37:10.341 --> 00:37:10.341
<v Speaker 1>means they care about the science may </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

803
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.200
<v Speaker 1>But what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth Meyers there,</v>

804
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 1>because he was doing weekend update at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

805
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:18.981
<v Speaker 1>he said a astrophysicist Neil degrasse </v>
<v Speaker 1>station harshly criticized the movie </v>

806
00:37:18.981 --> 00:37:23.511
<v Speaker 1>gravity a saying has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contains a number of scientific and </v>

807
00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:23.511
<v Speaker 1>accuracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

808
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.540
<v Speaker 1>There is no way George Clooney would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have spent that much time talking to a </v>

809
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.980
<v Speaker 1>woman his own age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

810
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I think Sandra bullock's still younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than George Clooney though.</v>

811
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.590
<v Speaker 1>They should've got their facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not.</v>

812
00:37:36.591 --> 00:37:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not by much.</v>

813
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

814
00:37:37.891 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 1>there were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were in the same neighborhood.</v>

815
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important.</v>

816
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that you enjoy the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great,</v>

817
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:48.600
<v Speaker 1>it's fun and everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's important to point out what the</v>

818
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:50.610
<v Speaker 1>science areas are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>

819
00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the movie could have done </v>

820
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

821
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I thinks they could have made the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

822
00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.700
<v Speaker 1>People thought I didn't like the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>when all I was doing was pointing out </v>

823
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:01.700
<v Speaker 1>things they got wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

824
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.390
<v Speaker 1>They did some stunning things correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

825
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is brilliant.</v>

826
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 1>If you're in zero g a fire basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts itself out.</v>

827
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.470
<v Speaker 1>So think about when you burn a candle on</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

828
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you liked the wick at this.</v>

829
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.730
<v Speaker 1>People have candles anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They forgot what a candle.</v>

830
00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 1>You light it with a match that you used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get from smoking lounges at bars.</v>

831
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:29.650
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you light the candle and it stays </v>

832
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:30.060
<v Speaker 1>lit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuel is the wax.</v>

833
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.540
<v Speaker 1>The oxygen continually comes in because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it heats the air around it and the air </v>

834
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:40.771
<v Speaker 1>rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot air rises and fresh air comes in </v>

835
00:38:40.771 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 1>from below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has fresh oxygen,</v>

836
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:44.470
<v Speaker 1>so the candles stayed lit until it burns</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way down in space.</v>

837
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.930
<v Speaker 1>If you light a candle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can light the candle.</v>

838
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:52.170
<v Speaker 1>It'll heat the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the air will not know where to go </v>

839
00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 1>because it's not lighter than everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's in zero g,</v>

840
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 1>it'll stake clustered around the candle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The candle will use up all the oxygen in</v>

841
00:38:57.731 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 1>that bubble and then it'll put itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

842
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.750
<v Speaker 1>They did this in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why do they have some good science?</v>

843
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Because they make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't think of everything so they </v>

844
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:09.780
<v Speaker 1>just have you on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staff will know they can.</v>

845
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't think of anything if I.</v>

846
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:16.380
<v Speaker 1>So you can't think of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't judgemental so much as this </v>

847
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.281
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it got so much right is </v>

848
00:39:20.281 --> 00:39:22.600
<v Speaker 1>what put it on my map to criticize what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it got wrong.</v>

849
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.380
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make they make you older hair?</v>

850
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Her bangs should've been floating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floating all over.</v>

851
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I the nitpicky?</v>

852
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:39.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we will get any picture of </v>

853
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:39.330
<v Speaker 1>somebody with hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

854
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.260
<v Speaker 1>In space in zero g there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is flying everywhere.</v>

855
00:39:41.261 --> 00:39:42.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the first thing you notice about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

856
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 1>It is so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

857
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:45.390
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the coolest.</v>

858
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.550
<v Speaker 1>You're not thinking about the spaceship </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the tie technology.</v>

859
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.700
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at the hair doing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will never see happen on earth </v>

860
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 1>unless someone is like underwater and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're jiggling their head.</v>

861
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.280
<v Speaker 1>So they would have to film it all in </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero gravity.</v>

862
00:39:57.281 --> 00:39:59.200
<v Speaker 1>They would have to film it on when those</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop things.</v>

863
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:04.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or to drop thing and they'd have to be </v>

864
00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:04.201
<v Speaker 1>clever about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she only had bangs.</v>

865
00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:05.920
<v Speaker 1>That's all you had to figure out how to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did other clever things.</v>

866
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I did play by the way.</v>

867
00:40:08.411 --> 00:40:11.020
<v Speaker 1>In all fairness to movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll call out something that's good.</v>

868
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.630
<v Speaker 1>The science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie got right.</v>

869
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.250
<v Speaker 1>That otherwise got no science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

870
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll be the first in line to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

871
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie monsters inc.</v>

872
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YOu didn't think I was going there.</v>

873
00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

874
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.600
<v Speaker 1>those doors were four dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>portals to,</v>

875
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.230
<v Speaker 1>to another.</v>

876
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.990
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

877
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 1>if you had four dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it would look like.</v>

878
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the movie opened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take the doors home?</v>

879
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They opened the door and they're in the </v>

880
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 1>closet of the kid that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorize.</v>

881
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a wormhole.</v>

882
00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:50.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What access to the fourth dimension </v>

883
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.711
<v Speaker 1>looks like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do You think scientifically that's </v>

884
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:52.711
<v Speaker 1>possible one day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

885
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I hope so because here's the example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a nice broad desk.</v>

886
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.940
<v Speaker 1>We hear it that at this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

887
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 1>So desk is two dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got length and width and I can </v>

888
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.961
<v Speaker 1>start putting papers on this desk and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can lay them out mosaic style and then </v>

889
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I have no more room to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put a sheet of paper.</v>

890
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.540
<v Speaker 1>If I'm an aunt living in the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the desk,</v>

891
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more room,</v>

892
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:21.090
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are three dimensional people and I </v>

893
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.821
<v Speaker 1>can put an organizer and stack things </v>
<v Speaker 1>vertically so I can take a sheet of </v>

894
00:41:24.611 --> 00:41:28.660
<v Speaker 1>paper and now I can put it higher up </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the surface of the desk.</v>

895
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 1>The aunt will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Did it go?</v>

896
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It disappeared in some portal.</v>

897
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 1>We're no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

898
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:35.240
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

899
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:40.300
<v Speaker 1>It went into the third dimension and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ant bound and obviously as a three </v>

900
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.430
<v Speaker 1>dimensional thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine it only lives in two dimensions.</v>

901
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:48.850
<v Speaker 1>You would have made that paper disappear</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a third dimension and it will have </v>

902
00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:52.931
<v Speaker 1>no clue where it went because you had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>portal you had access to that extra </v>

903
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:58.031
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at how much you can store on a </v>

904
00:41:58.031 --> 00:42:00.350
<v Speaker 1>desk when you have access to a third </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension above it,</v>

905
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 1>vastly more than just papers mosaic out </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the surface.</v>

906
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 1>So now let's up this example by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

907
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 1>You're storing boxes in a room or I ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of room.</v>

908
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.350
<v Speaker 1>No you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's open this four dimensional door.</v>

909
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.260
<v Speaker 1>You open it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the boxes through the door,</v>

910
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:22.690
<v Speaker 1>close the door box has gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be awesome for hoarders.</v>

911
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

912
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:28.181
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look around the other side of the </v>

913
00:42:28.181 --> 00:42:28.181
<v Speaker 1>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door,</v>

914
00:42:28.181 --> 00:42:28.181
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

915
00:42:28.181 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoUr side of the door,</v>

916
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:33.311
<v Speaker 1>nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a door that is a portal to a </v>

917
00:42:33.311 --> 00:42:36.071
<v Speaker 1>fourth dimension that can hold vastly </v>
<v Speaker 1>more content than what is what you're </v>

918
00:42:36.441 --> 00:42:39.350
<v Speaker 1>stuck storing in the three dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>space of your room.</v>

919
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Now that's so the tense of brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept and even though it has monsters </v>

920
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.191
<v Speaker 1>that don't exist that all speak english </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is one of them is a cycle ops and </v>

921
00:42:48.191 --> 00:42:48.191
<v Speaker 1>one of them is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:42:48.191 --> 00:42:50.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not judging the biophysiology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these creatures,</v>

923
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.720
<v Speaker 1>but they got the physics of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of four dimensional portals completely </v>

924
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.921
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the concept of dimensions is where </v>

925
00:42:59.921 --> 00:43:02.951
<v Speaker 1>it gets really abstract with pete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love me some dimensions and it is </v>

926
00:43:02.951 --> 00:43:02.951
<v Speaker 1>abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

927
00:43:02.951 --> 00:43:07.670
<v Speaker 1>and that's why you take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the math take you into those higher </v>

928
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.670
<v Speaker 1>dimensions because our intuition will </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

929
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:10.790
<v Speaker 1>will fail for us.</v>

930
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 1>RighT?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's where it gets weird.</v>

931
00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.750
<v Speaker 1>When you say take the math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them take you.</v>

932
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So like when quantum physicists use </v>
<v Speaker 1>these legal notepads,</v>

933
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.650
<v Speaker 1>those yellow pads and write all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy stuff down that nobody but you and</v>

934
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:24.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe them understand and when you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all those equations,</v>

935
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's them,</v>

936
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you probably understand it,</v>

937
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:31.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I definitely don't.</v>

938
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:36.700
<v Speaker 1>My point is What are they exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out that allows them to say </v>

939
00:43:36.951 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they say,</v>

940
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.300
<v Speaker 1>well at one point in time was 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they've expanded that,</v>

941
00:43:41.301 --> 00:43:42.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they say,</v>

942
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the latest dimension count </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the universe,</v>

943
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:51.010
<v Speaker 1>but what the way it works is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to make sense of the </v>

944
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:51.170
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

945
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 1>And so you take some leaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some,</v>

946
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.740
<v Speaker 1>some philosophical leafs leaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some mathematical leaps.</v>

947
00:43:57.741 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

948
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:04.690
<v Speaker 1>may be all particles that manifests as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an electronic proton,</v>

949
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:07.190
<v Speaker 1>a neutral may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the quarks,</v>

950
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:12.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe they are just strings of energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibrating at different frequencies and </v>

951
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Speaker 1>we sense these different frequencies as </v>
<v Speaker 1>different particles.</v>

952
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Let's just go there for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

953
00:44:19.641 --> 00:44:21.920
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the consequences to it?</v>

954
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many dimensions do these </v>

955
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.100
<v Speaker 1>vibrating strings require to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties that we see in our </v>

956
00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>dimensionality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

957
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.160
<v Speaker 1>so the exercise of explaining what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see takes you to places that you've </v>

958
00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.910
<v Speaker 1>never been before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's fine.</v>

959
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Places at intellectual places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

960
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:44.100
<v Speaker 1>that had been previously unplumbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

961
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:49.790
<v Speaker 1>We've done that before we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we know what is happening in </v>

962
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:50.460
<v Speaker 1>the center of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have we ever been there?</v>

963
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.080
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

964
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 1>but we know how matter behaves under </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure and temperature.</v>

965
00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 1>We can do that in a laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a son sitting out there with a</v>

966
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:01.440
<v Speaker 1>surface temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mass,</v>

967
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 1>a certain luminosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'd say,</v>

968
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:08.781
<v Speaker 1>what must be going on down in the core?</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's bring our best physics or quantum </v>

969
00:45:08.781 --> 00:45:09.560
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

970
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.390
<v Speaker 1>our chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our nuclear physics,</v>

971
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:17.450
<v Speaker 1>bring it all together and we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete understanding of what's going </v>

972
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.450
<v Speaker 1>on in the center of the sun.</v>

973
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 1>And we're on to other problems now even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though we've never visited there.</v>

974
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So when they're going over this math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mathematics and observable things </v>

975
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.080
<v Speaker 1>that we have right now or at like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atomic and subatomic level.</v>

976
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

977
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you realize the electron?</v>

978
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just uh,</v>

979
00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I met,</v>

980
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I did a whole series of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something calleD the great </v>

981
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.771
<v Speaker 1>courses lecture series was a sponsor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast for awhile with a really </v>

982
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.240
<v Speaker 1>great courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

983
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:50.390
<v Speaker 1>So I was once invited to be one of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>professors for the great courses and I </v>

984
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:54.510
<v Speaker 1>taught a very short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are like 30 lectures.</v>

985
00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:59.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like a whole college semester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have the time and the energy.</v>

986
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:04.670
<v Speaker 1>So they let me do like short bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of them is only six parts and </v>

987
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.781
<v Speaker 1>it's called the inexplicably universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's six parts of everything about </v>

988
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 1>which we know nothing in this university</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

989
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 1>well that's a pretty easy course to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark matter having a clue.</v>

990
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.070
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onto the next lecture might be something</v>

991
00:46:20.071 --> 00:46:22.800
<v Speaker 1>dark matter could be some we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay tuned.</v>

992
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:28.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting to learn how we </v>

993
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 1>come to know what we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

994
00:46:28.921 --> 00:46:32.650
<v Speaker 1>it's an exploration of our ignorance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very proud of it because it's,</v>

995
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not what you'd normally find in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture series and it's still,</v>

996
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:41.001
<v Speaker 1>it's still out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I will tell you </v>

997
00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:41.001
<v Speaker 1>that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you now,</v>

998
00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:44.840
<v Speaker 1>the electron has no known dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is smaller than the smallest we have </v>

999
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:51.480
<v Speaker 1>ever had the capacity to measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as far as we concerned,</v>

1000
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.820
<v Speaker 1>it is infinitely small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1001
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:57.240
<v Speaker 1>We have no way to even know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>

1002
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you measure something small?</v>

1003
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:04.131
<v Speaker 1>You geT something smaller and find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of those it is no.</v>

1004
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.840
<v Speaker 1>about no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about the challenges at each </v>

1005
00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:14.840
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

1006
00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Asked me how big is the universe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say it's as big as well,</v>

1007
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to say?</v>

1008
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing as big as the universe.</v>

1009
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So at the biggest and in at the littlest</v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

1010
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.700
<v Speaker 1>there's not something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work as well.</v>

1011
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To try to say what it is relative to </v>

1012
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.001
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you entertain the possibility that </v>

1013
00:47:39.001 --> 00:47:39.001
<v Speaker 1>the biggest and the littlest end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

1014
00:47:39.001 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 1>meaning that at are the smallest </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurable point that literally might be</v>

1015
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:45.140
<v Speaker 1>a whole nother universe that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fracked.</v>

1016
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.120
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to think about it all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1017
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to think about again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phonetically down like down or whatever,</v>

1018
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:53.440
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1019
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:58.590
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 twenties when we discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>the atom and it's structure and that </v>

1020
00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.450
<v Speaker 1>there's an electron in orbit around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nucleus.</v>

1021
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.040
<v Speaker 1>It was at way we'd been there before.</v>

1022
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.980
<v Speaker 1>We got planets orbiting the sun and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1023
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.890
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it's a mini solar system.</v>

1024
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's solar systems all the way down.</v>

1025
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you brought this up.</v>

1026
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we brought this up because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to bring this question.</v>

1027
00:48:15.671 --> 00:48:20.671
<v Speaker 1>I almost forgot there's a photograph of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a brain cell and side by side with a </v>

1028
00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:24.360
<v Speaker 1>photograph of the known universe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they look eerily similar to.</v>

1029
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about the large scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the universe?</v>

1030
00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Scale of galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll get to that in a minute.</v>

1031
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Hold that up jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>OkaY,</v>

1032
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:34.810
<v Speaker 1>so I'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so do you ever tell him just pull up his</v>

1033
00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:37.250
<v Speaker 1>own damn images?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1034
00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.370
<v Speaker 1>but I can't put it on the tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said he has To do it.</v>

1035
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.900
<v Speaker 1>So you a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's why.</v>

1036
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.230
<v Speaker 1>That's not likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1037
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.040
<v Speaker 1>It was an entertained idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's why it's not likely.</v>

1038
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:57.150
<v Speaker 1>The manifestation of the laws of physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>are different at the atomic scale than </v>

1039
00:48:59.261 --> 00:49:02.290
<v Speaker 1>they are at the macroscopic scale to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just simply different.</v>

1040
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.880
<v Speaker 1>A planet can take any orbit sensible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>its velocity around a host star.</v>

1041
00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:14.770
<v Speaker 1>An electron cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's energy levels are predetermined and</v>

1042
00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:19.771
<v Speaker 1>quantized hence the word quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prefix quanta in quantum physics.</v>

1043
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So if it was a continuum of matter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy following the same laws of </v>

1044
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:33.120
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would say then it's sole systems </v>

1045
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.601
<v Speaker 1>all the way down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rules completely change and so </v>

1046
00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:42.421
<v Speaker 1>things can on the surface seems similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes time to understand </v>

1047
00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:47.491
<v Speaker 1>them and to analyze them and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate them and to exploit their </v>

1048
00:49:47.491 --> 00:49:51.631
<v Speaker 1>conduct and their behavior for other </v>
<v Speaker 1>means as we have done with atoms or </v>

1049
00:49:51.631 --> 00:49:55.081
<v Speaker 1>molecules for the entire it revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you no longer are they the same and you </v>

1050
00:49:56.741 --> 00:49:59.260
<v Speaker 1>abandoned this romanticized concept.</v>

1051
00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So now with the neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the network of neurons and the cost are </v>

1052
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.450
<v Speaker 1>the clusters of galaxies and galaxy </v>
<v Speaker 1>superclusters.</v>

1053
00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.960
<v Speaker 1>That would be on the right neurons on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>

1054
00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:12.520
<v Speaker 1>That's so eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1055
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1056
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:19.590
<v Speaker 1>they can look the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are operating under completely </v>

1057
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:22.030
<v Speaker 1>different laws of physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

1058
00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:27.031
<v Speaker 1>the laws of physics that dictate what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in brain cells have no </v>

1059
00:50:27.031 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what's going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

1060
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Brain cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're undergoing a.</v>

1061
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:31.670
<v Speaker 1>We can tell you what forces are </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating.</v>

1062
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:32.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1063
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 1>it's electromagnetic forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brain cells use electrical impulses,</v>

1064
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:39.620
<v Speaker 1>chemical impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why drugs can affect the brain.</v>

1065
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:41.170
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are chemical,</v>

1066
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.820
<v Speaker 1>the chemistry going on in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its natural state.</v>

1067
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.470
<v Speaker 1>You disrupt that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance it.</v>

1068
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just put down some,</v>

1069
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:52.300
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some chemistry and your stomach that's </v>

1070
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:52.300
<v Speaker 1>now affecting your brain.</v>

1071
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you just drink there?</v>

1072
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.070
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain algebra.</v>

1073
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're entering the chemistry.</v>

1074
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:03.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on on the large scale </v>

1075
00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:03.040
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is not chemistry.</v>

1076
00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.100
<v Speaker 1>There's some chemistry deep within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1077
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.250
<v Speaker 1>the chemistry is not what's making that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>

1078
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And because of that it becomes an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic curiosity,</v>

1079
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:15.890
<v Speaker 1>not something that has any kind of deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific insight.</v>

1080
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's disappointing similarity.</v>

1081
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating.</v>

1082
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Similarly put them up together and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun to think about it,</v>

1083
00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:25.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to think about it artistically,</v>

1084
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.410
<v Speaker 1>but not scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1085
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 1>it's great if you're hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends going,</v>

1086
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:31.010
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1087
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.630
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

1088
00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1089
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're looking at subatomic </v>

1090
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:38.430
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1091
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:42.521
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking at these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they observed a particles in </v>

1092
00:51:42.521 --> 00:51:45.821
<v Speaker 1>superposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether moving and stationary at the </v>

1093
00:51:45.821 --> 00:51:46.010
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they blink in and out of existence,</v>

1094
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 1>like when you get down to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I repeat the,</v>

1095
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1096
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:56.561
<v Speaker 1>the opening page of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is under no obligation to </v>

1097
00:51:56.561 --> 00:51:56.561
<v Speaker 1>make sense to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1098
00:51:56.561 --> 00:51:56.561
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1099
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Definitely does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:04.700
<v Speaker 1>So at that scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that go on with atoms and </v>

1101
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.510
<v Speaker 1>molecules fall outside of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1102
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.840
<v Speaker 1>You don't hang out at the bar with </v>
<v Speaker 1>protons,</v>

1103
00:52:08.841 --> 00:52:13.841
<v Speaker 1>new claw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons or other nuclear plans </v>

1104
00:52:13.841 --> 00:52:13.841
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or molecules.</v>

1105
00:52:13.841 --> 00:52:18.161
<v Speaker 1>You just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they do in their day is </v>

1106
00:52:18.161 --> 00:52:21.551
<v Speaker 1>completely foreign to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you shrink down to that size and </v>

1107
00:52:21.551 --> 00:52:22.460
<v Speaker 1>particles a popping in and out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

1108
00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.450
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1109
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.410
<v Speaker 1>theY become conjoined quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanically conjoined.</v>

1110
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's completely weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you would say,</v>

1111
00:52:29.991 --> 00:52:34.991
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this makes sense and this is </v>

1112
00:52:34.991 --> 00:52:35.420
<v Speaker 1>observable in a visual sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1113
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>

1114
00:52:36.191 --> 00:52:41.191
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how big the phenomena is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you can see other things that </v>

1115
00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:44.111
<v Speaker 1>would happen that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are the manifestations of that </v>

1116
00:52:44.111 --> 00:52:44.111
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1117
00:52:44.111 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 1>so an electron is smaller even than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1118
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By how many factors?</v>

1119
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1120
00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:49.700
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

1121
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.920
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know was no electric.</v>

1122
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Never measured the size of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic.</v>

1123
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:58.690
<v Speaker 1>The concept of super string theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a supo these smaller than that,</v>

1124
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:03.270
<v Speaker 1>the strings would have to be smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinner.</v>

1125
00:53:03.271 --> 00:53:08.271
<v Speaker 1>It's smaller than the electronic self by</v>
<v Speaker 1>many that I couldn't quantify for you.</v>

1126
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I got to bring in a string theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1127
00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:14.870
<v Speaker 1>So iT's like at the bottom of what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can observe.</v>

1128
00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question.</v>

1129
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:18.710
<v Speaker 1>what is the bottom and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the word adam,</v>

1130
00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.430
<v Speaker 1>which was introduced by the greeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knoW,</v>

1131
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>what adam means in greek?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a translation,</v>

1132
00:53:23.031 --> 00:53:23.810
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1133
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Indivisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1134
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:30.770
<v Speaker 1>so they imagined that all matter was </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd come down to some thing that was </v>

1135
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:33.550
<v Speaker 1>invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that out.</v>

1136
00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.110
<v Speaker 1>They figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They supposed it and they were the first</v>

1137
00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:37.600
<v Speaker 1>day were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1138
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.900
<v Speaker 1>they're wealthy and had free time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1139
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:45.430
<v Speaker 1>when they weren't waging war or that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could think and what we think of his </v>

1140
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:50.481
<v Speaker 1>philosophy was traceable to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing back then and the </v>

1141
00:53:50.481 --> 00:53:55.101
<v Speaker 1>origins of what science is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are traceable to back to back then that </v>

1142
00:53:55.101 --> 00:53:59.451
<v Speaker 1>you have an idea that applies to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe does that enables you to </v>

1143
00:53:59.451 --> 00:54:00.000
<v Speaker 1>predict future behavior.</v>

1144
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Speaker 1>That is science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1145
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:07.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the atom it turned out is divisible </v>

1146
00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 1>is divisible into sub atomic sub atom </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles.</v>

1147
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So you get electrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protons,</v>

1148
00:54:11.731 --> 00:54:14.070
<v Speaker 1>neutrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a whole host of other particles less</v>

1149
00:54:14.071 --> 00:54:17.910
<v Speaker 1>familiar there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrinos and other things that it turns</v>

1150
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:22.911
<v Speaker 1>out protons and neutrons are further </v>
<v Speaker 1>divisible that you get corks out of </v>

1151
00:54:22.911 --> 00:54:23.970
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as we know,</v>

1152
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.260
<v Speaker 1>there are only four fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles in the universe.</v>

1153
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 1>The photon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is light,</v>

1154
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:34.450
<v Speaker 1>the electron of which there are several </v>
<v Speaker 1>species that the anti electronic,</v>

1155
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:38.040
<v Speaker 1>but just these are state simple here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The photon,</v>

1156
00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.400
<v Speaker 1>the electron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cork,</v>

1157
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:45.950
<v Speaker 1>and the neutrino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything in the universe that we've </v>

1158
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:49.731
<v Speaker 1>ever observed is made out of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are the atoms of the universe,</v>

1159
00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 1>the indivisible parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

1160
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't by the way dark matter could </v>

1161
00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 1>be made of yet another kind of saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't know yet the blood.</v>

1162
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.450
<v Speaker 1>We got top people trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what dark matter is.</v>

1163
00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:05.160
<v Speaker 1>We've measured it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't know what it is.</v>

1164
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something like 90 something percent</v>

1165
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:09.630
<v Speaker 1>of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark matter and dark energy.</v>

1166
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:15.020
<v Speaker 1>It's 95 percent of all that drives the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and we can measure the </v>

1167
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.340
<v Speaker 1>existence of both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet we have no idea what's driving them.</v>

1168
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 1>This is an awesome opportunity for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eliminate this.</v>

1169
00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Often it's all in astrophysics for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in heart.</v>

1170
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:27.090
<v Speaker 1>It's all it comes out in may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can preorder it,</v>

1171
00:55:27.091 --> 00:55:32.091
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishers love it if you preorder it </v>

1172
00:55:32.091 --> 00:55:32.500
<v Speaker 1>and adorable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's beautiful.</v>

1173
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a good size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's adorable.</v>

1174
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Preorder it on amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the reason why they publishers </v>

1175
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.940
<v Speaker 1>like you to preorder it is so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take of me.</v>

1176
00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want to.</v>

1177
00:55:40.801 --> 00:55:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Didn't want to overprint they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to under print that,</v>

1178
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 1>so they get a sense of the preordering </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not charged until they </v>

1179
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.260
<v Speaker 1>ship it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a pretty harmless exercise.</v>

1180
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:53.100
<v Speaker 1>While we're on this subject of subatomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles and weirdness,</v>

1181
00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

1182
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:59.421
<v Speaker 1>if you could eliminate this often </v>
<v Speaker 1>misused explanation for the observer </v>

1183
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:05.091
<v Speaker 1>effect because you know the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles waves and you watch them and </v>

1184
00:56:05.091 --> 00:56:07.410
<v Speaker 1>observed them and it changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reaction is heavily misunderstood.</v>

1185
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It's misunderstood because people want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to attribute it to magic.</v>

1186
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:16.011
<v Speaker 1>The magic and the consciousness looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it but isn't in fact just measuring </v>

1187
00:56:16.011 --> 00:56:16.290
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1188
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please explain next question because I'm</v>

1189
00:56:20.371 --> 00:56:22.040
<v Speaker 1>so tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show show you.</v>

1190
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just drives me nuts.</v>

1191
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Your people with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try when I'm.</v>

1192
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Where are you pulling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1193
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1194
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Where are you getting your people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1195
00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I Don't own them for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not my people.</v>

1196
00:56:37.601 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 1>They vary greatly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy been looped in together.</v>

1197
00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I know you haven't admirably diverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>following and then not many people can </v>

1198
00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 1>claim that and it's probably because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your diverse profile.</v>

1199
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1200
00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:53.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm as open minded as I can be smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd read and you're thoughtful and </v>

1201
00:56:53.491 --> 00:56:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you're also on some level of respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>people here at somebody out and you're,</v>

1202

00:56:58.221 --> 00:57:00.420
<v Speaker 1>you got your mma thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no,</v>

1204
00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you're in a lot of places and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces and that's a good thing.</v>

1205
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean we need more unity in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1206
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:07.020
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1208
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Please explain what flipped people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting wrong.</v>

1209
00:57:11.151 --> 00:57:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very simple.</v>

1210
00:57:12.181 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It's much simpler than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1211
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ready?</v>

1212
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking at you.</v>

1213
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the only reason why I can see you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's light reflecting off of </v>

1214
00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 1>your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body into my eyes.</v>

1215
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.390
<v Speaker 1>So there's light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1216
00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:29.150
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stars.</v>

1217
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:29.620
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:31.160
<v Speaker 1>those are hubble photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

1219
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are images from the hubble and I </v>

1220
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 1>walked in the sheets that you put over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the a fluorescent light cover.</v>

1221
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And so when we look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually see the real,</v>

1222
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 1>real images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pretending it's the night sky.</v>

1223
00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it be recording studio.</v>

1224
00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:52.180
<v Speaker 1>What I want to do in the future studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to actually build a glass ceiling</v>

1225
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:56.910
<v Speaker 1>and have a full scale image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high resolution image of stars.</v>

1226
00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 1>So a planetarium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're describing a planetary.</v>

1227
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call it that.</v>

1228
00:58:00.731 --> 00:58:01.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a planetarium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1229
00:58:01.751 --> 00:58:03.970
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just wanted an image.</v>

1230
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:07.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me how to do It.</v>

1231
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1232
00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:08.890
<v Speaker 1>do better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a,</v>

1233
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you get occurred version of those very </v>
<v Speaker 1>high resolution led.</v>

1234
00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Curved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1235
00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you put any image up there you want</v>

1236
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.710
<v Speaker 1>and then the night sky tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what the sky looks like from,</v>

1237
00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:22.600
<v Speaker 1>from alpha insuree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1238
00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:27.620
<v Speaker 1>So lIke when you go to see one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>star shows at a planetarium and they </v>

1239
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:27.780
<v Speaker 1>show it on the ceiling above you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1240
00:58:27.781 --> 00:58:32.781
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nowadays that the ceiling itself is </v>

1241
00:58:32.781 --> 00:58:32.781
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the source of light.</v>

1242
00:58:32.781 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not projected from something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you just feed that with image </v>

1243
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 1>data and then it becomes whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

1244
00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Can you hook me up with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows how to do that?</v>

1245
00:58:40.221 --> 00:58:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can totally.</v>

1246
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know people.</v>

1247
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.630
<v Speaker 1>I got people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people that my people,</v>

1248
00:58:45.631 --> 00:58:47.330
<v Speaker 1>terry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my people because you're mobile,</v>

1249
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:47.830
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1250
00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Are you happy that you know the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach the people.</v>

1251
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.000
<v Speaker 1>so I guess so here what I'm looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1252
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1253
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see you.</v>

1254
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I turn on the lights and I say,</v>

1255
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:03.760
<v Speaker 1>there you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1256
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Now let's make you tinier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make you mini me.</v>

1257
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in the movie,</v>

1258
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a tiny version of you.</v>

1259
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.550
<v Speaker 1>A mini me version of joe rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now your little.</v>

1260
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I turn on the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still there.</v>

1261
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1262
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Because if the lights are not on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see you.</v>

1263
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1264
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.740
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1265
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start becoming the size of </v>

1266
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:35.180
<v Speaker 1>molecules right on down to the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an atom.</v>

1267
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And I asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is joe rogan the adam and I turn </v>

1268
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 1>on the light to see you there because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're there.</v>

1269
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:49.160
<v Speaker 1>The light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photon comes in,</v>

1270
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:53.420
<v Speaker 1>hits your adam and pops you into another</v>
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>

1271
00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very act of trying to measure your </v>

1272
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.401
<v Speaker 1>position prevents me from measuring your</v>
<v Speaker 1>position and as have jack shit to do </v>

1273
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:08.630
<v Speaker 1>with your consciousness or your mind or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes or anything.</v>

1274
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with the fact that to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there,</v>

1275
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>some information has to come from you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1276
01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>like shining a light on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the smaller you are,</v>

1277
01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>the more susceptible you are to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1278
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.520
<v Speaker 1>the energy of the light changing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position in space.</v>

1279
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>So my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you notice like you ever.</v>

1280
01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>This is still happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a quarter spills out of your </v>

1281
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>pants pocket on the back seat of a car </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's there in the wedge between the </v>

1282
01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>bottom and the back seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you try to reach in to get it.</v>

1283
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>And the act of reaching for the coin </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the coin move farther away from </v>

1284
01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:48.710
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1285
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>the act of reaching for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1286
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Because we separated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you separated and it just slides down </v>

1287
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>even further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not your mind making that happen.</v>

1288
01:00:55.941 --> 01:01:00.941
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the act of the measurement that is </v>

1289
01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:01.490
<v Speaker 1>affecting what it is you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>

1290
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>And this was discovered in quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics until the point where that's </v>

1291
01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:09.731
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the heisenberg uncertainty </v>

1292
01:01:09.731 --> 01:01:11.171
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the basic foundations of </v>

1293
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when it's round,</v>

1294
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it's profound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it's described in the eu will </v>

1295
01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.671
<v Speaker 1>weigh you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They show these particles going through </v>

1296
01:01:18.671 --> 01:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>these slots and then observing them </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes the pattern that they go through</v>

1297
01:01:21.921 --> 01:01:22.970
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a.</v>

1298
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:27.971
<v Speaker 1>There's a horrible cartoon that you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that a movie.</v>

1299
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>What the bleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get through that movie.</v>

1300
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you go crazy with the bad science?</v>

1301
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you where I turned to?</v>

1302
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1303
01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>here's what people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that is from a cult.</v>

1304
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>The woman that I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman who is the lunch,</v>

1305
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind a cult movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1306
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>She's a channeler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's speaking as a character like di di</v>

1307
01:01:49.801 --> 01:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

1308
01:01:50.691 --> 01:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blonde woman,</v>

1309
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>older blonde woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1310
01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And she speaks when she speaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she speaking as a care.</v>

1311
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1312
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

1313
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:01.940
<v Speaker 1>she's a part of this very bizarre sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cult.</v>

1314
01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And should I tell you where I tuned it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out or you want to finish this?</v>

1315
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to,</v>

1316
01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1317
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a point where they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1318
01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1319
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>natives in the caribbean seeing european</v>
<v Speaker 1>ships.</v>

1320
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they said,</v>

1321
01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'd never seen a ship before.</v>

1322
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>They brain didn't register it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and then it just disappeared.</v>

1323
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking,</v>

1324
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not how the brain works.</v>

1325
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how this works.</v>

1326
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen?</v>

1327
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>They might not know what they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

1328
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>but they'll know they're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and it had ships.</v>

1329
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went from island to island.</v>

1330
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>That's how you get from island to </v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

1331
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1332
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:42.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a really big version of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

1333
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>We've never seen anything that big </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1334
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it came from,</v>

1335
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but I want to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to study it.</v>

1336
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to protect myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1337
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:55.850
<v Speaker 1>So just because you've never seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you're not going to </v>

1338
01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:55.850
<v Speaker 1>register it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

1339
01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1340
01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1341
01:02:56.761 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>no wonder I can't waste my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got other things I've got to devote my</v>

1342
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:01.980
<v Speaker 1>brain energy to instead of instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1343
01:03:01.981 --> 01:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>but someone else.</v>

1344
01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets better later on.</v>

1345
01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:05.360
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll borrow.</v>

1346
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:06.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

1347
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It gets more confusing later on and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1348
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.830
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does a better job of confusing you as</v>

1349
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:16.580
<v Speaker 1>to what science has shown and what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't shown now.</v>

1350
01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in all fairness to what they.</v>

1351
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that the point they were trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>

1352
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.170
<v Speaker 1>there are things that if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>to recognize them,</v>

1353
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.080
<v Speaker 1>you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They Would go undiscovered.</v>

1354
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1355
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.500
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you wouldn't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1356
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1357
01:03:33.421 --> 01:03:38.421
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're walking and you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you were walking over this </v>

1358
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>huge burial mound because the slope was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really shallow and you just walking,</v>

1359
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you just,</v>

1360
01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1361
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you didn't notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1362
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.330
<v Speaker 1>So you need a different way to see it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to know.</v>

1363
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:53.270
<v Speaker 1>So from space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an angle,</v>

1364
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 1>measure the height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1365
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.650
<v Speaker 1>So there are ways to miss things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

1366
01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:02.660
<v Speaker 1>And that happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's something there on the </v>

1367
01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.470
<v Speaker 1>horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my gosh,</v>

1368
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.010
<v Speaker 1>this is why we have eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1369
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.110
<v Speaker 1>now they're not the best day to taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices,</v>

1370
01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>but it was come time to tell you whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a shipper,</v>

1371
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:13.980
<v Speaker 1>not a ship that you've never seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1372
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1373
01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so much evidence of that when </v>

1374
01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:21.110
<v Speaker 1>people discover new animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1375
01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything before </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1376
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.420
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no record of it whatsoever.</v>

1377
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:27.120
<v Speaker 1>People find it and they could still see </v>
<v Speaker 1>most scientific discoveries.</v>

1378
01:04:27.121 --> 01:04:28.860
<v Speaker 1>You discovered something we've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen before.</v>

1379
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Ramp the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the woman's name.</v>

1380
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person that she was channel.</v>

1381
01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a cool channeling name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have a channeling name.</v>

1382
01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 1>It ramped our chancellor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be ramp though.</v>

1383
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I found that after the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1384
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:43.560
<v Speaker 1>after the movie was done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I watched it,</v>

1385
01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got me with a lot of things.</v>

1386
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1387
01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:47.310
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>IS that real?</v>

1388
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Then I started reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately that movie came out in the </v>

1389
01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>two thousands instead of in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

1390
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Because if it came out in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were all got duped.</v>

1391
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go and have the internet to research all</v>

1392
01:04:57.841 --> 01:05:02.841
<v Speaker 1>the shit that's wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the two thousands I started </v>

1393
01:05:02.841 --> 01:05:02.841
<v Speaker 1>researching it and then I would send it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to my friends,</v>

1394
01:05:02.841 --> 01:05:02.841
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1395
01:05:02.841 --> 01:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look where the fuck this came from.</v>

1396
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:05.490
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go,</v>

1397
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a called.</v>

1398
01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

1399
01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>The ladies at color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

1400
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:11.400
<v Speaker 1>she's talking like she's an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's supposed to be an alien.</v>

1401
01:05:11.401 --> 01:05:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that you see it in there anyway.</v>

1402
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>

1403
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind if people think their </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel or is that just don't put them </v>

1404
01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:19.760
<v Speaker 1>in charge of anything.</v>

1405
01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:19.760
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1406
01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:24.331
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I signed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that you should probably say </v>

1407
01:05:24.331 --> 01:05:26.400
<v Speaker 2>that when you get going with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:31.500
<v Speaker 2>So I know exactly what I'm saying called</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's ever said she calls herself </v>

1409
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.620
<v Speaker 2>ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it's real and genuine and </v>

1410
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:35.620
<v Speaker 2>sincere and they're very sincere because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've put themselves.</v>

1411
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing we need is,</v>

1412
01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:37.820
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you.</v>

1413
01:05:37.821 --> 01:05:42.821
<v Speaker 2>Don't you need is some foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science literacy so that you can </v>

1414
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:48.361
<v Speaker 2>inoculate yourself against those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would exploit your absence of knowledge </v>

1415
01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:51.730
<v Speaker 2>of how the science works for their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>gain?</v>

1416
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even for their own gain.</v>

1417
01:05:53.441 --> 01:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Just youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1418
01:05:55.031 --> 01:06:00.031
<v Speaker 2>someone could make a very compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube video where they get you </v>

1419
01:06:00.031 --> 01:06:00.031
<v Speaker 2>convinced at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My god,</v>

1420
01:06:00.031 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start playing these things for you.</v>

1421
01:06:02.261 --> 01:06:03.040
<v Speaker 2>they tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1422
01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:06.810
<v Speaker 2>tell us about phones can pop popcorn in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cmc.</v>

1423
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:07.060
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

1424
01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have seen that way.</v>

1425
01:06:08.091 --> 01:06:13.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You line up sometimes within the </v>

1426
01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:14.810
<v Speaker 2>department color you gotta like directly</v>
<v Speaker 2>to colonel someone that can't really </v>

1427
01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:14.810
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1428
01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:14.920
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1429
01:06:14.921 --> 01:06:15.510
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>

1430
01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Imagine it could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ will be like,</v>

1431
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:22.651
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing with these phones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a ton of those out there </v>

1432
01:06:22.651 --> 01:06:23.770
<v Speaker 2>where people see that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with,</v>

1433
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a lack of dialogue with someone who</v>

1434
01:06:26.771 --> 01:06:29.770
<v Speaker 2>just has one narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you sit down,</v>

1435
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:32.250
<v Speaker 2>he added something and you just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ain't no,</v>

1436
01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to like,</v>

1437
01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.760
<v Speaker 2>even if you write a blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's one thing if you're writing </v>

1438
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.161
<v Speaker 2>a blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say if you're an expert in </v>

1439
01:06:41.161 --> 01:06:43.070
<v Speaker 2>electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read a blog about how a televIsion </v>

1440
01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:45.451
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're just a person and you </v>

1441
01:06:45.451 --> 01:06:45.451
<v Speaker 2>don't really understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

1442
01:06:45.451 --> 01:06:49.711
<v Speaker 2>but you're right something and use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right words and you say it in a very </v>

1443
01:06:49.711 --> 01:06:53.071
<v Speaker 2>compelling way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an attack piece on someone that </v>

1444
01:06:53.071 --> 01:06:55.891
<v Speaker 2>really has no basis in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have someone convinced this </v>

1445
01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>person's a terrible person just by </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing something without them having to</v>

1446
01:06:58.031 --> 01:06:58.360
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>

1447
01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I call up stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never did that.</v>

1448
01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:04.711
<v Speaker 2>I tweet a february,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweet a few weeks ago and I don't get </v>

1449
01:07:04.711 --> 01:07:05.880
<v Speaker 2>their budget because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way better as the tweet than I will</v>

1450
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:10.890
<v Speaker 2>ever remember it as the tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was one of the great challenges in</v>

1451
01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 2>life is knowing enough to think you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1452
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:20.890
<v Speaker 2>but not enough to know you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1453
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.290
<v Speaker 2>well that is a big problem with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that watch his youtube videos.</v>

1454
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:24.400
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

1455
01:07:24.401 --> 01:07:25.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is right.</v>

1456
01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:30.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know enough to know why </v>

1457
01:07:30.181 --> 01:07:30.181
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I wanted to talk to you</v>

1458
01:07:30.181 --> 01:07:30.181
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1459
01:07:30.181 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 2>what is it about people that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1460
01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:32.160
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1461
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:37.170
<v Speaker 2>this very compelling need to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>something out that other people don't </v>

1462
01:07:37.601 --> 01:07:39.310
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the world is flat,</v>

1463
01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:44.460
<v Speaker 2>like dinosaurs aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of stuff is very </v>

1464
01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.670
<v Speaker 2>compelling to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I do in those cases,</v>

1465
01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:46.470
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the,</v>

1466
01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1467
01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:52.610
<v Speaker 2>so what I do is I would say instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>debating them and some of some of your </v>

1468
01:07:54.041 --> 01:07:55.350
<v Speaker 2>listeners are listening to this right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1469
01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:00.360
<v Speaker 2>it's what all I would do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your best single bit of evidence</v>

1470
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:08.220
<v Speaker 2>for what you're claiming and what would </v>
<v Speaker 2>it take to show that you're wrong?</v>

1471
01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:13.030
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's go get a simple one.</v>

1472
01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:13.420
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1473
01:08:13.421 --> 01:08:15.110
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I would ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1474
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I've done</v>

1475
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>this exercise and it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

1476
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there was a guy who didn't </v>

1477
01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:24.310
<v Speaker 1>believe we went to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spent a third of our time in our last</v>

1478
01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:24.750
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goes there.</v>

1479
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:29.920
<v Speaker 1>So there's someone I know who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe he went to the moon rather than </v>

1480
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>just say he's skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

1481
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>what kind of evidence would convince </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

1482
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>He said images of the landing site of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the apollo missions.</v>

1483
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1484
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.740
<v Speaker 1>here's a website where we sent a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't west,</v>

1485
01:08:44.741 --> 01:08:47.450
<v Speaker 1>it was the chinese think the chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>were europeans sent,</v>

1486
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>aced a probe to an orbiter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the moon.</v>

1487
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.810
<v Speaker 1>So It was close enough because ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>based telescopes are not,</v>

1488
01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 1>don't they don't have the resolution to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the landing sites,</v>

1489
01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:02.020
<v Speaker 1>but if you get close enough to the moon </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get It photographed the entire </v>

1490
01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:02.020
<v Speaker 1>surface of the moon.</v>

1491
01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And there were the landing sites and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the rover tracks and the base for </v>

1492
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:09.490
<v Speaker 1>the lunar module.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he,</v>

1493
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.650
<v Speaker 1>that night he went home and found it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he came back and says,</v>

1494
01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasa could have faked that.</v>

1495
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with you.</v>

1496
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:22.270
<v Speaker 1>We have no more to talk about because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not ready to be convinced.</v>

1497
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird.</v>

1498
01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Because he gave him the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked for exact.</v>

1499
01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.930
<v Speaker 1>That would convince him and it did not </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince them that we have,</v>

1500
01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I have no other conversation with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a singular event which you could </v>

1501
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.561
<v Speaker 1>say in one way or like it is possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone could fake a singular </v>

1502
01:09:41.561 --> 01:09:45.881
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't fake whether or not the </v>

1503
01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:45.881
<v Speaker 1>world's flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1504
01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Like that to me is the scariest one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's so many people out there </v>

1505
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.720
<v Speaker 1>that believes the world is flat because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

1506
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:53.750
<v Speaker 1>you could literally see the curvature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth from a plane.</v>

1507
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can get to a parts of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the images from the space </v>

1508
01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.890
<v Speaker 1>station where they circled the moon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they circled the earth rather.</v>

1509
01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many,</v>

1510
01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:05.570
<v Speaker 1>many satellite images of the earth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its entirety.</v>

1511
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the thIngs that,</v>

1512
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:12.401
<v Speaker 1>the argument was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how come every photograph of the </v>

1513
01:10:12.401 --> 01:10:13.040
<v Speaker 1>earth is a compilation of photographs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1514
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.380
<v Speaker 1>because they're all taken from 300 miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1515
01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:20.381
<v Speaker 1>The earth is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a way bigger than 300 miles or </v>

1516
01:10:20.381 --> 01:10:20.930
<v Speaker 1>have to take a compliment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>

1517
01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.180
<v Speaker 1>The only way to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except for the apollo photo,</v>

1518
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:28.270
<v Speaker 1>the polish 17 coming back has the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the famous one that was africa </v>

1519
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:30.310
<v Speaker 1>and antarctica and view the full earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few.</v>

1520
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Full earth's is very hard to get a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth single photo.</v>

1521
01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the astro and when we went to the moon,</v>

1522
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.630
<v Speaker 1>the moon missions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're coming back,</v>

1523
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.590
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

1524
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:44.590
<v Speaker 1>To get full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth means the sun is behind the </v>

1525
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:49.181
<v Speaker 1>astronauts on the way back to earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means the side of the moon facing </v>

1526
01:10:49.181 --> 01:10:52.901
<v Speaker 1>earth is not lit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the side of the moon they </v>

1527
01:10:52.901 --> 01:10:56.291
<v Speaker 1>came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they want to visit the moon while </v>

1528
01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:59.111
<v Speaker 1>it's sunlight there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want you to need flashlights </v>

1529
01:10:59.111 --> 01:11:01.840
<v Speaker 1>when they get to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they visited the moon while there's </v>

1530
01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.150
<v Speaker 1>sunlight earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The view of earth at that time will not </v>

1531
01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:08.141
<v Speaker 1>be full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So apollo 17 was there long enough so </v>

1532
01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:13.040
<v Speaker 1>that by the time they left the moon was </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a new moon.</v>

1533
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Earth was full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon of earth was full earth,</v>

1534
01:11:15.361 --> 01:11:18.360
<v Speaker 1>and then he got a fuller throat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those packs that they have on their back</v>

1535
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:23.361
<v Speaker 1>that regulate the temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that allows them to walk on the surface </v>

1536
01:11:23.361 --> 01:11:23.361
<v Speaker 1>of the moon when it's 250 degrees above </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

1537
01:11:23.361 --> 01:11:23.970
<v Speaker 1>the side is facing.</v>

1538
01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:26.190
<v Speaker 1>The sun is more than 200 degrees and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadow,</v>

1539
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.060
<v Speaker 1>the 150 degrees and below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1540
01:11:28.061 --> 01:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ken,</v>

1541
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it switched back and forth between those</v>
<v Speaker 1>two environments.</v>

1542
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Know what you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you just insulate the.</v>

1543
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It's insulated and so when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulated,</v>

1544
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:41.300
<v Speaker 1>those temperature extremes are not felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimized and it's regulated by the </v>

1545
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:45.771
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pack those warm oxygen and no it </v>

1546
01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:51.261
<v Speaker 1>maintains the temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the case of warming and cooling </v>

1547
01:11:51.261 --> 01:11:53.160
<v Speaker 1>in the face of what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it maintains the temperature.</v>

1548
01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 1>That's how you need to thInk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1549
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:58.170
<v Speaker 1>so regardless of what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooling one side of you and chilling the</v>

1550
01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.730
<v Speaker 1>heating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side,</v>

1551
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 1>it's maintaining a temperature for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you are in space like say,</v>

1552
01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:09.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a space can click on the </v>

1553
01:12:09.561 --> 01:12:10.971
<v Speaker 1>space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing as being on the surface of </v>

1554
01:12:10.971 --> 01:12:10.971
<v Speaker 1>the moon is real atmosphere on earth.</v>

1555
01:12:10.971 --> 01:12:13.800
<v Speaker 1>You are in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this cocoon there I say,</v>

1556
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:19.460
<v Speaker 1>of atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all the air in this room is the same </v>

1557
01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:24.111
<v Speaker 1>temperature because the air can </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate a difference in temperature </v>

1558
01:12:25.651 --> 01:12:28.590
<v Speaker 1>to itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equilibrating it across the whole room,</v>

1559
01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:33.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have air than your </v>

1560
01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.380
<v Speaker 1>temperature is measured by where's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy coming from,</v>

1561
01:12:34.381 --> 01:12:36.840
<v Speaker 1>the teaching you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the sun is hitting you,</v>

1562
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:42.290
<v Speaker 1>all that energy will be raising your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature and the side of you that's </v>

1563
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:42.810
<v Speaker 1>not facing photons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That temperature will drop,</v>

1564
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:45.900
<v Speaker 1>so you need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could survive it if you put yourself</v>

1565
01:12:45.901 --> 01:12:49.200
<v Speaker 1>on a rotisserie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out the right rotation rate,</v>

1566
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:54.230
<v Speaker 1>and even then you'd have to spend pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick in order to actually calculate </v>

1567
01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:54.230
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1568
01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:55.230
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out what the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate is.</v>

1569
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Now when you get in a debate with a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like bob guy,</v>

1570
01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't debate people.</v>

1571
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well when you discussed the saying goes,</v>

1572
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.590
<v Speaker 1>when winning argument lasts more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes,</v>

1573
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:07.350
<v Speaker 1>both sides are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1574
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:12.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely something wrong and </v>

1575
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.750
<v Speaker 1>the other person's stubborn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely lasts for hours.</v>

1576
01:13:12.751 --> 01:13:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1577
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighty percent of the time,</v>

1578
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.560
<v Speaker 1>but you got into would that wrapper that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that the.</v>

1579
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why bob,</v>

1580
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:27.861
<v Speaker 1>because in his twitter stream he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying he was invoking physics and so I,</v>

1581
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotta deal with this and so he</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed a picture from bear mountain,</v>

1582
01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:38.871
<v Speaker 1>which is a mountain in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in slightly upstate New York where </v>

1583
01:13:38.871 --> 01:13:41.610
<v Speaker 1>manhattan is in the sight line of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>summit of this mountain.</v>

1584
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give her the curvature of the earth and </v>

1585
01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.851
<v Speaker 1>this formula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should not be able to see manhattan </v>

1586
01:13:49.851 --> 01:13:49.851
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1587
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it depends on the height that you're</v>

1588
01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:53.610
<v Speaker 1>viewing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1589
01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.180
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1590
01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:54.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1591
01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:59.930
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the math and it turns out </v>

1592
01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:00.780
<v Speaker 1>manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the island would not be visible at all.</v>

1593
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:06.380
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But any building taller than 15 stories </v>

1594
01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 1>would rise up above the curvature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1595
01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:10.020
<v Speaker 1>And you will see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the photo,</v>

1596
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>you see the tall buildings</v>

1597
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:17.130
<v Speaker 2>rising above 15 stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what the correct formula </v>

1598
01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:21.271
<v Speaker 2>shows and not his formula,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was wrong and misinterpreted a </v>

1599
01:14:21.371 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 2>claims to show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1600
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:27.691
<v Speaker 2>it's just bizarre because snipers had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been using the literal curve of the </v>

1601
01:14:27.691 --> 01:14:31.560
<v Speaker 2>earth to plan where bullets go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you want it.</v>

1602
01:14:31.561 --> 01:14:34.450
<v Speaker 2>That have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you shoot a mile,</v>

1603
01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:37.630
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're shooting like well </v>
<v Speaker 2>out over a thousand yards.</v>

1604
01:14:37.631 --> 01:14:38.800
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those factors.</v>

1605
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.040
<v Speaker 2>So let me think of mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to ask how much curvature of the </v>

1606
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.800
<v Speaker 2>earth you get after a mile drop </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

1607
01:14:45.801 --> 01:14:47.890
<v Speaker 2>You get dropped in curb to be gravity </v>
<v Speaker 2>drop.</v>

1608
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then curve.</v>

1609
01:14:48.941 --> 01:14:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So both of those.</v>

1610
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1611
01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:52.270
<v Speaker 2>is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's here.</v>

1612
01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing to say someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a bullet in your hand and </v>

1613
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.790
<v Speaker 2>you shoot a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1614
01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.050
<v Speaker 2>which drops faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1615
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:05.530
<v Speaker 2>They generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get the wrong answer to that drop </v>

1616
01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:05.530
<v Speaker 2>at the exact same rate.</v>

1617
01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Go hIt the ground at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same time.</v>

1618
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blows people's minds.</v>

1619
01:15:08.021 --> 01:15:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that physics one-on-one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1620
01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:13.960
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a physics demo.</v>

1621
01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:16.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's why physics is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1622
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:18.700
<v Speaker 2>people always take biology in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>

1623
01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:23.940
<v Speaker 2>but don't leave out the physics because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the fundamental operations </v>

1624
01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:27.361
<v Speaker 2>of nature are to be found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of the physical universe are to be </v>

1625
01:15:27.361 --> 01:15:30.571
<v Speaker 2>found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you have is you have a gun at </v>

1626
01:15:30.571 --> 01:15:33.481
<v Speaker 2>one side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a thing that shoots out a </v>

1627
01:15:33.481 --> 01:15:36.241
<v Speaker 2>project to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it a gun at one side of the </v>

1628
01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:38.611
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have like a little stuffed </v>

1629
01:15:38.611 --> 01:15:38.611
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the other side's case held up with an</v>

1630
01:15:38.611 --> 01:15:42.580
<v Speaker 2>electro magnet at the top of his head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these two are exactly the same level</v>

1631
01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:45.670
<v Speaker 2>as the projectile comes out from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>booth.</v>

1632
01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:50.671
<v Speaker 2>There's many cannon it trips and </v>
<v Speaker 2>electric circuit that releases the </v>

1633
01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:52.630
<v Speaker 2>electromagnet at the top of the stuffed </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

1634
01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.650
<v Speaker 2>The stuffed animal begins to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bullets moves horizontally,</v>

1635
01:15:56.651 --> 01:16:01.651
<v Speaker 2>but also falls because gravity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling them both and you watched the </v>

1636
01:16:01.651 --> 01:16:06.421
<v Speaker 2>projectIle curve down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch the stuffed animal come down </v>

1637
01:16:06.421 --> 01:16:07.840
<v Speaker 2>and it hits the stuffed animal every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single time.</v>

1638
01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 2>The only factor that would change that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be if you put wings in the bullet.</v>

1639
01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.600
<v Speaker 2>it was dealing with the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the wind would affect it.</v>

1640
01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Did they have boats with wings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that.</v>

1641
01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>

1642
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:22.460
<v Speaker 2>But if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1643
01:16:22.461 --> 01:16:26.350
<v Speaker 2>if like you shot the bullet and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out like wings came out.</v>

1644
01:16:26.351 --> 01:16:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I saw that on some James Bond movie I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

1645
01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1646
01:16:30.031 --> 01:16:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1647
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:36.100
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just got to be frustrating for you </v>

1648
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.470
<v Speaker 2>when these things come back around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was no flat earth theory when</v>

1649
01:16:38.471 --> 01:16:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the other things though,</v>

1650
01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 2>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were in high school,</v>

1651
01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.460
<v Speaker 2>there was much more astrology going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1652
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:45.580
<v Speaker 2>The president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reagan.</v>

1653
01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Nancy reagan has an astrologer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1654
01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:52.790
<v Speaker 2>so today you don't see much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1655
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:54.330
<v Speaker 2>unless you talked to steve maxwell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1656
01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:56.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>

1657
01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not manifesting in public policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people believe in it deeply.</v>

1658
01:17:00.581 --> 01:17:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not up there in public policy.</v>

1659
01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:04.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1660
01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Well we're the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nancy reagan was really the only one </v>

1661
01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 2>that made it with public policy then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the bar to you,</v>

1662
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:10.020
<v Speaker 2>do</v>

1663
01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 1>you hear people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your sign?</v>

1664
01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Is that still pick up 100 percent be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true?</v>

1665
01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1666
01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.850
<v Speaker 1>you're married an american man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of it.</v>

1667
01:17:19.851 --> 01:17:21.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand if you want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid,</v>

1668
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:23.810
<v Speaker 1>you got to talk nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People got sucked.</v>

1669
01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a scorpio.</v>

1670
01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:28.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're a taurus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should just stop.</v>

1671
01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I misled myself.</v>

1672
01:17:30.231 --> 01:17:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was fading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1673
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:36.140
<v Speaker 1>nancy reagan was the big proponent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nonsense.</v>

1674
01:17:36.141 --> 01:17:41.141
<v Speaker 1>Astrology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not like someone who really </v>

1675
01:17:41.141 --> 01:17:42.440
<v Speaker 1>understands astrological charts and can </v>
<v Speaker 1>plot it and the moon's in retrograde and</v>

1676
01:17:42.441 --> 01:17:47.441
<v Speaker 1>you were born and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>celsius is rising and all that crazy </v>

1677
01:17:47.441 --> 01:17:51.401
<v Speaker 1>crap that they tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don'T know what they're doing on a </v>

1678
01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:51.401
<v Speaker 1>talk show with finished roger a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1679
01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1680
01:17:51.621 --> 01:17:54.290
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's real or fake one,</v>

1681
01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:59.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says she's real and I trust her </v>

1682
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:03.560
<v Speaker 1>because she talks about how fake other </v>
<v Speaker 1>astrologers are a hater.</v>

1683
01:18:04.650 --> 01:18:09.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was saying that the kennedys all</v>

1684
01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:14.180
<v Speaker 1>died during a lunar eclipse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scary.</v>

1685
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And you know that this is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>checkable statement.</v>

1686
01:18:17.361 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 1>She just says this and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening and believing in.</v>

1687
01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1688
01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 1>That can't be by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1689
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when other kennedy's died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know when Jack Kennedy died and it</v>

1690
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:29.600
<v Speaker 1>was November 22nd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1963,</v>

1691
01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:35.100
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't need to know if there's an </v>

1692
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:35.100
<v Speaker 1>eclipse then I just need to know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>phase the moon is in.</v>

1693
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can only have a lunar </v>

1694
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:39.610
<v Speaker 1>eclipse when the moon is full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the moon was nowhere near full.</v>

1695
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It was like two weeks away from full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if there was an eclipse,</v>

1696
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it didn't happen during an eclipse is my</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1697
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1698
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.520
<v Speaker 1>So of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was daylight.</v>

1699
01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1700
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:52.610
<v Speaker 1>you can have a lunar eclipse at anytime.</v>

1701
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have solar look anytime too.</v>

1702
01:18:56.381 --> 01:19:00.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just how it would be for the world.</v>

1703
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1704
01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Don't be so silly centric centric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1705
01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:10.690
<v Speaker 1>when there's a lunar eclipse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone on this side of the earth that </v>

1706
01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:10.690
<v Speaker 1>sees the moon will see the lunar </v>
<v Speaker 1>eclipse.</v>

1707
01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:12.350
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so by the way,</v>

1708
01:19:12.351 --> 01:19:15.920
<v Speaker 1>lunar eclipses you get several per year </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1709
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:21.190
<v Speaker 1>A partial eclipses as a minimum and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every couple years there's a full and </v>

1710
01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.420
<v Speaker 1>rich ellipses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are not rare things to start.</v>

1711
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:24.830
<v Speaker 1>They're not rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1712
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.420
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1713
01:19:26.421 --> 01:19:27.500
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was shot when the,</v>

1714
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what muna was first quarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon and she said,</v>

1715
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:36.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this counts if they're anywhere </v>

1716
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:37.850
<v Speaker 1>within two weeks on either side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eclipse,</v>

1717
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:40.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a month out of 12.</v>

1718
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.220
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1719
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.620
<v Speaker 1>let me just shut up here and let her </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep sharing the time.</v>

1720
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.540
<v Speaker 1>It was a thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a talk shOw.</v>

1721
01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.390
<v Speaker 1>We will talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1722
01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.730
<v Speaker 1>And he likes science by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

1723
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:52.880
<v Speaker 1>he wore the nasa shirt at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1724
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:57.140
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the academy award group photo.</v>

1725
01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Speaker 1>so I got to give him some props for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1726
01:19:59.631 --> 01:20:00.560
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1727
01:20:00.561 --> 01:20:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just said I'm,</v>

1728
01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm have nothing more to say here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence my argument with her lasted less </v>

1729
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:08.350
<v Speaker 1>than five minutes now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they when,</v>

1730
01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:12.390
<v Speaker 1>when they're trying to decide like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality would be and what you,</v>

1731
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:17.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you can dictate from your birth </v>

1732
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:18.900
<v Speaker 1>date and what time you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they exactly.</v>

1733
01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:23.901
<v Speaker 1>Trying to connect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a deeper awareness of this </v>

1734
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.720
<v Speaker 1>recently when I learned that people take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the names of things very seriously.</v>

1735
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The names mean things to people </v>

1736
01:20:39.090 --> 01:20:41.910
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what the thing actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1737
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1738
01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So What might we mean by this?</v>

1739
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so uh,</v>

1740
01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:53.860
<v Speaker 1>let's like astrophysics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say we have this thing called dark </v>

1741
01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:53.860
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what it is.</v>

1742
01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be some kind of matter.</v>

1743
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1744
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be called dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be called fred.</v>

1745
01:21:00.170 --> 01:21:02.040
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With no,</v>

1746
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:07.100
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't lead you to think anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because we do not know what it </v>

1747
01:21:07.951 --> 01:21:12.951
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't really call it dark </v>

1748
01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:12.951
<v Speaker 1>gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1749
01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:16.240
<v Speaker 1>it is gravity that we have measured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's causing the </v>

1750
01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:16.240
<v Speaker 1>gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just call it dark.</v>

1751
01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Matter implies you think it's matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people do,</v>

1752
01:21:18.781 --> 01:21:21.900
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So explain to me what,</v>

1753
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.590
<v Speaker 1>what is this based on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like When you say dark matter,</v>

1754
01:21:25.591 --> 01:21:30.591
<v Speaker 1>what is it based on its.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to just call it fred for let's </v>

1755
01:21:30.591 --> 01:21:31.200
<v Speaker 1>call it fred and I'm saying we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it is,</v>

1756
01:21:31.201 --> 01:21:31.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1757
01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.190
<v Speaker 1>What Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is,</v>

1758
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.200
<v Speaker 1>how is measuring the gravity of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

1759
01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out there the six times the gravity</v>

1760
01:21:37.231 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 1>of stuff that's ordinary matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know where it's coming from.</v>

1761
01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:42.760
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the arctic.</v>

1762
01:21:42.761 --> 01:21:47.761
<v Speaker 1>Is that a parallel universe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that we don't know and how are we </v>

1763
01:21:47.761 --> 01:21:48.810
<v Speaker 1>measuring it by its effect on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motions of object.</v>

1764
01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:54.980
<v Speaker 1>So a certain strength of gravity will </v>
<v Speaker 1>force you to move at a given speed as </v>

1765
01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:59.481
<v Speaker 1>you near it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you pull away and we see this in </v>

1766
01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:00.420
<v Speaker 1>galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy clusters,</v>

1767
01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.610
<v Speaker 1>binary galaxies and large entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies that are made completely out of</v>

1768
01:22:05.611 --> 01:22:10.611
<v Speaker 1>this fred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 80 percent of the force of </v>

1769
01:22:11.041 --> 01:22:13.950
<v Speaker 1>gravity manifested in these galaxies is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fred.</v>

1770
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1771
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:19.380
<v Speaker 1>and that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they calling it dark matter?</v>

1772
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:20.400
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1773
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:22.980
<v Speaker 1>she called dark gravity because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally what it is.</v>

1774
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:25.590
<v Speaker 1>So its gravity that cannot be measured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gravity,</v>

1775
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:27.840
<v Speaker 1>gravity and poorly understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not understood.</v>

1776
01:22:27.841 --> 01:22:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1777
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.140
<v Speaker 1>it's mysterious gravity completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured to measure it.</v>

1778
01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:34.920
<v Speaker 1>We can't narrow down what you measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>against gravity.</v>

1779
01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1780
01:22:35.821 --> 01:22:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you measure it,</v>

1781
01:22:36.811 --> 01:22:38.880
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my origin,</v>

1782
01:22:38.881 --> 01:22:43.881
<v Speaker 1>because some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what it is that my point </v>

1783
01:22:43.881 --> 01:22:44.580
<v Speaker 1>is because someone called it dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

1784
01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.490
<v Speaker 1>It has swayed everybody into thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is matter of some kind.</v>

1785
01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:56.640
<v Speaker 1>It has constrained people's thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to think about this problem.</v>

1786
01:22:57.270 --> 01:23:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the ancients looked up and they </v>

1787
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:05.661
<v Speaker 1>saw these stars and they put their </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture on the sky.</v>

1788
01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:10.390
<v Speaker 1>So there centaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1789
01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:12.310
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1790
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:14.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1791
01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 1>when it was sent to archer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sagittarius.</v>

1792
01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.180
<v Speaker 1>We have a ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunter.</v>

1793
01:23:19.181 --> 01:23:21.520
<v Speaker 1>We have tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have sea serpents,</v>

1794
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:26.790
<v Speaker 1>we have rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have stuff that mattered to people </v>

1795
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.790
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

1796
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have an aquarius.</v>

1797
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.570
<v Speaker 1>What does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the water bearer?</v>

1798
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the warner bear.</v>

1799
01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:36.310
<v Speaker 1>That must mean that when the sun is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>aquarius,</v>

1800
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>it's going to rain more on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1801
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Because the ancients called it the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>bearer a okay.</v>

1802
01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:50.490
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden the name reigns </v>
<v Speaker 1>supreme over the fact that it is a </v>

1803
01:23:52.511 --> 01:23:57.511
<v Speaker 1>random set of stars widely separated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space that don't even look like people </v>

1804
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:03.970
<v Speaker 1>holding a pitcher of water of the 88 </v>
<v Speaker 1>constellations,</v>

1805
01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:08.971
<v Speaker 1>about six of them look like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>told they're supposed to look like the </v>

1806
01:24:08.971 --> 01:24:13.201
<v Speaker 1>rest require opium induced imagination </v>
<v Speaker 1>to establish what they are.</v>

1807
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:20.070
<v Speaker 1>So they all have names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go to the astrologers tables </v>

1808
01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:22.030
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1809
01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:25.270
<v Speaker 1>this is the rain sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or this is a dry drought sign.</v>

1810
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And then you take the names of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those names are what they interpret </v>

1811
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:33.880
<v Speaker 1>based on where the moon is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sun is where the planets are and all</v>

1812
01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:36.250
<v Speaker 1>whatever the angle configurations they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1813
01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:41.400
<v Speaker 1>And each angle has a certain latitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>over which they'll count it as a hit </v>

1814
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:46.470
<v Speaker 1>rather than as a miss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this gives extraordinary capacity</v>

1815
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.830
<v Speaker 1>of the astrologer to tell you what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in your life.</v>

1816
01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh huh.</v>

1817
01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:58.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they did have this real,</v>

1818
01:25:01.441 --> 01:25:06.441
<v Speaker 1>a fascinating connection with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain constellations and all of the </v>

1819
01:25:07.561 --> 01:25:10.190
<v Speaker 1>different things that they thought were </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached these certain constellation.</v>

1820
01:25:10.191 --> 01:25:10.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1821
01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like,</v>

1822
01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:16.041
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like I'm a geologist going up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the border of Colorado trying to </v>

1823
01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:19.180
<v Speaker 1>understand the shape as a geologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

1824
01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:20.100
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1825
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:25.250
<v Speaker 1>it's an arbitrary shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado was a square on a curved </v>

1826
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:29.511
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much confirmation bias </v>

1827
01:25:29.511 --> 01:25:29.710
<v Speaker 1>is attached bY a river by a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1828
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:34.880
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the wiki has a great website on </v>

1829
01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:40.100
<v Speaker 1>cognitive bias and there's like 20 or so</v>
<v Speaker 1>well known by every person.</v>

1830
01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:46.230
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This should be a course called cognitive</v>

1831
01:25:46.231 --> 01:25:47.220
<v Speaker 1>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One-on-one,</v>

1832
01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:50.610
<v Speaker 1>not forget college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every high school should have a course.</v>

1833
01:25:50.611 --> 01:25:55.611
<v Speaker 1>Cognitive bias and the entire course </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be about all the ways we fool </v>

1834
01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:56.580
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

1835
01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:00.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tweeted this to science.</v>

1836
01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 1>The only of the scientific method is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you are not fooled into </v>

1837
01:26:10.161 --> 01:26:12.680
<v Speaker 1>thinking that something is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not,</v>

1838
01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 1>or thinking that something is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

1839
01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:23.320
<v Speaker 1>that is the only point of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore the scientists could be </v>

1840
01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 1>anything you invent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take better notes,</v>

1841
01:26:25.011 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>take a chart recorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1842
01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:28.820
<v Speaker 1>be more awake next time you take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

1843
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.880
<v Speaker 1>bring a friend to observe it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it takes to minimize the </v>

1844
01:26:34.041 --> 01:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>chances that you will miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret what you're looking at so that</v>

1845
01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:41.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't think something is true that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not or thinks something is not true.</v>

1846
01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:46.370
<v Speaker 1>That is do whatever it takes to support </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1847
01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:50.210
<v Speaker 1>that a mission statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the scientific method is and</v>

1848
01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:55.211
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do as scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why when you bring all of these </v>

1849
01:26:56.001 --> 01:27:01.001
<v Speaker 1>things that people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the astrology and the crystal </v>

1850
01:27:01.001 --> 01:27:01.001
<v Speaker 1>healers and the and who are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1851
01:27:01.001 --> 01:27:01.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1852
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:06.700
<v Speaker 1>the therapeutic touch people and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know that's real.</v>

1853
01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:10.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't even understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes on healer.</v>

1854
01:27:10.881 --> 01:27:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm an intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes on and on and on and on,</v>

1855
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:17.360
<v Speaker 1>and these are the things that fail in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the double blind science.</v>

1856
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Any why do you do double blind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't fool yourself into thinking</v>

1857
01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:25.241
<v Speaker 1>something is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you do double blind if you </v>

1858
01:27:25.241 --> 01:27:28.691
<v Speaker 1>don't and you want something to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you even if you're surprised by </v>

1859
01:27:28.691 --> 01:27:29.990
<v Speaker 1>something that might've been true that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were against,</v>

1860
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:35.290
<v Speaker 1>still you need someone else to check it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and you only get an emergent </v>

1861
01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:40.171
<v Speaker 1>scientific truth when you have agreement</v>
<v Speaker 1>among different people's experiments is </v>

1862
01:27:40.171 --> 01:27:42.080
<v Speaker 1>there so even if you get a result that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're happy with,</v>

1863
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:47.590
<v Speaker 1>it is not yet a scientific truth until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can confirm it by other people who </v>

1864
01:27:47.751 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 1>have no investment in you who don't care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1865
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:52.430
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to show that you're wrong.</v>

1866
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:58.180
<v Speaker 1>This is what made einstein so great </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one believed as relativity </v>

1867
01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:01.661
<v Speaker 1>and they kept devising evermore accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments to show he was wrong and it </v>

1868
01:28:01.661 --> 01:28:03.530
<v Speaker 1>ended up showing that he was right by </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever higher precision.</v>

1869
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that we're doing ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>a disservice by not teaching people how </v>

1870
01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.621
<v Speaker 1>the mind works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how confirmation bias and and it's you </v>

1871
01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:16.410
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't teach things in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on this one a few years,</v>

1872
01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:21.750
<v Speaker 1>in a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have something by now </v>

1873
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.750
<v Speaker 1>because I'm busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids are in school right now.</v>

1874
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1875
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>

1876
01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:30.890
<v Speaker 1>but let's discuss it because I think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>curriculum has to include an entire </v>

1877
01:28:30.951 --> 01:28:32.780
<v Speaker 1>course on cognitive bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1878
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:37.810
<v Speaker 1>If we are going to emerge as adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer susceptible to charlatans.</v>

1879
01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1880
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Who are either well meaning and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>misguided or who are explicitly </v>

1881
01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:49.370
<v Speaker 1>exploiting your ignorance and and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major factor in our culture,</v>

1882
01:28:49.371 --> 01:28:54.371
<v Speaker 1>a major factor when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians dry factor when it comes to </v>

1883
01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:56.210
<v Speaker 1>bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a major factor when it comes to how</v>

1884
01:28:56.211 --> 01:29:01.211
<v Speaker 1>you choose what you do for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human interaction and human interaction </v>

1885
01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:01.211
<v Speaker 1>with nature itself.</v>

1886
01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are constantly trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate and control other people's </v>

1887
01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:07.140
<v Speaker 1>biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors the way they think,</v>

1888
01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:09.540
<v Speaker 1>the way they act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're very vulnerable in some senses</v>

1889
01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:12.570
<v Speaker 1>because this is not something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught to us at an early age,</v>

1890
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that were,</v>

1891
01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:17.310
<v Speaker 1>it takes a long time to figure it out on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>

1892
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:19.560
<v Speaker 1>And I've often thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1893
01:29:19.561 --> 01:29:21.960
<v Speaker 1>why wasn't I explained this when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>young?</v>

1894
01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the curriculum was dee dee </v>

1895
01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.880
<v Speaker 1>wasn't thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we're thinking about just giving </v>

1896
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.701
<v Speaker 1>people facts instead of teaching them </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to use this vessel into which you </v>

1897
01:29:31.701 --> 01:29:36.591
<v Speaker 1>pour information and nowhere and at no </v>
<v Speaker 1>time are we trained how to turn effect </v>

1898
01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:44.960
<v Speaker 1>into knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge into wisdom and wisdom into </v>

1899
01:29:46.531 --> 01:29:51.531
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that full Sequence needs to be </v>

1900
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:54.060
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the academic system,</v>

1901
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:56.760
<v Speaker 1>k through 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 through 16,</v>

1902
01:29:57.170 --> 01:29:57.820
<v Speaker 1>13 point of view.</v>

1903
01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:00.060
<v Speaker 1>A college has got to be in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

1904
01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Without it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just this vessel effects.</v>

1905
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Even if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the people we call smart in </v>

1906
01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:12.111
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are people who get a's on </v>

1907
01:30:12.111 --> 01:30:12.180
<v Speaker 1>everything and they know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do they have the deepest insight?</v>

1908
01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they really understand what it is </v>

1909
01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:20.130
<v Speaker 1>that they're putting back on the test?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think all of them do.</v>

1910
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I think they have good short term </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

1911
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Some of them and they do well on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exams because of that fact.</v>

1912
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:28.610
<v Speaker 1>So they're good at acquiring data and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining it,</v>

1913
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:32.460
<v Speaker 1>acquiring information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then bringing it back on command.</v>

1914
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all summer are deep thinkers and I </v>

1915
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:40.760
<v Speaker 1>don't want to take that away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm saying is that the curriculum I </v>

1916
01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:44.430
<v Speaker 1>think needs these other dimensions of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of survival really.</v>

1917
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:47.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's survival in a world.</v>

1918
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:50.970
<v Speaker 1>And when a scientist says this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ask,</v>

1919
01:30:50.971 --> 01:30:52.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think that's true?</v>

1920
01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Exercise some healthy skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with that.</v>

1921
01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Say because of look at this evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how to read evidenced by the</v>

1922
01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:00.560
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look at this evidence,</v>

1923
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:02.940
<v Speaker 1>look at this chart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this experiment,</v>

1924
01:31:02.941 --> 01:31:07.941
<v Speaker 1>and this is why we conclude </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly that this is going to </v>

1925
01:31:07.941 --> 01:31:08.340
<v Speaker 1>happen in our future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1926
01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I choose out of your pointy headed </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>

1927
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:11.640
<v Speaker 1>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1928
01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:16.700
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me my cell phone so I can call my </v>

1929
01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:17.910
<v Speaker 1>grandmother while I use gps satellites </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know when to make a left turn,</v>

1930
01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call my astrologist to tell</v>

1931
01:31:21.691 --> 01:31:23.850
<v Speaker 1>them these scientists don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got their head up their ass.</v>

1932
01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:27.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

1933
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also it'd be really beneficial </v>

1934
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.870
<v Speaker 1>to teach people how to manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

1935
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:37.790
<v Speaker 1>And how to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at life in a way that's gonna be </v>

1936
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:39.740
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not really give them the tools</v>

1937
01:31:39.850 --> 01:31:42.000
<v Speaker 1>to match the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like philosophy,</v>

1938
01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:47.120
<v Speaker 1>a philosophy class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even philosophy not all flustered </v>

1939
01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.060
<v Speaker 1>because where the philosophy of law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1940
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:54.080
<v Speaker 1>just how to think about decision making </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the causes and effects and </v>

1941
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.470
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1942
01:31:55.510 --> 01:32:00.510
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough of that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're relying on that to happen </v>

1943
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520
<v Speaker 1>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not all homes are intact.</v>

1944
01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:06.360
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps most are broken homes or </v>

1945
01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.251
<v Speaker 1>separated homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the school system school </v>

1946
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:13.891
<v Speaker 1>needs to be rethought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to think that through a </v>

1947
01:32:13.891 --> 01:32:13.891
<v Speaker 1>few more years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1948
01:32:13.891 --> 01:32:15.240
<v Speaker 1>anytime you talk about alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>schooling,</v>

1949
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 1>people look at you like you're some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a hippie freak who wants your kids to</v>

1950
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:21.390
<v Speaker 1>eat granola in the mountains and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own spring water.</v>

1951
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they think of when you say </v>

1952
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>alternative schooling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1953
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll train them at home,</v>

1954
01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You good luck.</v>

1955
01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.860
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you say homeschooling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1956
01:32:29.861 --> 01:32:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you're a religious nut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1957
01:32:30.941 --> 01:32:32.630
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's immediate perception.</v>

1958
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Fastest growing sector of the homeschool</v>
<v Speaker 1>and center.</v>

1959
01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:38.160
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to cloud your head with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that evolution talk.</v>

1960
01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1961
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:41.410
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever talk to that ken ham guy?</v>

1962
01:32:41.411 --> 01:32:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever sat down with that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1963
01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:44.390
<v Speaker 1>but bill nye has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean booman.</v>

1964
01:32:44.391 --> 01:32:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I debated him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't debate people.</v>

1965
01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't do it.</v>

1966
01:32:48.491 --> 01:32:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what I do.</v>

1967
01:32:50.850 --> 01:32:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm an educator and I want to educate </v>
<v Speaker 1>you so you can think for yourself,</v>

1968
01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.010
<v Speaker 1>but then I go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1969
01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:02.220
<v Speaker 1>To debate someone implies that whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever is most convincing is correct </v>

1970
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:05.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's not how knowledge works.</v>

1971
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So much charisma involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever charisma level I have or not </v>

1972
01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:11.740
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hinge.</v>

1973
01:33:11.741 --> 01:33:14.350
<v Speaker 1>What is true on that fact?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1974
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm an educator.</v>

1975
01:33:15.851 --> 01:33:20.851
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will teach you the causes and effects </v>

1976
01:33:20.851 --> 01:33:24.750
<v Speaker 1>of what science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing what science is and how and why </v>

1977
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:27.630
<v Speaker 1>it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's critical that you </v>

1978
01:33:27.630 --> 01:33:27.630
<v Speaker 1>continue to criticize science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

1979
01:33:27.630 --> 01:33:28.690
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you back off now?</v>

1980
01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:34.290
<v Speaker 1>We need you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that wouldn't </v>

1981
01:33:34.290 --> 01:33:35.791
<v Speaker 1>know that that chinese space station is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near the space station and that </v>

1982
01:33:35.791 --> 01:33:36.890
<v Speaker 1>to her hair would be moving all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1983
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:39.790
<v Speaker 1>There would be everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my favorite one is you remember when</v>

1984
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:44.910
<v Speaker 1>he's at the end of the tether and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn to save him but she doesn't ever </v>

1985
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:48.970
<v Speaker 1>have oxygen to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he lets go of the tether and that way</v>

1986
01:33:48.971 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 1>she can't save him before she can save </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself and and then he flies away.</v>

1987
01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:55.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1988
01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.230
<v Speaker 1>they're like floating in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lets go of the tether.</v>

1989
01:34:00.231 --> 01:34:05.231
<v Speaker 1>It just stays there in his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would be right there and it would be </v>

1990
01:34:05.231 --> 01:34:05.231
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1991
01:34:05.231 --> 01:34:05.740
<v Speaker 1>He let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happened.</v>

1992
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be like a bungee cord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if he,</v>

1993
01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:09.780
<v Speaker 1>if she was swinging him in circles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he like,</v>

1994
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:14.790
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fly off at a tangent but that's not </v>

1995
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.790
<v Speaker 1>what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nor were they rotating.</v>

1996
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I would check the what they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative to earth below.</v>

1997
01:34:17.441 --> 01:34:20.330
<v Speaker 1>That waS not what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you don't.</v>

1998
01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:23.470
<v Speaker 1>She could just give it a slight tug and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he would have drifted towards her.</v>

1999
01:34:23.471 --> 01:34:24.910
<v Speaker 1>That could have even been a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic,</v>

2000
01:34:24.970 --> 01:34:29.970
<v Speaker 1>a little baby tub would do it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would slowly drift towards one of the </v>

2001
01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:31.510
<v Speaker 1>helmets would hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2002
01:34:31.511 --> 01:34:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and then they went me mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2003
01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:36.580
<v Speaker 1>And then the helmets would break and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there'd be freezing it instantly.</v>

2004
01:34:36.581 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you just suffocate that too.</v>

2005
01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And then freeze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2006
01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.960
<v Speaker 1>What movie nailed that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one movie when space and they </v>

2007
01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:45.960
<v Speaker 1>overdid it a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

2008
01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.611
<v Speaker 1>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want you to like explode in </v>

2009
01:34:50.611 --> 01:34:50.611
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2010
01:34:50.611 --> 01:34:51.070
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2011
01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:51.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2012
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:53.230
<v Speaker 1>they want you to freeze solid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly,</v>

2013
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:54.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2014
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:55.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

2015
01:34:55.310 --> 01:35:00.310
<v Speaker 1>And even in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it armageddon where the sun rose </v>

2016
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.710
<v Speaker 1>over the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the,</v>

2017
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:03.830
<v Speaker 1>over the comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't have his visor down and he</v>

2018
01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:08.831
<v Speaker 1>was blinded by the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the same son in our daytime </v>

2019
01:35:08.831 --> 01:35:13.421
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The atmosphere doesn't protect you in </v>

2020
01:35:13.421 --> 01:35:13.421
<v Speaker 1>any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earth's atmosphere takes out,</v>

2021
01:35:13.421 --> 01:35:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few percent.</v>

2022
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2023
01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.240
<v Speaker 1>A few percent of all in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

2024
01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.560
<v Speaker 1>One daylight at the top of the sky to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few percent.</v>

2025
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Now he'll get more uv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll get more uv.</v>

2026
01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a little brown.</v>

2027
01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2028
01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:30.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2029
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:35.590
<v Speaker 1>death in space is nowhere near as </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular as movies would have you </v>

2030
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.590
<v Speaker 1>think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2031
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:37.220
<v Speaker 1>they make it seem like if you take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>helmet off,</v>

2032
01:35:37.221 --> 01:35:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you just have immediately freeze up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2033
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:39.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2034
01:35:39.171 --> 01:35:41.120
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean You can go into very.</v>

2035
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:46.390
<v Speaker 1>What happens is there's nothing making </v>
<v Speaker 1>you cold other than you radiating heat </v>

2036
01:35:47.361 --> 01:35:48.490
<v Speaker 1>from your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2037
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:52.400
<v Speaker 1>So you only get as cold as quickly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can radiate away heat.</v>

2038
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:54.830
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we take quite a while.</v>

2039
01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.950
<v Speaker 1>You just have no air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd suffocate quicker.</v>

2040
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.970
<v Speaker 1>You'd suffocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2041
01:35:58.971 --> 01:36:00.980
<v Speaker 1>You said okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long before you saw anything,</v>

2042
01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:02.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that happen.</v>

2043
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:04.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just think about it.</v>

2044
01:36:04.121 --> 01:36:07.070
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing touching you that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>making you cold.</v>

2045
01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:10.280
<v Speaker 1>It has to wait for you to radiate away.</v>

2046
01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2047
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:15.830
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

2048
01:36:15.831 --> 01:36:20.831
<v Speaker 1>you will feel very cold very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to die from that </v>

2049
01:36:20.831 --> 01:36:21.020
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when stephen hawking,</v>

2050
01:36:21.021 --> 01:36:26.021
<v Speaker 1>and by the way you also have dissolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>gases in your body which will try to </v>

2051
01:36:26.021 --> 01:36:29.650
<v Speaker 1>come in in the vacuum of space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the air pressure tamping </v>

2052
01:36:29.811 --> 01:36:32.600
<v Speaker 1>down the dissolved gases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you take away the air pressure,</v>

2053
01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:37.900
<v Speaker 1>then the dissolved gases will begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble out of your blood and it's the </v>

2054
01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.320
<v Speaker 1>same problem with when you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benz.</v>

2055
01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come up from low altitude and </v>

2056
01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.961
<v Speaker 1>you go to lesser pressure around your </v>
<v Speaker 1>employees and so you want to do that </v>

2057
01:36:46.961 --> 01:36:49.620
<v Speaker 1>slowly so that it's a very slow thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hazards of.</v>

2058
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:53.780
<v Speaker 1>But why would you be button naked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space?</v>

2059
01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to have a space suit on,</v>

2060
01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:56.960
<v Speaker 1>so I just want to prove to everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could do it.</v>

2061
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.980
<v Speaker 1>So I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2062
01:36:57.981 --> 01:37:00.980
<v Speaker 1>they did it in 2001 a space odyssey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically did it right.</v>

2063
01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:03.260
<v Speaker 1>The guy without his helmet went through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the airlock,</v>

2064
01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:05.600
<v Speaker 1>just held his breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2065
01:37:05.601 --> 01:37:06.230
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2066
01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That's all he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's way more reasonable.</v>

2067
01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was a reasonable movie.</v>

2068
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.900
<v Speaker 1>That was a good movie that had real </v>
<v Speaker 1>advisor stanley kubrick.</v>

2069
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a really interesting guy because </v>

2070
01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:19.930
<v Speaker 1>he was a mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stanley kubrick about it,</v>

2071
01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:21.230
<v Speaker 1>but I knew he cared about that level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>

2072
01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:23.120
<v Speaker 1>He used to do complex math and it's for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

2073
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2074
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:29.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a fail bit of physics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] one day I'll talk about my </v>

2075
01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:31.760
<v Speaker 1>gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the model,</v>

2076
01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:34.970
<v Speaker 1>which was middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so remember when he's,</v>

2077
01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:40.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on one of the moon crafts and he's </v>

2078
01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:40.220
<v Speaker 1>orbIting the moon and they give him </v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

2079
01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a tray of nasty food.</v>

2080
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's like astronaut food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

2081
01:37:44.661 --> 01:37:47.290
<v Speaker 1>this is 1968.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything here is a,</v>

2082
01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:50.080
<v Speaker 1>is a visual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2083
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:52.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the taste of the future.</v>

2084
01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:57.580
<v Speaker 1>So he has another packet where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>extends straw from that plastic packet.</v>

2085
01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2086
01:37:59.251 --> 01:38:00.210
<v Speaker 1>there he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ExcelleNt.</v>

2087
01:38:00.230 --> 01:38:01.860
<v Speaker 1>You get in the good photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>

2088
01:38:01.930 --> 01:38:03.090
<v Speaker 1>You boys good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right here.</v>

2089
01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2090
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:06.120
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sucks up the straw.</v>

2091
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is in zero g,</v>

2092
01:38:07.891 --> 01:38:09.600
<v Speaker 1>so stuff is floating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he suck up the straw,</v>

2093
01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:13.470
<v Speaker 1>then he goes to another straw and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid and the straw goes back down.</v>

2094
01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:15.730
<v Speaker 1>That's gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2095
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:18.270
<v Speaker 1>they fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2096
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.360
<v Speaker 1>he totaLly fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2097
01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:22.500
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that one,</v>

2098
01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:27.501
<v Speaker 1>obviously he can't get everything right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fun to notice the things he </v>

2099
01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:27.501
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2100
01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:30.150
<v Speaker 1>We didn't think to get right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me it's a celebration.</v>

2101
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2102
01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:33.780
<v Speaker 1>The rotation rate of the space station.</v>

2103
01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I calculated that and I calculated what </v>
<v Speaker 1>g force would you have on the outer </v>

2104
01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:47.301
<v Speaker 1>perimeter of the space station in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did the math and I forgot the </v>

2105
01:38:47.301 --> 01:38:52.221
<v Speaker 1>exact number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like between two and three </v>

2106
01:38:52.221 --> 01:38:52.221
<v Speaker 1>g's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2107
01:38:52.221 --> 01:38:52.950
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>

2108
01:38:52.951 --> 01:38:54.240
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't do that.</v>

2109
01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.170
<v Speaker 1>And I realized if they've rotated it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rate that we give you one,</v>

2110
01:38:58.171 --> 01:39:03.171
<v Speaker 1>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be way too slow to make an </v>

2111
01:39:03.171 --> 01:39:04.280
<v Speaker 1>interesting scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I gave it to him.</v>

2112
01:39:04.530 --> 01:39:07.590
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you three gs because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strauss waltz,</v>

2113
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:12.650
<v Speaker 1>as the thing turns and the space shuttle</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's approaching it matches its </v>

2114
01:39:12.650 --> 01:39:16.320
<v Speaker 1>rotation rate with the opening in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center of the space station.</v>

2115
01:39:16.830 --> 01:39:21.000
<v Speaker 1>This whole bow lay this entire ballet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

2116
01:39:21.001 --> 01:39:21.660
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2117
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:24.810
<v Speaker 1>happens at a stately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but real pace.</v>

2118
01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that pace gives him a three g,</v>

2119
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:29.460
<v Speaker 1>three g's of gravity.</v>

2120
01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:33.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's three x the correct pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correct pace may have been two and a</v>

2121
01:39:33.361 --> 01:39:34.470
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot the number,</v>

2122
01:39:34.471 --> 01:39:36.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's multiples to high.</v>

2123
01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:39.390
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I let him do it.</v>

2124
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.850
<v Speaker 1>It's so I'm not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm that.</v>

2125
01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.010
<v Speaker 1>That's artistic license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's mark twain.</v>

2126
01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Ian licensed where he saYs first get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your facts straight,</v>

2127
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:51.480
<v Speaker 1>then distort them at your leisure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what I'm holding artists too.</v>

2128
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:55.920
<v Speaker 1>So now when you're looking at a space </v>
<v Speaker 1>station,</v>

2129
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:58.440
<v Speaker 1>like they're in zero gravity when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the space station.</v>

2130
01:39:58.441 --> 01:40:03.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are in one g on the edge of the </v>

2131
01:40:03.441 --> 01:40:03.441
<v Speaker 1>space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the edge.</v>

2132
01:40:03.441 --> 01:40:04.170
<v Speaker 1>On the turning edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2133
01:40:04.171 --> 01:40:05.490
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing.</v>

2134
01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:09.050
<v Speaker 1>So I mean the issue thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh our space station.</v>

2135
01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2136
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:15.620
<v Speaker 1>zero g now it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is possible zero g because it is </v>

2137
01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:16.530
<v Speaker 1>in free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall towards earth.</v>

2138
01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's constantly in free fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just going around the freefall </v>

2139
01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:24.930
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's going sideways so fast that the</v>

2140
01:40:24.931 --> 01:40:28.940
<v Speaker 1>amount that it has fallen equals </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the spinner.</v>

2141
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 1>The curvature of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that more proof of the earth is round</v>

2142
01:40:34.690 --> 01:40:36.450
<v Speaker 1>if you've had physics one o,</v>
<v Speaker 1>n yes,</v>

2143
01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:41.190
<v Speaker 1>but is it possible that the gravity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the space station,</v>

2144
01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:43.350
<v Speaker 1>the only if you rotate it wrote tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not gravity.</v>

2145
01:40:43.351 --> 01:40:45.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to einstein,</v>

2146
01:40:45.931 --> 01:40:48.240
<v Speaker 1>they're indistinguishable from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another so you can do it.</v>

2147
01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So there it is possible to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can send people into deep </v>

2148
01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 1>space and generate</v>

2149
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.050
<v Speaker 2>gravity through some sort of rotation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

2150
01:40:56.051 --> 01:41:01.051
<v Speaker 2>at least two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them you just rotate it and all </v>

2151
01:41:01.051 --> 01:41:02.440
<v Speaker 2>the good scifi movies have rotating </v>
<v Speaker 2>sections of a space station.</v>

2152
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some they have rotating opposite </v>

2153
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:08.230
<v Speaker 2>ways so that they can spin up against </v>
<v Speaker 2>one another.</v>

2154
01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2155
01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:15.260
<v Speaker 2>so there's some clever ideas out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>with space stations of the future for </v>

2156
01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:19.831
<v Speaker 2>long voyages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you bad commander hadfield on the </v>

2157
01:41:19.831 --> 01:41:22.531
<v Speaker 2>podcast came back from space and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the excruciating </v>

2158
01:41:22.991 --> 01:41:27.991
<v Speaker 2>difficulty he had readjusting to gravity</v>
<v Speaker 2>after being in a zero gravity </v>

2159
01:41:27.991 --> 01:41:32.521
<v Speaker 2>environment for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just showing off because he'd like </v>

2160
01:41:32.521 --> 01:41:33.230
<v Speaker 2>setting records for was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't until like six months ago.</v>

2161
01:41:33.231 --> 01:41:34.120
<v Speaker 2>It was a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

2162
01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's showing.</v>

2163
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

2164
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't handle life with you locally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Earth people.</v>

2165
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:44.100
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about his body like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>took like over a year before his bone </v>

2166
01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:44.100
<v Speaker 2>density came back.</v>

2167
01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:46.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is partly addressed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>

2168
01:41:46.781 --> 01:41:47.580
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2169
01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:52.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the martian kid who's born on mars comes</v>

2170
01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 2>to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which ones?</v>

2171
01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.350
<v Speaker 2>One on mars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2172
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:58.060
<v Speaker 2>the kid born on mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to research this.</v>

2173
01:41:58.061 --> 01:42:01.540
<v Speaker 2>like now that was the name of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's recent.</v>

2174
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2175
01:42:01.921 --> 01:42:02.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2176
01:42:02.411 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 2>that's the space between us now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell is that?</v>

2177
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:06.400
<v Speaker 2>You got to get out more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2178
01:42:06.490 --> 01:42:07.490
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2179
01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 2>That's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a martian colony.</v>

2180
01:42:09.650 --> 01:42:11.440
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the first community.</v>

2181
01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what movie is this?</v>

2182
01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:14.860
<v Speaker 2>This came out a couple months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2183
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2184
01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on itunes.</v>

2185
01:42:18.071 --> 01:42:19.270
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the martian colony.</v>

2186
01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:24.780
<v Speaker 2>And one of the female astronauts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they send that one there happens to be </v>

2187
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:29.320
<v Speaker 2>or they learn is pregnant and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring her back.</v>

2188
01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:33.430
<v Speaker 2>And so she gives birth on mars to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first person who,</v>

2189
01:42:33.650 --> 01:42:35.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was ever born on mars,</v>

2190
01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:41.940
<v Speaker 2>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they keep it a secret and then he </v>

2191
01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:41.940
<v Speaker 2>comes back as a teenager that falls in </v>
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

2192
01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:42.670
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the fetus.</v>

2193
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:45.610
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyhow,</v>

2194
01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.640
<v Speaker 2>he has a hard time on earth because his </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart developed in martian gravity,</v>

2195
01:42:50.711 --> 01:42:53.310
<v Speaker 2>which is only 38 percent earth gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>

2196
01:42:53.311 --> 01:42:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Man on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just couldn't do that to,</v>

2197
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:57.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to do with them.</v>

2198
01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:42:58.921 --> 01:43:00.610
<v Speaker 2>That's on mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kid was born on mars.</v>

2200
01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Don't spoil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alert me jamming.</v>

2202
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.650
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2203
01:43:04.651 --> 01:43:04.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2204
01:43:04.981 --> 01:43:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2205
01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:07.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were,</v>

2206
01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.750
<v Speaker 2>we were generating gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One way to rotate it up.</v>

2207
01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Another way is if you're headed </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

2208
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I just have a huge fuel tank and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>always run your rockets.</v>

2209
01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always a g force.</v>

2210
01:43:21.710 --> 01:43:26.410
<v Speaker 2>So if you sell or accelerate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one g right towards a destination,</v>

2211
01:43:26.770 --> 01:43:30.940
<v Speaker 2>then you will always have gravity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get there awesomely fast.</v>

2212
01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:34.200
<v Speaker 2>But you'd have to have so much fuel or </v>
<v Speaker 2>rely on something.</v>

2213
01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:36.710
<v Speaker 2>You filling stations en route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of thing end.</v>

2214
01:43:36.850 --> 01:43:38.160
<v Speaker 2>If you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2215
01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.460
<v Speaker 2>you accelerate one g halfway there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you turn the space ship around,</v>

2216
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:47.880
<v Speaker 2>then you decelerate at one g for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other half of the trip so that when you </v>

2217
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.700
<v Speaker 2>get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not whizzing past it in a by that</v>

2218
01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:53.060
<v Speaker 2>we have one g the whole trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you would do that.</v>

2219
01:43:53.630 --> 01:43:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the momentum when you had precisely </v>

2220
01:43:58.630 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 2>halfway there at one g.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

2221
01:43:59.391 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 2>You hit near the speed of light very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

2222
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

2223
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.340
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it in a.</v>

2224
01:44:04.770 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 2>I have to calculate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2225
01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:09.920
<v Speaker 2>it's the acceleration of earth's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity.</v>

2226
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:13.100
<v Speaker 2>If you actually move that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2227
01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.260
<v Speaker 2>that's head snapping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2228
01:44:15.261 --> 01:44:20.261
<v Speaker 2>would they have to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy propulsion system in order to do </v>

2229
01:44:20.261 --> 01:44:21.650
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fast we're one g get you there?</v>

2230
01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2231
01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:25.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2232
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:30.790
<v Speaker 2>So wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she would take a one year plus the </v>

2233
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:35.021
<v Speaker 2>distance in light years approximates and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tory four point two light years for </v>

2234
01:44:35.021 --> 01:44:35.360
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would take five point two years.</v>

2235
01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.340
<v Speaker 2>So the distance in light years plus a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2236
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:39.570
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2237
01:44:39.630 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that gets you basically a 20,</v>

2238
01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:48.190
<v Speaker 2>25 percent the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens if you just run into stuff </v>

2239
01:44:48.190 --> 01:44:48.190
<v Speaker 2>on the way like there's a lot of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

2240
01:44:48.190 --> 01:44:48.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:44:48.311 --> 01:44:51.950
<v Speaker 2>So he's not a giant issue in getting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mars is actually quite empty.</v>

2242
01:44:51.951 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 2>But if you do hit something that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of everything.</v>

2243
01:44:54.591 --> 01:44:58.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's a low risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high consequence thing.</v>

2244
01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:03.170
<v Speaker 2>But you gotta you gotta put in play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now how much of a risk is the space junk</v>

2245
01:45:03.171 --> 01:45:08.171
<v Speaker 2>that we've left in the environments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were started freaking out the other </v>

2246
01:45:08.171 --> 01:45:08.171
<v Speaker 2>day about how many are up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got.</v>

2247
01:45:08.171 --> 01:45:12.911
<v Speaker 2>So there's countless thousands of bits </v>
<v Speaker 2>of space junk from chips or paint that </v>

2248
01:45:13.551 --> 01:45:18.490
<v Speaker 2>fell off of just some bolts and nails </v>
<v Speaker 2>and retro rocket boosters.</v>

2249
01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:19.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

2250
01:45:19.311 --> 01:45:20.180
<v Speaker 2>it's all up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2251
01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:25.240
<v Speaker 2>and I'm wondering whether we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been visited by aliens yet because they </v>

2252
01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:25.240
<v Speaker 2>saw the space junk orbiting earth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2253
01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:29.090
<v Speaker 2>forget that I'm going to visit some </v>
<v Speaker 2>other planet and risk my life.</v>

2254
01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.450
<v Speaker 2>So short sighted approach to space </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel,</v>

2255
01:45:33.170 --> 01:45:38.170
<v Speaker 2>the nasa orbital debris office website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually see the debris that </v>

2256
01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:40.970
<v Speaker 2>nasa is tracking basic almost in real </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2257
01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:46.260
<v Speaker 2>It's crazY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll show it to you and it's like a </v>

2258
01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:48.140
<v Speaker 2>beehive around the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got.</v>

2259
01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

2260
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the debris around the earth.</v>

2261
01:45:51.230 --> 01:45:52.000
<v Speaker 2>That astra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>astra,</v>

2262
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:57.250
<v Speaker 2>that nasa tracks and that's failed </v>
<v Speaker 2>japanese experiment to try to that outer</v>

2263
01:45:57.621 --> 01:45:59.660
<v Speaker 2>ring that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

2264
01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.140
<v Speaker 2>the altitude of geosynchronous </v>
<v Speaker 2>satellites and that,</v>

2265
01:46:04.130 --> 01:46:06.710
<v Speaker 2>that should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be a video of that,</v>

2266
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:08.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite.</v>

2267
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the bottom right,</v>

2268
01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.010
<v Speaker 2>go to bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2269
01:46:10.190 --> 01:46:10.580
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

2270
01:46:10.610 --> 01:46:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Click on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Play that video.</v>

2271
01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Not a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't that a video?</v>

2272
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:20.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there is a video somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a video on that site so you can </v>

2273
01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:25.130
<v Speaker 2>just see the movement of these pieces </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's launch windows.</v>

2274
01:46:25.131 --> 01:46:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Have to know when to not hit stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2275
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:29.690
<v Speaker 2>so when you have lunch with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just,</v>

2276
01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:31.220
<v Speaker 2>is everything aligned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2277
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Is what we'll use successfully get past </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2278
01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:37.210
<v Speaker 2>the debris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a japanese,</v>

2279
01:46:37.211 --> 01:46:40.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had an experiment to try to capture</v>

2280
01:46:40.281 --> 01:46:45.281
<v Speaker 2>it with nets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a recent motion yet I so didn't </v>

2281
01:46:45.281 --> 01:46:49.331
<v Speaker 2>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is the low orbit stuff </v>

2282
01:46:49.621 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 2>will eventually</v>

2283
01:46:50.650 --> 01:46:53.340
<v Speaker 1>fall in and burned up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The high earth orbit stuff will never go</v>

2284
01:46:53.341 --> 01:46:55.840
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to destroy it.</v>

2285
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:58.200
<v Speaker 1>And so they can't capture that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2286
01:46:58.201 --> 01:47:01.140
<v Speaker 1>you need a very clever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the of this stuff is moving 18,000</v>

2287
01:47:01.141 --> 01:47:04.200
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's your net?</v>

2288
01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Just what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

2289
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you go.</v>

2290
01:47:08.410 --> 01:47:11.290
<v Speaker 1>The video go higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rez on that.</v>

2291
01:47:12.570 --> 01:47:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a higher risk.</v>

2292
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.760
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 10 80.</v>

2293
01:47:18.370 --> 01:47:23.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not from nasa as youtube parents </v>

2294
01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:23.370
<v Speaker 1>from somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the kind of.</v>

2295
01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:27.710
<v Speaker 1>So all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's debris that you're looking at </v>

2296
01:47:27.710 --> 01:47:27.710
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway.</v>

2297
01:47:27.710 --> 01:47:30.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're concerned for debris as well </v>

2298
01:47:30.741 --> 01:47:32.391
<v Speaker 1>placed and we may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may be putting so much debris in </v>

2299
01:47:32.391 --> 01:47:35.991
<v Speaker 1>space that we will close ourselves off </v>
<v Speaker 1>from space travel because of the dangers</v>

2300
01:47:36.901 --> 01:47:39.600
<v Speaker 1>it would take to get through our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage heap.</v>

2301
01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.600
<v Speaker 1>that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was all started in the 19 </v>

2302
01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:48.780
<v Speaker 1>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 fifties.</v>

2303
01:47:48.930 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 1>When did they start shooting stuff up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

2304
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NineTeen fifties.</v>

2305
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Sputnik.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 57.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first satellite,</v>

2307
01:47:55.351 --> 01:47:56.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First anything.</v>

2308
01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything in orbit.</v>

2309
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.470
<v Speaker 1>God and in that short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2310
01:48:01.710 --> 01:48:03.210
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:48:03.211 --> 01:48:05.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a dumpster.</v>

2312
01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Sixty years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Planetary don't ruin the whole thing.</v>

2313
01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:11.370
<v Speaker 1>They had it for billions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty years.</v>

2314
01:48:11.371 --> 01:48:13.090
<v Speaker 1>They filled it up with junk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2315
01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:16.470
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrifying.</v>

2316
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going around the earth.</v>

2317
01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2318
01:48:21.211 --> 01:48:23.790
<v Speaker 1>And has anybody ever hit anything while </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do something?</v>

2319
01:48:24.110 --> 01:48:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2320
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:26.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2321
01:48:26.731 --> 01:48:29.460
<v Speaker 1>what exacerbates it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when China,</v>

2322
01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:33.660
<v Speaker 1>when was this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen or 2004.</v>

2323
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred and three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China destroyed one of its own </v>

2324
01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.290
<v Speaker 1>satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orbit.</v>

2325
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I remember some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2326
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they basically did a Connecticut </v>

2327
01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:47.060
<v Speaker 1>kill on a satellite.</v>

2328
01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So Connecticut bill for those don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2329
01:48:48.511 --> 01:48:53.511
<v Speaker 1>is you don't need explosives if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of the projectile and its kinetic </v>

2330
01:48:53.671 --> 01:48:57.600
<v Speaker 1>energy is higher than the energy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be in the explosive shell itself.</v>

2331
01:48:58.370 --> 01:49:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fascInating.</v>

2332
01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:05.760
<v Speaker 1>A calculation to make so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here it is,</v>

2333
01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:10.940
<v Speaker 1>so I have this delivery system with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>warhead and I put some balm device in </v>

2334
01:49:11.761 --> 01:49:13.920
<v Speaker 1>the warhead and you can calculate how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much energy that is.</v>

2335
01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Then I send it and it hits and it blow </v>
<v Speaker 1>something up.</v>

2336
01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.890
<v Speaker 1>But suppose I send this thing really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>

2337
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2338
01:49:21.151 --> 01:49:26.151
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can calculate how much kinetic energy </v>

2339
01:49:26.151 --> 01:49:29.100
<v Speaker 1>this thing has the will be a point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give it so much kinetic energy.</v>

2340
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:34.310
<v Speaker 1>The kinetic energy is greater than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical energy of the conventional </v>

2341
01:49:34.531 --> 01:49:39.030
<v Speaker 1>explosive that I put in the warhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shoemaker levy.</v>

2342
01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2343
01:49:39.930 --> 01:49:42.870
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave you a terrestrial example.</v>

2344
01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2345
01:49:44.761 --> 01:49:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's what we call a high speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>collision.</v>

2346
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.500
<v Speaker 1>This is more than you bargained for in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2347
01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:51.090
<v Speaker 1>in our time together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will tell you now.</v>

2348
01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ready?</v>

2349
01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The argument for the longest time that </v>

2350
01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.051
<v Speaker 1>the craters on the moon work calderas </v>
<v Speaker 1>from volcanoes and not asteroid impacts.</v>

2351
01:50:04.630 --> 01:50:08.680
<v Speaker 1>The geologists argue strenuously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These can't be asteroid impacts.</v>

2352
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:12.490
<v Speaker 1>They've got to be calderas these </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand craters on the moon.</v>

2353
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2354
01:50:14.410 --> 01:50:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Because everyone is a perfect circle.</v>

2355
01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.640
<v Speaker 1>And if asteroids are coming from space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would come from all angles and if </v>

2356
01:50:24.101 --> 01:50:29.101
<v Speaker 1>you come in at a shallow angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get an oval and even shallower it'd </v>

2357
01:50:29.101 --> 01:50:33.521
<v Speaker 1>be more oval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have a whole range of circles </v>

2358
01:50:33.521 --> 01:50:34.030
<v Speaker 1>and ovals and ellipses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't see that,</v>

2359
01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:38.140
<v Speaker 1>they must be calderas law was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>caldera,</v>

2360
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:41.170
<v Speaker 1>volcanic volcanic crater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volcanic crater.</v>

2361
01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.480
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2362
01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:42.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2363
01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a volcanic crater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

2364
01:50:45.630 --> 01:50:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just a little more poetic at </v>

2365
01:50:50.630 --> 01:50:50.630
<v Speaker 1>caldera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

2366
01:50:50.630 --> 01:50:52.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a crater left by a volcano that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploded,</v>

2367
01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:58.140
<v Speaker 1>like the boom was so big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountains gone and now it's just a </v>

2368
01:50:58.140 --> 01:50:58.450
<v Speaker 1>big hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at the top of the mountain,</v>

2369
01:50:58.451 --> 01:50:59.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a crater at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>

2370
01:50:59.591 --> 01:51:01.290
<v Speaker 1>like crater lake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

2371
01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:03.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a round hole in the top of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>

2372
01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that once a volcano?</v>

2373
01:51:06.161 --> 01:51:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a whole.</v>

2374
01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the 19 seventies we were able to </v>

2375
01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:15.080
<v Speaker 1>do calculations with high speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers with good computers.</v>

2376
01:51:15.081 --> 01:51:20.081
<v Speaker 1>and what we found was if the object is </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving faster,</v>

2377
01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:28.180
<v Speaker 1>if the kinetic energy of the object is </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than the energy that's holding </v>

2378
01:51:30.111 --> 01:51:31.370
<v Speaker 1>the thing together,</v>

2379
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.760
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2380
01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:40.370
<v Speaker 1>So what's holding together a rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chemical connections of the silicon </v>

2381
01:51:40.441 --> 01:51:42.770
<v Speaker 1>and the oxygen and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that they ironed,</v>

2382
01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:45.120
<v Speaker 1>all everything that's making the rock is</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding it together.</v>

2383
01:51:45.121 --> 01:51:47.850
<v Speaker 1>You can calculate how much energy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding it together,</v>

2384
01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.790
<v Speaker 1>and if it's going 45,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles,</v>

2385
01:51:49.810 --> 01:51:51.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That write down that number.</v>

2386
01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Now I send in the asteroid with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinetic energy higher than the energy </v>

2387
01:51:57.881 --> 01:52:02.881
<v Speaker 1>that's holding it together on impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It explodes because all that energy goes</v>

2388
01:52:05.741 --> 01:52:09.150
<v Speaker 1>back into the rock because the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in moving anymore.</v>

2389
01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:12.130
<v Speaker 1>We did the Connecticut treat energy go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It digs a crater,</v>

2390
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.160
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by virtue of putting all that energy </v>

2391
01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:20.230
<v Speaker 1>back into the stone and that explodes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2392
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So on impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at an angle,</v>

2393
01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:27.481
<v Speaker 1>it is a singular point explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why every single crater is a </v>

2394
01:52:27.481 --> 01:52:29.980
<v Speaker 1>perfect circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call that a high speed impact,</v>

2395
01:52:30.490 --> 01:52:35.490
<v Speaker 1>where the speed is greater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy of the speed is greater than </v>

2396
01:52:35.490 --> 01:52:36.590
<v Speaker 1>the energy that's holding it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2397
01:52:36.630 --> 01:52:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Now you have experience in this.</v>

2398
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:40.230
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2399
01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thrown a do this next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2400
01:52:43.261 --> 01:52:44.690
<v Speaker 1>you were in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2401
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Snowballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snowballs.</v>

2402
01:52:46.191 --> 01:52:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Take us know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put a big bear.</v>

2403
01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:49.870
<v Speaker 1>They have taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snowball it face.</v>

2404
01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:53.750
<v Speaker 1>What's a barn wall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And throw the snowball at it and it'll.</v>

2405
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:58.810
<v Speaker 1>It'll make a little circular mark on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now change your angle to the wall and </v>

2406
01:52:59.811 --> 01:53:04.811
<v Speaker 1>throw the snowball again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll still make a small round mark and </v>

2407
01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:05.480
<v Speaker 1>it'll keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

2408
01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Because the speed with which you through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snowball,</v>

2409
01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:12.380
<v Speaker 1>that energy is greater than the energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's holding the snowball together.</v>

2410
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Because hardly energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardly any energy is holding the </v>

2411
01:53:17.770 --> 01:53:19.550
<v Speaker 1>snowball together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just loosely packed snow.</v>

2412
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So when you do it against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the snowball completely </v>

2413
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:27.650
<v Speaker 1>disappear in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a mini snowball explosion,</v>

2414
01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:28.970
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2415
01:53:28.971 --> 01:53:33.971
<v Speaker 1>so this works for any comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a projectile speed and what we call the </v>

2416
01:53:35.331 --> 01:53:36.080
<v Speaker 1>binding energy.</v>

2417
01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:41.100
<v Speaker 1>The object itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why the intercontinental </v>

2418
01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:43.931
<v Speaker 1>ballistic missiles never carried </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional warheads because their </v>

2419
01:53:44.001 --> 01:53:48.710
<v Speaker 1>speed coming out of this of space </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they leave the atmosphere,</v>

2420
01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 1>go from one continent to the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they fall out of the sky.</v>

2421
01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:56.800
<v Speaker 1>That speed gives them more kiNetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy than any conventional warheads </v>

2422
01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:57.070
<v Speaker 1>would've had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2423
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:59.870
<v Speaker 1>but then we figured out how to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>small nuclear warheads.</v>

2424
01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:03.260
<v Speaker 1>the nukes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're talking energy.</v>

2425
01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:09.880
<v Speaker 1>The kinetic energy of the icbm is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than the nuclear warhead that we </v>

2426
01:54:10.131 --> 01:54:12.560
<v Speaker 1>now put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why all icbm or nukes,</v>

2427
01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:17.860
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the v two rocket basically didn't need </v>

2428
01:54:17.901 --> 01:54:22.901
<v Speaker 1>an explosive warhead in its tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became out of the sky going five miles </v>

2429
01:54:22.901 --> 01:54:27.851
<v Speaker 1>per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was none of this that that </v>

2430
01:54:27.851 --> 01:54:28.460
<v Speaker 1>implies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hearing the thing,</v>

2431
01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:32.990
<v Speaker 1>dude is coming and supersonically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting there at a cocktail table</v>

2432
01:54:32.991 --> 01:54:36.080
<v Speaker 1>on a block and then the block has gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is obliterated in the next incident.</v>

2433
01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.910
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even know to look up.</v>

2434
01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the add an explosive anyway,</v>

2435
01:54:42.531 --> 01:54:44.810
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably didn't need to.</v>

2436
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Now go back to a shoemaker levy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a comment that slammed into </v>

2437
01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:53.201
<v Speaker 1>jupiter and jupiter is a gas giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been confused as to what </v>

2438
01:54:53.201 --> 01:54:53.201
<v Speaker 1>that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2439
01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:55.760
<v Speaker 1>most of its mass is in the form of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it's.</v>

2440
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety something percent of.</v>

2441
01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:02.480
<v Speaker 1>So when shoemaker levy slammed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>jupiter and going so fast,</v>

2442
01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the gaseous atmosphere was like hitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>a brick wall.</v>

2443
01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how fast it was moving.</v>

2444
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the explosion was exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's slow.</v>

2445
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:18.940
<v Speaker 1>All of its kinetic energy that it had </v>
<v Speaker 1>got put back into the object itself </v>

2446
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:25.270
<v Speaker 1>because it's slow down very quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative to its speed relative to the a.</v>

2447
01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:27.650
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's this comment,</v>

2448
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how big shoemaker levy was.</v>

2449
01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.910
<v Speaker 1>So now it goes into the atmosphere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

2450
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:33.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that just clouds?</v>

2451
01:55:33.291 --> 01:55:36.790
<v Speaker 1>And it can watch how fast it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

2452
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:42.250
<v Speaker 1>you can ask the question over how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance will it plow through its own </v>

2453
01:55:42.501 --> 01:55:46.730
<v Speaker 1>mass worth of gas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2454
01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:47.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2455
01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:53.380
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to plow that much mass out of </v>

2456
01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:53.380
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an important resistive force,</v>

2457
01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:56.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much atmosphere?</v>

2458
01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of atmosphere because it's </v>

2459
01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:01.600
<v Speaker 1>gas and this thing is solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2460
01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:02.570
<v Speaker 1>the thing is going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2461
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:04.440
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 miles per second.</v>

2462
01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:08.580
<v Speaker 1>It's falling into jupiter at $20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the speed was.</v>

2463
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.720
<v Speaker 1>If you go at 20 miles per second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will cover that much atmosphere in a</v>

2464
01:56:12.721 --> 01:56:16.710
<v Speaker 1>fraction of a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at a fraction of a second you go from</v>

2465
01:56:16.711 --> 01:56:20.940
<v Speaker 1>20 miles per second to zero or to a tiny</v>
<v Speaker 1>fraction of that speed.</v>

2466
01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.970
<v Speaker 1>All that energy has to go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes back into the system.</v>

2467
01:56:24.150 --> 01:56:27.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a comment made of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ice is not held together very easily.</v>

2468
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:33.080
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing explodes on impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was another terrifying statistic </v>

2469
01:56:33.391 --> 01:56:37.170
<v Speaker 1>that I read about the impact that hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the yucatan and killed the dinosaurs.</v>

2470
01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:41.550
<v Speaker 1>That how deep it had gone into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth's surface within the first second.</v>

2471
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

2472
01:56:42.590 --> 01:56:44.610
<v Speaker 1>These are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are numbers that are staggering.</v>

2473
01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Once you calculate what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and likE I said,</v>

2474
01:56:47.491 --> 01:56:50.040
<v Speaker 1>if you come in fast enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth's atmosphere is a brick.</v>

2475
01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Might as well be a brick wall to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

2476
01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you go 60 miles an hour down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolled down the window.</v>

2477
01:56:56.611 --> 01:57:01.611
<v Speaker 1>Just stick your hand out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to use muscle energy to not </v>

2478
01:57:01.651 --> 01:57:06.651
<v Speaker 1>have your and your hand blown backwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>against 60 miles and hour of air against</v>

2479
01:57:08.221 --> 01:57:10.710
<v Speaker 1>your open palm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try that next time.</v>

2480
01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:15.300
<v Speaker 1>See what kind of energy that requires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's 60 miles an hour.</v>

2481
01:57:16.050 --> 01:57:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine five miles per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 moles per second.</v>

2482
01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Twenty miles per second.</v>

2483
01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:30.110
<v Speaker 1>You're toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How deep did the asteroid that hit and </v>

2484
01:57:30.110 --> 01:57:31.240
<v Speaker 1>killed the dinosaurs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How deep did that thing going over?</v>

2485
01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:36.280
<v Speaker 1>so what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a 150 mile diameter crater or </v>

2486
01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:36.330
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the exact numbers.</v>

2487
01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

2488
01:57:38.041 --> 01:57:39.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a relationship between the depth</v>

2489
01:57:39.601 --> 01:57:41.520
<v Speaker 1>of a crater and the diameter and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass.</v>

2490
01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:43.200
<v Speaker 1>So the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no,</v>

2491
01:57:43.201 --> 01:57:44.490
<v Speaker 1>it goes miles down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2492
01:57:44.491 --> 01:57:46.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's miles.</v>

2493
01:57:46.230 --> 01:57:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

2494
01:57:47.670 --> 01:57:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me think.</v>

2495
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:51.480
<v Speaker 1>An earth rang for like a million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is,</v>

2496
01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:53.190
<v Speaker 1>let me pull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that back.</v>

2497
01:57:53.191 --> 01:57:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2498
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:59.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was what I had read.</v>

2499
01:57:59.550 --> 01:58:01.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the exact statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2500
01:58:01.290 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2501
01:58:01.771 --> 01:58:06.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta go miles that because the </v>

2502
01:58:06.771 --> 01:58:06.771
<v Speaker 1>thing is miles is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2503
01:58:06.771 --> 01:58:08.850
<v Speaker 1>the asteroid itself was the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mount everest.</v>

2504
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:11.220
<v Speaker 1>So the extra associates like five miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>across.</v>

2505
01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deep.</v>

2506
01:58:13.290 --> 01:58:14.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't mess with this.</v>

2507
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:19.430
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crater in Arizona called meteor </v>

2508
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:22.461
<v Speaker 1>crater for obvious reasons that can sink</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 60 story building and it's not even a </v>

2509
01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:28.370
<v Speaker 1>mile across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we're talking about a crater </v>

2510
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:28.370
<v Speaker 1>more than a hundred miles across that </v>
<v Speaker 1>took out the dinosaurs,</v>

2511
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:29.470
<v Speaker 1>that famous one in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>

2512
01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.310
<v Speaker 1>a 60 story building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2513
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:36.470
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put dirt up to the rim of the </v>

2514
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.470
<v Speaker 1>crater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can bury a 60 story building.</v>

2515
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Had an instance where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is your whole calculation about </v>

2516
01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:43.210
<v Speaker 1>explosions and about the amount of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were looking for,</v>

2517
01:58:43.211 --> 01:58:47.020
<v Speaker 1>the raw materials that caused that </v>
<v Speaker 1>crater.</v>

2518
01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot that they could mine it,</v>

2519
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:53.790
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They first thought is volcanic and the </v>

2520
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.790
<v Speaker 1>geologists thought it was volcanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2521
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And the but one geologist in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2522
01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:01.930
<v Speaker 1>eugene shoemaker who was in line to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>on one of the lunar missions and then he</v>

2523
01:59:01.931 --> 01:59:05.110
<v Speaker 1>had like a heart murmur and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sent a check,</v>

2524
01:59:05.111 --> 01:59:10.111
<v Speaker 1>schmidt to in his stead who's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>geologists turned us senator from</v>

2525
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where was he senator from?</v>

2526
01:59:14.421 --> 01:59:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2527
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:16.180
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2528
01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:19.010
<v Speaker 1>can you look at a Jack Schmidt where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was senator from.</v>

2529
01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Forgive me for forgetting [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I'm friends with him,</v>

2530
01:59:21.711 --> 01:59:22.600
<v Speaker 1>so I should known that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasa,</v>

2531
01:59:23.330 --> 01:59:24.320
<v Speaker 1>jack schmitt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s,</v>

2532
01:59:24.321 --> 01:59:25.760
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>h,</v>

2533
01:59:25.761 --> 01:59:26.240
<v Speaker 1>m,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I t,</v>

2534
01:59:26.241 --> 01:59:28.130
<v Speaker 1>t is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no dna.</v>

2535
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2536
01:59:30.130 --> 01:59:30.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tesco.</v>

2537
01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:31.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's right.</v>

2538
01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.620
<v Speaker 1>So in New Mexico I said Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico.</v>

2539
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:35.890
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2540
01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:37.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyhow,</v>

2541
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:38.120
<v Speaker 1>he say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2542
01:59:38.121 --> 01:59:39.980
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an impact crater.</v>

2543
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:41.870
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's an impact crater,</v>

2544
01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:44.250
<v Speaker 1>where is the media?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2545
01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It must be buried down here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there were miners.</v>

2546
01:59:47.450 --> 01:59:52.450
<v Speaker 1>They were there were there iron miners </v>
<v Speaker 1>who bought the land so they can get this</v>

2547
01:59:53.211 --> 01:59:58.211
<v Speaker 1>huge media that they were sure which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting down there that they could mind </v>

2548
01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:01.390
<v Speaker 1>for its natural resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could not find the meteor.</v>

2549
02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because it hit at high speed </v>

2550
02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>velocity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a high velocity impact,</v>

2551
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>which means it's collision energy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater than the binding energy even of </v>

2552
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:15.521
<v Speaker 1>the iron atoms itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And 90 percent of that thing vaporized </v>

2553
02:00:16.521 --> 02:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>on impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2554
02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No iron.</v>

2555
02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>More impressive even than I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2556
02:00:28.191 --> 02:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>The pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

2557
02:00:29.901 --> 02:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Low angle shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get the shadows of the rim.</v>

2558
02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's an Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in Arizona near winslow,</v>

2559
02:00:35.121 --> 02:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where would that be near?</v>

2560
02:00:36.951 --> 02:00:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that like if someone wanted to fly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see that?</v>

2561
02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

2562
02:00:41.421 --> 02:00:46.421
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the grand canyon then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive to this and it's a couple of </v>

2563
02:00:46.421 --> 02:00:46.490
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours.</v>

2564
02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's me.</v>

2565
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Your map was coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where's the grand canyon?</v>

2566
02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.790
<v Speaker 1>There's meteor crater</v>

2567
02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>and grand canyon because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also an Arizona.</v>

2568
02:00:58.950 --> 02:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Kenny has to park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can drive that.</v>

2569
02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>See that grand canyon to credit through </v>
<v Speaker 1>flagstaff.</v>

2570
02:01:03.821 --> 02:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not going to fly that.</v>

2571
02:01:05.831 --> 02:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>You'd just drive it and yelp reviews to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that highlighted.</v>

2572
02:01:10.110 --> 02:01:15.110
<v Speaker 1>It's got five star reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have all the stars?</v>

2573
02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it should have every goddamn </v>

2574
02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every three point nine people are so </v>

2575
02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>picky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big a deal.</v>

2576
02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I could dig a little bit better myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2577
02:01:25.570 --> 02:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this whole was this,</v>

2578
02:01:27.370 --> 02:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>this meteor crater was doug and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2579
02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>a few seconds this crater was made and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how many years ago was that?</v>

2580
02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Fifty thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not proximately nothing.</v>

2581
02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>So there's probably</v>

2582
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.980
<v Speaker 2>some form of humaN living here then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2583
02:01:42.981 --> 02:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Early humans.</v>

2584
02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they were in north </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

2585
02:01:46.791 --> 02:01:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say $40,000.</v>

2586
02:01:48.081 --> 02:01:53.081
<v Speaker 2>The most recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right when they crossed the bering </v>

2587
02:01:53.081 --> 02:01:55.871
<v Speaker 2>strait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they would adjust a ryan </v>

2588
02:01:55.871 --> 02:01:55.871
<v Speaker 2>knutson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2589
02:01:55.871 --> 02:01:59.180
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going back to that multiple times.</v>

2590
02:01:59.181 --> 02:02:00.710
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it freaky?</v>

2591
02:02:01.610 --> 02:02:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Freaky about it is you walk up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see it because the rim of the </v>

2592
02:02:06.610 --> 02:02:10.361
<v Speaker 2>crater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just looks like a ridge original </v>

2593
02:02:10.361 --> 02:02:10.361
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2594
02:02:10.361 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>the rim is raised above the plane of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>

2595
02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you press down it raises it</v>

2596
02:02:14.931 --> 02:02:19.931
<v Speaker 2>up a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just walk up to it and then you </v>

2597
02:02:19.931 --> 02:02:22.391
<v Speaker 2>come up to the ledge and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize what it is,</v>

2598
02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:26.390
<v Speaker 2>is nearly a mile diameter hole in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

2599
02:02:27.190 --> 02:02:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a stunning,</v>

2600
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:34.510
<v Speaker 2>stunning encounter with the forces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature and the fact that there's so many</v>

2601
02:02:34.761 --> 02:02:37.190
<v Speaker 2>of those particles just floating around </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

2602
02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:41.120
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How big was that when you think?</v>

2603
02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a bow.</v>

2604
02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2605
02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 20 yards across something.</v>

2606
02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:52.940
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>

2607
02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:54.840
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty yards.</v>

2608
02:02:54.841 --> 02:02:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be between 20 and 40 yards.</v>

2609
02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Twenty yards is the size of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right from that garage to that </v>

2610
02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>front door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2611
02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Make that kind of circle yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2612
02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2613
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:08.990
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2614
02:03:09.310 --> 02:03:14.310
<v Speaker 2>That's not the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of thing they can get </v>

2615
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.310
<v Speaker 2>close enough that you don't even see and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's too late.</v>

2616
02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:20.640
<v Speaker 2>That's not gonna make us extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will make a very bad day for a </v>

2617
02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:20.640
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2618
02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2619
02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:25.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>City's done and most likely the power </v>

2620
02:03:25.330 --> 02:03:27.761
<v Speaker 2>grids jack for a long time to right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>the detail now you have 10 more minutes.</v>

2621
02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:32.450
<v Speaker 2>So I had to get the stePhen hawkings </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote out for you.</v>

2622
02:03:32.730 --> 02:03:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm stephen hawkings was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2623
02:03:36.021 --> 02:03:41.021
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possIbility of alien life </v>

2624
02:03:41.021 --> 02:03:41.810
<v Speaker 2>discovering us and that it would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

2625
02:03:41.811 --> 02:03:46.811
<v Speaker 2>terrible thing if it did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what has happened to </v>

2626
02:03:46.811 --> 02:03:49.670
<v Speaker 2>other primitive lifeforms and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered them apparently have cultures</v>

2627
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:54.870
<v Speaker 2>and we have discovered them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you share that same opinion that if </v>

2628
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:57.671
<v Speaker 2>something did find us a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a strong opinion on that </v>

2629
02:03:57.671 --> 02:03:58.790
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have an analysis of his comment.</v>

2630
02:03:58.990 --> 02:04:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is worried about the possibility of </v>

2631
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:10.070
<v Speaker 2>aliens enslaving us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2632
02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:16.240
<v Speaker 2>based on the reality that we've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to ourselves.</v>

2633
02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just think about that.</v>

2634
02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:23.030
<v Speaker 2>His fear of aliens derived not from </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual knowledge of aliens,</v>

2635
02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:25.910
<v Speaker 2>but from an actual knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>

2636
02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:29.660
<v Speaker 2>AnytIme a more advanced civilization is </v>
<v Speaker 2>copano,</v>

2637
02:04:29.661 --> 02:04:31.680
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it technologically advanced civil,</v>

2638
02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:35.030
<v Speaker 2>it did not bode well for the less </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced civilization.</v>

2639
02:04:35.210 --> 02:04:37.740
<v Speaker 2>And that happened in north America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>south America,</v>

2640
02:04:37.890 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>north</v>

2641
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:39.660
<v Speaker 1>America with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with european,</v>

2642
02:04:39.661 --> 02:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>south american,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spanish,</v>

2643
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2644
02:04:42.810 --> 02:04:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

2645
02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>with the brits never boded well for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>less technologically advanced </v>

2646
02:04:50.221 --> 02:04:55.221
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His factual knowledge of that leads him </v>

2647
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:58.590
<v Speaker 1>to suspect that aliens would be exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>

2648
02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:01.950
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that skeptical.</v>

2649
02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think all life forms in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe have the basil,</v>

2650
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:16.310
<v Speaker 1>primal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent attitudes that we do as a </v>

2651
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:17.370
<v Speaker 1>species have not been given reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think so,</v>

2652
02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:22.580
<v Speaker 1>but don't you believe that things </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced because of competition and </v>

2653
02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:24.000
<v Speaker 1>competition forces things to be fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthless.</v>

2654
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It has been argued that if you colonize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you a civilization that colonizes the</v>

2655
02:05:29.041 --> 02:05:34.041
<v Speaker 1>galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a self limiting exercise.</v>

2656
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because here you've got you ready?</v>

2657
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:39.510
<v Speaker 1>We start here on earth is you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

2658
02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.940
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you take that plan.</v>

2659
02:05:41.941 --> 02:05:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I take this pLanet and now we have both </v>
<v Speaker 1>have offspring that are just like us and</v>

2660
02:05:46.381 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 1>we want more planets.</v>

2661
02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We reach a point where expansion is not </v>

2662
02:05:52.930 --> 02:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>possible because we are worrying with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to gain the territory that </v>

2663
02:05:58.801 --> 02:06:03.801
<v Speaker 1>each other has obtained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has been argued sociologically </v>

2664
02:06:04.710 --> 02:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>that the very act of wanting to colonize</v>
<v Speaker 1>is self limiting against successful </v>

2665
02:06:13.021 --> 02:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>colonization of the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because to colonize the galaxy,</v>

2666
02:06:15.741 --> 02:06:18.150
<v Speaker 1>it has to be done in an organized way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2667
02:06:18.210 --> 02:06:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you take this sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take this sector,</v>

2668
02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>but if I want territory and I want it </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and my kids want it now I want that </v>

2669
02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.610
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this other one.</v>

2670
02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:27.630
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it all.</v>

2671
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:32.950
<v Speaker 1>That kind of attitude breeds violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It breeds war,</v>

2672
02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:39.120
<v Speaker 1>intergalactic war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it may be that the very kind of </v>

2673
02:06:40.351 --> 02:06:45.351
<v Speaker 1>civilization that could peacefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonize a galaxy is not the kind of </v>

2674
02:06:46.261 --> 02:06:48.450
<v Speaker 1>civilization that would colonize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy at all.</v>

2675
02:06:48.490 --> 02:06:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's heavy.</v>

2676
02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Very heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the idea that.</v>

2677
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:56.610
<v Speaker 1>That's my first comment about steven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One he's got,</v>

2678
02:06:56.611 --> 02:07:01.611
<v Speaker 1>he made another comment about we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a multiplanetary species and check </v>

2679
02:07:01.611 --> 02:07:04.650
<v Speaker 1>ourselves against an asteroid rendering </v>
<v Speaker 1>one extinct.</v>

2680
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:07.470
<v Speaker 1>It makes a good headline and it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it makes sense,</v>

2681
02:07:07.890 --> 02:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not there with it yet.</v>

2682
02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Of course I want a backup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

2683
02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's be a multi planet species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>

2684
02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:16.480
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

2685
02:07:16.481 --> 02:07:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I would do it for different reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do because it's cool.</v>

2686
02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Not because we want to protect human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human species from extinction.</v>

2687
02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:26.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't be the reason to do it.</v>

2688
02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please list every reason why you think </v>

2689
02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>we go extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2690
02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:33.840
<v Speaker 1>we trash earth another and we can't live</v>
<v Speaker 1>off of it anymore.</v>

2691
02:07:34.010 --> 02:07:37.750
<v Speaker 1>An asteroid is coming through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some nanobots gone astray.</v>

2692
02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pandemic virus,</v>

2693
02:07:40.301 --> 02:07:41.200
<v Speaker 1>pandemics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2694
02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:47.100
<v Speaker 1>so it seems to me that if I want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplanetary species,</v>

2695
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:50.560
<v Speaker 1>mars would be the one because it's a 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour day.</v>

2696
02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 1>it's got seasons we would have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>terraform at first,</v>

2697
02:07:54.551 --> 02:07:57.100
<v Speaker 1>but then we all moved there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who to ship a billion people there.</v>

2698
02:07:57.101 --> 02:07:58.630
<v Speaker 1>HeRe's my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my point.</v>

2699
02:07:59.470 --> 02:08:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Would every takes to terraform mars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship a billion people there.</v>

2700
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be easier to deflect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid,</v>

2701
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:14.170
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes to terraform mars to </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it into earth.</v>

2702
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:18.730
<v Speaker 1>If you had the power of geoengineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>

2703
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:23.650
<v Speaker 1>then you have the power geoengineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn earth back into earth.</v>

2704
02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:25.360
<v Speaker 1>But there are occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2705
02:08:25.361 --> 02:08:26.650
<v Speaker 1>things that we miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2706
02:08:26.890 --> 02:08:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Because of the way that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2707
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:29.710
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you say,</v>

2708
02:08:29.711 --> 02:08:34.711
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes to geo engineer mars </v>

2709
02:08:34.711 --> 02:08:39.601
<v Speaker 1>and ship a billion people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be easier to create a </v>

2710
02:08:39.601 --> 02:08:43.561
<v Speaker 1>perfect viral serum that makes us immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all possible disease.</v>

2711
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:48.520
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that takes,</v>

2712
02:08:48.521 --> 02:08:53.521
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it possible that there some </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroids that we just will not see </v>

2713
02:08:53.521 --> 02:08:57.010
<v Speaker 1>until it's too late?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you put up with whatever that </v>

2714
02:08:57.010 --> 02:08:57.010
<v Speaker 1>takes.</v>

2715
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:59.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2716
02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:03.940
<v Speaker 1>but their time about being labels ship a</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people there.</v>

2717
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.530
<v Speaker 1>A bill w why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2718
02:09:05.531 --> 02:09:06.810
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have said,</v>

2719
02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:08.170
<v Speaker 1>what do you put 10 people there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2720
02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to split your species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2721
02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if an asteroid is coming that you </v>

2722
02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:18.571
<v Speaker 1>can't deflect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would surprise me if you could </v>

2723
02:09:18.571 --> 02:09:19.360
<v Speaker 1>ship a billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TomorroW's you just let them all die.</v>

2724
02:09:20.190 --> 02:09:25.190
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you plan to you to let all the </v>

2725
02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:25.190
<v Speaker 1>earth people die in the mars people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>

2726
02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:26.590
<v Speaker 1>just so you can save this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't save everybody.</v>

2727
02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not buying into the premise this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable car ology premise that you have to</v>

2728
02:09:33.371 --> 02:09:36.670
<v Speaker 1>save one to not save the other and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2729
02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:37.580
<v Speaker 1>cable cardiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youth.</v>

2730
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I see what you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cable car,</v>

2731
02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:42.100
<v Speaker 1>you know someone's in the tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let them go,</v>

2732
02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:42.800
<v Speaker 1>you let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've,</v>

2733
02:09:42.810 --> 02:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you've steered out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you actively kill two people </v>

2734
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>instead of passively killing one person.</v>

2735
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not buying into that premise for </v>

2736
02:09:51.930 --> 02:09:54.631
<v Speaker 1>this question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Simply saying that whatever it </v>

2737
02:09:54.631 --> 02:09:58.561
<v Speaker 1>takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be easier to put up some </v>

2738
02:09:58.561 --> 02:10:01.561
<v Speaker 1>kind of net that finds any asteroid that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly harm us and zaps them out</v>

2739
02:10:01.751 --> 02:10:05.110
<v Speaker 1>of the sky has got to be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the last question is,</v>

2740
02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:10.120
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that the reason why we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are never visited by extraterrestrials </v>

2741
02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:13.460
<v Speaker 1>is because the way civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the space debris one,</v>

2742
02:10:14.190 --> 02:10:17.170
<v Speaker 1>is it because the physicians they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>visited,</v>

2743
02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>they visited during comicon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cosplay costumes weren't as good as</v>

2744
02:10:26.531 --> 02:10:27.880
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

2745
02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:28.990
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2746
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 1>they've observed us and judged there no </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign of intelligent</v>

2747
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:34.970
<v Speaker 2>life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2748
02:10:34.971 --> 02:10:39.971
<v Speaker 2>but is there another possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations don't ever get to travel </v>

2749
02:10:39.981 --> 02:10:44.981
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what happens is as they advance </v>

2750
02:10:44.981 --> 02:10:45.440
<v Speaker 2>and as our technology advances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become,</v>

2751
02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:50.980
<v Speaker 2>instead of a biological entity seeking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to spread its genetics throughout the </v>

2752
02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:55.481
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become some sort of symbiotic </v>

2753
02:10:55.481 --> 02:10:58.211
<v Speaker 2>artificial life that as they create,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they advanced their technology and as</v>

2754
02:10:59.181 --> 02:11:04.181
<v Speaker 2>they continued to innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they reach a limitation in biology and </v>

2755
02:11:04.181 --> 02:11:08.441
<v Speaker 2>that eventually create artificial life </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sees no desire whatsoever to </v>

2756
02:11:08.441 --> 02:11:09.080
<v Speaker 2>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2757
02:11:09.081 --> 02:11:14.081
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say that's a great </v>

2758
02:11:14.081 --> 02:11:17.240
<v Speaker 2>philosophical question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that the day we create ai,</v>

2759
02:11:18.490 --> 02:11:23.490
<v Speaker 2>if the ai is everything we are except </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or not emotional,</v>

2760
02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:29.800
<v Speaker 2>then I have an urge to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe otherwise wouldn't have create </v>

2761
02:11:30.061 --> 02:11:35.061
<v Speaker 2>those doors like in monsters inc and </v>
<v Speaker 2>start going dimension to dementia </v>

2762
02:11:35.061 --> 02:11:37.490
<v Speaker 2>instead of fucking around with jetson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2763
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2764
02:11:38.001 --> 02:11:38.540
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2765
02:11:38.541 --> 02:11:38.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2766
02:11:38.931 --> 02:11:40.310
<v Speaker 2>They figured out the fourth dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2767
02:11:40.311 --> 02:11:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that be the best way to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>

2768
02:11:42.021 --> 02:11:47.021
<v Speaker 2>And then they figure it out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would figure out a way to travel </v>

2769
02:11:47.021 --> 02:11:49.271
<v Speaker 2>better than any way we could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if the fact that we want to travel </v>

2770
02:11:49.271 --> 02:11:50.630
<v Speaker 2>and we creating versions of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>called ai,</v>

2771
02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:54.230
<v Speaker 2>why would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to travel,</v>

2772
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:58.430
<v Speaker 2>but why would it be curious if ai fit is</v>
<v Speaker 2>us this logical,</v>

2773
02:11:58.630 --> 02:12:00.500
<v Speaker 2>then it's not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2774
02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.920
<v Speaker 2>if we create every neurosynaptic ma map </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2775
02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:13.360
<v Speaker 2>of our brain into silicon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a computer and recreate our </v>

2776
02:12:13.731 --> 02:12:16.580
<v Speaker 2>consciousness as humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human brain,</v>

2777
02:12:16.670 --> 02:12:21.670
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't the human brain version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ai would there be like an infinite </v>

2778
02:12:21.670 --> 02:12:22.880
<v Speaker 2>version of ai that ai could create </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself?</v>

2779
02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Because why would it limit itself to all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our emotions and sexual desires and </v>

2780
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:29.690
<v Speaker 2>jealousy and all the ridiculous things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are holding us back?</v>

2781
02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:31.070
<v Speaker 2>It could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

2782
02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:36.760
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not as fearsome of ai as others </v>

2783
02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:36.760
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2784
02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:36.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2785
02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:38.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2786
02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:43.570
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to make an ai looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being because the human form is </v>

2787
02:12:43.570 --> 02:12:44.420
<v Speaker 2>not the best or ideal forum for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2788
02:12:44.421 --> 02:12:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Did you see x makena?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2789
02:12:46.071 --> 02:12:48.200
<v Speaker 2>I love it because you love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is good.</v>

2790
02:12:48.201 --> 02:12:53.201
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good moments that he didn't love </v>

2791
02:12:53.201 --> 02:12:53.201
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2792
02:12:53.201 --> 02:12:53.201
<v Speaker 2>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

2793
02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to marry it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to marry it?</v>

2794
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2795
02:12:56.780 --> 02:13:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the first thing you bought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even that.</v>

2796
02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:03.620
<v Speaker 2>That's where the money for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2797
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2798
02:13:04.581 --> 02:13:06.140
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just saying it's one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite movies.</v>

2799
02:13:06.230 --> 02:13:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I want to marry the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just awesome movie.</v>

2800
02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:13.060
<v Speaker 2>So then marriage would no longer be </v>
<v Speaker 2>about sex or just to be about </v>

2801
02:13:13.060 --> 02:13:13.060
<v Speaker 2>reproduction because you just go to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>room with your sexual.</v>

2802
02:13:13.060 --> 02:13:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that that's one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that people figured out they </v>

2803
02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:17.500
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

2804
02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:19.280
<v Speaker 2>They get smart enough to symbiotically </v>
<v Speaker 2>attach themselves to.</v>

2805
02:13:19.281 --> 02:13:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Artificial intelligence was watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

2806
02:13:21.291 --> 02:13:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Family feud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the questions was,</v>

2807
02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:24.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>

2808
02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:32.310
<v Speaker 2>We asked 100 married women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could have a second husband for </v>

2809
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.340
<v Speaker 2>only one purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it be?</v>

2810
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Something like 70 percent of them said </v>
<v Speaker 2>just for sex.</v>

2811
02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

2812
02:13:39.010 --> 02:13:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Second husband for only one purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just for getting stuffed.</v>

2813
02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Just just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking wake up call for a lot </v>

2814
02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:49.620
<v Speaker 2>of guns out there guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's end on that.</v>
