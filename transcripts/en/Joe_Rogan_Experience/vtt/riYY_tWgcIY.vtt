00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you drawn?</v>

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I just write it down like a Pisco </v>
<v Speaker 1>chairs.</v>

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Burgo depot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How rude of me.</v>

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.323
<v Speaker 1>Ergo depot.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ergo depot is the company that provided </v>

6
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>us with Isa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love these chairs.</v>

7
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting paid for this ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't even an ad.</v>

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I just tell people with if you have back</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

9
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.353
<v Speaker 1>get a really good ergonomic chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes a fucking giant difference </v>

10
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:25.674
<v Speaker 1>because for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting in this thing when I do </v>

11
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>podcasts for three hours in a setting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my back doesn't bother me.</v>

12
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.403
<v Speaker 1>When I would use a regular office chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would sit in it for an hour and I'd </v>

13
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:34.464
<v Speaker 1>start getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started getting not adopt on the </v>

14
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:37.674
<v Speaker 1>podcast was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to grab like a ball and rubbed </v>

15
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>my back out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with these I think,</v>

16
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.314
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's better for my back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it acts when you force yourself </v>

17
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>to sit in a good posture.</v>

18
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like an exercise for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and the more you do it,</v>

19
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:51.444
<v Speaker 1>like I'm super conscious of it now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've always had super bad </v>

20
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.254
<v Speaker 1>posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to slump and then lean my head </v>

21
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>forward to terrible things to do during </v>
<v Speaker 1>our show.</v>

22
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>So bad it looks terrible tale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.753
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't do it when I would write to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would bind up on the top of my </v>

24
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.124
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I write for a few hours I'd be </v>

25
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:12.984
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

26
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but ever since I got these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

27
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>he's really good ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one of those blow up balls.</v>

28
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Just sit on those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.414
<v Speaker 1>Those workout balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find that it carries over to like </v>

30
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>when you sit somewhere else now you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>better posture.</v>

31
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.353
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>This is how I said no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to at least except when I'm.</v>

33
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.430

<v Speaker 1>I don't enjoy television like this.</v>

34
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>You got to slouch feet up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to be kicked back.</v>

35
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It isn't too so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

36

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.690

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lapdog backed out.</v>

125

<v Speaker 2>Backup dancer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

128
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 2>that's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

129
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 2>those relationships get super weird in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sixties,</v>

130
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>like once you get to this age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those relationships.</v>

131
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:05.730
<v Speaker 2>get real windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That woman,</v>

132
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 2>you're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No longer as hot.</v>

133
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Your life falls apart if that's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've banked on your whole life.</v>

134
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 2>You don't know If someone's 20 slash 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years younger than you.</v>

135
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that,</v>

136
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

137
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 2>if your entire thing is based on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look like,</v>

138
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.283
<v Speaker 2>if that's all you've really paid </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to and that's what you really </v>

139
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>rock is just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not your personality,</v>

140
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:26.864
<v Speaker 2>not not your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your enjoyment or your hobbies or </v>

141
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.394
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

142
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Not only does it taken away from you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've had it your whole life,</v>

143
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.183
<v Speaker 2>so you accustom to people approaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in communicating you with like </v>

144
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.893
<v Speaker 2>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like niceness and kindness and desire </v>

145
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 2>and men are just tripping over </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to be with you.</v>

146
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a magic potion that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>put up.</v>

147
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Not only does that go away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you become repulsive,</v>

148
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 2>As it all starts gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you.</v>

150
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 2>if you can't buy into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to extend your ears,</v>

151
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 2>then you start hitting your face cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>open.</v>

152
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 2>You start getting weird shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start getting your lips done.</v>

153
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.650
<v Speaker 2>You have a mouth that goes ear to ear to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep pulling them back into the mouth.</v>

154
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Keeps crawling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrendering your age.</v>

155
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:17.504
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's far better alternative to be the </v>

156
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.800
<v Speaker 2>dignified older woman who has never </v>
<v Speaker 2>faced fucked up older woman.</v>

157
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'll be answering some.</v>

158
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just a thing that we haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you've been,</v>

159
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.383
<v Speaker 2>I guess they've probably been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery on people's faces for like 20 </v>

160
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 2>years or 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

161
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 2>How long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago do you think they started?</v>

162
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I think probably in the between 30 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>48.</v>

163
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 2>And you're still an early adopter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

164
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.973
<v Speaker 2>What do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now the move is if you're going to </v>

165
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the mild,</v>

166
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.171
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

167
00:07:55.171 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 2>it's the type of the face lift or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nose job where you go,</v>

168
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something looks different,</v>

169
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 2>but you can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>

170
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a primo job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>When you see somebody and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ,</v>

172
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

173
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:08.421
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

174
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 2>that was Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>3,000</v>

175
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.580
<v Speaker 2>bcc or close to two years before we get.</v>

176
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust botox and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now they're like,</v>

177
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:18.494
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can inject botulism in your face </v>

178
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 2>with no repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>

179
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be.</v>

180
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 2>It can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be toxic.</v>

181
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:26.924
<v Speaker 2>It's going to melt your face off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna have a bunch of women with </v>

182
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 2>melted faces in a few years right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are mad at us because we don't know</v>

183
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I gotta I gotta assume.</v>

184
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 2>just assume that if you're paraLyzed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your fucking face to.</v>

185
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 2>That's weird to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk to people who can't do that.</v>

186
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little too shiny.</v>

187
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Something happens there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Waxy,</v>

188
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 2>shiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where's your head so shiny.</v>

189
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't move in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's shiny.</v>

190
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.073
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a time and a season to be the </v>

191
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 2>hot chick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I love.</v>

192
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I love Pamela Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

193
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.963
<v Speaker 2>we all did do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I know there was a time where </v>

194
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 2>she didn't surrender like you're the hot</v>
<v Speaker 2>chick for a minute and then you're,</v>

195
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.250
<v Speaker 2>you're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be no,</v>

196
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.860
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

197
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.413
<v Speaker 3>Logically that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that rush you get from all that </v>

198
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 3>attention as that you don't get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling anymore.</v>

199
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be really hard to deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

200
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.081
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

201
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

202
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:24.594
<v Speaker 3>how could you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's probably very few </v>

203
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 3>things in life that are like that where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't get back.</v>

204
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably similar to an aging,</v>

205
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 3>a rocker where you play out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:38.274
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're playing stadiums and people are </v>

207
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get that out of a ration of everyone</v>

208
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 3>coming to your shows and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huh?</v>

209
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't move the tickets anymore.</v>

210
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 3>or you just stopped touring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's gonna be an adjustment.</v>

211
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not just stadiums to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

212
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 3>I just don't do that anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too much of a rush.</v>

213
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

214
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Pick up heroin but see some aging rock </v>
<v Speaker 3>for some reason or another,</v>

215
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 3>they still pull it off like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like mick jagger can still pull it off,</v>

216
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that he can,</v>

217
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 3>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all it goes out and still does.</v>

218
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:11.634
<v Speaker 3>It puts on a great show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the reason that he does is </v>

219
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:17.280
<v Speaker 3>because you don't want to give up that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that rush,</v>

220
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 3>that feeling of playing the stadiums </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

221
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 3>And it's also probably fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fun,</v>

222
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:23.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do,</v>

223
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.783
<v Speaker 2>how is it not fun to be mick jagger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he works out like twice a </v>

224
00:10:30.131 --> 00:10:31.060
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

225
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Currently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a freak.</v>

226
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:33.404
<v Speaker 2>He's super disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does yoga and push ups and sit ups </v>

227
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:38.590
<v Speaker 2>and all kinds of crazy shit runs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

228
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he's 70 something years old </v>

229
00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:45.640
<v Speaker 2>as fuck as apparently he's super </v>
<v Speaker 2>dedicated to exercise.</v>

230
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Does you think keith has the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout regimen and 100 percent?</v>

231
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not doing heroin anymore.</v>

232
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't live that long.</v>

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting my leg removed next week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she was like,</v>

350
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

351
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my kidneys.</v>

352
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:09.920
<v Speaker 3>they already took out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My son is Afghanistan,</v>

353
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 3>he got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

354
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

355
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:16.580
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you like you want to see the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a dude this weekend who</v>

356
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:17.894
<v Speaker 3>was a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was telling us about a surgerY that </v>

357
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:23.774
<v Speaker 3>they had to perform on this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had to get her leg removed so they </v>

358
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.173
<v Speaker 3>had to cut through bone and meat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hack this woman's leg off for some </v>

359
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.430
<v Speaker 3>medical reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the reason was.</v>

360
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.250
<v Speaker 3>So they're in the middle of doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>procedure.</v>

361
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.113
<v Speaker 3>They remove her leg and he turns around </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the doctor that is with has the leg </v>

362
00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:47.291
<v Speaker 3>over his head like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

363
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 4>some crazy caveman joe in the operating </v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

364
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 4>Just remove this lady's leg over his </v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

365
00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 4>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to eat or something like it's</v>

366
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 4>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious,</v>

367
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 4>but super disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I guess,</v>

368
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just over it.</v>

369
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:12.190
<v Speaker 4>When You do it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at him joking around about it.</v>

370
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.890
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to make her leg like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

371
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 4>she's already witnessed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>witnessed surgery.</v>

372
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 4>You were going in and observe surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw my own surgery.</v>

373
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Surgery might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

374
00:18:23.411 --> 00:18:25.810
<v Speaker 1>my knee done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first knee operation.</v>

375
00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

376
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave me an epidural and I've </v>

377
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.513
<v Speaker 1>watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think was interesting early </v>

378
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:33.160
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

379
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.630
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to look at your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

380
00:18:34.631 --> 00:18:37.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

381
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.060
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the joints.</v>

382
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.390
<v Speaker 1>They seem like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're getting operated on,</v>

383
00:18:43.391 --> 00:18:45.850
<v Speaker 1>they're fixing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joint seemed like a,</v>

384
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.610
<v Speaker 1>like a hinge instead of like a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

385
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.560
<v Speaker 1>like you see it as um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:54.490
<v Speaker 1>you see what would a joint actually is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see the tissue in there because</v>

387
00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:56.410
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a complicated procedure.</v>

388
00:18:56.411 --> 00:18:57.244
<v Speaker 1>IT's called a patella tendon graft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They open up your knee like a fish and </v>

389
00:19:00.371 --> 00:19:02.500
<v Speaker 1>then they take a chunk of your patella </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendon,</v>

390
00:19:02.501 --> 00:19:05.410
<v Speaker 1>which is your big thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one that's on the front,</v>

391
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.500
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty thick and you don't need all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

392
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.393
<v Speaker 1>So they take like a third of it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they open you up and then they screw it </v>

393
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.820
<v Speaker 1>into the bone and the top and screwed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the bone and the bottom.</v>

394
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.480
<v Speaker 1>And then they stitch it all up and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so weird to watch them do that.</v>

395
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And it was so much better after that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

396
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.040
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fucked before the surgery.</v>

397
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:24.830
<v Speaker 1>It was too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was</v>

398
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.000
<v Speaker 4>wobbly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>

399
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.863
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're watching and they're cutting </v>

400
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 4>into you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings of when I was birthing our son,</v>

401
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.300
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want a mirror to see his head?</v>

402
00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:36.220
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

403
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.050
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck no.</v>

404
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.710
<v Speaker 4>So I mean that's pretty amazed that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were able to look at</v>

405
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.430
<v Speaker 1>your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to see it.</v>

406
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping I was never going to do </v>

407
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:48.311
<v Speaker 1>this again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

408
00:19:48.311 --> 00:19:49.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to do this,</v>

409
00:19:49.151 --> 00:19:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I observed</v>

410
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.600
<v Speaker 3>the food day of surgery an entire day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I saw eight operations when I was a</v>

411
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:57.883
<v Speaker 3>freshman in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the illusion that I would be a </v>

412
00:19:59.301 --> 00:20:00.134
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>

413
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.570
<v Speaker 4>I want to be a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then my uncle was</v>

414
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:06.463
<v Speaker 3>dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He set me up at the mayo clinic in </v>

415
00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:12.220
<v Speaker 3>jacksonville and so I meet this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty big kid.</v>

416
00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:13.740
<v Speaker 3>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what college do you go to?</v>

417
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.830
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

418
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm at school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And the first one we see is a woman who </v>

<v Speaker 3>he comes over to me and I'm with my dad,</v>

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Trash in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five minutes left on this video.</v>

488
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to throw up.</v>

495
00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:10.544
<v Speaker 2>I'm not criticizing or technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder why you have to take a </v>

496
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:17.570
<v Speaker 2>chunk out of the skin and less instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like making like a little hatch.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like you remember those old schools?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pajamas scape.</v>

<v Speaker 2>spots too.</v>

507
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.860
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

508
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.590
<v Speaker 2>go weird spots are going to top your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head and shit.</v>

509
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Like they over grow and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

510
00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

511
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Membrane the membrane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This membrane,</v>

512
00:25:02.671 --> 00:25:03.504
<v Speaker 2>the membrane in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A membranous sack or cab cavity of </v>

513
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 2>abnormal character containing fluid at </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough protective capsule.</v>

514
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.420
<v Speaker 2>And closing the larva of parasitic worm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

515
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.693
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a cavity containing fluid </v>

516
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 2>and they use the word fluid super </v>
<v Speaker 2>loosely.</v>

517
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Fluid pus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fluid.</v>

518
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:35.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whipped cream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pissy nastiness.</v>

519
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.090
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

520
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.530
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on vagina too.</v>

521
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:44.440
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine this ladies,</v>

522
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.573
<v Speaker 2>I still remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was her badge on the outer part so </v>

523
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:51.260
<v Speaker 2>everybody could see or inside it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>

524
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:52.094
<v Speaker 2>But then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

525
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.193
<v Speaker 2>they had her in some way where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could push back and you could see it </v>

526
00:25:56.241 --> 00:25:57.420
<v Speaker 2>coming out of the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:25:57.421 --> 00:26:02.421
<v Speaker 2>coming like on the wall in a speculum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they opened her up.</v>

528
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it really had fluid though.</v>

529
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I do remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like this.</v>

530
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It really was like a stream coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate.</v>

531
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.573
<v Speaker 2>I hate to be disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you think it made her pussy </v>

532
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:16.070
<v Speaker 2>tighter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

533
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:16.983
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how you had it in your </v>

534
00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:23.630
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would be sure.</v>

535
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Tough to swallow.</v>

536
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So imagine if you got it in your box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's how they fit.</v>

00:31:08.121 --> 00:31:08.954
<v Speaker 3>my youtube page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what it's about is that there's a </v>

616
00:31:10.521 --> 00:31:11.354
<v Speaker 3>real story about two guys who shot each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other in an argument over james brown's </v>

617
00:31:16.821 --> 00:31:18.480
<v Speaker 3>height.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

618
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we made a short about it.</v>

619
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.690
<v Speaker 3>This is all about James Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

620
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:28.820
<v Speaker 3>how did I not know about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it happened in Alabama and.</v>

621
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:29.863
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here it is.</v>

622
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

623
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.520
<v Speaker 3>He just pulled it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

624
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.593
<v Speaker 3>but based on a real story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two guys got in an argument about how </v>

625
00:31:36.531 --> 00:31:40.430
<v Speaker 3>tall he is and basically one guy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

626
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>james brown's five,</v>

627
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.680
<v Speaker 3>five or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that dude,</v>

628
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.440
<v Speaker 3>he's six feet motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they got,</v>

629
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.570
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got so heated,</v>

630
00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:52.200
<v Speaker 2>they shot each other over his height.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's called fiverr.</v>

631
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:57.380
<v Speaker 3>It's because of the discrepancy in area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a real story that,</v>

632
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.900
<v Speaker 3>that these guys were friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like good friends.</v>

633
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.140
<v Speaker 3>People get mad about nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

634
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.810
<v Speaker 2>People get mad about shit that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make any sense.</v>

635
00:32:06.811 --> 00:32:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Wind up killing each other because </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants it back down.</v>

636
00:32:08.791 --> 00:32:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Then escalates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be right.</v>

637
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

638
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm more concerned about pcp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did it go?</v>

639
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.383
<v Speaker 2>Because remember there was a lot of cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the eighties that happened </v>

640
00:32:17.131 --> 00:32:17.964
<v Speaker 2>because of angel dust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People lifted cars and we're where it's </v>

641
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:25.983
<v Speaker 2>pcp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My old boxing coach had his finger </v>

642
00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:28.254
<v Speaker 2>bitten off any of our pieces of really </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting off on pcp and he had it </v>

643
00:32:34.351 --> 00:32:36.640
<v Speaker 2>replaced with his toe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had his,</v>

644
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 2>his not as big toe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as two biggest</v>

645
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.770
<v Speaker 3>toe put in right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you being us.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Joe lake.</v>

647
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's my boxing coach.</v>

648
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 3>When I was kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had his finger permanently bent so he</v>

649
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:54.164
<v Speaker 3>could throw a right hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a southpaw and a very good right </v>

650
00:32:56.031 --> 00:32:57.140
<v Speaker 3>hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to give it up.</v>

651
00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.060
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

652
00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.440
<v Speaker 3>when you would shake his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shake it like that.</v>

653
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 3>He has like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little baby finger.</v>

654
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

655
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.800
<v Speaker 3>That was the toe that was a toe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's toe,</v>

656
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.980
<v Speaker 3>but now it's his index finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had his toe.</v>

657
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>his foot only.</v>

659
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 3>It was four toes as a toe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big toe.</v>

660
00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 3>And then three handlers and somebody hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>it off and say,</v>

661
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.310
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that reminds me,</v>

662
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.483

<v Speaker 3>with diaz for three days and I'll tell </v>

665
00:33:38.571 --> 00:33:39.404
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we're leaving the shoreline </v>

666
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 3>amphitheater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did the odd ball tour.</v>

667
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.230
<v Speaker 3>So we're leaving this shoreline </v>
<v Speaker 3>amphitheater.</v>

668
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.890
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was like close to 10,000</v>

670
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:52.100
<v Speaker 3>people we get in the shuttle because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's intermission and joey and I were</v>

671
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Speaker 3>before intermission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we tell the driver we want to go back</v>

672
00:33:55.341 --> 00:33:56.174
<v Speaker 3>to the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still another half of show to </v>

<v Speaker 3>and the driver.</v>

675
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.460
<v Speaker 3>And we get in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no music on.</v>

676
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking and we just hit one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those moments.</v>

677
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:08.144
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're on a highway at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night and you kind of hit that thing </v>

678
00:34:10.851 --> 00:34:11.684
<v Speaker 3>where it's like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone stopped talking for a minute </v>

679
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.443
<v Speaker 3>and you're looking out the window and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can feel like I'm just kind of </v>

680
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:18.404
<v Speaker 3>staring off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's talkinG and then after like 15 </v>

681
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:23.270
<v Speaker 3>seconds of silence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>julia goes,</v>

683
00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.720

<v Speaker 3>tenderloin in 1979,</v>

684
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.930

<v Speaker 3>widened.</v>

686
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:36.350
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>People just stepped over him and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>two guys stab each other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

812
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm one of those people,</v>

814
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like when I forced myself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up in the morning,</v>

815
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I get a better feeling about the day.</v>

879
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.150
<v Speaker 1>But just for just for you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

880
00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.920
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have as much hunger,</v>

881
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.930
<v Speaker 1>like in between meals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that.</v>

882
00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm a month into it and really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

883
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm down almost 18 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

884
00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically have,</v>

885
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 1>have felt that way where I'm not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like feeling that satisfaction more.</v>

886
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm also eating overall less food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

887
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to eat just a more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher volume of food,</v>

888
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:29.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every meal was much bigger than it </v>

889
00:43:30.951 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 1>was because that fat satisfies you.</v>

890
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much quicker.</v>

891
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:35.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll definitely satisfies you longer </v>

892
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.880
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just like the craving for carbs.</v>

893
00:43:40.881 --> 00:43:41.714
<v Speaker 1>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got off of it when I went on this </v>

894
00:43:43.341 --> 00:43:44.174
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on a trip and I was with these </v>

895
00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:51.230
<v Speaker 1>guys camping for six days and there just</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>

896
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.333
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just so much food that </v>

897
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:56.540
<v Speaker 1>wasn't key to genic yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all we had was that food.</v>

898
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:57.763
<v Speaker 1>So I got off it and the first thing I </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed is like how hungry would get in </v>

899
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:03.680
<v Speaker 1>between meals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar spikes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got to eat.</v>

902
00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

903
00:44:07.341 --> 00:44:08.174
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that when I'm on the fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>based diet and as soon as I got on the </v>

904
00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 1>fat based diet again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went away.</v>

905

<v Speaker 1>My son,</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

928
00:45:04.371 --> 00:45:06.710
<v Speaker 1>when you're first doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some people it hits him like really</v>

929
00:45:06.711 --> 00:45:08.390
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just really irritable.</v>

930
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really irritable.</v>

931
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.740
<v Speaker 3>You're jonesing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

932
00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.180
<v Speaker 3>I wanted it bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

933
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So bad.</v>

934
00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.730
<v Speaker 3>And you forget all the stuff that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar in it.</v>

935
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.200
<v Speaker 3>That's everything for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it.</v>

936
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Actually the cool other cool part about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it besides the health benefits me,</v>

937
00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I've read,</v>

938
00:45:26.411 --> 00:45:28.630
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all their cholesterol goes down,</v>

939
00:45:28.631 --> 00:45:29.464
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good exercise in discipline and </v>

940
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:38.620
<v Speaker 3>in being focused and mindful in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's the cool part.</v>

941
00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.370
<v Speaker 3>If you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

942
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a super disciplined person about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things,</v>

943
00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:43.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm disciplined about work,</v>

944
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.300
<v Speaker 3>but like I don't find myself to be super</v>
<v Speaker 3>disciplined and all sudden you're going,</v>

945
00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.250
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to look at what's in this.</v>

946
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.870
<v Speaker 3>And then you're starting to catch </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

947
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.823
<v Speaker 3>It makes you more focused overall </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're focused on trying to do </v>

948
00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.430
<v Speaker 3>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I want to eliminate sugar,</v>

949
00:46:00.431 --> 00:46:03.050
<v Speaker 3>which he secretly in everything you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

950
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.720
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of addictions,</v>

951
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:05.650
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

952
00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:06.483
<v Speaker 1>they're all almost the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same pattern and that pattern </v>

953
00:46:10.331 --> 00:46:13.390
<v Speaker 1>is you're just doing something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even believe you're doing it while</v>

954
00:46:13.391 --> 00:46:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm betting all on black,</v>

955
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:17.843
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's gambling or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sex or whether it's drugs or </v>

956
00:46:21.521 --> 00:46:22.840
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

957
00:46:22.841 --> 00:46:25.150
<v Speaker 1>people are addicted to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different weird shit.</v>

958
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:26.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And food is a big one.</v>

959
00:46:26.771 --> 00:46:27.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

960
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 1>It's kinda the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just caught up in it.</v>

961
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.270
<v Speaker 4>And then after you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

962
00:46:33.271 --> 00:46:37.200
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did I do before I had a baby?</v>

963
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:38.034
<v Speaker 4>I had so much free time and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize how much of that time I just </v>

964
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:46.041
<v Speaker 4>spent eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just snacking on shit that I did not.</v>

965
00:46:47.521 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 4>And now I don't have the time to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

966
00:46:49.531 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 4>you lose the baby weight gradually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't an effort because it's,</v>

967
00:46:52.741 --> 00:46:53.574
<v Speaker 4>I don't have fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to graze out of boredom or </v>

968
00:46:56.011 --> 00:46:58.680
<v Speaker 4>depression or on the road or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

969
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need to eat half the shit.</v>

970
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't need you to have the shit I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating.</v>

971
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 4>It's simple mouth poser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's when you got to look at it.</v>

972
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.973
<v Speaker 1>There's two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two different things going on at the </v>

973
00:47:09.051 --> 00:47:10.040
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

974
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:10.874
<v Speaker 1>there's a simple mouth pleasure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you eat lasagna or something </v>

975
00:47:14.061 --> 00:47:14.894
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1064
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:52.040
<v Speaker 4>These loaves of bread while there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>place here in woodland hills.</v>

1065
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:54.920
<v Speaker 4>It's called the german cold cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on topanga canyon.</v>

1066
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:57.950
<v Speaker 4>I grew up going there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tiny little german place and it's</v>

1067
00:51:57.951 --> 00:52:00.380
<v Speaker 4>rye with no seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then there's another one,</v>

1068
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.890
<v Speaker 4>a burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another german slash hungarian.</v>

1069
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 4>They got all the treats and my dad is he</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1070
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:10.730
<v Speaker 4>we have cockroach dna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're eastern blockers.</v>

1071
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.193
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have relatives who one guy drives a </v>

1072
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:15.590
<v Speaker 4>cab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 years old,</v>

1073
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:18.890
<v Speaker 4>never exercised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drinks a liter of vodka every day.</v>

1074
00:52:18.891 --> 00:52:19.724
<v Speaker 4>Small like it's just our family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that was because she never </v>

1075
00:52:22.551 --> 00:52:23.384
<v Speaker 4>gets sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'll get like a fucking flew and go </v>

1076
00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:30.070
<v Speaker 4>to the hospital and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sniffs for a couple of days.</v>

1077
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.590
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet your people survive strong.</v>

1078
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 4>Like bull zilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about like,</v>

1079
00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.753
<v Speaker 4>like eastern block people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the hardiest people will you </v>

1080
00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.430
<v Speaker 4>think like hardy white system most </v>
<v Speaker 4>tender,</v>

1081
00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.400
<v Speaker 4>the sweetest and the most kind and </v>
<v Speaker 4>affectionate pupil.</v>

1082
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.960
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing I don't like though is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that my parents are just so cold.</v>

1083
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:51.853
<v Speaker 4>Like my step mom used to get offended </v>
<v Speaker 4>when waiters would come to the table at </v>

1084
00:52:55.491 --> 00:52:57.320
<v Speaker 4>a restaurant and be like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You folks like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1087
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.430
<v Speaker 4>they think that it's weakness to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>friendly.</v>

1088
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.811
<v Speaker 4>Hi,</v>

<v Speaker 4>People went through too much chaos,</v>

1091
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.370
<v Speaker 4>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much trauma.</v>

1092
00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.380
<v Speaker 4>How to be hard for a lot of cold stares.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my step,</v>

1093
00:53:17.751 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 4>my step mom he didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or do you think that's.</v>

1094
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:24.530
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think russians admire putin?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because.</v>

1095
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 4>But do think they admire him</v>

<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1097
00:53:27.331 --> 00:53:28.164
<v Speaker 1>they're scared.</v>

1098
00:53:30.301 --> 00:53:31.134
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually admire that hard ass </v>

<v Speaker 1>companies and puts them in jail.</v>

1106
00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to be scared that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been scared for so many leaders.</v>

1107
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:02.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1112
00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1113
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:11.994
<v Speaker 1>I'm prudent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did a suicide assassination </v>

1114
00:54:13.411 --> 00:54:14.244
<v Speaker 1>attempt on putin and the way they did it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they were driving on the opposite </v>

1115
00:54:16.831 --> 00:54:19.950
<v Speaker 1>side of the highway and they drove head </v>
<v Speaker 1>on into his car.</v>

1116
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on one side.</v>

1117
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.273
<v Speaker 1>Then on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had a median and this guy </v>

1118
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:30.090
<v Speaker 1>drives in the center of the median,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like before the putin's car comes.</v>

1119
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And when he sees putin's car turns right</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

1120
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:35.610
<v Speaker 1>So he knew it was that car and putin </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't in the car,</v>

1121
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:36.623
<v Speaker 1>but his driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his driver was and his driver was </v>

1122
00:54:38.371 --> 00:54:39.690
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is there a video of this was a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos from a couple of different </v>

1125
00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:45.564
<v Speaker 1>angles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy because dashboard cameras </v>

1126
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:48.540
<v Speaker 1>they have over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1127
00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:48.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1128
00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.570
<v Speaker 1>This is like a street cameras so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the cars.</v>

1129
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 1>You could see the cars and they see them</v>
<v Speaker 1>slamming each other.</v>

1130
00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're going like 80 miles an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

1131
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.880
<v Speaker 1>both sides and is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1135
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:05.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1136
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because putting wasn't in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>

1137
00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they thought he was in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that maybe they had a heads up and</v>

1138
00:55:12.241 --> 00:55:13.500
<v Speaker 1>they knew something was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1139
00:55:13.501 --> 00:55:14.820
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1140
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they put them in a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

1141
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:18.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a bunch of different cars,</v>

1142
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:21.510
<v Speaker 1>but you could see here here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll it back and he watched this.</v>

1143
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy did that on purpose.</v>

1144
00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Roll it back again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jamie,</v>

1145
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.460
<v Speaker 1>why does that thing keeps shutting off </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with the connector.</v>

1146
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that?</v>

1147
00:55:31.241 --> 00:55:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1148
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:35.640
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple different angles of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1149
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 1>but the guy leg literally just drove </v>
<v Speaker 1>right into the other lane,</v>

1150
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.480
<v Speaker 1>so that was new for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1151
00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously to target that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1152
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:45.743
<v Speaker 1>New for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To target it and knew for sure he was </v>

1153
00:55:47.071 --> 00:55:48.950
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

1154
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.033
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1156
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.800

1246
01:00:32.931 --> 01:00:33.764
<v Speaker 1>like he drew pictures of like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people looked like when they would do </v>

1247
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>certain jobs and once you couldn't do </v>

01:00:44.151 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>you fuck up or let's say you escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a north korean citizen,</v>

1251
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:48.764
<v Speaker 1>you escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go round up your family and </v>

1252
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:53.803
<v Speaker 1>put them in jail and they have a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation policy there so that your </v>

1253
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 1>kids and their kids will live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>labor camps.</v>

1254
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during communism,</v>

1255
01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:07.754
<v Speaker 1>my dad said that they would encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>the children at school to rat out their </v>

1256
01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>parents if they heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hear your parents saying anything</v>

1257
01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:15.344
<v Speaker 1>against the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to write your parents </v>

1258
01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>out and that kids would end up doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and then they come to your door and</v>

1259
01:01:21.201 --> 01:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that thing is called escape from</v>

1260
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:24.704
<v Speaker 1>camp 19 or escape from camp 14 that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy got free and then he was still </v>

1261
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:31.424
<v Speaker 1>living as though he was in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He preferred I'm sleeping on the floor </v>

1262
01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>because he slept on the floor for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years,</v>

1263
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he couldn't adapt.</v>

1264
01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.053
<v Speaker 1>He just couldn't escape from something </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out about him later that he had </v>

1265
01:01:47.931 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>made up some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that his whole story was made up,</v>

1266
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.103
<v Speaker 1>but he fabricated something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that if you lived in a </v>

1267
01:01:55.251 --> 01:01:58.100
<v Speaker 1>prison camp your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some serious mental illness.</v>

1268
01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:58.993
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we could think that this </v>

1269
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>guy is going to be saying that we hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up to some sort of standard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a few years back.</v>

1282
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Early two thousands for a fight at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball game.</v>

1283
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.773
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1284
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>dude up and then years later he was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>mtv and the dude saw him on tv and heard</v>

1285
01:02:45.391 --> 01:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>about that and that's how he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested.</v>

1286
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.860
<v Speaker 1>He got arrested and then he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did prison time.</v>

1287
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I did three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1288
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking hilarious by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it stories are hilarious.</v>

01:02:56.221 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>He's just a funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny dude.</v>

1290
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was talking about prison,</v>

1291
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:00.953
<v Speaker 1>it got me thinking like he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how much people make and he was </v>

1292
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:06.810
<v Speaker 1>talking like thirty eight cents an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1293
01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not one of them.</v>

1294
01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:12.650
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that he said something</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously low and then I'm like,</v>

1295
01:03:12.841 --> 01:03:15.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that not slavery?</v>

1296
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:16.643
<v Speaker 1>Like how were You like you not only are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you putting someone in jail where they </v>

1297
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>can't go anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are forcing them to work at this</v>

1298
01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:27.600
<v Speaker 1>insanely low rate that no one would ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked for.</v>

1299
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:28.523
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at the definition of </v>

1300
01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>

1301
01:03:30.901 --> 01:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery ended in 18,</v>

1302
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:35.400
<v Speaker 1>65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How has slavery done in 18,</v>

1303
01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 1>65 when you have men literally in chain </v>
<v Speaker 1>gangs breaking,</v>

1304
01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:41.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we wrote it down on paper,</v>

1305
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:45.030
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this guy robbed a purse or whatever</v>

1306
01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:46.710
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put those people in.</v>

1307
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1308
01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:53.940

<v Speaker 1>You can't force someone to break rocks.</v>

1309
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:54.873
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't force them to work for thirty </v>

1310
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>cents an hour,</v>

1311
01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

1312
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the last places that still,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of the whole pronoun thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1448

<v Speaker 2>crowder.</v>

1457

<v Speaker 2>preferred gender pronouns are and they </v>

1460
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.340
<v Speaker 2>just the looks they give him like he </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to like grown adults,</v>

1461
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:36.653

<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is that's got a beard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

1489
01:12:51.911 --> 01:12:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I know it doesn't have a preferred </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender pronoun.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're going to get to.</v>

1491
01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of be whatever you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Which is fine.</v>

1494
01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's funny that some people</v>

1495
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:09.050
<v Speaker 2>are saying that you should see this </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual and lead with like,</v>

1496
01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.580
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like it's rude for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assume,</v>

1497
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:17.730
<v Speaker 2>which I think is absurd that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do that.</v>

1498
01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:18.564
<v Speaker 2>It's rude to assume like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to dictate a different </v>

1499
01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:21.954
<v Speaker 2>pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that should be on you like a </v>

1500
01:13:24.301 --> 01:13:27.480
<v Speaker 2>status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you should just show people or some</v>

1501
01:13:27.481 --> 01:13:28.314
<v Speaker 2>people do have these little stickers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they put on my preferred gender </v>

1502
01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:32.760
<v Speaker 2>pronoun is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

1503
01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a radio lab and this is one of my</v>

1504
01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:37.530
<v Speaker 2>all time favorite ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a radio,</v>

1505
01:13:37.531 --> 01:13:38.364
<v Speaker 2>a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take it so seriously because it's </v>

1506
01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:43.800
<v Speaker 2>radio lab and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy on it who's clearly out of</v>

1507
01:13:43.801 --> 01:13:44.634
<v Speaker 2>his fucking mind and he goes back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth between male and female during </v>

1508
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:53.340
<v Speaker 2>switches while he's talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I just switched.</v>

1509
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:55.800
<v Speaker 2>I just switched from the man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're like,</v>

1510
01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:56.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1511
01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:01.460
<v Speaker 2>When do you get to be a dragon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get to read minds in the future?</v>

1512
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Then we're supposed to respect this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to because it's,</v>

1513
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.180
<v Speaker 2>it has to do with gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if this guy was telling you about his</v>

1514
01:14:09.181 --> 01:14:10.650
<v Speaker 2>past lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1515
01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>as a roman gladiator</v>

1516
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>or if he was telling you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future when the star ships land,</v>

1517
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 1>you would think that he's a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1518
01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1519
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 1>But right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you talk about gender,</v>

1520
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.320
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

1521
01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:24.533
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to like give people the </v>

1522
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:27.904
<v Speaker 1>benefit of all doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even if you think you're switching </v>

1523
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:33.560
<v Speaker 1>gender back and forth as you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that you're,</v>

1524
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:35.620
<v Speaker 1>your genders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of a seesaw,</v>

1525
01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you're on the precipice and you can just</v>
<v Speaker 1>go left or right to left or right.</v>

1526
01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And it is close minded asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just decide you don't understand.</v>

1527
01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we different a lot of the time?</v>

1528
01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:48.993
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I be that difference be </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed in gender like you the other </v>

1529
01:14:51.611 --> 01:14:53.230
<v Speaker 1>day when you were cranky because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get your sugar.</v>

1530
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1531
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1532
01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:59.890
<v Speaker 1>That's be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a dIfferent personality trait.</v>

1533
01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.753
<v Speaker 1>You fell into this bitchy but doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that feeling like going back to </v>

1534
01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:10.690
<v Speaker 1>like sexist and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Join up gender folk phobic.</v>

1535
01:15:10.691 --> 01:15:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm looking forward,</v>

1536
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.313
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to ignoring so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>emails that are going to come into my </v>

1537
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:20.740
<v Speaker 1>inbox about this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people get mad.</v>

1538
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're going to get so mad.</v>

1539
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.550
<v Speaker 1>My point is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this,</v>

1540
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 1>like if you're feeling particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>lovie dovie,</v>

1541
01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:31.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your patent kittens and you're.</v>

1542
01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:34.180
<v Speaker 1>You're putting your daughter's hair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ponytails.</v>

1543
01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:35.723
<v Speaker 1>You're more feminine feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you switch genders at that </v>

1544
01:15:38.861 --> 01:15:39.700
<v Speaker 1>moment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1545
01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:44.710
<v Speaker 1>You still specifically this guy wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back and forth to being recognized</v>

1546
01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:47.400
<v Speaker 1>as a man and then recommend the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the conversation.</v>

1547
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Then as he goes back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he becomes a totally different person.</v>

1548
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:51.743
<v Speaker 1>Like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's not going to tolerate any </v>

1549
01:15:53.171 --> 01:15:54.940
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think usually in the military too,</v>

1550
01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:55.774
<v Speaker 1>it was like it was like there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdness to the story and he's under </v>

1551
01:15:58.301 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the care of a psychiatrist though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1552
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:00.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1553
01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:00.660
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1554
01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.280
<v Speaker 1>He's wondering around getting government</v>
<v Speaker 1>grants and.</v>

1555
01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1556
01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just.</v>

1557
01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.053
<v Speaker 1>You never go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone goes back and forth and </v>

1558
01:16:13.781 --> 01:16:17.170
<v Speaker 1>pretends to be hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungarian now.</v>

1559
01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:17.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1560
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:18.623
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm from Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel today I'm now I'm hungarian </v>

1561
01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:21.190
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1562
01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:22.670
<v Speaker 6>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm identifying that way,</v>

1563
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.370
<v Speaker 6>but that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like here's the thing.</v>

1564
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.650
<v Speaker 6>If you want to identify throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 6>day,</v>

1565
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.610
<v Speaker 6>sometimes I am more masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I'm at the comedy store performing,</v>

1566
01:16:30.611 --> 01:16:33.970
<v Speaker 6>I am very alpha male.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm very macho,</v>

1567
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:34.923
<v Speaker 6>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have to demand that people know what </v>

1568
01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:40.840
<v Speaker 6>to call me at every given moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a little unrealistic.</v>

1569
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:43.110
<v Speaker 6>What's a nEw thing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really weird.</v>

1570
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.103
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's so presumptuous and </v>
<v Speaker 6>narcissistic that you should know what </v>

1571
01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:48.154
<v Speaker 6>to call it.</v>

1572
01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:53.620
<v Speaker 1>You at least say like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>address me as her shoe.</v>

1573
01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:54.683
<v Speaker 1>Different names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks and he just snatched it out of </v>

1574
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:57.740
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depending on who I'm.</v>

1575
01:16:57.790 --> 01:17:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I might be mis-gendering or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how he here or she hears it</v>

1576
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.930
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you did point,</v>

1577
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.570
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a conversation with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1578
01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.180
<v Speaker 1>would you like feel like that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect?</v>

1579
01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Like something that you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1580
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:13.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll respect your wishes.</v>

1581
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not changing your gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta to pick one?</v>

1582
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

1583
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:22.070
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a girl.</v>

1584
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any problem with that,</v>

1585
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.040
<v Speaker 2>but you can't go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1586
01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:28.760
<v Speaker 2>or I can't talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too much work.</v>

1587
01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:33.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too much fucking work.</v>

1588
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And if you're an adult that's got a full</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1589
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:40.300
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck a room In your head for </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] every second changing.</v>

1590
01:17:41.010 --> 01:17:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's somebody else's issue,</v>

1591
01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about yourself?</v>

1592
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:46.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any.</v>

1593
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.053
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a room to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you because you're concentrating on </v>

1594
01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:50.864
<v Speaker 2>yourself so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want people to change how they </v>

1595
01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:53.534
<v Speaker 2>address you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just change how you feel </v>

1596
01:17:55.851 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 2>occasionally and not have a new fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>name that someones 3:00</v>

1597
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:00.914
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon.</v>

1598
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm bob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did we have to label it every moment</v>

1599
01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:06.460
<v Speaker 2>of every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1600
01:18:06.461 --> 01:18:07.294
<v Speaker 2>is he super self indulgent thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're getting out of this </v>

1601
01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:11.810
<v Speaker 2>and that's what like the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1602
01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being labeled as insensitive.</v>

1603
01:18:14.331 --> 01:18:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Like that's kind of the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is like,</v>

1604
01:18:16.341 --> 01:18:17.174
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be insensitive of </v>

1605
01:18:18.021 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This deserves a fair amount of mockery,</v>

1606
01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:23.973
<v Speaker 2>afraid to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in part because we're going to get </v>

1607
01:18:25.431 --> 01:18:26.264
<v Speaker 2>shamed on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going to call us phobic of </v>

1608
01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:30.590
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you say something remotely,</v>

1609
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:33.080
<v Speaker 2>your gender unpolitically correct or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1610
01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:33.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1611
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:38.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just not happy and they might not be</v>

1612
01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:38.834
<v Speaker 2>happy with the gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might not be happy with the way </v>

1613
01:18:40.431 --> 01:18:41.264
<v Speaker 2>they look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might not be happy with how old </v>

1614
01:18:42.501 --> 01:18:43.334
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might not be happy with a bunch of </v>

1615
01:18:44.181 --> 01:18:45.014
<v Speaker 2>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have like rules as far as like </v>

1616
01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.570
<v Speaker 2>what you can change and what you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>change and we're allowing people now.</v>

1617
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.080
<v Speaker 2>This is like a really reason thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just decide to change your gender,</v>

1618
01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:01.250
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't affect me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want people to have freedom.</v>

1619
01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't bother me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

1620
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:05.650
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1621
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.360
<v Speaker 2>there's an addendum to the radio lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

1622
01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:12.950
<v Speaker 2>She made them edit out the references to</v>
<v Speaker 2>her actually changing her identity.</v>

1623
01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:13.784
<v Speaker 2>I guess she stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She stopped switching after all this is </v>

1624
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.670
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she no longer flips.</v>

1625
01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:21.873
<v Speaker 2>Interesting woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She now remains comfortable as a queer </v>

1626
01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:26.900
<v Speaker 2>trans woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does,</v>

1627
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:30.110
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a queer?</v>

1628
01:19:30.111 --> 01:19:32.300
<v Speaker 2>There's not gay though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1629
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I thought it meant that queer is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1630
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Like you can do both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1631
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is queer?</v>

1632
01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:43.130
<v Speaker 2>And then let.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know gay is gay?</v>

1633
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Queer is not gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Queer is like non defined.</v>

1634
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>people used to.</v>

1667
01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Queer is the idea that labels and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Similar to the concept of queer,</v>

<v Speaker 1>of gender queer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1672
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:21.870
<v Speaker 1>what's gender queer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that'd be like me,</v>

1673
01:21:21.871 --> 01:21:26.190
<v Speaker 1>like nonbinary where I don't fall under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum of male or female.</v>

1674
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.053
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queer is a term which refers to </v>

1675
01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:29.214
<v Speaker 1>individuals or groups who are queer or </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematize what for making a fake </v>

1676
01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:36.900
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hegemonic notions of sex,</v>

1677
01:21:36.901 --> 01:21:37.950
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and desire.</v>

1678
01:21:37.951 --> 01:21:38.784
<v Speaker 1>In a given society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender queer people possess identities </v>

1679
01:21:40.921 --> 01:21:45.900
<v Speaker 1>which fall outside of the widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted sexual binary.</v>

1680
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:47.700
<v Speaker 1>You're not buying your area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your gender queer,</v>

1681
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:49.140
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender queer.</v>

1682
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Gender may also refer to people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify as both transgendered and queer</v>

1683
01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:57.430
<v Speaker 1>eye individuals who</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1691
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:18.563
<v Speaker 4>Why do we have to check each other to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure that everyone's on the same </v>

1692

<v Speaker 4>don't have grades first grade,</v>

<v Speaker 4>third grade,</v>

1697
01:22:30.721 --> 01:22:34.170
<v Speaker 4>so that the kids don't feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no hierarchy.</v>

1698
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:36.150
<v Speaker 4>Group one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>group two,</v>

1699
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.800

<v Speaker 4>shit like that.</v>

1700
01:22:37.801 --> 01:22:40.260
<v Speaker 4>Soft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are trying to eliminate all forms</v>

1701
01:22:40.261 --> 01:22:42.480
<v Speaker 4>of competition and scrutiny and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>calling.</v>

1702
01:22:42.481 --> 01:22:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Any criticism of you at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bullying,</v>

1703
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.810
<v Speaker 4>bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all bull.</v>

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>

1705
01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:51.120
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of leagues with no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No score.</v>

1706
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.460
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1707
01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.290
<v Speaker 4>That is really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1708
01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.810

<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

1709
01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.210
<v Speaker 4>I think shame helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Loss,</v>

1710
01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:01.770
<v Speaker 4>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear.</v>

1711
01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 4>those were all my primary motivations as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a young woman and it carried me very</v>

1712
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.023
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fucking loser and because of </v>

1713
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure like the people that do it,</v>

1714
01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that do mean shit or say mean shit.</v>

1715
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:15.850
<v Speaker 1>The kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized after they do it,</v>

1716
01:23:15.851 --> 01:23:18.790
<v Speaker 1>how shitty it feels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a learning experience even for</v>

1717
01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:19.624
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they should absolutely be </v>

1718
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:20.764
<v Speaker 1>corrected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this idea that somehow or another </v>

1719
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going to wipe all that stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being a person,</v>

1720
01:23:26.261 --> 01:23:28.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird part of being a person.</v>

1721
01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Like people liked the fact that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect people by saying shit.</v>

1722
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they absolutely.</v>

1723
01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:34.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we're going to sanitize </v>

1724
01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:36.244
<v Speaker 1>out everything so that your kids will </v>
<v Speaker 1>never have to feel a bad feeling ever </v>

1725
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:39.850
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I highly doubt he'll let you play your </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff without you heal yankee offline.</v>

1840
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 1>We put a match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:16.890
<v Speaker 1>They're going to find you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Matter time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1843
01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think this is his property,</v>

1844
01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.600
<v Speaker 1>like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lectures and all that stuff.</v>

1845
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.000
<v Speaker 1>This is where fair use argument could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a player.</v>

1846
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:30.270
<v Speaker 1>That fair use argument is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1847
01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We play shit all the time and talk about</v>

1848
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:34.760
<v Speaker 1>it and it gets jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whom?</v>

1849
01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Well did you see the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video today?</v>

1850
01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:37.580
<v Speaker 1>The guy who got attacked by a grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear?</v>

1851
01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1852
01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.473
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was scouting scouting for an upcoming </v>

1853
01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:49.500
<v Speaker 1>client and he came across a mama bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>and her cubs.</v>

1854
01:29:49.501 --> 01:29:50.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:29:50.521 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and he even sprayed it with bear spray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said dead on 25 yards,</v>

1856
01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:57.500
<v Speaker 1>like unloaded in the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just ran.</v>

1857
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Ran right through it.</v>

1858
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:03.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't.</v>

1859
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what they're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>until they do it.</v>

1860
01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.360
<v Speaker 1>That bear spray might work sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work this time.</v>

1861
01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1862
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.093
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his skin is hanging off of his head </v>

1863
01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:21.240
<v Speaker 1>above his ear and he the bear bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>through his arms to.</v>

1864
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.193
<v Speaker 1>His name's todd or he's lucky he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>away on my face and protected the back </v>

1865
01:30:26.561 --> 01:30:27.670
<v Speaker 1>of my neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god,</v>

1866
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's under my hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my arm,</v>

1867
01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:36.790
<v Speaker 1>his arm's broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that stuff.</v>

1868
01:30:36.791 --> 01:30:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole just twitched.</v>

1869
01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:44.040
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't imagine a fucking bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>female grizzly bear protecting her cubs.</v>

1870
01:30:46.730 --> 01:30:47.563
<v Speaker 1>Tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is holding back that up there </v>

1871
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.470
<v Speaker 1>for a second there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back it up.</v>

1872
01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this.</v>

1873
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Internal organs are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eyes are good.</v>

1874
01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I just walked out three miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you go to the hospital,</v>

1875
01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:01.293
<v Speaker 1>so nobody stopped to make a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but listen to that pragmatic way of </v>

1876
01:31:06.101 --> 01:31:08.230
<v Speaker 1>looking at her legs are good.</v>

1877
01:31:09.190 --> 01:31:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Internal organs are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is the fear.</v>

1878
01:31:12.191 --> 01:31:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy just came in contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a real live monster,</v>

1879
01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:21.580
<v Speaker 1>a fucking grizzly bear twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice in a day.</v>

1880
01:31:22.570 --> 01:31:23.403
<v Speaker 1>A real live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that three mile hike got in his </v>

1881
01:31:26.741 --> 01:31:30.510
<v Speaker 1>truck and drove 20 miles to a hospital </v>
<v Speaker 1>for then.</v>

1882
01:31:30.511 --> 01:31:34.750
<v Speaker 1>You should probably so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just he's alive.</v>

1883
01:31:34.751 --> 01:31:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the photos,</v>

1884
01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:37.230
<v Speaker 1>the scar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1885
01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.260
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:31:38.261 --> 01:31:40.180
<v Speaker 1>the photos that headscarf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:31:40.181 --> 01:31:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really big.</v>

1888
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that was a claw was probably</v>

1889
01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.620
<v Speaker 1>a claw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1890
01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.950
<v Speaker 1>He's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's scouting for alex,</v>

1891
01:31:47.951 --> 01:31:50.380
<v Speaker 1>so this is like a public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it a,</v>

1892
01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

1893
01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:54.370
<v Speaker 1>where do people have some kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting area?</v>

1894
01:31:54.371 --> 01:31:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's said he could be on private land,</v>

1895
01:31:57.071 --> 01:31:59.800
<v Speaker 1>but most likely is on public land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1896
01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:01.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a,</v>

1897
01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:02.313
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe Montana has a grizzly </v>

1898
01:32:03.521 --> 01:32:04.354
<v Speaker 1>bear season.</v>

1899
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 1>They do have grizzly bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he just wasn't.</v>

1900
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:10.030
<v Speaker 1>He just walked over and then I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1901
01:32:10.031 --> 01:32:10.864
<v Speaker 1>I think the only place you can hunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears in north America as </v>

1902
01:32:12.851 --> 01:32:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1903
01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:16.043
<v Speaker 1>I think there's grizzly bears in Alaska </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I don't think you even hunt </v>

1904
01:32:19.391 --> 01:32:23.230
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had imagined the diarrhea in Canada.</v>

1905
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:25.480
<v Speaker 1>They hunt them in british columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I talking about?</v>

1906
01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you walk over and then 80 yards was</v>

1907
01:32:29.921 --> 01:32:34.570
<v Speaker 1>a bear and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh god.</v>

1908
01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got his spread.</v>

1909
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 1>He knows if you're around here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't book it,</v>

1910
01:32:39.281 --> 01:32:41.800
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sprayed it.</v>

1911
01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 1>We know that that's one photo of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm,</v>

1912
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:46.713
<v Speaker 1>but check out the other ones just has </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his head or pull them up because </v>

1913
01:32:49.541 --> 01:32:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not logged into facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1914
01:32:50.891 --> 01:32:51.724
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1915
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm just see if we could find it outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

1916
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.793
<v Speaker 1>but oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my buddy Adam Green tree who is on </v>

1917
01:32:59.321 --> 01:33:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the podcast last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bow hunter.</v>

1918
01:33:01.181 --> 01:33:02.890
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at his head.</v>

1919
01:33:03.490 --> 01:33:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Look at the giant scar that goes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>his temple.</v>

1920
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Although first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted a scar on the back of your</v>

1921
01:33:07.931 --> 01:33:09.010
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the spot.</v>

1922
01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't rip his ear off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't you know?</v>

1923
01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:14.093
<v Speaker 1>It's got a nice line on his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like it will stitch back </v>

1924
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:19.920
<v Speaker 1>together as long as he doesn't have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infection from the bear bite.</v>

1925
01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:23.320
<v Speaker 1>And a guy's goT a good story too for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile now.</v>

1926
01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:28.720
<v Speaker 1>One bite on my farm went through to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bone and I heard a crunch.</v>

1927
01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:32.970
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1928

<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of grizzly bears here,</v>

1940
01:34:03.521 --> 01:34:04.354
<v Speaker 1>Because we went there in the summer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to bozeman and we drove down </v>

1941
01:34:06.691 --> 01:34:07.524
<v Speaker 1>this road and we pulled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw 100 elk just sitting in this </v>

1942
01:34:10.201 --> 01:34:11.910
<v Speaker 1>field like right off the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

1943
01:34:11.911 --> 01:34:13.260
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

1944
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:18.440
<v Speaker 1>You just get out of the car and look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them on a hunting trip or with my family</v>

1945
01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:18.830
<v Speaker 1>we went to.</v>

1946
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:19.663
<v Speaker 1>We did the yellowstone thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just looking out and looking at all </v>

<v Speaker 1>them at a grizzly sanctuary,</v>

1949
01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.340
<v Speaker 1>but apparently people just run into them</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1950
01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

1951
01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:31.313

<v Speaker 1>accidentally be in the Wrong place at </v>

1952
01:34:34.351 --> 01:34:36.870

1953
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I remember going there once and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guide tells,</v>

1954
01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you run into a bear and like do these</v>

1955
01:34:45.181 --> 01:34:46.500
<v Speaker 1>things in the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brains,</v>

1956
01:34:46.501 --> 01:34:48.440
<v Speaker 1>like you just got to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1957
01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:49.960
<v Speaker 1>like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1958
01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:51.990
<v Speaker 1>cover your ears and crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1959
01:34:51.991 --> 01:34:53.370
<v Speaker 1>play limp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fight back,</v>

1960
01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.890
<v Speaker 1>don't run my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy actually did it,</v>

1961
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.170
<v Speaker 1>which is the crazy part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1962
01:34:57.171 --> 01:34:59.330
<v Speaker 1>He actually did it and he played dead on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that second one.</v>

1963
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:00.163
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1964
01:35:00.230 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 1>he just went limp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way.</v>

1965
01:35:03.650 --> 01:35:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Imagine going limp on that thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>biting you.</v>

1966
01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so big.</v>

1967
01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's such a terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1968
01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:11.813
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that it's a real thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real animal that's 11 feet </v>

1969
01:35:15.651 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 1>tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It weighs a thousand pounds.</v>

1970
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:23.270
<v Speaker 1>So my friend adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went on an elk by himself in Montana.</v>

1971
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.360
<v Speaker 1>He was in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot an elk and uh,</v>

1972
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:27.223
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to pack it off the mountain and </v>

1973
01:35:28.461 --> 01:35:29.294
<v Speaker 1>he's like 14 miles in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got to pack this thousand pound </v>

1974
01:35:33.171 --> 01:35:37.910
<v Speaker 1>animal and he's going to do it in 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>200 pound chunks.</v>

1975
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:40.160
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to and each one of them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take a day.</v>

1976
01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:44.330
<v Speaker 1>So he's doing it essentially four days </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just packing out meat.</v>

1977
01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:49.460
<v Speaker 1>So the first day when he goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a grizzly was sleeping on the carcass.</v>

1978
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:50.383
<v Speaker 1>A giant grizzly bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 foot grizzly bears sleeping on the </v>

1979
01:35:54.201 --> 01:35:54.560
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

1980
01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.393
<v Speaker 1>Elk chase it off and scare it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has to yell at it to try to get it out </v>

1981
01:35:58.981 --> 01:36:02.500
<v Speaker 1>of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a pistol with him by himself.</v>

1982
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would have taken that </v>
<v Speaker 1>route by himself.</v>

1983
01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.050
<v Speaker 1>He had no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nuts.</v>

1984
01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can have the elk.</v>

1985
01:36:07.611 --> 01:36:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bear ran off really well.</v>

1986
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Is that the approach you would have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>without knowing this?</v>

1987
01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Have you been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1988
01:36:13.761 --> 01:36:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1989
01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:19.310
<v Speaker 1>you post to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say you're supposed to yell at me if</v>

1990
01:36:19.311 --> 01:36:20.144
<v Speaker 1>you want it to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might want to Just give it to </v>

1991
01:36:21.951 --> 01:36:23.540
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of there.</v>

1992
01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Just get the fuck out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true anymore.</v>

1993
01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't.</v>

1994
01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.313
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to do that beCause he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worked hard for that elk can you </v>

1995
01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.380
<v Speaker 1>shine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1996
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:31.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough fucking call.</v>

1997
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to be the one to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1998
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:35.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>

1999
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See goes one hand.</v>

2000
01:36:36.711 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 1>You would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

2001
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:38.653
<v Speaker 1>the bad news is I don't get to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is the of big and see </v>

2002
01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:42.800
<v Speaker 1>because I really liked paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a teddy bear when I was a kid.</v>

2003
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:46.670
<v Speaker 1>That's my friend cameron hanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one he killed in Alaska.</v>

2004
01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.013
<v Speaker 1>Is he the guy that also does those crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon run ran 200 miles this summer </v>

2005
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.470
<v Speaker 1>in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy eight hours.</v>

2006
01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:57.230
<v Speaker 1>He ran three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slept three hOurs and three days.</v>

2007
01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.093
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does your system keep going until </v>

2008
01:36:59.890 --> 01:37:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to build up to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was runninG a half a marathon a day.</v>

2009
01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Every day was running 13 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2010
01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:06.374
<v Speaker 1>And then he ran a hundred miles in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>june to prepare for the 205 miles in </v>

2011
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:14.720
<v Speaker 1>august.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2012
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the mental part,</v>

2013
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:20.870
<v Speaker 1>which is its own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then physically doesn't that just,</v>

2014
01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.420
<v Speaker 1>he looks tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tired.</v>

2015
01:37:23.690 --> 01:37:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't just do it.</v>

2016
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:28.160
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a good friend of mine.</v>

2017
01:37:28.161 --> 01:37:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I love him to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's crazy.</v>

2018
01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the things he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He uh,</v>

2019
01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.313
<v Speaker 1>he lOst a ton of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went from 180 pounds down to below </v>

2020
01:37:36.531 --> 01:37:41.531
<v Speaker 1>one slash 60 just by starving himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had his body eat itself.</v>

2021
01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.840
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because he was already lean,</v>

2022
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:44.893
<v Speaker 1>like he didn't have any fat to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the only way for him to losE weight </v>

2023
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.050
<v Speaker 1>burn 3000 calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat 2000.</v>

2024
01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:54.170
<v Speaker 1>So he did that for months until his body</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked shriveled away,</v>

2025
01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 1>down to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2026
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I think he got under 160 before he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>

2027
01:37:59.350 --> 01:38:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Like the other day he put a picture on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his instagram.</v>

2028
01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.830
<v Speaker 1>He weighed 100 fifTy eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I met him he weighed 180 and he was</v>

2029
01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:08.970
<v Speaker 1>built like you lift weights but he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these at 180.</v>

2030
01:38:08.971 --> 01:38:12.120
<v Speaker 1>And it was too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he decided to lose the weight.</v>

2031
01:38:12.121 --> 01:38:12.954
<v Speaker 1>So that's how we kind of discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to just make your Body eat </v>

2032
01:38:15.781 --> 01:38:17.480
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have any faCts,</v>

2033
01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:22.850
<v Speaker 1>even at sub one 60 to run that that muCh</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to your knees,</v>

2034
01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:25.860
<v Speaker 1>your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be brutal.</v>

2035
01:38:25.861 --> 01:38:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good will.</v>

2036
01:38:27.241 --> 01:38:28.074
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it's really like you could do </v>

2037
01:38:31.351 --> 01:38:34.070
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really not necessarily going to</v>

2038
01:38:34.071 --> 01:38:36.960
<v Speaker 1>help you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really they're not going to help you</v>

2039
01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:39.740
<v Speaker 1>not feel pain or be able to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's.</v>

2040
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:41.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is just being tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:44.400
<v Speaker 1>He's a tough son of man suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:38:44.770 --> 01:38:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a maniac.</v>

2043
01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:46.493
<v Speaker 1>He's got issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also like one of the most </v>

2044
01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:51.250
<v Speaker 1>successful bowhunters ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really hasn't.</v>

2045
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Bowhunting is the hardest thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to do when it comes to acquisition</v>

2046
01:38:54.751 --> 01:38:56.760
<v Speaker 1>of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no harder way to.</v>

2047
01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:57.960
<v Speaker 1>What state does he live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In?</v>

2048
01:38:58.050 --> 01:38:58.883
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no harder way to get an animal </v>

2049
01:39:00.721 --> 01:39:03.480
<v Speaker 1>than with a bow and arrow because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get within a certain distance.</v>

2050
01:39:03.481 --> 01:39:05.190
<v Speaker 1>You have to practice every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

2051
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:06.353
<v Speaker 1>and he hasn't had an unsuccessful </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowhunt since 2009 and he goes every </v>

2052
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:12.210
<v Speaker 1>year and it kills multiple elk every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

2053
01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:14.520
<v Speaker 1>That's like unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does that.</v>

2054
01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody has dud dud trips like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go and you struck out,</v>

2055
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you just don't see the right animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get him.</v>

2056
01:39:20.190 --> 01:39:21.990
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just.</v>

2057
01:39:22.210 --> 01:39:23.043
<v Speaker 1>I mean this one is designed for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he does and he just excels at it and </v>

2058
01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.070
<v Speaker 1>if he doesn't find somebody just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>runs 100 miles to the next spot,</v>

2059
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.553
<v Speaker 1>I've hunted with them and the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy is how he doesn't get </v>

2060
01:39:33.151 --> 01:39:35.040
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LIke I'm in pretty good shape.</v>

2061
01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:37.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what I follow him up the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2062
01:39:37.021 --> 01:39:38.290
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

2063
01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Some people are wired like his sister </v>
<v Speaker 2>maria is a similar level of lunacy.</v>

2064

<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the auditors are.</v>

2083
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:45.170
<v Speaker 2>These crazy races where you have to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

2084
01:40:45.171 --> 01:40:46.004
<v Speaker 2>You're literally running a lot of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>through mugs that they're totally </v>

2085
01:40:50.661 --> 01:40:51.494
<v Speaker 2>covered with mud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that is mud as </v>

2086
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.823
<v Speaker 2>water and still water is super bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get that mud in their mouth and </v>

<v Speaker 2>machinery out.</v>

2091
01:41:13.061 --> 01:41:15.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like spring cleaning with a carpet </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaner.</v>

2092

<v Speaker 2>It does look fun like the I think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>running and you know what I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well they learn.</v>

2095
01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:28.113
<v Speaker 2>They learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean some people just really into it </v>

2096
01:41:29.471 --> 01:41:30.304
<v Speaker 2>and they keep their mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know how to do it or keep their </v>

2097
01:41:31.841 --> 01:41:34.720
<v Speaker 2>mouth closed and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't breathe it in,</v>

2098
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:36.820
<v Speaker 2>but when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see them running through it,</v>

2099
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have all the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is just people walking.</v>

2103
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:46.833
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some where you see them running </v>

2104
01:41:48.251 --> 01:41:49.084
<v Speaker 2>and doing all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just a bunch of people walking </v>

2105
01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:52.040
<v Speaker 2>through a swamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your life,</v>

2106
01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:54.820

<v Speaker 2>you have to crawl under stuff too.</v>

2107
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's when you can get it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mouth.</v>

2108
01:41:57.990 --> 01:42:02.890

<v Speaker 2>do when it's so easy to get food.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what's that disease or he heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>from him.</v>

2115
01:42:28.531 --> 01:42:30.100
<v Speaker 2>but tweak some of these obstacles so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like six,</v>

2116
01:42:30.101 --> 01:42:31.180
<v Speaker 2>seven miles,</v>

2137
01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:37.240
<v Speaker 2>people pour in the turn of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn of the 20th century.</v>

2145
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:58.350

<v Speaker 2>You have to be responsible.</v>

2158
01:44:22.530 --> 01:44:23.363
<v Speaker 2>They have a special on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same reason they have a special and </v>

2159
01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:26.300
<v Speaker 2>a lady who doesn't cut her toenails.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They could never get a job.</v>

2162
01:44:37.881 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are employed.</v>

2163
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.860
<v Speaker 2>that is the one common denominator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your,</v>

2164
01:44:42.861 --> 01:44:44.180
<v Speaker 2>what do you do for living?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not anymore.</v>

2165
01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:48.290
<v Speaker 2>That's discrimination by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're discriminating against her guys.</v>

2166
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:49.723
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people discuss the merits of </v>

2167
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 2>the sacred argument where you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to cut your hair because of your</v>

2168
01:44:55.311 --> 01:44:56.170
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2169
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:57.290
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well listen,</v>

2170
01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.390
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just your fucking hair.</v>

2171
01:44:59.530 --> 01:45:02.600
<v Speaker 2>And if your religion is about cutting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hair or not cutting your hair,</v>

2172
01:45:02.601 --> 01:45:05.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might be bullshit.</v>

2173
01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2174
01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.240

<v Speaker 2>So if you can't,</v>

2175
01:45:08.241 --> 01:45:09.260
<v Speaker 2>you can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2176
01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:10.610
<v Speaker 2>my hair is getting in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna cut it.</v>

2177
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Who says that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who says you can.</v>

2468
01:59:14.590 --> 01:59:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2471
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's a,</v>

2472
01:59:25.150 --> 01:59:26.940
<v Speaker 1>the judge's discretion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>

2474
01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:30.723
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be like you're punishing her </v>

2475
01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:37.600
<v Speaker 1>because she's being disrespectful to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to the court itself.</v>

2476
01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:38.493
<v Speaker 1>To both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you have to respect the </v>

2477
01:59:39.611 --> 01:59:40.444
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see what they did to that </v>

2478
01:59:41.141 --> 01:59:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Alabama judge know he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Here we will get yanked yogi.</v>

2480
01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Want to hear what he says to say to her?</v>

2481
01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:55.870
<v Speaker 1>It has no sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2482
01:59:56.290 --> 01:59:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

2483
01:59:57.311 --> 01:59:59.080
<v Speaker 1>It was probably like the courtroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

2484
01:59:59.230 --> 02:00:01.050
<v Speaker 1>St.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actual courtroom can come back.</v>

2485
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Tomal did the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's laughing and smiling.</v>

2486
02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Funny how people when they're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position like that,</v>

2487
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you're caught like you're in court and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all the power.</v>

2488
02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>You want to pretend like you don't give </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fuck.</v>

2489
02:00:15.610 --> 02:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd give a lot of fuck.</v>

2490
02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>If I were in front of a judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be very,</v>

2491
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>very respectful and scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just flipped him off.</v>

2492
02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's angry.</v>

2493
02:00:27.610 --> 02:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing that he can just do that.</v>

2494
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:34.750
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of amazing because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost too much power.</v>

2495
02:00:34.890 --> 02:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I understand that you are violating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the court,</v>

2496
02:00:37.001 --> 02:00:37.834
<v Speaker 1>but should it really be up to the judge </v>
<v Speaker 1>to arbitrarily decide to give you 30 </v>

2497
02:00:40.781 --> 02:00:41.614
<v Speaker 1>more days or 90 more days or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you shouldn't really be up to </v>

2498
02:00:45.821 --> 02:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2499
02:00:46.150 --> 02:00:46.983
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe there's a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you say the f word or if you </v>

2500
02:00:49.391 --> 02:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>give someone the finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get an automatic,</v>

2501
02:00:51.071 --> 02:00:51.970
<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2502
02:00:51.971 --> 02:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>but then they'd be able to pick rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2503
02:00:54.461 --> 02:00:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's contempt of court,</v>

2504
02:00:57.731 --> 02:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys?</v>

2505

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2512
02:01:12.611 --> 02:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to respect the court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The judge was,</v>

2513
02:01:15.131 --> 02:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>she had to wear the jumpsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you,</v>

2514
02:01:18.431 --> 02:01:19.264
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2515
02:01:20.231 --> 02:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>decide how many days he gives you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2516
02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be a limit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't be set to for contempt,</v>

02:01:45.771 --> 02:01:46.604
<v Speaker 4>weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have minimums were certain things </v>

2525
02:01:47.751 --> 02:01:50.840
<v Speaker 4>like murder and armed robbery crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's probably,</v>

2526
02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:53.870
<v Speaker 4>there's got to be parameters for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're always like,</v>

2527
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:54.733
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this judge particularly is lenient on </v>

2528
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:57.890
<v Speaker 4>this and that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

2529
02:01:57.910 --> 02:02:00.800
<v Speaker 4>you almost want to choose your judge and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you choose your jurors.</v>

2530
02:02:01.250 --> 02:02:03.380
<v Speaker 4>The attorneys do based on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2531
02:02:03.381 --> 02:02:04.214
<v Speaker 4>so I didn't really go to law school for </v>
<v Speaker 4>two weeks and we did learn about jury </v>

2532
02:02:06.681 --> 02:02:09.170
<v Speaker 4>selection and the key is you do want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>

2533
02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:12.800
<v Speaker 4>and this is horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but usually like the dumbest people,</v>

2534
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:14.900
<v Speaker 4>like you want to have people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

2535
02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:16.233
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm easily persuaded to whatever your </v>

2536
02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:23.531
<v Speaker 4>cause and a judge to that is favorable </v>
<v Speaker 4>for liberal if they're whatever,</v>

2537
02:02:24.710 --> 02:02:27.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could guess based on their,</v>

2538
02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:29.750
<v Speaker 4>the precedence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>open.</v>

02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:39.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what really geeked me out was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dj dad math came because he was becoming</v>

2640
02:06:40.681 --> 02:06:45.681
<v Speaker 3>a father at the time and was a dad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it kind of morphed into dj dan.</v>

2641
02:06:48.150 --> 02:06:49.500
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that's true.</v>

2642
02:06:49.501 --> 02:06:52.860
<v Speaker 3>But taking it onto morning news was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a one time goof.</v>

2643
02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:53.933
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was so fun and I was like all the </v>

2644
02:06:55.711 --> 02:06:56.610
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2645
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:57.653
<v Speaker 3>So when you went on as a onetime goof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you have a plan or did you just </v>

2646
02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:02.610
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you do?</v>

2647
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:07.280
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fun thing was to go was because I,</v>

2648
02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:08.600
<v Speaker 3>the thing that I hate the most when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that,</v>

2649
02:07:08.670 --> 02:07:10.560
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can audiences expect this weekend?</v>

2650
02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:11.720
<v Speaker 3>They always say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2651
02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:12.780
<v Speaker 3>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2652
02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:14.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking show jokes.</v>

2653

2655
02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:19.380
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's bothering you right now?</v>

2656
02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:20.213
<v Speaker 3>Tom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2657
02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:21.113
<v Speaker 3>that's the setup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell What's going on in your life and </v>

2658
02:07:22.141 --> 02:07:23.610
<v Speaker 3>they think you're going to like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they go,</v>

2659
02:07:23.611 --> 02:07:25.680
<v Speaker 3>just do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just have fun with it.</v>

2660
02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.840
<v Speaker 3>So when they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

2661
02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:30.270
<v Speaker 3>it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really give a fuck about comedy.</v>

2662
02:07:30.570 --> 02:07:31.940
<v Speaker 3>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2663
02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about the after party,</v>

2664
02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:34.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be deejaying here just to </v>

2665
02:07:36.821 --> 02:07:40.420
<v Speaker 3>goof off because it was fun to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and be like,</v>

2666
02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are at the funny bone.</v>

2667
02:07:42.641 --> 02:07:43.181
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2668
02:07:43.181 --> 02:07:46.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even really care about it.</v>

2669
02:07:46.901 --> 02:07:49.120
<v Speaker 3>The funny bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have the funny bone sitting</v>

2670
02:07:49.121 --> 02:07:52.310
<v Speaker 3>right there off camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who cares?</v>

2671
02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:53.313
<v Speaker 3>Like the best part is when he sets up </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the really cheesy anchors to ask </v>

2672
02:07:57.521 --> 02:08:00.360
<v Speaker 3>him stupid questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2673
02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:00.821
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2674
02:08:00.821 --> 02:08:02.530
<v Speaker 3>you had someone do the bird is fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2675
02:08:02.810 --> 02:08:06.100
<v Speaker 3>That was the best one because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever add sometimes when you go,</v>

2676
02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:07.293
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2677
02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:09.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked me about farts or something,</v>

2678
02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:11.200
<v Speaker 3>they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2679
02:08:11.310 --> 02:08:13.120
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know not to.</v>

2680
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:14.683
<v Speaker 3>They check themselves on asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>something provocative or that's not 100 </v>

2681
02:08:18.371 --> 02:08:21.190
<v Speaker 3>percent pg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't know how it go,</v>

2682
02:08:21.191 --> 02:08:22.030
<v Speaker 3>but I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2683
02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:23.290
<v Speaker 3>ask me what bird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fat.</v>

2684
02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:24.610
<v Speaker 3>And the lady goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2685
02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:28.960
<v Speaker 3>and then so we just are in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this interview.</v>

2686
02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:32.260
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white bird,</v>

2687
02:08:32.261 --> 02:08:34.180
<v Speaker 3>so fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I was asked a good question and I'm</v>

2688
02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.650
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just rolled with it,</v>

2689
02:08:35.651 --> 02:08:37.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it grew.</v>

2690
02:08:37.151 --> 02:08:41.180
<v Speaker 3>And then a hot dog eating champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy that was in scotland,</v>

2691
02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.390

2693
02:08:46.630 --> 02:08:51.630
<v Speaker 3>like a kobiashi dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy was probably the audio on this.</v>

2694
02:08:52.450 --> 02:08:53.500

<v Speaker 3>for a fucking year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now tom will write to the hashtag burn </v>

<v Speaker 3>with their shirts off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing who's fatter.</v>

2709
02:09:40.930 --> 02:09:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was fun.</v>

2710
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:42.740
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2711
02:09:43.190 --> 02:09:46.630
<v Speaker 3>it's died down a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like the fact that that guy did,</v>

2712
02:09:46.650 --> 02:09:49.190
<v Speaker 3>he did it on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a picture of you up.</v>

2713
02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:49.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

2714
02:09:49.971 --> 02:09:50.804
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag burn as fast talk about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I tweet about you hashtag birds that </v>

2715
02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:58.580
<v Speaker 3>took off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't,</v>

2716
02:09:58.610 --> 02:10:00.080
<v Speaker 3>like we talked about on your mom's </v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

2717
02:10:00.081 --> 02:10:02.330
<v Speaker 3>but we never thought we'd do all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 3>of silly stuff,</v>

2718
02:10:02.331 --> 02:10:04.790
<v Speaker 3>but this one really resonated with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

2719
02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Why did that one really resonate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2720
02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:08.540
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

2721
02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:11.510
<v Speaker 3>there was great theories about this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was this.</v>

2722
02:10:11.511 --> 02:10:14.960
<v Speaker 3>I think matt full trump pointed out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me the full charge said,</v>

2723
02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gave them the formula,</v>

2724
02:10:17.210 --> 02:10:20.660
<v Speaker 3>you gave audiences a joke formula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a person.</v>

2725
02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:23.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a fat joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>

2726
02:10:23.050 --> 02:10:23.883
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that was what was fun for </v>

2727
02:10:25.281 --> 02:10:29.780
<v Speaker 3>people to jump in on something that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

2728
02:10:29.781 --> 02:10:32.780
<v Speaker 3>like the formula is there to pick a </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

2729
02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 3>That's the</v>

2730
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.460
<v Speaker 1>competitive nature of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2731
02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:38.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they know that you guys really are </v>

2732
02:10:39.771 --> 02:10:41.240
<v Speaker 1>good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some did,</v>

2733
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:43.160
<v Speaker 1>some did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say most,</v>

2734
02:10:43.190 --> 02:10:44.780
<v Speaker 1>most people did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people did.</v>

2735
02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Some people get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2736
02:10:46.551 --> 02:10:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Some people were like really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>really harsh and really like,</v>

2737
02:10:50.871 --> 02:10:51.704
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always fucking hated burgs a piece </v>

2738
02:10:52.971 --> 02:10:53.571
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2739
02:10:53.571 --> 02:10:55.310
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like shit like that.</v>

2740
02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:58.310
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people were like that though.</v>

2741
02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing to me.</v>

2742
02:10:59.710 --> 02:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll tape some people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2743
02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:03.860
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my theories about this trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2744
02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I think people just pick a fucking side </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that side represents the battle.</v>

2745
02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't have to make any sense,</v>

2746
02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:12.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you like,</v>

2747
02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:15.140
<v Speaker 1>whatever fact you bring about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

2748
02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:18.110
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I post something about hillary,</v>

2749
02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:21.200
<v Speaker 1>like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get so many people just get so fucking</v>

2750
02:11:21.201 --> 02:11:21.500
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>

2751
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2752
02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:24.200
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take away from like one guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying that,</v>

2753
02:11:24.201 --> 02:11:25.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different ones,</v>

2756
02:11:28.341 --> 02:11:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but there was one recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a wiki leaks,</v>

2757
02:11:30.951 --> 02:11:33.080
<v Speaker 1>one that came out today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a wiki.</v>

2758
02:11:33.081 --> 02:11:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Leaks is saying that she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2759
02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:38.870
<v Speaker 1>she said she asked about julian assange </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they could just drone this guy.</v>

2760
02:11:39.850 --> 02:11:41.720
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of funny.</v>

2761
02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's saying he's just thumbing his nose</v>

2762
02:11:45.771 --> 02:11:46.640
<v Speaker 1>up in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

2763
02:11:46.641 --> 02:11:49.220
<v Speaker 1>we just drone this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows where she really centered.</v>

2764
02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2765
02:11:49.850 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody tweets it,</v>

2766
02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:54.380
<v Speaker 1>the people that support hillary don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2767
02:11:54.381 --> 02:11:55.580
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of interesting.</v>

2768
02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:56.420
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2769
02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:58.250
<v Speaker 1>you fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that you really mean that.</v>

2770
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Where's your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's your proof?</v>

2771
02:11:59.541 --> 02:12:00.374
<v Speaker 1>Like we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden they're defending their </v>

2772
02:12:01.641 --> 02:12:02.474
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're defending that person like </v>

2773
02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:04.253
<v Speaker 1>they're so emotionally invested in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning over trump that instead of </v>

2774
02:12:07.941 --> 02:12:08.780
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

2775
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:09.663
<v Speaker 1>did she really say that?</v>

2776
02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:10.513
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's check the story out or in as a </v>

2777
02:12:12.321 --> 02:12:14.810
<v Speaker 1>human being just going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think she meant?</v>

2778
02:12:14.811 --> 02:12:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you think is a joke or crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you think this is what they really</v>

2779
02:12:17.901 --> 02:12:18.734
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts.</v>

2780
02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:19.573
<v Speaker 1>You start thinking about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have taken place like that </v>

2781
02:12:21.021 --> 02:12:25.130
<v Speaker 1>fucking kid who leaked the emails to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dnc and wound up getting shot at 4:00</v>

2782
02:12:25.131 --> 02:12:26.780
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and the back in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his house.</v>

2783
02:12:27.170 --> 02:12:28.010
<v Speaker 1>You know that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2784
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2785
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:31.600
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a kid who,</v>

2786
02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:32.570
<v Speaker 1>4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

2787
02:12:32.571 --> 02:12:33.404
<v Speaker 1>this is a guy who leaked the emails that</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed that they collaborated to get </v>

2788
02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:37.453
<v Speaker 1>hillary elected over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie sanders makes sure that she got </v>

2789
02:12:39.681 --> 02:12:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the nomination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2790
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:43.850
<v Speaker 1>they literally distorted they distorted </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>

2791
02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:44.893
<v Speaker 1>like the democratic national campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>was working to try to get hillary </v>

2792
02:12:49.821 --> 02:12:53.870
<v Speaker 1>elected over him because bernie sanders </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not really a democrat.</v>

2793
02:12:54.110 --> 02:12:56.390
<v Speaker 1>He's like more of an independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2794
02:12:56.391 --> 02:12:57.224
<v Speaker 1>and like he doesn't play like party line</v>
<v Speaker 1>games and they had decided pretty early </v>

2795
02:13:00.801 --> 02:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>on they were going to support her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like the democratic national</v>

2796
02:13:04.311 --> 02:13:07.370
<v Speaker 1>committee has just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being completely objective and just</v>

2797
02:13:07.371 --> 02:13:09.590
<v Speaker 1>doing their best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was murdered,</v>

2798
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:14.610
<v Speaker 1>hence murdered dc staffer was email </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaker offers $20,000</v>

2799
02:13:14.611 --> 02:13:16.230
<v Speaker 1>reward for info.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2800
02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy story.</v>

2801
02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:23.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if that is what happened and they</v>

2802
02:13:23.901 --> 02:13:27.260
<v Speaker 1>decided to have someone kill that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid is the one that leaked that.</v>

2803
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

2804
02:13:28.730 --> 02:13:31.010
<v Speaker 1>it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It not only he's that he's,</v>

2805
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:32.183
<v Speaker 1>but no one's talking about it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those things you just </v>

2806
02:13:34.081 --> 02:13:35.640
<v Speaker 1>kind of went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

2807
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:36.474
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might have just been kiLled in some </v>

2808
02:13:36.991 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 1>random act of violence because he was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad place at the wrong time,</v>

2809
02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:41.843
<v Speaker 1>or some of them have fucking killed him </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that might've happened to if he </v>

2810
02:13:46.801 --> 02:13:50.250
<v Speaker 1>really did leak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those emails like that is nuts.</v>

2811
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:53.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a movie a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure is,</v>

2812
02:13:54.230 --> 02:13:57.300
<v Speaker 1>and in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create crazy chaotic election.</v>

2813
02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:58.433
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has any time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many other things you have </v>

2814
02:13:59.611 --> 02:14:00.444
<v Speaker 1>to be thinking about is a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things going on at the same </v>

2815
02:14:02.491 --> 02:14:03.324
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2816
02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:05.213
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really makes you like those picking </v>

2817
02:14:06.121 --> 02:14:08.640
<v Speaker 3>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things to always makes you realize.</v>

2818
02:14:08.641 --> 02:14:12.870
<v Speaker 3>I think that that elections are decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>by either side.</v>

2819
02:14:12.871 --> 02:14:15.300
<v Speaker 3>It really is decided by that person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be swayed.</v>

2820
02:14:15.570 --> 02:14:17.340
<v Speaker 3>It's such a small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird thing.</v>

2821
02:14:17.341 --> 02:14:19.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to sway the left.</v>

2822
02:14:19.410 --> 02:14:22.800
<v Speaker 3>The far left or the far right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the person who was like,</v>

2823
02:14:23.290 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 3>who is the undecided?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like are you really?</v>

2824
02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Those are two polar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

2825
02:14:28.351 --> 02:14:30.300
<v Speaker 3>opposite people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump and hillary.</v>

2826
02:14:30.301 --> 02:14:31.134
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you on the fence if they're </v>

2827
02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:34.890
<v Speaker 3>don't understand the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>

2828
02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:36.690
<v Speaker 3>They're so polar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a joke,</v>

2829
02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:42.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a cartoon they have male and </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine,</v>

2830
02:14:43.291 --> 02:14:44.124
<v Speaker 3>nor the noise of all the news stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversations you really got to be </v>

2831
02:14:48.481 --> 02:14:50.550
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the policy on this?</v>

2832
02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:53.550
<v Speaker 3>And then I guess some people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are actually caught up,</v>

2833
02:14:54.130 --> 02:14:55.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking like an actual,</v>

2834
02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:58.830
<v Speaker 3>like the drama of it all and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>

2835
02:14:58.831 --> 02:14:59.900
<v Speaker 3>the drama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>

2836
02:14:59.910 --> 02:15:02.400
<v Speaker 3>if you're one of those people that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually going back and forth,</v>

2837
02:15:03.150 --> 02:15:05.970
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have just eat neither or</v>

2838
02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:07.053
<v Speaker 1>our ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anybody who pretends that either or </v>

2839
02:15:09.581 --> 02:15:11.860
<v Speaker 1>are our ideal is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2840
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:12.833
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get you want to stop trump because </v>

2841
02:15:15.341 --> 02:15:17.080
<v Speaker 1>you think he represents everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong in the world.</v>

2842
02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some people,</v>

2843
02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:21.070
<v Speaker 1>hillary represents everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong in politics.</v>

2844
02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Some people have a problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

2845
02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:26.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the whole thing is,</v>

2846
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:27.303
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird sort of a social studY as </v>

2847
02:15:30.701 --> 02:15:35.410
<v Speaker 1>much as it is an election year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're watching this team thing play out</v>

2848
02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:36.940
<v Speaker 1>is very strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2850
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2851
02:15:40.670 --> 02:15:41.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>

2852
02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:44.320
<v Speaker 3>And I mean there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do you think's gonna win.</v>

2853
02:15:45.010 --> 02:15:45.640
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

2854
02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:46.451
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

2855
02:15:46.451 --> 02:15:47.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you think's gonna win?</v>

2856
02:15:47.530 --> 02:15:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking.</v>

2857
02:15:49.150 --> 02:15:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I think people will pick a side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll pick a side,</v>

2858
02:15:53.410 --> 02:15:54.243
<v Speaker 1>whether it's democrat or republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll pick aside at some point in </v>

2859
02:15:57.281 --> 02:15:58.114
<v Speaker 1>their life and then just start accepting</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff to stay on the team going with </v>

2860
02:16:02.321 --> 02:16:07.321
<v Speaker 1>stuff that goes that way and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like some ridiculous like</v>

2861
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:08.583
<v Speaker 1>super ultra sensitive leftwing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is preposterous and then </v>

2862
02:16:11.921 --> 02:16:13.720
<v Speaker 1>there's some ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2863
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:14.583
<v Speaker 1>We're super conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra religious stuff that I think is </v>

2864
02:16:16.781 --> 02:16:19.870
<v Speaker 1>preposterous and you could only be one </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other.</v>

2865
02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:20.733
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to believe in god and you have </v>

2866
02:16:22.751 --> 02:16:25.600
<v Speaker 1>to be conservative and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2867
02:16:26.050 --> 02:16:26.883
<v Speaker 3>The party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the party is now is completely </v>

2868
02:16:28.181 --> 02:16:32.050
<v Speaker 3>different than what it was the eighties </v>
<v Speaker 3>when reagan was chillin and everyone was</v>

2869
02:16:32.051 --> 02:16:32.884
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The eighties is when they courted the </v>

2870
02:16:34.841 --> 02:16:36.670
<v Speaker 3>religious right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they made it.</v>

2871
02:16:36.671 --> 02:16:40.210
<v Speaker 3>The religious right in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those religious people are a big part of</v>

2872
02:16:40.211 --> 02:16:41.044
<v Speaker 3>the reason why reagan got elected in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first place because they organize those </v>

2873
02:16:43.721 --> 02:16:44.554
<v Speaker 3>church people organized like they all </v>
<v Speaker 3>supported him because you know he was </v>

2874
02:16:47.531 --> 02:16:48.364
<v Speaker 3>supporting christian values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was much more of a separation of </v>

2875
02:16:50.891 --> 02:16:53.950
<v Speaker 3>church and state in the earLier years of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government.</v>

2876
02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:55.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel well,</v>

2877
02:16:55.211 --> 02:16:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I feel like thIs year's election is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our lifetime or my lifetime is the most.</v>

2878
02:17:00.010 --> 02:17:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Like the votes are based on the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hatred of the other candIdate,</v>

2879
02:17:06.011 --> 02:17:09.340
<v Speaker 3>more so than supporting the candidate in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some ways,</v>

2880
02:17:09.341 --> 02:17:11.800
<v Speaker 3>but some peopLe love trumP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucking love a man.</v>

2881
02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:13.410
<v Speaker 3>They love the idea thAt this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>

2882
02:17:13.430 --> 02:17:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Come in and just shake it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shake it up,</v>

2883
02:17:17.590 --> 02:17:22.590
<v Speaker 3>shake it up with all kinds of stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the dumbest fucking guy.</v>

2884
02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:25.960
<v Speaker 3>It's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That debate the other night was insane.</v>

2885
02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:29.140
<v Speaker 3>I saw people that I like who said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he won the debate,</v>

2886
02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:32.680
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dave rubin said it.</v>

2887
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Dave ruben said he thinks that he thinks</v>
<v Speaker 3>that overall trump Won.</v>

2888
02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the beginning was just brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed the beginning.</v>

2889
02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the beginning?</v>

2890
02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:43.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not either.</v>

2891
02:17:43.170 --> 02:17:44.003
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only saw the end when he was just </v>

2892
02:17:44.501 --> 02:17:45.334
<v Speaker 3>stumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Said he has a winning temperament and </v>

2893
02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:48.633
<v Speaker 3>she found him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's called the winning temperament </v>

2894
02:17:50.561 --> 02:17:51.394
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was such a like a childish temper </v>

2895
02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:54.064
<v Speaker 3>tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it's so weird because he turns it </v>

2896
02:17:56.411 --> 02:17:57.244
<v Speaker 3>around like the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you say that hillary doesn't have </v>

2897
02:18:00.881 --> 02:18:03.850
<v Speaker 3>the right look to be president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was the look,</v>

2898
02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:08.080
<v Speaker 3>the stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't have a winning temperament.</v>

2899
02:18:08.290 --> 02:18:11.980
<v Speaker 3>I have a winning temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He turns it around on himself Because he</v>

2900
02:18:11.981 --> 02:18:14.960
<v Speaker 3>knows that the big knock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's getting defensive that that was,</v>

2901
02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:16.210
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was bait,</v>

2902
02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:19.450
<v Speaker 3>but that he couldn't ignore because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>big knock had been.</v>

2903
02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the bIg knocks was like,</v>

2904
02:18:21.310 --> 02:18:22.143
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the temperament because </v>

2905
02:18:22.841 --> 02:18:24.580
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very thin skinned.</v>

2906
02:18:24.610 --> 02:18:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anybody tweet something,</v>

2907
02:18:26.310 --> 02:18:27.490
<v Speaker 3>adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fights,</v>

2908
02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:28.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>

2909
02:18:28.001 --> 02:18:30.160
<v Speaker 3>all the insults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's because his temperament,</v>

2910
02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:33.190
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't seem presidential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a winning temperament.</v>

2911
02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:34.053
<v Speaker 3>That's the spin spin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just shows how much he absorbed </v>

2912
02:18:38.441 --> 02:18:40.240
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff and was defensive about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2913
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2914
02:18:41.130 --> 02:18:42.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very defensive.</v>

2915
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:44.770
<v Speaker 3>Also the presidential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet he gets very,</v>

2916
02:18:45.020 --> 02:18:46.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really get away,</v>

2917
02:18:46.481 --> 02:18:50.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of those things that his </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters ignore was how often,</v>

2918
02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:52.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just goes like bronc,</v>

2919
02:18:52.421 --> 02:18:53.410
<v Speaker 3>like he was wrong.</v>

2920
02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:56.740
<v Speaker 3>That's not never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's all stuff that he did say.</v>

2921
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just go like,</v>

2922
02:18:57.911 --> 02:19:02.380
<v Speaker 3>well who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just some part of the tax thing came</v>

2923
02:19:02.381 --> 02:19:07.381
<v Speaker 3>out that he put how much money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine hundred and $15,000,000</v>

2924
02:19:07.931 --> 02:19:08.764
<v Speaker 3>in losses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't have to pay taxes for a </v>

2925
02:19:10.361 --> 02:19:12.040
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighteen years,</v>

2926
02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:14.020
<v Speaker 3>18 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no taxes really.</v>

2927
02:19:14.180 --> 02:19:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that he basically,</v>

2928
02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:17.530
<v Speaker 3>it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you,</v>

2929
02:19:17.530 --> 02:19:18.363
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying might be the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>why he hasn't wanted to release his tax </v>

2930
02:19:22.181 --> 02:19:27.181
<v Speaker 3>returns is that that level of loss would</v>
<v Speaker 3>allow him to not taxes on</v>

2931
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:32.240
<v Speaker 1>essentially $50 million in income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No federal taxes for about 20 years.</v>

2932
02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:35.481
<v Speaker 1>But they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2933
02:19:35.481 --> 02:19:39.590
<v Speaker 1>that's why the reluctance to probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause once that's out there,</v>

2934
02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:42.230
<v Speaker 1>even though you didn't break a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2935
02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:43.113
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it also crushes the illusion that </v>

2936
02:19:45.381 --> 02:19:47.840
<v Speaker 1>he's a successful businessman of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

2937
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you don't lose $950,</v>

2938
02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:53.510
<v Speaker 1>million dollars or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing great.</v>

2939
02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a fact.</v>

2940
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:57.020
<v Speaker 1>He's filed bankruptcy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal bankruptcy,</v>

2941
02:19:57.021 --> 02:19:58.940
<v Speaker 1>but a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few times.</v>

2942
02:19:58.941 --> 02:19:59.774
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was weird when he was talking on </v>

2943
02:20:00.831 --> 02:20:03.540
<v Speaker 1>the debate and hillary brought that up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

2944
02:20:03.541 --> 02:20:04.730
<v Speaker 1>it's because I'm smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:06.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2946
02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't pay taxes because I'm smart.</v>

2947
02:20:09.470 --> 02:20:10.840
<v Speaker 1>You're running for our phone.</v>

2948
02:20:13.290 --> 02:20:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Like people who have paid taxes only </v>
<v Speaker 1>make like 40 grand a year.</v>

2949
02:20:16.470 --> 02:20:18.050
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2950
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:19.700
<v Speaker 1>President camacho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2951
02:20:19.701 --> 02:20:20.534
<v Speaker 1>We might get them to the prophecy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiocracy ways that you think is going </v>

2952
02:20:24.771 --> 02:20:27.140
<v Speaker 1>to happen next because this is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me.</v>

2953
02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:30.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like once we get through him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2954
02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And whether or not he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he can win at this point,</v>

2955
02:20:32.481 --> 02:20:33.760
<v Speaker 1>but I've been wrong before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2956
02:20:34.810 --> 02:20:36.920
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no trump fans are getting better.</v>

2957
02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the hate mail episodes.</v>

2958
02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:47.511
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2963
02:20:57.530 --> 02:20:58.363

<v Speaker 1>black guys,</v>

2981
02:21:49.390 --> 02:21:51.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the dumb shit he's going to do it.</v>

2982
02:21:51.211 --> 02:21:53.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the feeling that he doesn't really</v>

2983
02:21:53.241 --> 02:21:55.580
<v Speaker 1>want to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so either.</v>

2984
02:21:55.650 --> 02:21:58.520
<v Speaker 1>He just likes the attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bit of a megalomaniac.</v>

2985
02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:01.590
<v Speaker 1>he likes people talking about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so well,</v>

2986
02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:02.900
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's saY he gets elected.</v>

2987
02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I really don't see him doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the motivation?</v>

2988
02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:06.943
<v Speaker 1>So was just going to be in the headLines</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and he wants to be referred to as </v>

2989
02:22:10.521 --> 02:22:11.354
<v Speaker 1>mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>President.</v>

2990
02:22:11.390 --> 02:22:12.223
<v Speaker 1>I think he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that once you get in </v>

2991
02:22:16.101 --> 02:22:17.210
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean once,</v>

2992
02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:18.073
<v Speaker 1>once he's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's not going to want to let it </v>

2993
02:22:19.071 --> 02:22:21.230
<v Speaker 1>go though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's going to actually try to make</v>

2994
02:22:21.231 --> 02:22:22.370
<v Speaker 1>a mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2995
02:22:22.371 --> 02:22:23.630
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some stupid shit.</v>

2996
02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his favorite,</v>

2997
02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:26.483
<v Speaker 1>his perfect scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you would ever want to </v>

2998
02:22:27.841 --> 02:22:30.090
<v Speaker 1>give up running his businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he loves it.</v>

2999
02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:33.060
<v Speaker 1>He loves his lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he wants to be tied to the</v>

3000
02:22:33.061 --> 02:22:33.894
<v Speaker 1>white house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his dream scenario is that this </v>

3001
02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:40.260
<v Speaker 1>is a close race and then he goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically should have won.</v>

3002
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:43.800
<v Speaker 1>this was pretty much rigged and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be another vote count.</v>

3003
02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that about the debate.</v>

3004
02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a real deal.</v>

3005
02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Rigged deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that about one of the.</v>

3006
02:22:51.211 --> 02:22:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3007
02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:53.753
<v Speaker 1>what's it called during when there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>more candidates in the republican </v>

3008
02:22:55.891 --> 02:22:56.724
<v Speaker 1>primaries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost one state and like the day or </v>

3009
02:23:00.091 --> 02:23:01.910
<v Speaker 1>two after he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I won.</v>

3010
02:23:03.130 --> 02:23:05.210
<v Speaker 1>He lost like Iowa or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was mad.</v>

3011
02:23:05.211 --> 02:23:09.660
<v Speaker 1>they got one that didn't want to give it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to even do like,</v>

3012
02:23:09.661 --> 02:23:10.494
<v Speaker 1>what does he want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so amazing that he's this </v>

3013
02:23:12.541 --> 02:23:14.550
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing and he's the nominee.</v>

3014
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:15.953
<v Speaker 1>It's so embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican's embarrassing for all of </v>

<v Speaker 1>they rig the machines.</v>

3051
02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:54.270
<v Speaker 1>The machines were rigged so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have a third party enter data,</v>

3052
02:24:54.271 --> 02:24:56.250
<v Speaker 1>so like not just you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machines were 100 percent hackable and </v>

3056
02:25:04.921 --> 02:25:05.754
<v Speaker 1>they had designed them to be savable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They designed them to have third party </v>

3057
02:25:08.791 --> 02:25:11.070
<v Speaker 1>input and they showed on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hacking democracy.</v>

02:32:18.130 --> 02:32:18.963
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what she went through is </v>

3210
02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:22.590
<v Speaker 1>absolutely terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be really,</v>

3211
02:32:22.591 --> 02:32:23.820
<v Speaker 1>really horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

3212
02:32:24.330 --> 02:32:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to predict what kind of guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>angelina jolie hooks up with?</v>

3213

<v Speaker 1>This long hair wouldn't beads for sure.</v>

3214
02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:34.013
<v Speaker 1>Probably does yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in the peace corps he's going to </v>

3215
02:32:36.031 --> 02:32:40.940
<v Speaker 1>be really poor and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't care about money and um,</v>

3216
02:32:41.490 --> 02:32:44.550
<v Speaker 1>he's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's more of an activist than,</v>

3217
02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:45.493
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't even act right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then she's going to dump him after </v>

3218
02:32:48.151 --> 02:32:48.984
<v Speaker 1>he wants to act because once they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>together for awhile it was going to get </v>

3219
02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:51.894
<v Speaker 1>some offers to do some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's gonna want him to go to a </v>

3220

<v Speaker 1>basketball game.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Maybe one dick.</v>

3346
02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I saw the exhibit when I was living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>boston.</v>

3352
02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.440
<v Speaker 1>blasphemous and the religious people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>super upset because I just,</v>

3353
02:39:04.450 --> 02:39:05.283
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong,</v>

<v Speaker 1>some public funding like for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his art.</v>

<v Speaker 1>or something for his art,</v>

3356
02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:14.633
<v Speaker 1>so we're in the wrong business.</v>

3389
02:40:48.031 --> 02:40:48.864
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a punishment for its role </v>

3390
02:40:51.751 --> 02:40:53.430
<v Speaker 1>in supporting the work of an artist at </v>

3397
02:41:07.771 --> 02:41:08.604
<v Speaker 1>of a robert maplethorpe show at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philadelphia institute of contemporary </v>

3398
02:41:11.581 --> 02:41:12.510
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3399
02:41:12.511 --> 02:41:14.010
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was somebody else.</v>

3400
02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So maplethorpe was just all the fists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and buttholes and stuff.</v>

3401
02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:21.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really was upsetting that they </v>

3402
02:41:23.011 --> 02:41:26.220
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't show that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what the guy is known for it</v>

3403
02:41:26.221 --> 02:41:27.054
<v Speaker 1>don't give me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're looking at patty smith </v>

3404
02:41:28.411 --> 02:41:29.580
<v Speaker 1>portraits the whole time.</v>

3405
02:41:29.850 --> 02:41:30.930
<v Speaker 1>but he did that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3406
02:41:30.931 --> 02:41:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it,</v>

3407
02:41:32.370 --> 02:41:33.203
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we have such a hard time with </v>

3408
02:41:35.311 --> 02:41:37.590
<v Speaker 1>sex?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of stuff,</v>

3409
02:41:37.591 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 1>but not a hard time with violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about.</v>

3410
02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:42.500
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3411
02:41:42.570 --> 02:41:44.520
<v Speaker 1>narcos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so violent,</v>

3412
02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:46.420
<v Speaker 1>so crazy violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3413
02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:50.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot of sex in that show too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're.</v>

3414
02:41:50.731 --> 02:41:53.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't,</v>

3415
02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:54.293
<v Speaker 1>we don't have nearly as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to give away any </v>

3416
02:41:57.121 --> 02:41:58.950
<v Speaker 1>spoiler alerts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a,</v>

3417
02:41:58.990 --> 02:42:02.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a scene where a kid gets shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say when,</v>

3418
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:04.470
<v Speaker 1>when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it happens,</v>

3419
02:42:04.471 --> 02:42:09.240
<v Speaker 1>it's so graphic and I was thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so crazy that they can show that kind</v>

3420
02:42:09.241 --> 02:42:13.050
<v Speaker 1>of violence like violence and adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus against a kid.</v>

3421
02:42:13.530 --> 02:42:16.470
<v Speaker 1>But you could never show like actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

3422
02:42:17.450 --> 02:42:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3428
02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:35.010

<v Speaker 1>She said that really,</v>

3429
02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:35.920
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what does he think?</v>

3432
02:42:41.501 --> 02:42:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was making the same argument,</v>

3433
02:42:44.251 --> 02:42:45.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was making the argument like,</v>

3434
02:42:45.721 --> 02:42:50.721
<v Speaker 1>why is it okay to have violence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it okay to have all these aspects</v>

3435
02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:54.000
<v Speaker 1>of people kissing and grabbing each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other's asses?</v>

3436
02:42:54.001 --> 02:42:57.280
<v Speaker 1>We can have actual sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also just wanted a blow job.</v>

3437
02:42:57.330 --> 02:42:58.163
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

<v Speaker 2>football shows where they called fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport sash or whatever,</v>

3457
02:43:55.710 --> 02:43:58.690
<v Speaker 2>and these guys that are working on these</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

3458
02:43:58.691 --> 02:44:00.280
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking basset hounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3459
02:44:00.310 --> 02:44:02.680
<v Speaker 2>They're mostly older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unattractIve,</v>

3460
02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:07.150
<v Speaker 2>and there's no way a woman would be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get away with looking like shit on tv</v>

3461
02:44:07.151 --> 02:44:09.760
<v Speaker 2>the way these dudes do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their football experts.</v>

3462
02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3463
02:44:11.010 --> 02:44:11.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3464
02:44:11.921 --> 02:44:14.770
<v Speaker 2>but there's no attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the news,</v>

3465
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:19.150
<v Speaker 2>but even show on news though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standards.</v>

3466
02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:21.820
<v Speaker 2>It's true that for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for men.</v>

3467
02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way different.</v>

3468
02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:25.600
<v Speaker 2>There's some real fucking dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3469
02:44:25.810 --> 02:44:28.840
<v Speaker 2>The women can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They either had to be really old,</v>

3470
02:44:28.841 --> 02:44:30.850
<v Speaker 2>like Barbara Walters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stateswoman.</v>

3471
02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:32.313
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting is they have </v>

3472
02:44:35.201 --> 02:44:38.950
<v Speaker 2>these like really like ridiculously hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>women and they're reading the news,</v>

3473
02:44:38.951 --> 02:44:40.510
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have to know shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the news.</v>

3474
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:42.340
<v Speaker 2>They just have to read off a </v>
<v Speaker 2>teleprompter.</v>

3475
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:45.850
<v Speaker 2>It's the comparison with the football </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys is worth because football is one of</v>

3476
02:44:45.851 --> 02:44:47.830
<v Speaker 2>those things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit about football,</v>

3477
02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:48.753
<v Speaker 2>but there's some dudes who knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything about fulbright and they can </v>

3478
02:44:51.551 --> 02:44:52.384
<v Speaker 2>recall games from the 19 sixties and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>play that was news to win super bowl 44 </v>

3479
02:44:57.281 --> 02:45:00.400
<v Speaker 2>and those fucking guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They essentially to.</v>

3480
02:45:00.430 --> 02:45:01.263
<v Speaker 2>They do what you do in that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at a play that took seven seconds </v>

3481
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:08.230
<v Speaker 2>and tell you everything that happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way you can tell.</v>

3482
02:45:08.470 --> 02:45:12.010
<v Speaker 2>You know how a guy got beat like in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut.</v>

<v Speaker 2>his arm drop there.</v>

3484
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:17.710
<v Speaker 2>The guy saw an opportunity to put him in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chokehold like you see that fast.</v>

3485
02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:20.620
<v Speaker 2>These guys go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they watch the play in right away.</v>

3486
02:45:20.621 --> 02:45:21.454
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what happened was that linebacker </v>

3487
02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:25.780
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got tricked into thinking he,</v>

3488
02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:27.070
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he bit for the fake.</v>

3489
02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:28.113
<v Speaker 2>So he came up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It opened up this guy to run across the </v>

3490
02:45:29.711 --> 02:45:31.540
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they do that in two seconds,</v>

3491
02:45:31.541 --> 02:45:33.880
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be hot.</v>

3492

3496
02:45:47.530 --> 02:45:48.363
<v Speaker 2>of his life and they're letting that guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>on tv and they're complaining that </v>

3497
02:45:50.471 --> 02:45:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Barbara Walters is too old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

3498
02:45:52.901 --> 02:45:54.630
<v Speaker 2>This guy can barely get through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking set.</v>

3499
02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:55.480
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3500
02:45:55.481 --> 02:45:56.141
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3501
02:45:56.141 --> 02:45:56.974
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was definitelY old and not tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not camera ready and as they would say </v>

3502
02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:02.220
<v Speaker 2>like diane soria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

3503
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:03.280
<v Speaker 2>she's still hanging in there,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're still strong,</v>

3505
02:46:04.810 --> 02:46:09.560
<v Speaker 2>but that's like another state's woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman who's established,</v>

3506
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:10.450
<v Speaker 2>respected,</v>

3507
02:46:10.450 --> 02:46:11.283

<v Speaker 1>She's not fuckable as long as she's of </v>

3508
02:46:12.981 --> 02:46:17.570
<v Speaker 1>the age where she's unbelievable.</v>

<v Speaker 1>anderson wants to though.</v>

3553
02:48:07.630 --> 02:48:08.463
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can say that and that makes </v>

3554
02:48:10.221 --> 02:48:11.054
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm supposed to be down with like </v>

3555
02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:15.710
<v Speaker 1>the women's movement that says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an expression.</v>

3556
02:48:15.711 --> 02:48:18.560
<v Speaker 1>That's her expression of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But leonard and it is.</v>

3557
02:48:18.561 --> 02:48:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

3558
02:48:19.791 --> 02:48:20.624
<v Speaker 1>if you're a professional news caster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that really what you want to be </v>

3559
02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:25.250
<v Speaker 1>presenting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3560
02:48:25.270 --> 02:48:28.420
<v Speaker 1>the thing is it didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3561
02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:31.970
<v Speaker 1>What hot news caster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3562
02:48:31.971 --> 02:48:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Well they figured out they can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratings.</v>

3563
02:48:33.441 --> 02:48:34.274
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could get men to pay attention </v>

3564
02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:36.673
<v Speaker 1>because here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ratings to men that are really into </v>

3565
02:48:40.161 --> 02:48:42.560
<v Speaker 1>politics are almost entirely unfuckable.</v>

3566
02:48:42.820 --> 02:48:44.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why they get really into </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

3567
02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Usually they're married and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3568
02:48:46.851 --> 02:48:47.684
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just stay around out and </v>

3569
02:48:49.371 --> 02:48:52.790
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking chin starts dropping and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they remember the good old days and they</v>

3570
02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:55.130
<v Speaker 1>watched that fox news and they see </v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

3571
02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:57.170
<v Speaker 1>They're so hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they treat.</v>

3572
02:48:57.360 --> 02:48:58.193
<v Speaker 1>Their wife is yelling at them and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just ice queens on fox and was a </v>

3573
02:49:02.660 --> 02:49:03.411
<v Speaker 1>publican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3574
02:49:03.411 --> 02:49:04.880
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all the same.</v>

3575
02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:07.770
<v Speaker 1>If you go to that image on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3576
02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:12.340
<v Speaker 1>those have all been women that have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>news on on.</v>

3577
02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:15.080
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The robots a robot.</v>

3578
02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:19.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a real doll factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun and super hot,</v>

3579
02:49:20.830 --> 02:49:21.631
<v Speaker 1>but I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3580
02:49:21.631 --> 02:49:23.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes total sense.</v>

3581
02:49:23.701 --> 02:49:25.770
<v Speaker 1>They crushed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They crush the ratings Man.</v>

3582
02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:28.080
<v Speaker 1>That I don't know if they do anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

3583
02:49:28.410 --> 02:49:31.860
<v Speaker 1>As far as the of the cable news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're.</v>

3584
02:49:32.010 --> 02:49:32.843
<v Speaker 1>I think they dominate sumner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Just read recently that they weren't </v>

3585
02:49:35.401 --> 02:49:36.960
<v Speaker 1>doing so well anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3586
02:49:37.430 --> 02:49:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think cable news is doing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well anymore.</v>

3587
02:49:39.570 --> 02:49:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe in the grand scheme of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3588
02:49:41.071 --> 02:49:46.050
<v Speaker 1>but within the cable news competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they.</v>

3589
02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:50.400
<v Speaker 1>They dominate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find out who got my cable news,</v>

3590
02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:51.833
<v Speaker 1>cable ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fox beat cnn and msnbc combined method </v>

3591
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:58.470
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3592
02:49:58.730 --> 02:49:59.563
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should be wearing a laundry </v>

3593
02:50:01.021 --> 02:50:01.854
<v Speaker 1>during your mom's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that goes up or down </v>

3594
02:50:04.711 --> 02:50:05.544
<v Speaker 1>depending on who's president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a wonder is when you have a </v>

3595
02:50:08.041 --> 02:50:10.920
<v Speaker 1>republican president of cnn gets a bump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3596
02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Because people are pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3597
02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:13.433
<v Speaker 1>that's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is probably how it works because </v>

3598
02:50:15.181 --> 02:50:16.014
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fox news thrives on every obama story </v>

3599
02:50:18.691 --> 02:50:19.530
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

3600
02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:21.720
<v Speaker 1>But to cnn go deep to do they go with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3601
02:50:21.721 --> 02:50:24.330
<v Speaker 1>a scantily clad beautIful ladies as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3602
02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:26.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch cnn.</v>

3603
02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:30.000
<v Speaker 1>They have pretty ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty,</v>

3604
02:50:30.001 --> 02:50:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have more diverse.</v>

3605
02:50:32.700 --> 02:50:37.700
<v Speaker 1>A couple of basset hounds tooth but they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a couple of cuties.</v>

3606
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't have to go over each one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3607
02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:41.120
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3608
02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:42.173
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's odd about it is that </v>

3609
02:50:43.351 --> 02:50:44.620
<v Speaker 1>had never existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

3610
02:50:44.621 --> 02:50:46.320
<v Speaker 1>once they figured that formula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3611
02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:49.110
<v Speaker 1>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we do now.</v>

3612
02:50:49.170 --> 02:50:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and football,</v>

3613
02:50:51.310 --> 02:50:54.090
<v Speaker 1>they're reporting from the ground or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of the guys.</v>

3615
02:51:00.250 --> 02:51:02.520
<v Speaker 1>There are some really good ones though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some really good reporters.</v>

3616
02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Female reporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3621
02:51:12.350 --> 02:51:13.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few really good ones.</v>

3622
02:51:13.591 --> 02:51:15.900
<v Speaker 1>People they got the hot thing was when.</v>

3623
02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your name?</v>

3624
02:51:16.891 --> 02:51:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Aaron andrews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got her.</v>

3625
02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:20.393
<v Speaker 1>They peeped her fucking creeps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cut a hole in her fucking hotel </v>

3626
02:51:24.541 --> 02:51:28.770
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her and like recorded her fucking gross.</v>

3627
02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3628
02:51:31.650 --> 02:51:33.180
<v Speaker 1>She knows her shit though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know.</v>

3629
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:35.220
<v Speaker 1>She knows her sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows football.</v>

3630
02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:38.550
<v Speaker 1>It is funny though because when we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not football,</v>

3631
02:51:38.551 --> 02:51:39.384
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I said the most people guys that </v>

3632
02:51:41.551 --> 02:51:42.384
<v Speaker 1>are into politics or unfuckable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I mean by that honestly is what </v>

3633
02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:45.713
<v Speaker 1>they're usually like guys who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>married and have families have their </v>

3634
02:51:48.661 --> 02:51:49.494
<v Speaker 1>dads and they worry about their income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They worried about where their money's </v>

3635
02:51:52.141 --> 02:51:52.974
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a giant subject of the </v>

3636
02:51:55.051 --> 02:51:59.760
<v Speaker 1>young single man until trump came along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3637
02:52:00.300 --> 02:52:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Trump was like one of the first ones I </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed like a lot of like young,</v>

3638
02:52:05.291 --> 02:52:08.340
<v Speaker 1>single guys that were really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3639
02:52:08.890 --> 02:52:10.720
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened there?</v>

3640
02:52:10.730 --> 02:52:13.340
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they grew up with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Name recognition.</v>

3641
02:52:13.341 --> 02:52:15.920
<v Speaker 6>He's on that reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3642
02:52:15.940 --> 02:52:17.780
<v Speaker 6>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's on tv.</v>

3643
02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:19.730
<v Speaker 6>That guy's a reality star.</v>

3644
02:52:19.810 --> 02:52:20.643
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just that he was so outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the the the political speak and he </v>

3645
02:52:25.511 --> 02:52:26.980
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

3646

<v Speaker 1>Shit keeps happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking do just chicks </v>

3648
02:52:32.711 --> 02:52:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Falling down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3649
02:52:38.110 --> 02:52:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It is pretty hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

3650
02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:41.713
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even insinuated that she probably </v>

3651
02:52:42.821 --> 02:52:44.810
<v Speaker 1>wasn't faithful either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3652
02:52:45.330 --> 02:52:46.163
<v Speaker 1>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes for it and that's why he's got </v>

3653
02:52:48.551 --> 02:52:49.384
<v Speaker 1>the fan trumpeter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imitates hillary clinton for stumbling </v>

3654
02:52:51.251 --> 02:52:53.710
<v Speaker 1>at nine slash 11 memorial questions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>loyalty to bill.</v>

3656
02:52:56.550 --> 02:52:57.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at the people behind them </v>

3657
02:52:58.330 --> 02:53:01.240
<v Speaker 1>clapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually they're holding up cameras.</v>

3660
02:53:06.791 --> 02:53:10.420
<v Speaker 1>and if you look back at photos from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 fifties or sixties,</v>

3661
02:53:10.430 --> 02:53:13.720
<v Speaker 1>like watch the nixon debates with </v>
<v Speaker 1>kennedy and you look into the audience,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something up anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do you think happens next?</v>

3682
02:54:04.350 --> 02:54:07.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're getting at earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like after these two?</v>

3684
02:54:10.330 --> 02:54:13.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the deep end we're in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the deepest deep never sure.</v>

3685
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

3686
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:16.560
<v Speaker 1>The only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only good out of it,</v>

3687
02:54:16.561 --> 02:54:17.394
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not being patronizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only good out of It honestly is </v>

3688
02:54:20.341 --> 02:54:22.620
<v Speaker 1>we get to see a woman be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3689
02:54:22.850 --> 02:54:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

3690
02:54:23.941 --> 02:54:24.774
<v Speaker 1>if she was a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would be thought of as someone </v>

3691
02:54:27.270 --> 02:54:30.390
<v Speaker 1>deeply entrenched in the system that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been proven to be full of shit,</v>

3692
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:33.300
<v Speaker 1>has been proven to be somewhat option </v>
<v Speaker 1>and corruption,</v>

3693
02:54:33.750 --> 02:54:34.583
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing on their position to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous amounts of money and there's </v>

3694
02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:38.193
<v Speaker 1>so much going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you basically criticize </v>

3695
02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:45.690
<v Speaker 1>about politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would fit the bill for that.</v>

3696
02:54:45.870 --> 02:54:46.703
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next president's going to be </v>

3697
02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:51.370
<v Speaker 1>nonbinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

3698
02:54:52.670 --> 02:54:53.930
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean we got the black guy.</v>

3699
02:54:53.931 --> 02:54:56.270
<v Speaker 6>We had obama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now it's the woman's turn.</v>

3700
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Did you see pansexual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pansexual,</v>

3701
02:54:58.841 --> 02:55:02.640
<v Speaker 1>and some woman came out as pansexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was the first politician to come out</v>

3702
02:55:02.641 --> 02:55:04.220
<v Speaker 1>as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

3703
02:55:04.340 --> 02:55:05.173
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next is the pan sexual president could </v>

3704
02:55:07.971 --> 02:55:09.620
<v Speaker 1>be like a gender thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pansexual,</v>

3705
02:55:10.750 --> 02:55:12.500
<v Speaker 1>trans president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it means.</v>

<v Speaker 1>middle east,</v>

3789
02:58:45.841 --> 02:58:46.674
<v Speaker 1>like Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so volatile because they have </v>

3790
02:58:47.940 --> 02:58:52.410
<v Speaker 1>weapons in South Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we really like South Korea.</v>

3795
02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:11.370

<v Speaker 1>it's so strange.</v>

3796
02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know what?</v>

3797
02:59:14.820 --> 02:59:15.653
<v Speaker 1>It also disturbs me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were so calm about all the </v>

3798
02:59:19.021 --> 02:59:19.854
<v Speaker 1>conflict and the rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's not really that much </v>

3799
02:59:21.931 --> 02:59:22.764
<v Speaker 1>over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we've kind of minimalize it and we </v>

3800
02:59:24.871 --> 02:59:29.871
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on some other nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we fill our face with sugar and the rest</v>

3801
02:59:31.201 --> 02:59:33.900
<v Speaker 1>of the world is embroiled in all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles.</v>

3802
02:59:33.901 --> 02:59:34.734
<v Speaker 1>Like indian Pakistan are right next to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and they fucking hate each </v>

3803
02:59:37.081 --> 02:59:37.914
<v Speaker 1>other and russia's invading the Ukraine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's all this crazy shit that's </v>

3804
02:59:41.671 --> 02:59:42.504
<v Speaker 1>going on with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this putin's almost getting </v>

3805
02:59:45.211 --> 02:59:47.380
<v Speaker 1>assassinated and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're like,</v>

3806
02:59:47.460 --> 02:59:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I want a latte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angelina broke up yet,</v>

3807
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:52.663
<v Speaker 1>but it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were isolated geographically till </v>

3808
02:59:55.800 --> 02:59:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

3809
02:59:57.001 --> 02:59:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's isolated.</v>

3810
02:59:58.360 --> 03:00:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Australia is the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3811
03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:01.793
<v Speaker 1>what we call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to learn how to talk </v>

3812
03:00:04.861 --> 03:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>different though and driving the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the road.</v>

3813
03:00:06.570 --> 03:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3814
03:00:08.011 --> 03:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>They need to fix that in order for us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonize.</v>

3815
03:00:11.670 --> 03:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you guys on that side?</v>

3816
03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is counter.</v>

3817
03:00:15.871 --> 03:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Is there a reason for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3818
03:00:17.791 --> 03:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>the logical reason that we don't see as </v>
<v Speaker 1>americans,</v>

3819
03:00:19.861 --> 03:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>like the metric system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3820
03:00:21.241 --> 03:00:22.074
<v Speaker 1>they got it from england,</v>
<v Speaker 1>england had it because england is so </v>

3821
03:00:25.261 --> 03:00:26.094
<v Speaker 1>fucking old that back in the day they </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to ride horses and when you would </v>

3822
03:00:29.791 --> 03:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>be like riding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want people that were opposing</v>

3823
03:00:33.511 --> 03:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you on your right hand side so you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>hack it them with your sword.</v>

3824
03:00:36.690 --> 03:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really impressive.</v>

3825
03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not that impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've looked at up though,</v>

3826
03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>because most people were right handed or</v>
<v Speaker 1>right handed,</v>

3827
03:00:45.450 --> 03:00:46.283
<v Speaker 1>so you'd want to be on the left hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>side so you could chop someone's head </v>

3828
03:00:48.151 --> 03:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>off for the sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really good.</v>

3829
03:00:50.230 --> 03:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3830
03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense.</v>

3831
03:00:51.841 --> 03:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Over here we grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realized,</v>

3832
03:00:54.211 --> 03:00:55.044
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could Just shoot someone chopped </v>

3833
03:00:57.450 --> 03:00:59.890
<v Speaker 1>away with a fucking sword.</v>

<v Speaker 1>throw things to the air yet.</v>

03:03:22.481 --> 03:03:23.210
<v Speaker 6>This is going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>happened</v>

3897
03:03:23.210 --> 03:03:24.043
<v Speaker 1>to you if you steal this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to the other day about </v>

3898
03:03:27.591 --> 03:03:30.110
<v Speaker 1>the inquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fascinating man,</v>

3899
03:03:30.111 --> 03:03:30.944
<v Speaker 1>and it was talking about how everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>had gotten so crazy that they would try </v>

3900
03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:36.633
<v Speaker 1>to dig through any means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THey would try to elicit a confession </v>

3901
03:03:39.591 --> 03:03:40.424
<v Speaker 1>out of you that you had done something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was blasphemous or done something </v>

3902
03:03:44.030 --> 03:03:48.110
<v Speaker 1>against the lord and they could torture </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in order to do that.</v>

3903
03:03:48.140 --> 03:03:50.390
<v Speaker 1>They could torture you in order to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that confession out of you.</v>

3904
03:03:50.870 --> 03:03:51.703
<v Speaker 1>And they just start torturing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like everybody was guilty and they </v>

3905
03:03:54.381 --> 03:03:56.220
<v Speaker 1>were just killing people like crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>jesus.</v>

3906
03:03:56.230 --> 03:03:57.063
<v Speaker 1>And just listening the accounts of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it all went wrong and how they </v>

3907
03:04:00.351 --> 03:04:01.730
<v Speaker 1>started doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3908
03:04:01.940 --> 03:04:05.390
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could see we want to think that</v>

3909
03:04:05.391 --> 03:04:08.360
<v Speaker 1>in today's day and age that this can </v>
<v Speaker 1>never happen.</v>

3910
03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Like we're past that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3911
03:04:09.801 --> 03:04:11.990
<v Speaker 1>we're just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have too much information.</v>

3912
03:04:11.991 --> 03:04:16.760
<v Speaker 1>We were to evolve or to our culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our civilizations move far too fast,</v>

3913
03:04:16.970 --> 03:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>but there's spots on earth where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't like North Korea,</v>

3914
03:04:20.390 --> 03:04:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you know what their spots on earth where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't moved past that.</v>

3915
03:04:23.540 --> 03:04:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Like Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about.</v>

3916
03:04:25.470 --> 03:04:27.570
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it goes well and we still punish people.</v>

3917
03:04:27.571 --> 03:04:30.240
<v Speaker 6>We still kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We just do it behind closed doors in the</v>

3918
03:04:30.241 --> 03:04:33.260
<v Speaker 6>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We may get magnified quite dignified.</v>

3919
03:04:33.261 --> 03:04:33.961
<v Speaker 6>We're still murder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3920
03:04:33.961 --> 03:04:34.290
<v Speaker 6>and if you.</v>

3921
03:04:34.290 --> 03:04:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I rob somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make you a slave,</v>

3922
03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asleep,</v>

3923
03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:39.270
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just dignified because it's,</v>

3924
03:04:39.290 --> 03:04:42.810
<v Speaker 6>it's in a building that's clean and we </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't see it.</v>

3925
03:04:42.811 --> 03:04:44.460
<v Speaker 6>You don't Have to see it so it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>exist.</v>

3926
03:04:44.490 --> 03:04:46.560
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's still horrific</v>

3927
03:04:46.740 --> 03:04:49.870
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just,</v>

3928
03:04:50.010 --> 03:04:50.843
<v Speaker 1>we like to think because we can send a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video through the sky and it arrives on </v>

3929
03:04:54.541 --> 03:04:55.374
<v Speaker 1>your phone from 50 miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to think that we're way more </v>

3930
03:04:59.011 --> 03:05:00.030
<v Speaker 1>advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really are.</v>

3931
03:05:01.930 --> 03:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>We're so close to monkeys were so </v>

<v Speaker 6>we're on the verge of death all the </v>

3934
03:05:07.371 --> 03:05:09.140
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had this girl right to me.</v>

3935

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3951
03:05:45.550 --> 03:05:46.383
<v Speaker 1>And people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to save the barrier is really </v>

3952
03:05:47.441 --> 03:05:48.274
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll keep him around to kill more </v>

3953
03:05:48.941 --> 03:05:49.774
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he shouldn't have been around the </v>

3954
03:05:52.091 --> 03:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>baron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His baby mama bear protects her babies.</v>

3955
03:05:56.210 --> 03:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Is there a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a problem?</v>

3956
03:05:58.080 --> 03:05:58.913
<v Speaker 1>Do we have like a big event?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an issue with grizzly bears in </v>

3957
03:06:01.901 --> 03:06:02.734
<v Speaker 1>the greater yellowstone ecosystem that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people think that there are too </v>

3958
03:06:05.711 --> 03:06:08.050
<v Speaker 1>many bears and they want them to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>classified.</v>

3959
03:06:08.080 --> 03:06:08.913
<v Speaker 1>The environmentalist disagree and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that the bears were brought to the </v>

3960
03:06:12.281 --> 03:06:14.440
<v Speaker 1>brink of extinction and only through </v>
<v Speaker 1>diligent work,</v>

3961
03:06:14.441 --> 03:06:15.274
<v Speaker 1>have they been brought back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where they're at now where </v>

3962
03:06:17.261 --> 03:06:18.094
<v Speaker 1>they're thriving.</v>

3963
03:06:18.400 --> 03:06:22.870
<v Speaker 1>The problem is super hard to accurately </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimate hoW many bears there are.</v>

3964
03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:24.010
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3965
03:06:24.010 --> 03:06:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but you see a lot of them and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are out there all the time,</v>

3966
03:06:27.071 --> 03:06:28.840
<v Speaker 1>the hikers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sportsmen,</v>

3967
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:29.703
<v Speaker 1>meaning the hunters and the fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see a lot of them and they're </v>

3968
03:06:32.351 --> 03:06:33.184
<v Speaker 1>seeing more of them than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're seeing actually less black </v>

3969
03:06:35.381 --> 03:06:38.020
<v Speaker 1>bears and more grizzly bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

3970
03:06:38.021 --> 03:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>it used to be the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3971
03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazY animal man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ha.</v>

3972
03:06:43.500 --> 03:06:44.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brown bears are like the real </v>

3973
03:06:45.311 --> 03:06:46.180
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3974
03:06:46.181 --> 03:06:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Aren't they even bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are super aggressive.</v>

3975
03:06:48.760 --> 03:06:50.140
<v Speaker 1>They're super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

3976
03:06:50.141 --> 03:06:53.080
<v Speaker 1>super Aggressive sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they don't give a fuck.</v>

3977
03:06:53.290 --> 03:06:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really spot where there's this,</v>

3978
03:06:57.121 --> 03:06:57.954
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this river that runs through Alaska and </v>

3979
03:07:00.811 --> 03:07:05.130
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredibly common place to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears to the point where there's</v>

3980
03:07:05.131 --> 03:07:07.920
<v Speaker 1>a video of it where there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jamie,</v>

03:07:08.730 --> 03:07:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Like 15 bears is like 15 grizzly bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this one area because there's so many</v>

3985
03:07:19.861 --> 03:07:20.694
<v Speaker 1>there's so much food for the bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bears never killed people and it's </v>

3986
03:07:23.341 --> 03:07:26.220
<v Speaker 1>like one of the safest places to observe</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears in Alaska.</v>

3987
03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:28.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a killer.</v>

<v Speaker 4>bear's leg.</v>

4056
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:31.720
<v Speaker 4>Nothing can take down a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in nature.</v>

4057
03:10:31.930 --> 03:10:33.010
<v Speaker 1>No humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The king.</v>

4058
03:10:33.100 --> 03:10:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Only humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When humans weren't,</v>

4059
03:10:36.010 --> 03:10:36.843
<v Speaker 1>they actually think there was a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the short face bear that </v>

4060
03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:43.090
<v Speaker 1>dominated the bering strait so </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerfully.</v>

4061
03:10:43.150 --> 03:10:45.100
<v Speaker 1>It was so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was such a dangerous animal.</v>

4062
03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:48.940
<v Speaker 1>They think it might have prevented </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from immigrating to north America</v>

4063
03:10:49.330 --> 03:10:50.163
<v Speaker 1>like buy like thousands of years because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing was so dominant that it is a </v>

4064
03:10:54.731 --> 03:10:55.564
<v Speaker 1>huge aggressive grizzly bear type </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature that lived during the ice age </v>

4065
03:10:58.991 --> 03:11:03.070
<v Speaker 1>and it was so dangerous that it kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from speculation.</v>

4066
03:11:03.071 --> 03:11:04.630
<v Speaker 1>But look at the size of the god damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

4067
03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:06.033
<v Speaker 1>That's the short face bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like even bigger than a goddamn </v>

4068
03:11:08.460 --> 03:11:09.910
<v Speaker 1>grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

4069
03:11:10.580 --> 03:11:11.413

4070
03:11:12.881 --> 03:11:13.714
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what it would've looked </v>

4071
03:11:14.081 --> 03:11:14.400
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

4072
03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is a short face bear.</v>

4074
03:11:18.401 --> 03:11:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Tom is a bear that went extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was way bigger than a grizzly.</v>

4075
03:11:22.660 --> 03:11:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the hulk.</v>

4076
03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>The hulk was a bear so crazy that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be a real thing in north America</v>

4077
03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:34.900
<v Speaker 1>and they think tom was saying that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that thing.</v>

4078
03:11:34.901 --> 03:11:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bigger than a buffalo.</v>

4079
03:11:37.090 --> 03:11:37.923
<v Speaker 1>Those thing woulD take out buffalo's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that they were fearsome </v>

4080
03:11:40.451 --> 03:11:43.840
<v Speaker 1>predators and they may have prevented </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from immigrating to north America</v>

4081
03:11:44.050 --> 03:11:49.050
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that thing would die a song die.</v>

4082
03:11:49.220 --> 03:11:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

4083
03:11:50.620 --> 03:11:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jesus christ.</v>

4084
03:11:52.630 --> 03:11:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real thing.</v>

4085
03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>What the hell was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane?</v>

4086
03:11:58.630 --> 03:12:03.250

<v Speaker 1>Terrible teeth on that thing.</v>

4087
03:12:04.900 --> 03:12:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Good lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just.</v>

4088
03:12:07.300 --> 03:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of.</v>

4089
03:12:08.290 --> 03:12:09.123
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so torn on these Kinds of things </v>

4090
03:12:10.271 --> 03:12:12.310
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's cool that grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears are alive.</v>

4091
03:12:12.370 --> 03:12:13.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool too.</v>

4092
03:12:13.111 --> 03:12:14.110
<v Speaker 1>You can go see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4093
03:12:14.590 --> 03:12:17.300
<v Speaker 1>But not if you're that dude that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up today face.</v>

4094
03:12:17.350 --> 03:12:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hunted a bear.</v>

4095
03:12:19.300 --> 03:12:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black bears.</v>

4096
03:12:20.530 --> 03:12:21.363
<v Speaker 1>Black bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that like why you don't really eat </v>

4097
03:12:24.370 --> 03:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>brown bears or you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't because they eat a</v>

4098
03:12:28.121 --> 03:12:30.860
<v Speaker 1>lot of carcasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So apparently they taste bad.</v>

4099
03:12:32.380 --> 03:12:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Black bears don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blackberries taste good date more.</v>

4100
03:12:35.380 --> 03:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more plants.</v>

4101
03:12:37.220 --> 03:12:39.040
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still eat carcasses.</v>

4102
03:12:39.310 --> 03:12:42.460
<v Speaker 1>They still kill things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did do a lot of cannibalism.</v>

4103
03:12:42.850 --> 03:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the big issue with black bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4104
03:12:45.470 --> 03:12:48.000
<v Speaker 4>I had such animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are.</v>

4105
03:12:49.470 --> 03:12:50.071
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4106
03:12:50.071 --> 03:12:51.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean as like a corny joke,</v>

4107
03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:55.620
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's males killing lions.</v>

4108
03:12:56.840 --> 03:12:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Lions don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4109
03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:01.100
<v Speaker 1>just kill them there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill them to keep them from growing</v>

4110
03:13:01.101 --> 03:13:05.660
<v Speaker 1>up and becoming the male competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bears do that.</v>

4111
03:13:05.661 --> 03:13:07.640
<v Speaker 1>They think bears are doing it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're hungry.</v>

4112
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:09.583
<v Speaker 1>And also because they think it might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to bring the women back into </v>

4113
03:13:12.381 --> 03:13:13.660
<v Speaker 1>estrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4114
03:13:13.770 --> 03:13:15.080
<v Speaker 1>But that's speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

4115
03:13:15.081 --> 03:13:17.350
<v Speaker 1>there's polar bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polar bears are.</v>

4116
03:13:17.620 --> 03:13:21.140
<v Speaker 1>There are 100 percent cannibals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the males.</v>

4117
03:13:21.740 --> 03:13:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>

4118
03:13:22.700 --> 03:13:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I've watched her ecosystem is basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinking,</v>

4119
03:13:25.461 --> 03:13:27.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean supposedlY,</v>

4120
03:13:27.860 --> 03:13:28.940
<v Speaker 1>but you know what they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4121
03:13:28.941 --> 03:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell who's right because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4122
03:13:31.550 --> 03:13:32.383
<v Speaker 1>the wildlife biologists and the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who measure bare numbers versus the </v>

<v Speaker 1>One or see one where you're like,</v>

4239
03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I got to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch of shit.</v>

4240
03:18:32.250 --> 03:18:33.083
<v Speaker 1>One of them was doing the opiod anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>show because opie and anthony show was </v>

4241
03:18:35.431 --> 03:18:36.660
<v Speaker 1>just like a hangout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4242
03:18:36.661 --> 03:18:39.580
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have a formula to it.</v>

4243
03:18:39.970 --> 03:18:40.803
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have a format necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would come in and a bunch of </v>

4244
03:18:42.901 --> 03:18:45.870
<v Speaker 1>comments to come in and they'll just </v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking and it would be hilarious.</v>

4245
03:18:45.871 --> 03:18:46.704
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people that knew everybody </v>

4246
03:18:47.651 --> 03:18:49.270
<v Speaker 1>and we all sit around and just joke </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

4247
03:18:49.271 --> 03:18:51.070
<v Speaker 1>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun hang.</v>

4248
03:18:51.490 --> 03:18:52.323
<v Speaker 1>Then anthony kumina started doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing called live from the compound </v>

4249
03:18:55.030 --> 03:18:56.820
<v Speaker 1>where you put up a green screen in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement.</v>

4250
03:18:56.830 --> 03:18:57.663
<v Speaker 1>He had a whole lot professional desk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional cameras and he's just a </v>

4251
03:19:00.461 --> 03:19:01.294
<v Speaker 1>maniac and he would do karaoke holding a</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine gun and he would have a </v>

4252
03:19:04.481 --> 03:19:06.430
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the background and be like manhattan,</v>

4253
03:19:06.431 --> 03:19:07.600
<v Speaker 1>who does change the bat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4254
03:19:07.601 --> 03:19:09.370
<v Speaker 1>but that would be an amazing thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

4255
03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:12.190
<v Speaker 1>And so when he was doIng live from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>compound,</v>

4256
03:19:12.280 --> 03:19:14.320
<v Speaker 1>he was doing it on one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming services.</v>

4257
03:19:14.470 --> 03:19:15.303
<v Speaker 1>So then we started doing the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and red band on ustream just started </v>

4258
03:19:19.931 --> 03:19:21.730
<v Speaker 1>one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we started doing it on.</v>

4259
03:19:21.970 --> 03:19:26.970
<v Speaker 1>We do it in green rooms first it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>even pre youtube or pre ustream,</v>

4260
03:19:27.970 --> 03:19:28.803
<v Speaker 1>like we did it in cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember we did in and joe yelled at us </v>

4261
03:19:31.511 --> 03:19:32.344
<v Speaker 1>and told us to shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking fucking thing off your </v>

4262
03:19:35.570 --> 03:19:37.160

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4263
03:19:37.630 --> 03:19:39.340
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even have a phone back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4264
03:19:39.850 --> 03:19:40.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4265
03:19:40.060 --> 03:19:42.820
<v Speaker 1>He told us to shut it off and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started.</v>

4266
03:19:42.821 --> 03:19:44.920
<v Speaker 1>We just started doing it that way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it was fun.</v>

4267
03:19:44.921 --> 03:19:45.754
<v Speaker 1>So we started doing it every week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then somewhere along the line I just </v>

4268
03:19:48.671 --> 03:19:52.570
<v Speaker 1>realized it was this way that I can have</v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy conversations with all these</v>

4269
03:19:52.571 --> 03:19:53.404
<v Speaker 1>interesting people and I could get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>once I realized there was a certain </v>

4270
03:19:55.901 --> 03:19:56.734
<v Speaker 1>number of people that were listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could get people to come in and sit </v>

4271
03:19:58.871 --> 03:20:00.700
<v Speaker 1>down and talk to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>something like your show?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I never looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She never looked.</v>

4276
03:20:08.350 --> 03:20:09.510
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>PuT it up again.</v>

4277

4278
03:20:13.181 --> 03:20:16.090

<v Speaker 4>don't you guys feel like that?</v>

4311
03:21:26.360 --> 03:21:29.110
<v Speaker 4>It's my favorite thing that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the best.</v>

4312
03:21:29.170 --> 03:21:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Do you like it more than standup itself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4313
03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:32.673
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Standups.</v>

4314
03:21:32.680 --> 03:21:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Always number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the podcast,</v>

4315
03:21:34.810 --> 03:21:37.450
<v Speaker 4>specially since we'd become parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the one thing that,</v>

4316
03:21:37.480 --> 03:21:40.600
<v Speaker 4>it's the old world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's who we were before.</v>

4317
03:21:40.601 --> 03:21:45.601
<v Speaker 4>It's still juvenile and it's the sealed </v>
<v Speaker 4>hour and a half of just nonsense</v>

4318
03:21:46.190 --> 03:21:48.500
<v Speaker 2>and then we can go back to being </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible adults.</v>

4319
03:21:48.860 --> 03:21:49.693
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of putting it because </v>

4320
03:21:50.541 --> 03:21:53.210
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very juvenile and silly,</v>

4321
03:21:53.270 --> 03:21:56.110
<v Speaker 2>but that's why we have a good time just </v>
<v Speaker 2>being silly on it,</v>

4322
03:21:56.111 --> 03:21:57.130
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4323
03:21:57.140 --> 03:21:57.973
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the big takeaway from your </v>

4324
03:21:59.151 --> 03:22:02.150
<v Speaker 2>podcast is how silly it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys just always look.</v>

4325
03:22:02.200 --> 03:22:06.250
<v Speaker 2>It's the least serious thing ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4326
03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:10.750
<v Speaker 2>No serious conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love black or tom to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you could add a bunch of elements to it </v>

4333
03:22:25.251 --> 03:22:28.660
<v Speaker 2>to once you realize you have all this </v>
