00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is one of the podcasts that we</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:05.581
<v Speaker 1>recorded.</v>

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Why we recording the Scifi show,</v>

4
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan questions,</v>

5
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have listened to those shows and they've said,</v>

7
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.451
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

8
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:13.111
<v Speaker 1>I love your show,</v>

9
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>but the fucking fig podcasts are killing me.</v>

10
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>They actually weren't fake.</v>

11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>The way we did the show was we did everything that we do during a normal podcast</v>

12
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>and [inaudible] and then we just talked about the subject at hand.</v>

13
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:35.391
<v Speaker 1>And of course a lot of times the subjects went on crazy tangents like,</v>

14
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>like any other podcasts that we do.</v>

15
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.491
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>but they were all recorded just like a regular podcast.</v>

17
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>And then we had the Scifi people or um,</v>

18
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:46.741
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

19
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>people at Arthur Smith,</v>

21
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>the production company that made the show,</v>

22
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>edit down portions of it and insert those.</v>

24
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>So there were some things that we said that,</v>

25
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>sort of busy work,</v>

27
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>like w things that we had to say,</v>

28
00:00:59.281 --> 00:00:59.491
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

29
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin,</v>

30
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send you to go check,</v>

31
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.623
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

33
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>There was just stuff that we had to do for the show.</v>

34
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

35
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:12.201
<v Speaker 1>the majority of it was just regular podcast talk and I promise you guys that I</v>

36
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>would release it and uh,</v>

37
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>thanks to the generosity of Scifi,</v>

38
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>they have allowed us to do so.</v>

39
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to put all these podcasts out there.</v>

40
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:22.351
<v Speaker 1>How many of them are there,</v>

41
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:23.184
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

42
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.001
<v Speaker 1>10 or 11.</v>

43
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>So there's like 10 or 11.</v>

44
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>They range between,</v>

45
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>two hours plus for this first one to short ones are probably like an hour</v>

47
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

48
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.223
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>

49
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.293
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

50
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>this is the first one and this one is brought to you by ting.</v>

51
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>So if you go to rogan.ting.com you can find out what Ting is all about.</v>

52
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:47.691
<v Speaker 1>Ting is an excellent cell phone service company that uses the sprint backbone.</v>

53
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And Sprint of course is one of the biggest cell phone providers in the world and</v>

54
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>in the country.</v>

55
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have to worry about getting a crappy cell phone signal along with</v>

56
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.693
<v Speaker 1>saving money.</v>

57
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>But with Tim does is they have it set up so that you only pay for what you use.</v>

58
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>If you have,</v>

59
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>like if you go to the,</v>

60
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:13.431
<v Speaker 1>if you go to rogan.ting.com there's a sign that says 98% of people would save</v>

61
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>money with Ting.</v>

62
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>That's because we do mobile differently and they really do.</v>

63
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not bullshit if you don't use,</v>

64
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.691
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

65
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>say if you have one plan and then you use less than that plan,</v>

66
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>they will credit you the difference on your next bill.</v>

67
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck does that?</v>

68
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>

69
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>nobody does that.</v>

70
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.503
<v Speaker 1>Tim does that.</v>

71
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>$21 is the average monthly bill per device per device for 10 customers.</v>

72
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking nuts.</v>

73
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.090
<v Speaker 1>$440 is the average annual savings per device for a business with 11 to 20</v>

74
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

148
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>like a little pencil that came with it,</v>

149
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>a stylist and he would write on it and they would recognize his handwriting and</v>

150
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucked,</v>

151
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're barely recognized it and it was,</v>

152
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>it had all these like really wonky,</v>

153
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>shitty apps.</v>

154
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>It would crash on you,</v>

155
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>but he was just ranting and raving about how great it was.</v>

156
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Then I saw the motherfucker three months later with an iPhone.</v>

157
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:08.201
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

158
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

159
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>what are you trying to do?</v>

160
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>You fucking tried to sell me on the same shit that you're on.</v>

161
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like people that are on sprint,</v>

162
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>they want you to be on sprint.</v>

163
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>People are on at and t like you needed,</v>

164
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:19.074
<v Speaker 1>you didn't need,</v>

165
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.120
<v Speaker 1>but people who are on ting or on tin because they're saving money son,</v>

166
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.880
<v Speaker 1>they're saving themselves some shackles and they're trying to set up a cell</v>

167
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>phone company that does it ethically,</v>

168

171
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use all of your minutes,</v>

172
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 1>they will knock you down to the lower rate and they will credit you.</v>

173
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.670

<v Speaker 2>when he went out of town,</v>

192

<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>

221
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 2>with without any further ado,</v>

222
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 2>this is a one of many of the Psi Phi podcasts for the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

223
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 2>They kiss you on the Joe Rogan</v>

224
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.590
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

225
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan podcast,</v>

226
00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:48.090
<v Speaker 3>my night all day.</v>

227
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.810
<v Speaker 3>So the Joe Rogan experience podcast,</v>

228
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.673
<v Speaker 3>it's not real.</v>

229
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 3>We're pretending that it's real.</v>

230
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Only 10 carefully,</v>

231
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.710
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

232
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.011
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

233
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:03.970
<v Speaker 3>you should go to Canada.</v>

234
00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:05.010
<v Speaker 3>I heard there's a hum there.</v>

235
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out</v>

236
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.610
<v Speaker 3>and cut.</v>

237
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.633
<v Speaker 3>That was perfect.</v>

238
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.093
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

239
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:19.090
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of people that believe that the government not only is capable</v>

240
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 2>of manipulating the weather,</v>

241
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 2>but does manipulate the weather and we know that they've done certain things</v>

242
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 2>like we know that people can make it rain and not just at a strip club,</v>

243
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.550
<v Speaker 2>but people can make it rain by spraying certain chemicals into the clouds or</v>

244
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.430
<v Speaker 2>seeding clouds,</v>

245
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:36.264
<v Speaker 2>child seating.</v>

246
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 2>They have actually done that in the United Arab Emirates.</v>

247
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 2>They've made it rain 50 times last year,</v>

248
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 2>so they do it basically once a week.</v>

249
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.281
<v Speaker 3>But this is I,</v>

250
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:44.700
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

251
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.600
<v Speaker 3>I've heard it's dangerous.</v>

252
00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:48.960
<v Speaker 3>Like the chemicals that come with a rain are poisonous.</v>

253
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

254
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:49.500
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

255
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.010
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

256
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

257
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:50.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

258
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:50.971
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

259
00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Chemicals sprayed out of an Arabs jet,</v>

260
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.630
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

261
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't think weird.</v>

262
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Let's</v>

263
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 4>say cloud cities that you never in human history has anyone flown over a desert</v>

264
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 4>and sprayed chemicals into a cloud?</v>

265
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:03.350
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

266
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.621
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

267
00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out.</v>

268
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Is Cloud seeding harmful?</v>

269
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what a lot of people want to know.</v>

270
00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:08.204
<v Speaker 2>Duncan Trussell.</v>

271
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.630
<v Speaker 2>And when studying the efficacy and consequences of cloud seeding experience,</v>

272
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.710
<v Speaker 2>the experimenters tend to be biased towards saying cloud seeding with silver</v>

273
00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:19.190
<v Speaker 2>iodide enhances precipitation without negative consequences.</v>

274
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.270
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

275
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.640
<v Speaker 2>much of the literature substantiates that,</v>

276
00:09:22.641 --> 00:09:26.120
<v Speaker 2>not only does cloud seeding fail to achieve the desired effect,</v>

277
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.700
<v Speaker 2>it also yields harmful consequence.</v>

278
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Also look up that guy eight silver iodide.</v>

279
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.630
<v Speaker 4>If you ever got a turn purple.</v>

280
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.811
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

281
00:09:32.811 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 4>that blueberry man.</v>

282
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

283
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.393
<v Speaker 4>What happened there?</v>

284
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 4>You eat silver.</v>

285
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 4>These people eat silver out of some.</v>

286
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 4>They think it increases their longevity or their virility and it makes them turn</v>

287
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 4>smurf blue forever.</v>

288
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.383
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

289
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So this is one take on it and there's other takes on it.</v>

290
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with the Internet,</v>

291
00:09:51.221 --> 00:09:51.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

292
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Is that if you really wanted to,</v>

293
00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:56.200
<v Speaker 2>you could find a bunch of people that agree with you and just hanging those</v>

294
00:09:56.201 --> 00:09:57.034
<v Speaker 2>circles.</v>

295
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.920
<v Speaker 2>It's the beauty of the Internet and it's the problem with the Internet.</v>

296
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.050
<v Speaker 2>The fact that there's so much information out there,</v>

297
00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:02.980
<v Speaker 2>but if you choose to,</v>

298
00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you can filter it down and get it to a point where you're not really listening</v>

299
00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:08.050
<v Speaker 2>to anybody other than people that support your point of</v>

300
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't need the Internet to help me figure out if I want to stand under a cloud</v>

301
00:10:12.401 --> 00:10:13.750
<v Speaker 4>pouring silver iodide,</v>

302
00:10:13.751 --> 00:10:16.300
<v Speaker 4>crystallized rain and into my yard.</v>

303
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.130
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone gave you a choice,</v>

304
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.630
<v Speaker 4>do you want to stand in a rain shower of PuroClean Hawaiian water or would you</v>

305
00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:26.440
<v Speaker 4>like to stand in a silver iodide rain,</v>

306
00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:27.251
<v Speaker 4>shower and joy,</v>

307
00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:31.690
<v Speaker 4>those relaxing silver particles spilling into your skin?</v>

308
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:32.171
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

309
00:10:32.171 --> 00:10:33.850
<v Speaker 2>here's the other side of it.</v>

310
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.620
<v Speaker 2>They can also prevent it from raining.</v>

311
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

312
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.090
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

313
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.150
<v Speaker 2>we know China did that during the Olympics and uh,</v>

314
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.190
<v Speaker 2>other than preventing rain for the Olympics,</v>

315
00:10:42.191 --> 00:10:45.700
<v Speaker 2>it says here in this article on space-explores.com,</v>

316
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever it says here in this article that other than preventing rain for the</v>

317
00:10:50.021 --> 00:10:50.411
<v Speaker 2>Olympics,</v>

318
00:10:50.411 --> 00:10:54.430
<v Speaker 2>China is spending 60 to that other than preventing rain for the Olympics,</v>

319
00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:59.431
<v Speaker 2>China is spending 60 to $90 million a year on cloud seeding to provide enough</v>

320
00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:03.790
<v Speaker 2>water for its enormous population to clear away smog from heavily polluted</v>

321
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:04.430
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>

322
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's their way of dealing with smart.</v>

323
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.091
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

324
00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:09.910
<v Speaker 2>do you think we should like put mufflers on our cars now let's just make it</v>

325
00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:10.370
<v Speaker 2>rain.</v>

326
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Just wash it.</v>

327
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:11.981
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

328
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Just push it down into the corner.</v>

329
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Dyed water.</v>

330
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

331
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 2>It's really good for pollution.</v>

332
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.540
<v Speaker 4>China is going to give China is going to birth the Godzilla there.</v>

333
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 4>Fucking around with that.</v>

334
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.780
<v Speaker 4>We can't say that it would beep it out.</v>

335
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.131
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

336
00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:24.741
<v Speaker 4>I yeah,</v>

337
00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:25.850
<v Speaker 4>I yourself God damn it.</v>

338
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.800
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a powerful weapon though,</v>

339
00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:28.041
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

340
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:28.551
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

341
00:11:28.551 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 4>If you want it to attack a country and you could make rain stop.</v>

342
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:32.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

343
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.420
<v Speaker 4>Then you would have full power over that country.</v>

344
00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:37.010
<v Speaker 4>If you could control their weather,</v>

345
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.330
<v Speaker 4>you've definitely would win.</v>

346
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.340
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>

347
00:11:39.341 --> 00:11:40.360
<v Speaker 2>if you could do that,</v>

348
00:11:40.361 --> 00:11:41.440
<v Speaker 2>how do you know you can do that?</v>

349
00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:41.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

350
00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:42.400
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to try it.</v>

351
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.570
<v Speaker 2>And how did you try it?</v>

352
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Did you try it just during the Olympics or did you know about it beforehand?</v>

353
00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Have you been using it on countries?</v>

354
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Have you been aiming it in places?</v>

355
00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:50.621
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you do it?</v>

356
00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:51.220
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

357
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.970
<v Speaker 2>is it very specific or you know,</v>

358
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.823
<v Speaker 2>can it be,</v>

359
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>can</v>

360
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.650
<v Speaker 1>you misfire and it is,</v>

361
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.930
<v Speaker 1>people can get cotton drive by accidental cloud seatings where it would rain in</v>

362
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 1>a place where you didn't want it to rain.</v>

363
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.063
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even make sense.</v>

364
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Dry by accidental cloud seeding.</v>

365
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>It ricocheted stray clouds.</v>

366
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>You get Ma'am got hit by a stray cloud.</v>

367
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.130
<v Speaker 1>That would be a great dramatic get hit by,</v>

368
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 5>he made it rain on my family.</v>

369
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even a crip</v>

370
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.970
<v Speaker 1>now besides the chem trail issue,</v>

371
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.301
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

372
00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:18.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

373
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:18.990
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

374
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I've met with a bunch of people so far on this camp trail issue and there's</v>

375
00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:24.600
<v Speaker 1>certainly some,</v>

376
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.780
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly some possibilities that the government at one point in time</v>

377
00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:30.480
<v Speaker 1>has sprayed something from a plane for sure.</v>

378
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

379
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.250
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of this constant spraying and this in the skies,</v>

380
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>

381
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.590
<v Speaker 1>this constant spraying and this guys seems to be much more ignorance than</v>

382
00:12:40.591 --> 00:12:41.220
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

383
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:41.671
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

384
00:12:41.671 --> 00:12:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

385
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And not just ignorance,</v>

386
00:12:43.051 --> 00:12:44.880
<v Speaker 1>but like on purpose,</v>

387
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.920
<v Speaker 1>like being willfully ignorant,</v>

388
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.850
<v Speaker 1>like not looking at any of the things that refute the things you're saying.</v>

389
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.220
<v Speaker 1>It's scientifically people with no agenda.</v>

390
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Instead looking only at the things that support it.</v>

391
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

392
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

393
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:57.721
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias,</v>

394
00:12:57.721 --> 00:12:59.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like pure and simple.</v>

395
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.800
<v Speaker 1>And there's people that make entire documentaries.</v>

396
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.510
<v Speaker 1>This guy that I met with,</v>

397
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:03.991
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

398
00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:04.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

399
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.573
<v Speaker 1>Michael Murphy,</v>

400
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.200
<v Speaker 1>he's got these two documentaries.</v>

401
00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:10.620
<v Speaker 1>What in the world are they spraying and why in the world are they spraying?</v>

402
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.750
<v Speaker 1>And he refuses to look at anything that points to the fact that what he's</v>

403
00:13:15.751 --> 00:13:17.880
<v Speaker 1>measuring when he's measuring like aluminum,</v>

404
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.631
<v Speaker 1>he's saying Lloyd's,</v>

405
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:18.841
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

406
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:20.310
<v Speaker 1>we found aluminum and this water,</v>

407
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.370
<v Speaker 1>what he's measuring his dirt and dirt is rich in aluminum.</v>

408
00:13:23.371 --> 00:13:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

409
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a real simple stuff,</v>

410
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:25.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

411
00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:30.060
<v Speaker 1>So that in saying that this is a part of some nefarious plan and some secret</v>

412
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:32.820
<v Speaker 1>thing that he's uncovered is being ridiculous person.</v>

413
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.341
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>

414
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:38.341
<v Speaker 5>I like to think about the specifics of the person flying the plane that's</v>

415
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:41.580
<v Speaker 5>apparently dropping the poison onto there.</v>

416
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 5>It's like who are these mysterious pilots?</v>

417
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 5>Did they have breakfast with their family?</v>

418
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.480
<v Speaker 5>Do they sit down and chat about how,</v>

419
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:47.861
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

420
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 5>going to spray aluminum dichloride over New York,</v>

421
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:51.634
<v Speaker 5>honey.</v>

422
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.610
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is it's so nonspecific.</v>

423
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone down there is the enemy or everyone down there has to be</v>

424
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:01.330
<v Speaker 1>experimented with including billionaires,</v>

425
00:14:01.331 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 1>bankers,</v>

426
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

427
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 1>they're all getting sprayed on everybody.</v>

428
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

429
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.390
<v Speaker 1>What kind of asshole would do that?</v>

430
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question.</v>

431
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.603
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

432
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 1>what a shit result like it barely does anything.</v>

433
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean stop and think about all this spring.</v>

434
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you had something where you can spray this guy completely cover the</v>

435
00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 1>sky in this spray,</v>

436
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.810
<v Speaker 1>this chemical spray and what does it do to the people down there?</v>

437
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It makes prince freak out.</v>

438
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.700
<v Speaker 1>It makes prince freak out almost worth.</v>

439
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 1>We got to pull that up.</v>

440
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Pull up prince talks about chem trails.</v>

441
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 1>This is a very important,</v>

442
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:31.690
<v Speaker 1>actually put,</v>

443
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:32.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a youtube video.</v>

444
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Prince talks to Dick Gregory about chem trails areas.</v>

445
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.700
<v Speaker 1>It's hilariously awesome and it,</v>

446
00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:39.000
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

447
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.340
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

448
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.970
<v Speaker 1>it highlights a lot of people's ignorance about this issue.</v>

449
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Like they haven't even looked into what creates these clouds.</v>

450
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>And this was a paper that was published by the,</v>

451
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

452
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 1>the United military in the 1940s,</v>

453
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't call them con trails back then.</v>

454
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.730
<v Speaker 1>They called them persistent condensation trails and they were trying to</v>

455
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>determine that these clouds they were making with propellers.</v>

456
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:02.760
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

457
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.531
<v Speaker 1>if these clouds,</v>

458
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they were dangerous and the same conditions were always</v>

459
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 1>discussed,</v>

460
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 1>it's always like super hazy.</v>

461
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's at a point just before clouds are created,</v>

462
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.910
<v Speaker 1>like a point in the,</v>

463
00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 1>the condensation of the atmosphere where it's almost cloudy.</v>

464
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of hazy.</v>

465
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And when they cut through with a plane,</v>

466
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>it creates artificial clouds.</v>

467
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.310
<v Speaker 1>And when people saying they're spraying clouds,</v>

468
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

469
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 1>they're actually making clouds by driving through it with a plane.</v>

470
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

471
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's really simple stuff.</v>

472
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

473
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.070
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

474
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.380
<v Speaker 6>I've never really bought into that stuff,</v>

475
00:15:35.381 --> 00:15:40.381
<v Speaker 6>but I have had somebody explained to me how they're putting poison into the air.</v>

476
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:46.140
<v Speaker 6>Someone explained that to me while smoking a cigarette while taking big puffs on</v>

477
00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:46.751
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

478
00:15:46.751 --> 00:15:49.450
<v Speaker 6>say they're poisoning as a deadly chemicals in the air,</v>

479
00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:49.751
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

480
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:51.580
<v Speaker 6>They just want to control the population.</v>

481
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:52.763
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

482
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.120
<v Speaker 6>I've seen people talk about saving the environment,</v>

483
00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.070
<v Speaker 6>whether it drove a Prius and throw a cigarette out the window.</v>

484
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.420
<v Speaker 6>It's ridiculous.</v>

485
00:15:58.421 --> 00:15:58.961
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

486
00:15:58.961 --> 00:15:59.794
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

487
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

488
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.241
<v Speaker 6>honestly,</v>

489
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:04.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand what makes those things up in the air.</v>

490
00:16:04.061 --> 00:16:08.650
<v Speaker 6>I think they're pretty like criss crossing pattern clouds.</v>

491
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.510
<v Speaker 6>They're nice to look at it on a picnic,</v>

492
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:11.980
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think they're poison.</v>

493
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.860
<v Speaker 6>And why is it that they keep appearing near airports?</v>

494
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:15.761
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

495
00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:17.530
<v Speaker 6>Why would they spray near the airport?</v>

496
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.720
<v Speaker 6>Because that way they could do it rather than under our noses.</v>

497
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.051
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

498
00:16:20.051 --> 00:16:22.780
<v Speaker 6>The biggest lie is the lie that you don't even have to tell.</v>

499
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.510
<v Speaker 6>Everybody tells us for you ps,</v>

500
00:16:25.511 --> 00:16:29.830
<v Speaker 6>the government could probably release free packs of cigarettes that say on them,</v>

501
00:16:29.831 --> 00:16:33.970
<v Speaker 6>these make you depressed and people would just bought willingly buy them.</v>

502
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:36.280
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to secretly dump chemicals on Americans.</v>

503
00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:38.230
<v Speaker 6>We're gulping them down every day.</v>

504
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:43.290
<v Speaker 6>We love chemicals sit in front of a seven 11 and watch those pigs come flapping</v>

505
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.130
<v Speaker 6>out of there with their big gulps and their pasty glistening sugar,</v>

506
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.950
<v Speaker 6>sugar lips and fried hot dogs.</v>

507
00:16:50.951 --> 00:16:51.310
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

508
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.540
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to poison a merit.</v>

509
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.950
<v Speaker 6>The idea that you have to actively and secretly poisoned Americans is insane.</v>

510
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:57.760
<v Speaker 6>It's ridiculous.</v>

511
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.130
<v Speaker 6>So I think we both agree on that.</v>

512
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.330
<v Speaker 6>They obviously know how to manipulate weather and they obviously have</v>

513
00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:08.170
<v Speaker 6>manipulated whether before and by they meaning everyone but us.</v>

514
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.010
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

515
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you'd done any manipulation and so we'll just include the whole</v>

516
00:17:11.591 --> 00:17:12.424
<v Speaker 6>rest of the population.</v>

517
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.060
<v Speaker 6>Someone out there has figured out how to make it stop raining and they've also</v>

518
00:17:16.061 --> 00:17:17.170
<v Speaker 6>figured out how to make it rain.</v>

519
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:17.740
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

520
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Speaker 6>The question is how often does it does go on and is this a part of our everyday</v>

521
00:17:21.911 --> 00:17:25.810
<v Speaker 6>life that we have to concern ourselves with and does it spray down harmful</v>

522
00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:26.400
<v Speaker 6>chemicals?</v>

523
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:26.941
<v Speaker 6>Is the other,</v>

524
00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:30.090
<v Speaker 6>those clouds of the reason why people are finding aluminum,</v>

525
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:30.490
<v Speaker 6>the soil,</v>

526
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.640
<v Speaker 6>well it turns out no aluminum is one of the most common elements on earth.</v>

527
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.480
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

528
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.290
<v Speaker 6>you can find commensurate levels that they've been finding in these tests that</v>

529
00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:40.030
<v Speaker 6>they've done that prove chem trails a real,</v>

530
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.460
<v Speaker 6>you find those everywhere all over the country.</v>

531
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.503
<v Speaker 6>The reason being,</v>

532
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.220
<v Speaker 6>because fucking aluminum is everywhere.</v>

533
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:45.560
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

534
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.450
<v Speaker 6>Aluminum's everywhere.</v>

535
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.090
<v Speaker 6>So that's something we know we don't have to worry about.</v>

536
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 6>So we've got that put</v>

537
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.993
<v Speaker 2>us put aside.</v>

538
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.060
<v Speaker 2>So a plane's create clouds automatically proven be aluminum exists in the</v>

539
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere all the time.</v>

540
00:17:58.291 --> 00:17:59.124
<v Speaker 2>Proves right.</v>

541
00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean that they haven't sprayed things from the sky.</v>

542
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that they're not capable of altering the weather.</v>

543
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:05.664
<v Speaker 2>We know they are.</v>

544
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

545
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

546
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:11.480
<v Speaker 3>But then also isn't there always toxins coming off of airplanes no matter why</v>

547
00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:13.280
<v Speaker 3>jet fuel that's on fire.</v>

548
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

549
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:14.900
<v Speaker 3>and it's sprays.</v>

550
00:18:14.901 --> 00:18:15.261
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

551
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:19.280
<v Speaker 3>that's the one of the biggest factors in global warming is jets,</v>

552
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

553
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Giant tubes filled with flammable dead dinosaurs that you're flying over the sky</v>

554
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.770
<v Speaker 3>once that spraying,</v>

555
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.210
<v Speaker 3>that's the real spraying.</v>

556
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.480
<v Speaker 3>The real spraying is burning jet fuel above your face.</v>

557
00:18:32.481 --> 00:18:32.960
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>

558
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

559
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.760
<v Speaker 3>That's the poison.</v>

560
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.940
<v Speaker 3>They really are spraying us every time you fly to The Bahamas,</v>

561
00:18:37.941 --> 00:18:38.774
<v Speaker 3>you're chipping in.</v>

562
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.381
<v Speaker 3>That's what I heard.</v>

563
00:18:39.381 --> 00:18:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I heard every time you fly your fat kids to Disneyland,</v>

564
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.920
<v Speaker 3>you're incinerating like 19 acres of rain forest.</v>

565
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.870
<v Speaker 3>How do they get to that much?</v>

566
00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:51.770
<v Speaker 3>But I feel I exactly eating a lot of different ways when I said that.</v>

567
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Now the other aspect</v>

568
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.420
<v Speaker 2>of manipulating,</v>

569
00:18:55.421 --> 00:19:00.421
<v Speaker 2>whether that's fascinating is harp and I think Harb stands for high altitude</v>

570
00:19:01.811 --> 00:19:03.790
<v Speaker 2>active auroral research.</v>

571
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Let's find that one.</v>

572
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

573
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.321
<v Speaker 2>H.</v>

574
00:19:05.321 --> 00:19:05.771
<v Speaker 2>A r.</v>

575
00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:08.410
<v Speaker 2>P just so we know it stands for,</v>

576
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.651
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

577
00:19:08.651 --> 00:19:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I spelled it totally wrong.</v>

578
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I spelled it h.</v>

579
00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:11.950
<v Speaker 2>H a r,</v>

580
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.010
<v Speaker 2>which is the Hebrew home for the aged in Riverdale.</v>

581
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

582
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Not the same thing.</v>

583
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Don't go there and yell at those people for controlling the weather.</v>

584
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 3>Jewish elderly people are making it rain and</v>

585
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.210
<v Speaker 2>they don't even know what you're talking about and they will hit you.</v>

586
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

587
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:31.960
<v Speaker 2>High frequency active auroral research program.</v>

588
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

589
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.780
<v Speaker 2>and this is a fascinating thing because what this is the official use of harp is</v>

590
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:40.520
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>

591
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.170
<v Speaker 2>they send these radio waves up into the ionosphere and they can manipulate it,</v>

592
00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:46.520
<v Speaker 2>and by manipulating it,</v>

593
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.350
<v Speaker 2>it can aid in communication.</v>

594
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.120
<v Speaker 2>They could shut down communication and they could possibly make it so that they</v>

595
00:19:53.121 --> 00:19:56.330
<v Speaker 2>can send radio signals and receive radio signals from very far away.</v>

596
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.470
<v Speaker 2>What's the ionosphere?</v>

597
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:58.970
<v Speaker 2>The ionosphere?</v>

598
00:19:59.030 --> 00:19:59.863
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

599
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.850
<v Speaker 2>We should get the official</v>

600
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.430
<v Speaker 2>explanation without me going into my pseudoscience.</v>

601
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:07.791
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

602
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

603
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's the layer of the earth's atmosphere that contains a high concentration of</v>

604
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:17.530
<v Speaker 2>ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio.</v>

605
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.130
<v Speaker 2>So that's the ionosphere.</v>

606
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.260
<v Speaker 2>So it makes sense that they would have these,</v>

607
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.190
<v Speaker 2>this gigantic radio array antenna ray,</v>

608
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.400
<v Speaker 2>and that they're sending these charged particles up into the ionosphere and that</v>

609
00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:35.480
<v Speaker 2>what they're trying to do is manipulate it so that they can use their radios</v>

610
00:20:35.481 --> 00:20:36.350
<v Speaker 2>more effectively.</v>

611
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.903
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

612
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.970
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy theory and the conspiracy harp has been blamed for a variety of</v>

613
00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:44.570
<v Speaker 2>different events,</v>

614
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

615
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.420
<v Speaker 2>including numerous natural disasters,</v>

616
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.010
<v Speaker 1>tsunamis.</v>

617
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Some people think they can cause earthquake and some people attribute it to</v>

618
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:54.730
<v Speaker 1>something called sky quakes.</v>

619
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of sky quake?</v>

620
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Now listen to this.</v>

621
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

622
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna play this for you.</v>

623
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.230
<v Speaker 1>This is an audio of a sky quake.</v>

624
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.243
<v Speaker 1>And let's play.</v>

625
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's play the one from Allen,</v>

626
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:06.064
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

627
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people that are standing outside and they hear this,</v>

628
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and the freaky thing they say is that when they hear these things that you can't</v>

629
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:22.510
<v Speaker 1>pinpoint where they're coming from.</v>

630
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.790
<v Speaker 1>They're just coming from the sky.</v>

631
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And in order to have something that's that loud that doesn't dissipate with</v>

632
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:29.884
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>

633
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with some incredible amount of energy.</v>

634
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And the big F is as if this isn't a hoax,</v>

635
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.123
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

636
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.480
<v Speaker 1>You could get some Dick heads in college and think it's cute to just stand</v>

637
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:43.901
<v Speaker 1>around and go,</v>

638
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:44.734
<v Speaker 1>what's that sound?</v>

639
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

640
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And then they go on their computer and add in some sound effects.</v>

641
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:49.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

642
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 1>just slow down a trumpet and put it your picnic video.</v>

643
00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly you've got 15 billion hits on Youtube.</v>

644
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

645
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.891
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

646
00:21:56.891 --> 00:21:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

647
00:21:58.151 --> 00:21:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things,</v>

648
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like what exactly are we listening to this?</v>

649
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:02.940
<v Speaker 1>It sounds cool.</v>

650
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

651
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this is called sky quakes,</v>

652
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:05.920
<v Speaker 1>but I have heard of this.</v>

653
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And what I really like is the Judeo Christian explanation for what this is.</v>

654
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Because in the book of revelations,</v>

655
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 1>they talk about how the horsemen of the apocalypse blow these trumpets.</v>

656
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:18.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you know it's the end of days.</v>

657
00:22:18.781 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 1>So this is really feeding into the apocalyptic Christian theory that we're at</v>

658
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 1>the end of the world.</v>

659
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And these are the sounds that you hear before the great plagues come rolling</v>

660
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:29.770
<v Speaker 1>through the land.</v>

661
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what a lot of Christians think that.</v>

662
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see Kevin Smith's movie?</v>

663
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:33.574
<v Speaker 1>Red State?</v>

664
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:33.941
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

665
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:34.181
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

666
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

667
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.381
<v Speaker 1>Amazing movie.</v>

668
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:38.600
<v Speaker 1>And remember the end when they played the trumpet and that's what got the crazy</v>

669
00:22:38.601 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 1>evangelism and make it to the end.</v>

670
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:41.921
<v Speaker 1>I was drunk,</v>

671
00:22:41.921 --> 00:22:42.754
<v Speaker 1>I fell asleep.</v>

672
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 1>It's worth a second look.</v>

673
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

674
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.220
<v Speaker 1>now we also have some recordings of what harp actually sounds like in operation.</v>

675
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 1>And this is equally freaky.</v>

676
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.860
<v Speaker 7>It's not a good sound that you never want to hear that.</v>

677
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.800
<v Speaker 7>You never want to be out on your porch with your dog throwing a stick and you're</v>

678
00:23:09.801 --> 00:23:10.634
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

679
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.091
<v Speaker 7>what is what?</v>

680
00:23:14.091 --> 00:23:14.751
<v Speaker 7>So what is hard?</v>

681
00:23:14.751 --> 00:23:15.351
<v Speaker 7>What do they have?</v>

682
00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:17.480
<v Speaker 7>Like demons yelling in a microphones.</v>

683
00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.930
<v Speaker 7>I think it's the garbage disposal of the universe.</v>

684
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.800
<v Speaker 7>That's what it sounds like.</v>

685
00:23:21.801 --> 00:23:23.780
<v Speaker 7>It sounds like a garbage disposal and space.</v>

686
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:25.160
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

687
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.140
<v Speaker 7>this sounds like interstellar locust</v>

688
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.070
<v Speaker 1>descending on the,</v>

689
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.500
<v Speaker 1>when you really stop and think about the fact that there's something on earth</v>

690
00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:34.590
<v Speaker 1>that shoots energy up into the sky and makes that noise.</v>

691
00:23:34.591 --> 00:23:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

692
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.030
<v Speaker 1>And then above us,</v>

693
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

694
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.890
<v Speaker 1>What is it shooting into the ionosphere where there's like thousands of</v>

695
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:44.040
<v Speaker 1>satellites and space junk flying in it just,</v>

696
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 5>no thanks.</v>

697
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 5>No thanks to creeps were a creepy species.</v>

698
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine if if chimpanzees were blasting the honest fear with devil</v>

699
00:23:57.421 --> 00:23:58.150
<v Speaker 5>screeches,</v>

700
00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:58.983
<v Speaker 1>we kill them,</v>

701
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 1>wipe them out with him.</v>

702
00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Two days there'd be no more chimps.</v>

703
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 1>We found chimp with a bow and Arrow would shoot it right in the head.</v>

704
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to,</v>

705
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.923
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to.</v>

706
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

707
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.453
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

708
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about this is it like Robin Hood and make a ton of money.</v>

709
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.780
<v Speaker 1>We had this guy on the show that I interviewed,</v>

710
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 1>his name is woody Norris.</v>

711
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:17.150
<v Speaker 1>He's this genius inventor,</v>

712
00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 1>a true bonafide genius.</v>

713
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.740
<v Speaker 1>He's responsible for over 80 patents.</v>

714
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:27.010
<v Speaker 1>He is a an audio expert and he listened to the sounds and review the amount of</v>

715
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 1>power this thing puts out and he believes that this,</v>

716
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 1>this array of antennas absolutely could be responsible for those sounds.</v>

717
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.010
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks that it could be responsible for manipulating whether it can,</v>

718
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.030
<v Speaker 1>that you could have a lot of what you would call off label uses and that maybe</v>

719
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 1>it was an issue initially created to heat up the ionosphere so that they could</v>

720
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>send radio signals.</v>

721
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.440
<v Speaker 1>But along the way they might've figured out,</v>

722
00:24:51.441 --> 00:24:51.921
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

723
00:24:51.921 --> 00:24:54.980
<v Speaker 1>we can make trumpets blow in the sky over Iran.</v>

724
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.600
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

725
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:55.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

726
00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 1>do you know how freaky it would be is like,</v>

727
00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:58.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:24:58.761 --> 00:25:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you get an email from the president,</v>

729
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:00.771
<v Speaker 1>good luck,</v>

730
00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:01.251
<v Speaker 1>fuck face,</v>

731
00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:01.941
<v Speaker 1>we're going to war.</v>

732
00:25:01.941 --> 00:25:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And then he had a raw,</v>

733
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 1>you'd know it's common and you hear trumpets in the sky.</v>

734
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Just that alone is like,</v>

735
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:08.631
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

736
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:08.871
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

737
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 1>we've been thinking,</v>

738
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.570
<v Speaker 1>we've been very hasty.</v>

739
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.790
<v Speaker 1>The nuclear who needs nuclear power?</v>

740
00:25:13.791 --> 00:25:14.160
<v Speaker 1>My friend,</v>

741
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 1>he stopped the trumpet.</v>

742
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Japan has problems with it.</v>

743
00:25:16.851 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So we don't want that in this world.</v>

744
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.221
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

745
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:19.701
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

746
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

747
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.870
<v Speaker 5>I think that for whatever reason,</v>

748
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:28.100
<v Speaker 5>it's part of the government's job to every day come up with new ways to kill</v>

749
00:25:28.101 --> 00:25:28.910
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

750
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.910
<v Speaker 5>And someone looks at tornadoes when tornadoes hit and thinks,</v>

751
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:35.451
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

752
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 5>that would make a great weapon.</v>

753
00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 5>If I could figure out a way to do that,</v>

754
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:40.940
<v Speaker 5>I'd have the ultimate weapon.</v>

755
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 5>Because the problem with nuclear bombs,</v>

756
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.103
<v Speaker 5>aside,</v>

757
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.360
<v Speaker 5>aside from the fact that they like kill hundreds of thousands of innocent</v>

758
00:25:47.361 --> 00:25:47.781
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

759
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 5>is they irradiate where they hit.</v>

760
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:55.270
<v Speaker 5>So you end up not being able to move into that area as a good conquer would want</v>

761
00:25:56.061 --> 00:25:56.350
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

762
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.190
<v Speaker 5>Cause everything's full radiation.</v>

763
00:25:58.191 --> 00:25:59.420
<v Speaker 5>Everything's like Chernobyl.</v>

764
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.660
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

765
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Speaker 5>and with bioweapons the same thing.</v>

766
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the hydrogen bombs.</v>

767
00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 1>That was the idea behind the hydrogen bomb was that you could kill everyone</v>

768
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:08.231
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

769
00:26:08.231 --> 00:26:09.190
<v Speaker 1>But leave the structures.</v>

770
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:09.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

771
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine that pitch meeting where somebody,</v>

772
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 5>he's like pitching that I've innovated something great.</v>

773
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.590
<v Speaker 5>We can leave the structures and kill all the people.</v>

774
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.663
<v Speaker 5>Great Gym.</v>

775
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.623
<v Speaker 5>But with this,</v>

776
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.561
<v Speaker 5>with this idea,</v>

777
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:23.780
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of like a in between thing,</v>

778
00:26:23.781 --> 00:26:28.040
<v Speaker 5>which is that not only could you send in tornadoes or earthquakes to wipe out</v>

779
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:28.880
<v Speaker 5>populations,</v>

780
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.220
<v Speaker 5>but also you could do it anonymously.</v>

781
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.770
<v Speaker 5>No one would even know who is doing the attack.</v>

782
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 5>You would just think you were having some bad geological luck for a few years</v>

783
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.350
<v Speaker 5>until everything's flattened.</v>

784
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 5>And then the UN comes in.</v>

785
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:40.911
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

786
00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:41.211
<v Speaker 5>well look,</v>

787
00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:42.410
<v Speaker 5>we're going to help you rebuild.</v>

788
00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 5>And then the next thing you know you've been infiltrated by the empire taken</v>

789
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 5>over and you don't even know it.</v>

790
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.960
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate weapon.</v>

791
00:26:48.961 --> 00:26:51.250
<v Speaker 5>So it makes a lot of sense that a,</v>

792
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 5>that a government or an empire would want to investigate this stuff.</v>

793
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

794
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And if this was a possibility,</v>

795
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 1>they would certainly explore it and look into it.</v>

796
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 1>The real question is have they ever used it?</v>

797
00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's the beauty of this thing being sort of an anonymous thing.</v>

798
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.290
<v Speaker 1>If you really can create a storm,</v>

799
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 1>how would you know that someone created a storm or whether or not it's just a</v>

800
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:11.460
<v Speaker 1>storm.</v>

801
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.720
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

802
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.110
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

803
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.620
<v Speaker 1>you send a nuclear bomb,</v>

804
00:27:13.621 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 1>there's an obvious footprint.</v>

805
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 1>There's sure you know where it came from.</v>

806
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 1>We know a human created it.</v>

807
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.330
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

808
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 1>they connect the dots.</v>

809
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 1>They find out you can't,</v>

810
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

811
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.610
<v Speaker 1>it's not like throwing a snowball in a car and running behind a bush.</v>

812
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.181
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

813
00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 1>when you throw a nuclear bomb,</v>

814
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.663
<v Speaker 1>you get caught.</v>

815
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>

816
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows you're an asshole.</v>

817
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.700
<v Speaker 5>You don't need Colombo to solve that one.</v>

818
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.073
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] question is,</v>

819
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 1>do you think that they've done it already?</v>

820
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question though.</v>

821
00:27:38.391 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 1>The question is not,</v>

822
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.770
<v Speaker 1>can they manipulate the weather?</v>

823
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.933
<v Speaker 1>It's been proven.</v>

824
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Can they manipulate with harp?</v>

825
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.453
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

826
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 1>But if they could have they already,</v>

827
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

828
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:48.890
<v Speaker 5>just I,</v>

829
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:49.830
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

830
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:50.280
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

831
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:50.611
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

832
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:51.061
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

833
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:51.894
<v Speaker 5>If they could,</v>

834
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 1>if they could,</v>

835
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:53.850
<v Speaker 1>they've definitely done it.</v>

836
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they could do it with harp?</v>

837
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.510
<v Speaker 5>I think harp is creepy.</v>

838
00:27:57.511 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 5>I had never heard those sounds before,</v>

839
00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 5>but I've seen that array of,</v>

840
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.060
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

841
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

842
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 5>antenna and there's spooky looking.</v>

843
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 5>And also I heard that security at harp is like area 51 level security and I've</v>

844
00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 5>also heard that they don't,</v>

845
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:12.091
<v Speaker 5>they're very,</v>

846
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:14.100
<v Speaker 5>very secretive about what's going on over there.</v>

847
00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:18.510
<v Speaker 5>So I wouldn't surprise me if I had something to do with controlling the weather.</v>

848
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:19.890
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't surprise me at all.</v>

849
00:28:19.891 --> 00:28:20.724
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

850
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 5>I would hate to break up with someone who worked at Harv is reigns over your</v>

851
00:28:24.751 --> 00:28:26.250
<v Speaker 5>house for a year straight.</v>

852
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:27.990
<v Speaker 5>It's just always cloudy in your neighborhood.</v>

853
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

854
00:28:28.271 --> 00:28:32.590
<v Speaker 1>let's listen to what some experts say because a Stanford University professor</v>

855
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.030
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] said to popular science that weather control conspiracy theories</v>

856
00:28:37.031 --> 00:28:41.710
<v Speaker 1>were completely uninformed and he explained that there's absolutely nothing that</v>

857
00:28:41.711 --> 00:28:44.740
<v Speaker 1>we can do to disturb the earth's weather systems.</v>

858
00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.980
<v Speaker 1>And even though the power that harp radiates is very large,</v>

859
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.930
<v Speaker 1>it's minuscule compared with the power of a lightning flash and there are 50 to</v>

860
00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:55.570
<v Speaker 1>a hundred lightning flashes every second harps.</v>

861
00:28:55.571 --> 00:28:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Intensity is very small,</v>

862
00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.710
<v Speaker 1>but he could just be a shill.</v>

863
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

864
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:01.900
<v Speaker 1>He could be working for the man.</v>

865
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:02.981
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

866
00:29:02.981 --> 00:29:03.131
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

867
00:29:03.131 --> 00:29:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I to Stanford teaching all those liberals.</v>

868
00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.870
<v Speaker 5>He's a lot more credible than some hipster.</v>

869
00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:10.930
<v Speaker 5>And a fedora with a beard yapping about tornadoes.</v>

870
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.700
<v Speaker 5>Are you a hipster?</v>

871
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.330
<v Speaker 5>Officially?</v>

872
00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:13.951
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

873
00:29:13.951 --> 00:29:17.830
<v Speaker 5>but I mean I could be called wine and I get judged like that.</v>

874
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:18.850
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

875
00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:19.511
<v Speaker 5>who knows?</v>

876
00:29:19.511 --> 00:29:19.781
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

877
00:29:19.781 --> 00:29:19.961
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

878
00:29:19.961 --> 00:29:24.961
<v Speaker 5>I just think that the government has explored in governments of the world if</v>

879
00:29:25.091 --> 00:29:30.091
<v Speaker 5>explored how to kill people and almost every possible way from coming up with</v>

880
00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:36.160
<v Speaker 5>weaponized smallpox to using nuclear bombs.</v>

881
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.050
<v Speaker 5>So why wouldn't they explore it?</v>

882
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.160
<v Speaker 5>Something like the weather,</v>

883
00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:42.030
<v Speaker 5>it makes a hundred percent absolute sense and</v>

884
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.980
<v Speaker 1>you no one else for sure.</v>

885
00:29:43.981 --> 00:29:46.470
<v Speaker 1>This Omran in non is not hanging out at harp.</v>

886
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:46.921
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

887
00:29:46.921 --> 00:29:47.820
<v Speaker 1>He's not going up there.</v>

888
00:29:47.821 --> 00:29:49.140
<v Speaker 1>He's not talking to those scientists.</v>

889
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.470
<v Speaker 1>He's not absolutely clearly informed as to what they're capable of.</v>

890
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

891
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And there's one thing that really smart people love to do and that they love to</v>

892
00:29:56.581 --> 00:30:01.581
<v Speaker 1>dismiss things that they believe are silly or things that don't agree with what</v>

893
00:30:01.891 --> 00:30:02.790
<v Speaker 1>they've stated.</v>

894
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

895
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:08.330
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of these guys that are saying this like computer scientist David</v>

896
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Nadick who characterize harp as a magnet for conspiracy theorists and says that</v>

897
00:30:11.971 --> 00:30:16.620
<v Speaker 1>harp attracts their attention because it's purpose seems deeply mysterious to</v>

898
00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:18.210
<v Speaker 1>the scientifically uninformed.</v>

899
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.313
<v Speaker 1>He says that.</v>

900
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:24.410
<v Speaker 1>But when you talked to geniuses and experts in sound and in the power output and</v>

901
00:30:24.961 --> 00:30:26.040
<v Speaker 1>they talk about the,</v>

902
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

903
00:30:26.221 --> 00:30:29.370
<v Speaker 1>the capabilities of a system like harp there,</v>

904
00:30:29.371 --> 00:30:32.670
<v Speaker 1>like you're talking about something that's being run by Darpa,</v>

905
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

906
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

907
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.423
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

908
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.330
<v Speaker 1>let's pull up.</v>

909
00:30:36.331 --> 00:30:37.440
<v Speaker 1>What does Darpa stand for?</v>

910
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think it's something evil.</v>

911
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely something evil.</v>

915
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that means defense as in they need to charge up the ionosphere</v>

916
00:30:49.951 --> 00:30:54.410
<v Speaker 1>descend radio signals or maybe it means that a sound robot in the sky is going</v>

917
00:30:54.411 --> 00:30:55.244
<v Speaker 1>to eat your baby.</v>

918
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.851
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

919
00:30:55.851 --> 00:30:59.210
<v Speaker 3>And have you seen that other crap Darpa spits out of their health,</v>

920
00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.730
<v Speaker 3>those robots that you can kick and they don't fall over deadly galloping dogs.</v>

921
00:31:04.731 --> 00:31:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Weird springing attack.</v>

922
00:31:06.951 --> 00:31:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Frogs death drones.</v>

923
00:31:09.081 --> 00:31:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Like of course they're trying them and have their own Twitter though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

932
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have 75 you have more than Darpa.</v>

933
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 1>That sad suck at Darpa.</v>

934
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

935
00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that's what I say.</v>

936
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off Darpa.</v>

937
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:30.941
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

938

940
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Alaska and a couple of weeks to do stand up.</v>

941
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:37.894
<v Speaker 1>I want to visit.</v>

942
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they'll still let me in?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like the one of the most secure places on the planet.</v>

947
00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:44.283
<v Speaker 1>They let you in.</v>

948
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.260
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the saddest things when you run into like any of these people that</v>

949
00:31:48.261 --> 00:31:49.450
<v Speaker 3>you've villainized and you're,</v>

955
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:52.341
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

956
00:31:52.341 --> 00:31:54.290
<v Speaker 3>we're just trying to make radio waves work better.</v>

957
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

958
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.900
<v Speaker 3>And then you leave and they laugh.</v>

959
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.420
<v Speaker 3>They turn back into reptiles that fuck it.</v>

960
00:31:59.421 --> 00:32:00.254
<v Speaker 3>I got his phone.</v>

961
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Let's follow home kills dog.</v>

962
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Dog died of a heart attack.</v>

963
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:04.251
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

964
00:32:04.251 --> 00:32:05.084
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

965
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

966
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:06.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

967
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:06.771
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

968
00:32:06.771 --> 00:32:07.604
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

969
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:07.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

970
00:32:07.941 --> 00:32:08.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

971
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.201
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

972
00:32:09.201 --> 00:32:10.034
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

973
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:11.600
<v Speaker 3>So there's some things I've learned today.</v>

974
00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.140
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that harp was run by Darpa.</v>

975
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.890
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that there was any connection there because I said that.</v>

976
00:32:18.891 --> 00:32:20.450
<v Speaker 3>But let's make sure that that's correct.</v>

977
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.220
<v Speaker 3>Harp run by Darpa.</v>

978
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.233
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true.</v>

979
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.850
<v Speaker 1>High Frequency Dee Dee,</v>

980
00:32:29.851 --> 00:32:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee,</v>

981
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you n the defense.</v>

982
00:32:33.061 --> 00:32:33.894
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

983
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.003
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

984
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty weird because Darpa is a notorious creator of things that are</v>

985
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 3>without question going to destroy our civilization.</v>

986
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 3>They just gleefully whip up death machines,</v>

987
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:50.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

988
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 3>without any concern for what's going to happen 50 years from now,</v>

989
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.353
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

990
00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they just make good defensive stuff to keep the defense</v>

991
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:02.860
<v Speaker 3>defense.</v>

992
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.420
<v Speaker 3>Offensive Defensive Department of Defense.</v>

993
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

994
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.280
<v Speaker 3>It about Dunkin and keeping us safe.</v>

995
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.660
<v Speaker 3>It's about the defense.</v>

996
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.570
<v Speaker 3>You know what neat about offense being offensive?</v>

997
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what made me feel really safe?</v>

998
00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

999
00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 3>a galloping robotic dog,</v>

1000
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 3>they can chase me over may or may not have cannons on it.</v>

1001
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Galloping dog that's half made of c four that makes its way into your building</v>

1002
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 3>and then makes a volcano explodes.</v>

1003
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.960
<v Speaker 3>I felt so scared.</v>

1004
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I used to be so nervous.</v>

1005
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I'd walk around with fear inside of me until those packs of wild galloping</v>

1006
00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Cyborg dogs made solar powered dogs and by the way,</v>

1007
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:43.590
<v Speaker 3>they could be solar powered.</v>

1008
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1009
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:44.800
<v Speaker 3>ain't just to run all day.</v>

1010
00:33:44.801 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 3>It never rains here and they can be autonomous to,</v>

1011
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.370
<v Speaker 3>or they're just controlled by 18 year olds and trailers outside of Vegas with</v>

1012
00:33:52.371 --> 00:33:56.270
<v Speaker 3>with Xbox controllers all messed up on government speed.</v>

1013
00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:57.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1014
00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.150
<v Speaker 3>look at a speed that they give those those drone operator.</v>

1015
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 3>He makes sure they're hopped up on the good stuff.</v>

1016
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.490
<v Speaker 3>If you want speed,</v>

1017
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.810
<v Speaker 3>talk to a drone operator,</v>

1018
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.270
<v Speaker 3>they've got the good stuff.</v>

1019
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:10.040
<v Speaker 3>They don't need big gulps.</v>

1020
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:11.210
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even drink water.</v>

1021
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.930
<v Speaker 3>They just have a pace to their chew on.</v>

1022
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.270
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

1023
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.770
<v Speaker 3>they don't take in any moisture.</v>

1024
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Moisture disrupts the effects of the electrolyte</v>

1025
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:21.220
<v Speaker 1>imbalance that math provides.</v>

1026
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Darpa in the Internet because I think Darpa invented the Internet.</v>

1027
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I thought Al Gore did</v>

1028
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.280
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1029
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I think Darpa did invent the Internet,</v>

1030
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.410
<v Speaker 1>which is going to create a thank you,</v>

1031
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:34.263
<v Speaker 1>right too.</v>

1032
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.040
<v Speaker 8>E</v>

1033
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 1>involved in the creation of the Internet and history of the Internet.</v>

1034
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Formal group with Darpa,</v>

1035
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:44.930
<v Speaker 1>the fruit.</v>

1036
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 1>A group within Darpa.</v>

1037
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1038
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.411
<v Speaker 1>Brief history.</v>

1039
00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1973</v>

1040
00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.573
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>

1041
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:54.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1043
00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.540
<v Speaker 1>here's what's interesting.</v>

1044
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:03.590
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Darpa is also linked to the creation of the Internet,</v>

1045
00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.610
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating.</v>

1046
00:35:06.611 --> 00:35:11.611
<v Speaker 1>In 1973 the US defense advanced research project agency or Darpa,</v>

1047
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.790
<v Speaker 1>initiated a research program to investigate techniques and technologies for</v>

1048
00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:18.850
<v Speaker 1>interlinking packet networks of various kinds.</v>

1049
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.390
<v Speaker 1>The objective was to develop communication protocols,</v>

1050
00:35:22.391 --> 00:35:27.220
<v Speaker 1>which would allow network computers to communicate transparently across multiple</v>

1051
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.720
<v Speaker 1>linked packet networks.</v>

1052
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 1>So it was created by Darpa.</v>

1053
00:35:30.551 --> 00:35:33.850
<v Speaker 1>The very thing that will bring down the empire was created by it.</v>

1054
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1055
00:35:34.211 --> 00:35:34.331
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1056
00:35:34.331 --> 00:35:34.751
<v Speaker 3>that's what I,</v>

1057
00:35:34.751 --> 00:35:38.970
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens to all mad scientists is their creation turns against that.</v>

1058
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:39.391
<v Speaker 3>So true.</v>

1059
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Frankenstein.</v>

1060
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:41.120
<v Speaker 3>It was killed by Frankenstein.</v>

1062
00:35:41.121 --> 00:35:42.240
<v Speaker 3>It's an inevitability.</v>

1063
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

1064
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.410
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1065
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1066
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.050
<v Speaker 3>So this thing that,</v>

1067
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 3>so they unleashed the internet.</v>

1068
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what else they've unleashed or they're going to unleash,</v>

1069
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:49.711
<v Speaker 3>but you know what else?</v>

1070
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:54.711
<v Speaker 3>The Internet did inform people about mushrooms maybe that can help them with</v>

1071
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Darpa needs mushrooms.</v>

1072
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:56.843
<v Speaker 3>That's what they need.</v>

1073
00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the kind of shit that you could create if you had the technology and the</v>

1074
00:36:02.181 --> 00:36:03.350
<v Speaker 1>resources of Darpa.</v>

1075
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1076
00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.290
<v Speaker 3>but it was all people on mushrooms.</v>

1077
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.910
<v Speaker 3>They're beautiful world.</v>

1078
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.200
<v Speaker 3>It'd be amazing.</v>

1079
00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Think of what burning man would look like if Darpa took it over.</v>

1080
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.590
<v Speaker 6>They would kill all the people begging for sandwiches.</v>

1081
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:17.663
<v Speaker 6>That'd be the first thing.</v>

1082
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.790
<v Speaker 6>Take him outside of we know how to do it.</v>

1083
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:22.080
<v Speaker 6>Them like they didn't even care.</v>

1084
00:36:22.081 --> 00:36:24.330
<v Speaker 6>Even if they're on mushrooms and just still just shoot hippies.</v>

1085
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:25.621
<v Speaker 6>Let's tell you,</v>

1086
00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 6>just knew you did that.</v>

1087
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:27.811
<v Speaker 6>Come on guys.</v>

1088
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:29.180
<v Speaker 6>Stop crying in.</v>

1089
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Speaker 6>Know that brother was a loser.</v>

1090
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.030
<v Speaker 6>You brother had dirty feet.</v>

1091
00:36:33.031 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>

1092
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:34.651
<v Speaker 6>come on.</v>

1093
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:35.101
<v Speaker 6>We shot him.</v>

1094
00:36:35.101 --> 00:36:35.611
<v Speaker 6>What's the big deal?</v>

1095
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:36.444
<v Speaker 6>I got more mushrooms.</v>

1096
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.950
<v Speaker 6>Who wants to sing?</v>

1097
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 6>Who wants to get in a drum circle?</v>

1098
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 3>Drones that shoot poison darts at anything that smells like Patchouli.</v>

1099
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.231
<v Speaker 3>Some hot girls.</v>

1100
00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:47.960
<v Speaker 3>It's more like a truly a lot.</v>

1101
00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:48.940
<v Speaker 3>A lot of hot girls.</v>

1102
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:49.951
<v Speaker 3>Some girls,</v>

1103
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:51.120
<v Speaker 3>they were like little oil.</v>

1104
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Just as a gentle like I look very oil.</v>

1105
00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:55.443
<v Speaker 3>Mm hmm.</v>

1106
00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.160
<v Speaker 3>I love that sweet smell up at Julian and I body the sweet smell.</v>

1107
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 3>But truly and bumper stickers.</v>

1108
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I like the sweet smell of it,</v>

1109
00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:05.561
<v Speaker 3>Julie,</v>

1110
00:37:05.561 --> 00:37:07.290
<v Speaker 3>cause there's usually like good acid around.</v>

1111
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the other thing.</v>

1112
00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Here's the other thing that people think a harp is responsible for.</v>

1113
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing in Windsor and it's called the Windsor Hum.</v>

1114
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.040
<v Speaker 1>And these poor people that live in this town that's across the river from Zug</v>

1115
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Island,</v>

1116
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.210
<v Speaker 1>which is near Detroit.</v>

1117
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And these poor people that live in Windsor,</v>

1118
00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:35.590
<v Speaker 1>they say that their houses rattle their windows rattle and sometimes it's 24</v>

1119
00:37:35.591 --> 00:37:35.921
<v Speaker 1>hours a day.</v>

1120
00:37:35.921 --> 00:37:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Just whoo,</v>

1121
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:38.320
<v Speaker 1>whoo,</v>

1122
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.010
<v Speaker 1>whoo.</v>

1123
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.630
<v Speaker 1>That's how they all describe it.</v>

1124
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.330
<v Speaker 1>And no one can seem to locate the source of it.</v>

1125
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Some people say that it's coming from Zug Island and some people say that even</v>

1126
00:37:49.661 --> 00:37:51.730
<v Speaker 1>though you can't hear it near Zug island,</v>

1127
00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.470
<v Speaker 1>it gets more powerful.</v>

1128
00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:54.880
<v Speaker 1>The further away you get.</v>

1129
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.660
<v Speaker 1>And they describe it as like a tsunami effect that like a tsunami,</v>

1130
00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.190
<v Speaker 1>like it starts in one place,</v>

1131
00:38:00.191 --> 00:38:01.390
<v Speaker 1>then builds up powers.</v>

1132
00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:02.201
<v Speaker 1>It moves along well.</v>

1133
00:38:02.201 --> 00:38:04.000
<v Speaker 1>If you talked to anybody knows anything about sound,</v>

1134
00:38:04.001 --> 00:38:05.590
<v Speaker 1>they say that's not how sound works,</v>

1135
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to describe it that way.</v>

1136
00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.770
<v Speaker 1>They just scream seem to describe it as a sound that's coming from a place where</v>

1137
00:38:11.771 --> 00:38:13.780
<v Speaker 1>they can't quite pinpoint where it is.</v>

1138
00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.030
<v Speaker 1>They want to say it's coming towards Zug island.</v>

1139
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.040
<v Speaker 1>But some folks say that as you get closer to Zug island,</v>

1140
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:22.330
<v Speaker 1>it actually is less noisy than it is when you're further away from it.</v>

1141
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a really weird thing and it's not one person complaining about this.</v>

1142
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.630
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about an entire town of people.</v>

1143
00:38:28.631 --> 00:38:29.980
<v Speaker 1>We talked to several people,</v>

1144
00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.240
<v Speaker 1>not one of them was like,</v>

1145
00:38:31.241 --> 00:38:32.560
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking to?</v>

1146
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Does anybody live on Zug Island?</v>

1147
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1148
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:35.951
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1149
00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 3>Zug Island</v>

1150
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.390
<v Speaker 1>is gross.</v>

1151
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 1>We went to visit.</v>

1152
00:38:38.561 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Sounds great with such a beautiful name.</v>

1153
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Who would think that it would be gross?</v>

1154
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Zug Island stinks.</v>

1155
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.610
<v Speaker 1>It smells like pollution.</v>

1156
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:49.330
<v Speaker 1>You could buy a house across the river from Zug island for 500 bucks.</v>

1157
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad it is.</v>

1158
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:51.101
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>

1159
00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 4>so what you're saying is there's this low resonant hum.</v>

1160
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm merging from a place called Zug island</v>

1161
00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 1>and would Zug island is for,</v>

1162
00:38:59.420 --> 00:38:59.790
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1163
00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 1>it's it cross from Detroit.</v>

1164
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of Detroit and it's for you.</v>

1165
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Speaker 1>They make steel there and they have these giant piles of raw materials and these</v>

1166
00:39:08.381 --> 00:39:09.191
<v Speaker 1>furnaces.</v>

1167
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:14.170
<v Speaker 1>And we talked to a guy named Gregory Fornia who worked there in the 1960s and it</v>

1168
00:39:14.171 --> 00:39:14.350
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1169
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 1>he said it was always disgusting and it was always dangerous and it was always</v>

1170
00:39:17.801 --> 00:39:19.030
<v Speaker 1>environmental hazards.</v>

1171
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:19.691
<v Speaker 1>This is really,</v>

1172
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 1>really polluted.</v>

1173
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:24.430
<v Speaker 1>The river around there is one of the 10 most polluted places in the United</v>

1174
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.610
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

1175
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 1>and yet people are fishing there and pulling fish out left and right where we're</v>

1176
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:27.730
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1177
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 1>So it really kind of scary stuff.</v>

1178
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

1179
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.050
<v Speaker 1>he said that what they're doing,</v>

1180
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 1>they're a wood they've always been doing there is manufacturing steel and he</v>

1181
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:40.450
<v Speaker 1>believes that that sound is just a part of the process,</v>

1182
00:39:40.451 --> 00:39:40.751
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1183
00:39:40.751 --> 00:39:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1184
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.441
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1185
00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:43.690
<v Speaker 1>the process of creating and making steel.</v>

1186
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1187
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1188
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.000
<v Speaker 1>It does make sense.</v>

1189
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.640
<v Speaker 1>What doesn't make sense though is the sound itself,</v>

1190
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.430
<v Speaker 1>when you bring the sound to sound experts and you say,</v>

1191
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:55.360
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that this sound was recorded six miles,</v>

1192
00:39:55.361 --> 00:39:56.150
<v Speaker 1>five miles?</v>

1193
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible?</v>

1194
00:39:57.191 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 1>This sound was recorded x amount of miles away from a source and was this loud</v>

1195
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:03.070
<v Speaker 1>in a person's house and they say,</v>

1196
00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

1197
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:07.510
<v Speaker 1>We met a guy in Windsor named Gary Gross and Gary recorded some sounds that he</v>

1198
00:40:07.511 --> 00:40:08.760
<v Speaker 1>says are the winds are home.</v>

1199
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:09.211
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1200
00:40:09.211 --> 00:40:09.761
<v Speaker 1>And listen to this.</v>

1201
00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:10.594
<v Speaker 1>We're going to play it for you.</v>

1202
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.673
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>

1203
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.230
<v Speaker 1>The imagine being in your house.</v>

1204
00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:20.550
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1205
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And there's something here like this and he is miles away from Zug island.</v>

1206
00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.221
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1207
00:40:29.221 --> 00:40:32.580
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like you're outside of nightclub.</v>

1208
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.780
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like high powered bass speakers.</v>

1209
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1210
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Inside a building.</v>

1211
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Except there's nothing near him.</v>

1212
00:40:39.381 --> 00:40:42.500
<v Speaker 1>He's just in his house and everyone in his neighborhood feels it as well.</v>

1213
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.190
<v Speaker 1>So you're not talking about something that's like a car that has giant speakers.</v>

1214
00:40:46.191 --> 00:40:47.660
<v Speaker 1>It's right outside your door.</v>

1215
00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you hear this.</v>

1216
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:53.690
<v Speaker 1>We you're talking about is something that somehow or another is making these</v>

1217
00:40:53.691 --> 00:40:57.950
<v Speaker 1>people's houses vibrate like this from miles away.</v>

1218
00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:01.520
<v Speaker 1>We don't know of any kind of sound that can do something like that.</v>

1219
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.620
<v Speaker 1>What is Woody's last name would,</v>

1220
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.243
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even Doris.</v>

1221
00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:05.571
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

1222
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Not Worries.</v>

1223
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.450
<v Speaker 1>When we played this sound for Woody Norris,</v>

1224
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.940
<v Speaker 1>who is a an acoustical expert,</v>

1225
00:41:10.941 --> 00:41:11.774
<v Speaker 1>an engineer,</v>

1226
00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.160
<v Speaker 1>brilliant genius.</v>

1227
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.851
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1228
00:41:13.851 --> 00:41:17.540
<v Speaker 1>there's no way the industrial process could make this sound.</v>

1229
00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.860
<v Speaker 1>He said that the amount of power that would be required to make a sound like</v>

1230
00:41:21.861 --> 00:41:26.120
<v Speaker 1>this that would travel that far and not dissipate in the environment is</v>

1231
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.860
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

1232
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:29.960
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1234
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.730
<v Speaker 4>is this something that has been documented?</v>

1235
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1236
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.443
<v Speaker 1>The sour,</v>

1237
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 1>the sound has been documented.</v>

1238
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.910
<v Speaker 1>This sound has been documented by the people that live in the town.</v>

1239
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.060
<v Speaker 1>It's been documented by the politicians that try to get the explanations for the</v>

1240
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:41.894
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>

1241
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.550
<v Speaker 1>but if this is a sound that is emanating from Zug island,</v>

1242
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be insanely loud on Zug island.</v>

1243
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.020
<v Speaker 1>What people are saying though is that when you're around it,</v>

1244
00:41:54.021 --> 00:41:54.890
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the river,</v>

1245
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not that loud.</v>

1246
00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 1>It's when you get further away that it's doing things like this,</v>

1247
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.750
<v Speaker 1>that it's vibrating people's windows,</v>

1248
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 1>vibrating their houses.</v>

1249
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no known explanation for this and when I talk to this guy who's an audio</v>

1250
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:09.741
<v Speaker 1>expert,</v>

1251
00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:12.710
<v Speaker 1>he says that in order to create a power output like that,</v>

1252
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about an insane amount of,</v>

1253
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:16.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1254
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.110
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

1255
00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:17.321
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:42:17.321 --> 00:42:17.950
<v Speaker 5>No that's,</v>

1257
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:18.550
<v Speaker 5>that's an,</v>

1258
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.720
<v Speaker 5>that's a really,</v>

1259
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:24.850
<v Speaker 5>really intense sound and it'd be a bummer to have to deal with listening to that</v>

1260
00:42:24.851 --> 00:42:27.370
<v Speaker 5>because that is a depressing sound.</v>

1261
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.420
<v Speaker 5>That's a sound like in my neighborhood when that sounds starts,</v>

1262
00:42:31.421 --> 00:42:31.811
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1263
00:42:31.811 --> 00:42:35.920
<v Speaker 5>you're not sleeping that night cause someone's having some idiot party until</v>

1264
00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.110
<v Speaker 5>4:00 AM it sounds like a party.</v>

1265
00:42:38.111 --> 00:42:40.960
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like bass speakers it sounds like,</v>

1266
00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 1>but that would be like your neighbor.</v>

1267
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.260
<v Speaker 1>You would have to be like really close for that to be affecting you.</v>

1268
00:42:46.261 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

1269
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that as a weapon.</v>

1270
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.301
<v Speaker 5>If you wanted to,</v>

1271
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:55.301
<v Speaker 5>if you were experimenting with weird forms of weaponry and you could blast that</v>

1272
00:42:55.521 --> 00:43:00.140
<v Speaker 5>sound over someone that you were fighting or someone that you wanted to disrupt,</v>

1273
00:43:00.141 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 5>that would do it because that is not a pleasant sound.</v>

1274
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:03.051
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1275
00:43:03.051 --> 00:43:03.651
<v Speaker 1>but that I don't,</v>

1276
00:43:03.651 --> 00:43:05.600
<v Speaker 1>don't think that that's what anybody's claiming.</v>

1277
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I think what they're claiming is that this is a side effect of the use of this</v>

1278
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.453
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

1279
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1280
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.000
<v Speaker 1>and that most likely what Zug island is,</v>

1281
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:19.030
<v Speaker 1>is some sort of a repeater and that these people are experiencing the sound</v>

1282
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.280
<v Speaker 1>outside of the island because of harp.</v>

1283
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.740
<v Speaker 1>How close is that to harp?</v>

1284
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.810
<v Speaker 1>It's very far from harp,</v>

1285
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but what they're saying is that Zug island could be a repeater station.</v>

1286
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing about harp is that harp,</v>

1287
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 1>although it's really far away,</v>

1288
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:39.080
<v Speaker 1>the whole purpose of the magnetizing the ionosphere or a rather,</v>

1289
00:43:39.081 --> 00:43:39.914
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1290
00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1291
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.960
<v Speaker 1>charging the ionosphere shooting these waves into the ionosphere is so that they</v>

1292
00:43:44.961 --> 00:43:47.300
<v Speaker 1>can transmit long distances.</v>

1293
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 1>So what the conspiracy theorists believe is that Zug island is some sort of a</v>

1294
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:53.390
<v Speaker 1>repeater station.</v>

1295
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.110
<v Speaker 1>So these people who live in Windsor across the river from Zug island are getting</v>

1296
00:43:57.111 --> 00:44:02.111
<v Speaker 1>this crazy sound echo thing going on that's rattling their buildings.</v>

1297
00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:03.500
<v Speaker 1>No one can explain it.</v>

1298
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Speaker 1>W W shaking their windows.</v>

1299
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:05.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1300
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:07.490
<v Speaker 1>these people have really freaked out.</v>

1301
00:44:07.491 --> 00:44:08.061
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1302
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a couple people we're talking to.</v>

1303
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Is this always happening?</v>

1304
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.660
<v Speaker 1>It happens quite often and it's dissipated apparently.</v>

1305
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the heart,</v>

1306
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:20.180
<v Speaker 1>the heart proponents believe that what's happening is that they've realized that</v>

1307
00:44:20.181 --> 00:44:21.380
<v Speaker 1>they're making the sound now,</v>

1308
00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:23.060
<v Speaker 1>so they've turned down the power out.</v>

1309
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:24.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1310
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.751
<v Speaker 5>I don't buy it,</v>

1311
00:44:24.751 --> 00:44:24.961
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1312
00:44:24.961 --> 00:44:28.740
<v Speaker 5>I think if you're dealing with like this super advanced Darpa project that can</v>

1313
00:44:28.741 --> 00:44:29.574
<v Speaker 5>shoot out,</v>

1314
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1315
00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:31.170
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

1316
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 5>the ion is fear.</v>

1317
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.150
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to be like,</v>

1318
00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:33.391
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1319
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:38.391
<v Speaker 4>let's turn Zug island outside of Detroit into a bass speaker so that everyone</v>

1320
00:44:39.211 --> 00:44:40.080
<v Speaker 4>can freak out.</v>

1321
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:40.361
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1322
00:44:40.361 --> 00:44:41.230
<v Speaker 1>that's not what they're saying.</v>

1323
00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.030
<v Speaker 1>They're not saying that they're doing it on purpose.</v>

1324
00:44:43.031 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 1>What they're saying is this is a side effect what they're trying to accomplish.</v>

1325
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1326
00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone is saying that those sky quakes or something they're doing</v>

1327
00:44:51.311 --> 00:44:52.144
<v Speaker 1>on purpose.</v>

1328
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:56.620
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is they're doing some sort of experiments and in doing those</v>

1329
00:44:56.621 --> 00:44:57.430
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>

1330
00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:01.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the side effects is this very strange sound phenomenon.</v>

1331
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.930
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go there and see and investigate and talk to some of these people</v>

1332
00:45:04.931 --> 00:45:06.730
<v Speaker 1>and find out if this holds up.</v>

1333
00:45:06.731 --> 00:45:11.620
<v Speaker 1>But it's a very interesting possibility and these sounds are very unique.</v>

1334
00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1335
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:13.720
<v Speaker 1>very ominous and weird.</v>

1336
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.131
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1337
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 4>they're definitely weird.</v>

1338
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:15.830
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1339
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:17.790
<v Speaker 4>I wonder about the Darpa connection,</v>

1340
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:21.120
<v Speaker 4>but if you go there and actually hear the sound,</v>

1341
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:22.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll be more likely to believe it.</v>

1342
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 4>It's the kind of thing where if I knew someone who'd actually heard the sound</v>

1343
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:26.730
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

1344
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:27.840
<v Speaker 4>then I don't know.</v>

1345
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:28.110
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

1346
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.570
<v Speaker 4>this seems like it seems so easy to fake.</v>

1347
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:34.050
<v Speaker 4>It seems so easy to drop these kinds of things into sound files.</v>

1348
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1349
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1350
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>

1351
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.170
<v Speaker 1>The thing is though,</v>

1352
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:37.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1353
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.140
<v Speaker 1>the compelling thing is that all of these folks,</v>

1354
00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 1>it's well documented that these people have been complaining.</v>

1355
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.401
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1356
00:45:44.401 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 1>when I went through customs,</v>

1357
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:46.561
<v Speaker 1>the guy asked me,</v>

1358
00:45:46.561 --> 00:45:47.221
<v Speaker 1>what are you here for?</v>

1359
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:47.611
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1360
00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm a here to listen to some hum.</v>

1361
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:49.981
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1362
00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:50.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1363
00:45:50.131 --> 00:45:50.970
<v Speaker 1>the winds or hum.</v>

1364
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Like he goes all,</v>

1365
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.931
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1366
00:45:51.931 --> 00:45:52.764
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1367
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:53.011
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1368
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 1>it's probably something going on at Zug island,</v>

1369
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:57.890
<v Speaker 1>like right away the cop that works at the border tells me,</v>

1370
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.380
<v Speaker 1>do you feel,</v>

1371
00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.190
<v Speaker 1>did you hear it?</v>

1372
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1373
00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 1>we didn't hear it.</v>

1374
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 1>But we heard a lot of industrial noise.</v>

1375
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1376
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't sound anything like that.</v>

1377
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:08.540
<v Speaker 1>What we heard is like call out are clanging and trucks moving and stuff.</v>

1378
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.270
<v Speaker 4>Is there any got like one going on around there or any of them?</v>

1379
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:11.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1380
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.031
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1381
00:46:12.031 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's mostly done on Canada.</v>

1382
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1383
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.601
<v Speaker 1>This is what they,</v>

1384
00:46:14.601 --> 00:46:17.880
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing there is they're just creating steel and they're a,</v>

1385
00:46:17.881 --> 00:46:19.040
<v Speaker 1>they're mixing the,</v>

1386
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.090
<v Speaker 1>the raw elements to create,</v>

1387
00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:23.040
<v Speaker 1>create steel and their furnaces.</v>

1388
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:23.580
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>

1389
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.300
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

1390
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of industrial stuff going on there and it's very high security,</v>

1391
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 1>but the high security can easily be explained in that that steel and make,</v>

1392
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:36.840
<v Speaker 1>creating all that steel is very important to the industrial output of the United</v>

1393
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:36.841
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

1394
00:46:36.841 --> 00:46:37.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1395
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:37.850
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>

1396
00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:38.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1397
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:41.980
<v Speaker 1>if you were looking for a place to disrupt our economy or to,</v>

1398
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.833
<v Speaker 1>to mess up,</v>

1399
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:43.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1400
00:46:43.231 --> 00:46:45.270
<v Speaker 1>an area that would be something that would do it.</v>

1401
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.681
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1402
00:46:45.681 --> 00:46:46.281
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>

1403
00:46:46.281 --> 00:46:47.900
<v Speaker 4>You just mentioned that you didn't say there.</v>

1404
00:46:47.901 --> 00:46:49.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a high security area.</v>

1405
00:46:49.191 --> 00:46:50.480
<v Speaker 4>I think that's really weird.</v>

1406
00:46:50.481 --> 00:46:53.450
<v Speaker 4>If this is just supposed to be some toxified industrial island,</v>

1407
00:46:53.451 --> 00:46:55.820
<v Speaker 4>I think there is something suspicious about the therapy.</v>

1408
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:56.400
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1409
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.890
<v Speaker 4>the combination of a massive amount of security around a polluted island and</v>

1410
00:47:00.891 --> 00:47:04.790
<v Speaker 4>some bizarre Godzilla noise rising up out of the nothingness.</v>

1411
00:47:04.791 --> 00:47:07.340
<v Speaker 4>That does seem to indicate that there's more going on there.</v>

1412
00:47:07.341 --> 00:47:08.840
<v Speaker 4>Then just making steel.</v>

1413
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.650
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1414
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:10.730
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible.</v>

1415
00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:11.391
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1416
00:47:11.391 --> 00:47:15.740
<v Speaker 1>it's also very possible that what you're dealing with is a high security because</v>

1417
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:17.540
<v Speaker 1>they're creating steel there.</v>

1418
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.590
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly dangerous that working with volatile materials,</v>

1419
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:26.000
<v Speaker 1>they're also probably doing a lot of environmental damage that they wouldn't</v>

1420
00:47:26.001 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 1>want people to investigate or people to shine cameras and expose all this.</v>

1421
00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:35.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's stinks there but when you go there the water is like greasy with</v>

1422
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell they're leaking into it.</v>

1423
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 1>The guy that we were with was Taz that it floats green.</v>

1424
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.360
<v Speaker 1>There's like this glowing green shit that you see in the water so it's not</v>

1425
00:47:46.361 --> 00:47:46.810
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

1426
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely,</v>

1427
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.760
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely stinks.</v>

1428
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:49.830
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely bad.</v>

1429
00:47:49.831 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1430
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 1>we were thinking while we were there,</v>

1431
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 1>like were breathing this hand like this is like we're,</v>

1432
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:54.600
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1433
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.930
<v Speaker 1>we're taking it fumes.</v>

1434
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1435
00:47:56.171 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Detroit is a crazy place man.</v>

1436
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:02.110
<v Speaker 1>When I went and performed at Mark Reilly's comedy castle,</v>

1437
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.101
<v Speaker 1>awesome spot.</v>

1438
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:04.540
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who drove me there,</v>

1439
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.080
<v Speaker 1>he told me that he used to buy eight balls and go camping,</v>

1440
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 1>like who does cocaine camping?</v>

1441
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.573
<v Speaker 1>Kid Rock.</v>

1442
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1443
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he could blame Detroit or Zug island on that,</v>

1444
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 1>but I feel you.</v>

1445
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1446
00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Detroit is the worst person in the world to be a book.</v>

1447
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst place in the world to be a book.</v>

1448
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.940
<v Speaker 1>There's 47% illiteracy rate and they call it the first American ruin.</v>

1449
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1450
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 1>because there's so many at parts of it that are just gone.</v>

1451
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1452
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.090
<v Speaker 1>across from Zug island,</v>

1453
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 1>you can get a house in Detroit for $500 we saw them,</v>

1454
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.260
<v Speaker 1>they were telling us about it and we saw amazing.</v>

1455
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:41.861
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1456
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:42.850
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want that house.</v>

1457
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:43.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1458
00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:43.301
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1459
00:48:43.301 --> 00:48:48.301
<v Speaker 1>It's got toxic mold and it's next to the moaning of Baphomet and the smell.</v>

1460
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.400
<v Speaker 1>The smell is horrible.</v>

1461
00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:52.750
<v Speaker 1>The smell in the air is,</v>

1462
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.280
<v Speaker 1>it's really a shame.</v>

1463
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a shame.</v>

1464
00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I know you need steel.</v>

1465
00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I know that they need it,</v>

1466
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.330
<v Speaker 1>but first of all to do it right there in a highly populated area like Detroit</v>

1467
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 1>and to do that kind of damage to the environment.</v>

1468
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just sad.</v>

1469
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:05.300
<v Speaker 1>It's sad,</v>

1470
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.310
<v Speaker 1>it seems archaic.</v>

1471
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:09.070
<v Speaker 1>It seems like some shit that they should have figured out how to do better a</v>

1472
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:11.950
<v Speaker 1>long time ago and it kind of makes sense that if you're disrupting the</v>

1473
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:13.740
<v Speaker 1>environment at that level in someplace,</v>

1474
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 1>then there's going to be unexplained side effects like some odd noise.</v>

1475
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that is the case.</v>

1476
00:49:20.561 --> 00:49:21.490
<v Speaker 1>So this is the thing.</v>

1477
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether or not the noise and the industrial output or connected.</v>

1478
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.880
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense when you look at the sound and the sound is coming from this spot</v>

1479
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.270
<v Speaker 1>and you look at the spot and it's a lot of machines moving.</v>

1480
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:38.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of digging in the ground is a lot of making steel Aquaman's razor</v>

1481
00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:39.970
<v Speaker 1>would dictate that sound is probably coming from there,</v>

1482
00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but if these people are to be believed,</v>

1483
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 1>these people that are talking about this sound and the rattling of the houses,</v>

1484
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:46.870
<v Speaker 1>it's too much power.</v>

1485
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 1>It's too much power.</v>

1486
00:49:47.861 --> 00:49:50.050
<v Speaker 1>It's too far away and it's too strange.</v>

1487
00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to make sense.</v>

1488
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 1>And would it could be is that we're connecting these two,</v>

1489
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 1>these two events together.</v>

1490
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1491
00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:58.511
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

1492
00:49:58.511 --> 00:50:01.930
<v Speaker 1>they're not connected and that all those Zug island is a place where they make</v>

1493
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:04.240
<v Speaker 1>the sound where they were creating or rather,</v>

1494
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.980
<v Speaker 1>although Zug island is a place where they make steel that this noise is not</v>

1495
00:50:08.981 --> 00:50:10.180
<v Speaker 1>emanating from Zug island,</v>

1496
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 1>but in fact it's coming from the sky itself,</v>

1497
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.540
<v Speaker 1>from harp.</v>

1498
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:16.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just that people are assuming that Zug island has something to do with it</v>

1499
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 1>cause Zog islands gross so that it's just a coincidence.</v>

1500
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Super Creepy.</v>

1501
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.121
<v Speaker 1>It is creepy.</v>

1502
00:50:22.121 --> 00:50:22.780
<v Speaker 1>That sound,</v>

1503
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.760
<v Speaker 1>that sound is real is very creepy.</v>

1504
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1505
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:25.840
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>

1506
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.170
<v Speaker 1>But you have a good point too,</v>

1507
00:50:27.171 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 1>is that we didn't hear that sound and unless,</v>

1508
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.093
<v Speaker 1>unless you,</v>

1509
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 1>even if it was like someone you really know,</v>

1510
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:38.630
<v Speaker 1>how do you know whether or not they're really recording that sound or whether</v>

1511
00:50:38.631 --> 00:50:41.480
<v Speaker 1>they're getting wacky and getting on their computer and creating it and say,</v>

1512
00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to freak everybody out and I'm going to bring some more cause or more</v>

1513
00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 1>people to this cause more,</v>

1514
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:51.110
<v Speaker 1>more eyes and ears to this plight that we're suffering here when really it's</v>

1515
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:53.740
<v Speaker 1>just normal industrial noise that people are complaining about.</v>

1516
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 1>You gotta go there and see and if there's the site,</v>

1517
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 1>if you hear the sound,</v>

1518
00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:58.340
<v Speaker 1>which I bet you won't,</v>

1519
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 1>then it will be interesting.</v>

1520
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Why do you bet I won't,</v>

1521
00:51:01.971 --> 00:51:02.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1522
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.073
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I will.</v>

1523
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1524
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:04.803
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there you,</v>

1525
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I think the sound of Zug island is the sound of people's neurons frying is they</v>

1526
00:51:10.611 --> 00:51:15.611
<v Speaker 1>smoked Detroit level crystal meth in the basements of their $500 crap homes.</v>

1527
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:16.800
<v Speaker 9>Whoa,</v>

1528
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.410
<v Speaker 9>Whoa,</v>

1529
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:19.280
<v Speaker 9>whoa.</v>

1530
00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:23.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the sound of your brain rotting inside your skull,</v>

1531
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:26.050
<v Speaker 1>bouncing back and forth off the bony walls.</v>

1532
00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.153
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

1533
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:29.741
<v Speaker 1>Imagine though,</v>

1534
00:51:29.741 --> 00:51:31.510
<v Speaker 1>if you were in your house and you're hearing this,</v>

1535
00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.540
<v Speaker 1>it would be the most annoying thing ever.</v>

1536
00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.110
<v Speaker 1>And these people say that it could be 24 hours a day and then sometimes they'll</v>

1537
00:51:38.111 --> 00:51:40.390
<v Speaker 1>get up in the middle of the night to pee and then we'll hear that sound and</v>

1538
00:51:40.391 --> 00:51:41.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll never get back to bed.</v>

1539
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:45.520
<v Speaker 1>They also said that for some reason it seems to correspond with the rain.</v>

1540
00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:48.070
<v Speaker 1>They said when it's stormy and rainy,</v>

1541
00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:48.880
<v Speaker 1>sometime there's,</v>

1542
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.713
<v Speaker 1>there's that sound.</v>

1543
00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:54.190
<v Speaker 1>That is where the heart people come in because they think that that's not a</v>

1544
00:51:54.191 --> 00:51:58.480
<v Speaker 1>coincidence and they think that the rain itself might be rained that was created</v>

1545
00:51:58.481 --> 00:52:01.990
<v Speaker 1>by harp and that that's why these people are saying that whenever it rains and</v>

1546
00:52:01.991 --> 00:52:02.650
<v Speaker 1>your thunder,</v>

1547
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:04.420
<v Speaker 1>that's when this sound is more prominent.</v>

1548
00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:05.081
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1549
00:52:05.081 --> 00:52:05.741
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1550
00:52:05.741 --> 00:52:06.430
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1551
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:11.430
<v Speaker 1>As symptom of whether being controlled by harp is low resonant sound sky quakes.</v>

1552
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:13.720
<v Speaker 1>But that makes sense.</v>

1553
00:52:13.721 --> 00:52:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Sound.</v>

1554
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Think of that.</v>

1555
00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:19.390
<v Speaker 1>It's raining out and you hear this sound and you know that big brother is</v>

1556
00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:23.830
<v Speaker 1>fucking with the sky and making it rain above your shitty $500 house.</v>

1557
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:24.723
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1558
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:25.653
<v Speaker 1>that's leaking.</v>

1559
00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Is it bad enough that I'm here breathing in toxic farts and living in a $500</v>

1560
00:52:31.261 --> 00:52:31.900
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1561
00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.440
<v Speaker 1>You guys got to shake my three remaining windows with your stupid sound.</v>

1562
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:38.730
<v Speaker 1>All I want to do is smoke my mat in peace.</v>

1563
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a physicist named Brooks Agnew who says that he can demonstrate the</v>

1564
00:52:45.701 --> 00:52:50.701
<v Speaker 1>effects of harp in a box that he's built and he creates artificial clouds.</v>

1565
00:52:50.921 --> 00:52:52.210
<v Speaker 1>He is like one of those MREs.</v>

1566
00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:55.780
<v Speaker 1>You know how you buy like a bonsai tree at the mall and they have like the fog</v>

1567
00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.500
<v Speaker 1>that's flowing out of those are beautiful,</v>

1568
00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:58.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1569
00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Well that stuff is very similar to clouds.</v>

1570
00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.073
<v Speaker 1>That vapor,</v>

1571
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:05.140
<v Speaker 1>that water vapor and they puff out at clubs.</v>

1572
00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1573
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:06.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1574
00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:06.670
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1575
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:07.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a smoke.</v>

1576
00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the shit that Michael Braverman likes.</v>

1577
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.010
<v Speaker 1>He likes to put that when we're doing promos a fuck,</v>

1578
00:53:12.011 --> 00:53:13.420
<v Speaker 1>he likes to fill the air with that shit.</v>

1579
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.201
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1580
00:53:17.201 --> 00:53:18.034
<v Speaker 1>I love you buddy.</v>

1581
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1582
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.361
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1583
00:53:19.361 --> 00:53:19.870
<v Speaker 1>The um,</v>

1584
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:20.620
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>

1585
00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:20.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1586
00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:21.700
<v Speaker 1>it's vapor.</v>

1587
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.660
<v Speaker 1>It's water vapor,</v>

1588
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.030
<v Speaker 1>but this guy claims that he,</v>

1589
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.153
<v Speaker 1>this device</v>

1590
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:31.340
<v Speaker 6>that can create the same sort of effect by charging the particles that are</v>

1591
00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:33.120
<v Speaker 6>inside of this,</v>

1592
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 6>this box that he built,</v>

1593
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.960
<v Speaker 6>he can actually prove the effects of harp.</v>

1594
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:37.891
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1595
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:42.891
<v Speaker 6>he's saying that there is a correlation between the e cigarette smoke and his</v>

1596
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:46.290
<v Speaker 6>box and actual clouds.</v>

1597
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1598
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:48.780
<v Speaker 6>what clouds are,</v>

1599
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 6>is vapor.</v>

1600
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:55.040
<v Speaker 6>It's moisture and it's in a condensed sort of a one.</v>

1601
00:53:55.221 --> 00:53:58.830
<v Speaker 6>I should probably actually have a technical explanation because I just ventured</v>

1602
00:53:58.831 --> 00:53:59.450
<v Speaker 6>into bullshit.</v>

1603
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.850
<v Speaker 6>I do that.</v>

1604
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:00.990
<v Speaker 6>I felt myself doing it,</v>

1605
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:03.240
<v Speaker 6>but I pulled back what a cloud is and I'll never,</v>

1606
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:04.980
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea what it is.</v>

1607
00:54:04.981 --> 00:54:09.981
<v Speaker 6>A visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various</v>

1608
00:54:10.921 --> 00:54:14.680
<v Speaker 6>chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body.</v>

1609
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.050
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1610
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:15.690
<v Speaker 6>so now you know,</v>

1611
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:16.180
<v Speaker 6>so it's,</v>

1612
00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:19.590
<v Speaker 6>it is clouds with his guys creating as essentially the same thing as clouds.</v>

1613
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:23.130
<v Speaker 6>He's using moisture and he's using this machine that does something and it</v>

1614
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:24.420
<v Speaker 6>creates e-cigarettes,</v>

1615
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:25.141
<v Speaker 6>e-cigarettes,</v>

1616
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:30.141
<v Speaker 6>or an ionizer that creates water vapor that has nicotine infused into the vapor.</v>

1617
00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.130
<v Speaker 6>Just like Stephen Dorff.</v>

1618
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.360
<v Speaker 6>Awesome commercials.</v>

1619
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:35.491
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>

1620
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 6>Hey guys,</v>

1621
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:41.390
<v Speaker 6>come on guys to take back our freedom saying that if this is like if a giant</v>

1622
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:42.870
<v Speaker 6>Stephen Dorff,</v>

1623
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:46.230
<v Speaker 6>we're breathing east segregate cigarette smoke over America,</v>

1624
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:47.070
<v Speaker 6>it would be cloud.</v>

1625
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:52.100
<v Speaker 6>And if you had a machine you could zap that the clouds and make a tornado that</v>

1626
00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 6>take Stephen Dorff away like the house and the wizard of Oz where it lands on</v>

1627
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:57.810
<v Speaker 6>the witch.</v>

1628
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1629
00:54:58.410 --> 00:54:59.011
<v Speaker 6>Just like that.</v>

1630
00:54:59.011 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 6>And then Darpa would finally have done something amazing for the world.</v>

1631
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 6>That would be the second best thing they did since the Internet.</v>

1632
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:05.731
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

1633
00:55:05.731 --> 00:55:07.470
<v Speaker 6>Stephen Dorff was awesome and blade.</v>

1634
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:07.921
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1635
00:55:07.921 --> 00:55:08.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1636
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 6>So you need to step.</v>

1637
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.360
<v Speaker 6>I stepped played one is the best blade ever.</v>

1638
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.820
<v Speaker 6>Stephen Dorff was the,</v>

1639
00:55:13.821 --> 00:55:15.450
<v Speaker 6>the the bad guy and he was amazing.</v>

1640
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:16.483
<v Speaker 6>She's amazing.</v>

1641
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

1642
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:17.873
<v Speaker 6>So shut it.</v>

1643
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:19.780
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry Steven to laugh.</v>

1644
00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:20.561
<v Speaker 6>Please apologize.</v>

1645
00:55:20.561 --> 00:55:21.250
<v Speaker 6>He's too easy.</v>

1646
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 6>Stephen Dorff.</v>

1647
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 6>Steven making our cloud.</v>

1648
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:25.950
<v Speaker 6>Stephen Dorff is the Nickelback of actors.</v>

1649
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 6>It's too easy to pick on him.</v>

1650
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 6>It's not fair.</v>

1651
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.573
<v Speaker 6>It's rude.</v>

1652
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 6>It's cheap and it's rude.</v>

1653
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 6>He's the rape joke of actors.</v>

1654
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.823
<v Speaker 6>We just need to stop.</v>

1655
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.860
<v Speaker 6>He just stopped the Stephen Stephen Dorff happened to be flipping through</v>

1656
00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:40.620
<v Speaker 6>channels right now and heard that he's going for his pistol.</v>

1657
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.440
<v Speaker 6>Well don't shoot me as long as you going to shoot yourself.</v>

1658
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Speaker 6>Death is inevitable with my friend.</v>

1659
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:45.481
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1660
00:55:45.481 --> 00:55:46.200
<v Speaker 6>but murder,</v>

1661
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.690
<v Speaker 6>you don't want to murder charge like yourself,</v>

1662
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:48.031
<v Speaker 6>Steven,</v>

1663
00:55:48.031 --> 00:55:48.661
<v Speaker 6>don't do it.</v>

1664
00:55:48.661 --> 00:55:49.280
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be fun.</v>

1665
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:49.651
<v Speaker 6>So look,</v>

1666
00:55:49.651 --> 00:55:50.040
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1667
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 6>I think that it's a interesting thing.</v>

1668
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 6>I the box.</v>

1669
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.280
<v Speaker 6>I would wonder if the clouds in this box are identical to the clouds.</v>

1670
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:04.310
<v Speaker 6>It they are actually floating overland because I think like what you just did</v>

1671
00:56:04.441 --> 00:56:05.480
<v Speaker 6>definition that you just read it.</v>

1672
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:06.361
<v Speaker 6>Ice Crystals,</v>

1673
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:07.194
<v Speaker 6>chemicals.</v>

1674
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 6>This is just like ionized vapor.</v>

1675
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:12.600
<v Speaker 6>So I wonder if it looks like it's actually better liquid droplets.</v>

1676
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:16.260
<v Speaker 6>It's a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystal sugar water.</v>

1677
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.780
<v Speaker 6>So it's close enough for various chemicals.</v>

1678
00:56:18.781 --> 00:56:20.400
<v Speaker 6>Like there can be a toxic cloud too.</v>

1679
00:56:20.401 --> 00:56:22.350
<v Speaker 6>That's not not water droplets.</v>

1680
00:56:22.351 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 6>Chemicals can actually form toxic</v>

1681
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:24.590
<v Speaker 1>clouds.</v>

1682
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.680
<v Speaker 5>And he's saying that by shooting some form of electricity into this,</v>

1683
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.710
<v Speaker 1>this is what he says.</v>

1684
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.800
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to say,</v>

1685
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.230
<v Speaker 1>and we're not going to say we've already seen,</v>

1686
00:56:31.231 --> 00:56:33.510
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to change shirts and we're going to go right into this because</v>

1687
00:56:33.511 --> 00:56:34.380
<v Speaker 1>this guy's an idiot.</v>

1688
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1689
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.113
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

1690
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:42.470
<v Speaker 1>So I go to visit this physicist named Brooks Agnew and Brooks Agnew has a box</v>

1691
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:47.250
<v Speaker 1>that he's got this artificial clouds that he's created with this Mr Machine.</v>

1692
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1693
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:51.210
<v Speaker 1>And he believes that he has this machine that can dissipate the clouds.</v>

1694
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.880
<v Speaker 1>So we go and do the experiments.</v>

1695
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:54.743
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1696
00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.580
<v Speaker 1>here's red flag number one.</v>

1697
00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.320
<v Speaker 1>We walk in the door and his friend,</v>

1698
00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:58.801
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1699
00:56:58.801 --> 00:56:59.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo of a,</v>

1700
00:56:59.941 --> 00:57:02.250
<v Speaker 1>an Indian man with white paint on his face.</v>

1701
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.293
<v Speaker 1>So I say,</v>

1702
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:04.163
<v Speaker 1>what's up with this dude?</v>

1703
00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:05.183
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1704
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.671
<v Speaker 1>he went,</v>

1705
00:57:05.671 --> 00:57:09.030
<v Speaker 1>underwent an amazing transformation of his body 10 years ago,</v>

1706
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:11.430
<v Speaker 1>and now he no longer needs food or water.</v>

1707
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.773
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1708
00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:13.111
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1709
00:57:13.111 --> 00:57:13.890
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

1710
00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.240
<v Speaker 1>And I just walk out of the room.</v>

1711
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:15.931
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1712
00:57:15.931 --> 00:57:16.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1713
00:57:16.141 --> 00:57:16.561
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

1714
00:57:16.561 --> 00:57:17.040
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1715
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:17.880
<v Speaker 1>you have to meet this guy.</v>

1716
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:18.031
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

1717
00:57:18.031 --> 00:57:18.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1718
00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1719
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.261
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1720
00:57:19.261 --> 00:57:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1721
00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to meet him.</v>

1722
00:57:20.611 --> 00:57:21.510
<v Speaker 1>And that guy eats,</v>

1723
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.741
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

1724
00:57:22.741 --> 00:57:23.574
<v Speaker 1>get away from me.</v>

1725
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:27.240
<v Speaker 1>And like I knew right away we'd made a horrible mistake cause this is the dude</v>

1726
00:57:27.241 --> 00:57:28.050
<v Speaker 1>he's partying with.</v>

1727
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1728
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not the scientist and the scientist buddy.</v>

1729
00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1730
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.190
<v Speaker 1>So we go in that Brooks has this machine and in this machine he's got the clouds</v>

1731
00:57:35.191 --> 00:57:35.551
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

1732
00:57:35.551 --> 00:57:35.731
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1733
00:57:35.731 --> 00:57:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to turn it on.</v>

1734
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And so he turns it on and uh,</v>

1735
00:57:39.241 --> 00:57:39.511
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1736
00:57:39.511 --> 00:57:42.600
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing the clouds dissipate fairly rapidly and we're like,</v>

1737
00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:43.170
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

1738
00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:44.100
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting.</v>

1739
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:46.290
<v Speaker 1>The clouds have dissipated fairly rapidly.</v>

1740
00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:49.800
<v Speaker 1>But then we noticed this motherfuckers got a crack in the door so the clouds are</v>

1741
00:57:49.801 --> 00:57:50.970
<v Speaker 1>sneaking out of his door.</v>

1742
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1743
00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.490
<v Speaker 1>So now we take over the cracks of the door.</v>

1744
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:54.503
<v Speaker 1>We turn it on again.</v>

1745
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Now this,</v>

1746
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't dissipate at all.</v>

1747
00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1748
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:57.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just sort of hovers there.</v>

1749
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.750
<v Speaker 1>But there's some weird funnels like coming off of it.</v>

1750
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1751
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.940
<v Speaker 1>it does seem to have an effect.</v>

1752
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Well then we opened the door and touch it and it's hot.</v>

1753
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So this stupid machine that he claims is changing the ionosphere and the tube</v>

1754
00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.950
<v Speaker 1>and then making the weather manipulate.</v>

1755
00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:15.443
<v Speaker 1>It's just hot.</v>

1756
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:18.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just a big stupid hot electrical box.</v>

1757
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.130
<v Speaker 1>And when it gives off heat,</v>

1758
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.760
<v Speaker 1>heat rises and it,</v>

1759
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:22.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1760
00:58:22.681 --> 00:58:24.840
<v Speaker 1>it goes through this stupid fake clouds.</v>

1761
00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.820
<v Speaker 1>So nothing so not,</v>

1762
00:58:26.821 --> 00:58:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but here's what's crazy.</v>

1763
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Not only did this guy thought this,</v>

1764
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:36.230
<v Speaker 1>but that this guy thought this enough to build a machine and that he did this</v>

1765
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:37.231
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

1766
00:58:37.231 --> 00:58:38.190
<v Speaker 1>this is so good.</v>

1767
00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:39.720
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be on TV.</v>

1768
00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:40.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1769
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:41.701
<v Speaker 5>that's fun though.</v>

1770
00:58:41.701 --> 00:58:42.534
<v Speaker 5>Going crazy.</v>

1771
00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:45.660
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to go that crazy.</v>

1772
00:58:45.661 --> 00:58:47.520
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how fun that would be?</v>

1773
00:58:47.521 --> 00:58:50.630
<v Speaker 5>Seriously constructing a weather machine in your house?</v>

1774
00:58:50.631 --> 00:58:51.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1775
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:52.560
<v Speaker 5>That will be a blast.</v>

1776
00:58:52.561 --> 00:58:55.560
<v Speaker 5>So he's enjoying life and he somehow his,</v>

1777
00:58:55.561 --> 00:58:57.810
<v Speaker 5>whether machines summoned the TV crew</v>

1778
00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.350
<v Speaker 1>and you know what's really crazy magic.</v>

1779
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.393
<v Speaker 1>He's a white guy.</v>

1780
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:02.141
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

1781
00:59:02.141 --> 00:59:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Who'd a thought it's,</v>

1782
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you never see white guys with these unfounded claims.</v>

1783
00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:13.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a really rare that you see a bunch of white guys in their late forties</v>

1784
00:59:13.151 --> 00:59:17.560
<v Speaker 1>early fifties possibly into their sixties hosts divorce or post divorce,</v>

1785
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.830
<v Speaker 1>just eaten alive by depression.</v>

1786
00:59:20.831 --> 00:59:21.664
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1787
00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:22.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1788
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:22.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1789
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:27.240
<v Speaker 4>waking up and spitting out pieces of their teeth from grinding all night long</v>

1790
00:59:27.241 --> 00:59:31.050
<v Speaker 4>and then going to work on your weather machine is your tears disrupt your</v>

1791
00:59:31.051 --> 00:59:35.040
<v Speaker 4>experiment when you contemplate how your wife left you because you wouldn't stop</v>

1792
00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:36.030
<v Speaker 4>talking about harp.</v>

1793
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 1>And then you call your friend over the Tarion who knows a dude who actually is</v>

1794
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 1>an heir at Terrion.</v>

1795
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Just each air doesn't have water,</v>

1796
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:46.610
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have food that makes sense to you.</v>

1797
00:59:46.611 --> 00:59:49.010
<v Speaker 1>This is the guys hanging out at your house and you go,</v>

1798
00:59:49.011 --> 00:59:50.600
<v Speaker 1>what do you think you to help me put this together?</v>

1799
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto some amazing work.</v>

1800
00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:52.971
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1801
00:59:52.971 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 1>You're doing amazing work.</v>

1802
00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 1>So they put together this stupid thing and it doesn't work.</v>

1803
00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1804
00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.310
<v Speaker 1>and you flew out to that?</v>

1805
00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:58.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1806
00:59:58.761 --> 00:59:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I drove.</v>

1807
00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:00.043
<v Speaker 1>This was an,</v>

1808
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 1>luckily it was in California,</v>

1809
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.410
<v Speaker 1>but not only did we drive,</v>

1810
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 1>but this is how stupid we are.</v>

1811
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>The Guy said there was a mistake with the experiment we want.</v>

1812
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.113
<v Speaker 1>He wants to do it again.</v>

1813
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>So he had them do it again.</v>

1814
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:10.901
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1815
01:00:10.901 --> 01:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>the camera crew went back a second time.</v>

1816
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And guess what happened the second time?</v>

1817
01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Fucking nothing happened.</v>

1818
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.111
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happened.</v>

1819
01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:18.921
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's going to happen.</v>

1820
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>You knew nothing was going to happen.</v>

1821
01:00:20.031 --> 01:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You wanted the camera back again like you,</v>

1822
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>this guy probably has seen the secret like a thousand times and he thinks that</v>

1823
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>if he really truly believes that this is a weather machine,</v>

1824
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:29.780
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes a weather machine.</v>

1825
01:00:29.781 --> 01:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Or something.</v>

1827
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.670
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

1828
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.350
<v Speaker 4>the next season of this show,</v>

1829
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.260
<v Speaker 4>you are going to be riddled with trolls.</v>

1830
01:00:36.261 --> 01:00:38.660
<v Speaker 4>Who realized that you guys will come out to anything.</v>

1831
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:40.423
<v Speaker 4>It's too late.</v>

1832
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:41.961
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

1833
01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 4>Just email the Scifi channel and Joe Rogan shows up at your house.</v>

1834
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 4>If you've farted in a box.</v>

1835
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:47.631
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1836
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:48.950
<v Speaker 1>it's way too late for that.</v>

1837
01:00:48.951 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the photo that I tweeted yesterday of me,</v>

1838
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1839
01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>with this stupid fucking apparatus on my head?</v>

1840
01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Cause some asshole claims that this stupid apparatus was going to uh,</v>

1841
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.860
<v Speaker 1>detect electricity that comes off of my eyeballs.</v>

1842
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1843
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.701
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1844
01:01:04.701 --> 01:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>this fuck had gotten me to where this,</v>

1845
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>this guy got me to wear this.</v>

1846
01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>And inside this thing does goggle inside the goggle is like a sensor.</v>

1847
01:01:12.861 --> 01:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And the sensor reads the electricity coming off your eyeballs.</v>

1848
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>So he's talking to all these scientific terms and he's got a degree in Canada.</v>

1849
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And so he tells me he's,</v>

1850
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>he tells me that this device measures of the electricity coming off your</v>

1851
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:30.230
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs and that theoretically you could feel this electricity on the back of</v>

1852
01:01:30.231 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>your head scientifically explaining the psychic phenomenon that a lot of people</v>

1853
01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:35.301
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>

1854
01:01:35.301 --> 01:01:38.540
<v Speaker 1>which is that people can tell when people are looking at the back of their head.</v>

1855
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>So this fuck head gets me to put on this stupid thing.</v>

1856
01:01:42.501 --> 01:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I got glue all over my head.</v>

1857
01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Lucky I'm bald because then I just have to clean my head.</v>

1858
01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>If that was in my hair,</v>

1859
01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd be pissed.</v>

1860
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Especially if had some beautiful like Joey Lawrence and the nineties hair,</v>

1861
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>just something flowing,</v>

1862
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:54.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1863
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>and then saw this gooey shit.</v>

1864
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:57.283
<v Speaker 1>A boy can dream.</v>

1865
01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:57.741
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1866
01:01:57.741 --> 01:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I got these goggles on and the goggles have a sensor in and he shows me that on</v>

1867
01:02:02.121 --> 01:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>this EKG.</v>

1868
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>So what it's called Eeg,</v>

1869
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Kanji,</v>

1870
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:05.443
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's called.</v>

1871
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>He shows me EEG.</v>

1872
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Electroencephalogram.</v>

1873
01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1874
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>He shows me on this computer that the e g f set up is reading all the electrodes</v>

1875
01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 1>on my head,</v>

1876
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>but also reading the one that's in front of my eye.</v>

1877
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:23.010
<v Speaker 6>And then it's a very similar signal,</v>

1878
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.970
<v Speaker 6>thus indicating that electricity is coming off of your eyeball,</v>

1879
01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 6>like the evil eye in scientific form.</v>

1880
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:30.503
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1881
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.170
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1882
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:31.471
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1883
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:32.060
<v Speaker 6>I say,</v>

1884
01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:32.520
<v Speaker 6>hmm.</v>

1885
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 6>So I look at his test and I go,</v>

1886
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:36.420
<v Speaker 6>did you ever try just putting it on your hand?</v>

1887
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:41.730
<v Speaker 6>And then I just put it on my hand and it's the same thing,</v>

1888
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:44.100
<v Speaker 6>this same signal.</v>

1889
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 6>And the only time it's not the same signal is when it's shaking because I'm</v>

1890
01:02:47.641 --> 01:02:47.881
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>

1891
01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:52.881
<v Speaker 6>it's the same fucking signal you made me put glue on my head and I'm holding</v>

1892
01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 6>your wacky space goggles that you think can measure eyeball raise.</v>

1893
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.300
<v Speaker 6>You'll fuck head look what you've done to me.</v>

1894
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm mad.</v>

1895
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:01.951
<v Speaker 6>And I said to him,</v>

1896
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:02.221
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

1897
01:03:02.221 --> 01:03:03.590
<v Speaker 6>how did you get again,</v>

1898
01:03:03.591 --> 01:03:04.160
<v Speaker 6>same thing.</v>

1899
01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.700
<v Speaker 6>How did you get on TV with this?</v>

1900
01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:07.800
<v Speaker 6>How did it Kinda does and how has this,</v>

1901
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.220
<v Speaker 6>not just a dumb idea that you fucked around with with your friends,</v>

1902
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 6>but you got so far that you went to her producer and said,</v>

1903
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:15.600
<v Speaker 6>well this is what I can do.</v>

1904
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:16.410
<v Speaker 6>And he went,</v>

1905
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:17.640
<v Speaker 6>I like your Moxie.</v>

1906
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 6>I think this is going to really happen.</v>

1907
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 6>I think this is going to be an amazing segment once they show that you are</v>

1908
01:03:23.521 --> 01:03:28.230
<v Speaker 6>correct and that you can shoot raise from your eyes and then I can detect this,</v>

1909
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Speaker 6>oh this is going to be fantastic stuff.</v>

1910
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 6>You could probably be on Doctor Oz after this show.</v>

1911
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.053
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1912
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:33.541
<v Speaker 6>But no,</v>

1913
01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:38.541
<v Speaker 6>it's just another white dude with unfounded claims in his 50s and access to</v>

1914
01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 6>aluminum foil.</v>

1915
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 6>He had aluminum foil and head glue.</v>

1916
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:48.360
<v Speaker 6>Has anybody looked into the correlation between starting to like aluminum foil</v>

1917
01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:49.280
<v Speaker 6>and going insane?</v>

1918
01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:52.410
<v Speaker 6>It's like cats they make out of,</v>

1919
01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:56.460
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's literally wear tinfoil hat theory came from somewhere along the</v>

1920
01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:56.761
<v Speaker 6>lines.</v>

1921
01:03:56.761 --> 01:03:59.190
<v Speaker 6>So many fuckheads had tin foil hats on,</v>

1922
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 6>but people actually came up with that expression.</v>

1923
01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 6>Like if you say that expression,</v>

1924
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 6>the tin foil hat brigade,</v>

1925
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.330
<v Speaker 6>people know exactly what you're saying.</v>

1926
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.040
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to say conspiracy theorist.</v>

1927
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:08.491
<v Speaker 6>He say,</v>

1928
01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:08.611
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1929
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.700
<v Speaker 6>he's one of those tin foil hat wearing motherfuckers,</v>

1930
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 6>and then the conversation's over.</v>

1931
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:16.230
<v Speaker 6>If you aren't using aluminum foil for cooking,</v>

1932
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.020
<v Speaker 6>there's a 15% chance you've gotten and saying,</v>

1933
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:22.740
<v Speaker 6>what is,</v>

1934
01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 6>what is it about aluminum?</v>

1935
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:26.580
<v Speaker 6>And that's the shift that people look forward to.</v>

1936
01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:27.310
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1937
01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:28.030
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1938
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:31.200
<v Speaker 6>I can show people that always claiming this plane aluminum.</v>

1939
01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:33.240
<v Speaker 6>It's all aluminum with these guys.</v>

1940
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 6>You know what's crazy is the ground is mostly aluminum.</v>

1941
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:43.740
<v Speaker 6>A lot of God damn aluminum up there.</v>

1942
01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:45.810
<v Speaker 6>Apparently it's super cheap.</v>

1943
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:46.883
<v Speaker 6>Jamaica</v>

1944
01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.590
<v Speaker 6>is a source of aluminum.</v>

1945
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.060
<v Speaker 6>Jamaica is a source of aluminum.</v>

1946
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:52.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1947
01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:52.560
<v Speaker 6>They put,</v>

1948
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:52.711
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1949
01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:54.990
<v Speaker 6>it's apparently according to scientists,</v>

1950
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.810
<v Speaker 6>it's one of the most common minerals known to man.</v>

1951
01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.300
<v Speaker 6>It's also what you put into an apple.</v>

1952
01:05:00.301 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 6>If you've lost your pipe,</v>

1953
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:04.020
<v Speaker 6>you can smoke weed from an apple on aluminum foil.</v>

1954
01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:05.190
<v Speaker 6>Aluminum foil pipes.</v>

1955
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:05.851
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:06.690
<v Speaker 6>That's the foil though,</v>

1957
01:05:06.691 --> 01:05:07.524
<v Speaker 6>buddy.</v>

1958
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.371
<v Speaker 6>It's not the same thing.</v>

1959
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:09.600
<v Speaker 6>It's a mineral that's in the ground.</v>

1960
01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:11.110
<v Speaker 6>You're talking nothing crazy.</v>

1961
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.990
<v Speaker 6>Foil isn't made of aluminum.</v>

1962
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:13.561
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

1963
01:05:13.561 --> 01:05:14.311
<v Speaker 6>it's made of aluminum.</v>

1964
01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:16.760
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to talk about it too long or we'll both go insane.</v>

1965
01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:19.030
<v Speaker 6>If it's aluminum foil,</v>

1966
01:05:19.031 --> 01:05:22.840
<v Speaker 6>just aluminum or does it have anything else that's mixed into it and heat it</v>

1967
01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:23.674
<v Speaker 6>down?</v>

1968
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:26.940
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of fascinating that they can make metal that you can just repeat here</v>

1969
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:29.290
<v Speaker 6>is the downwards slippery slope.</v>

1970
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:30.340
<v Speaker 6>Well it's kind of cool.</v>

1971
01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:31.390
<v Speaker 6>Aluminum foil is cool.</v>

1972
01:05:31.391 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 6>Like you could take an ass hole and you could wrap that apple up in it.</v>

1973
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.290
<v Speaker 6>Like did you take a piece of food and wrap it up in the internet or a friend?</v>

1974
01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 6>Turn her under an android.</v>

1975
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:41.530
<v Speaker 6>Don't do that because chicks are always going to think that you really want an</v>

1976
01:05:41.531 --> 01:05:43.420
<v Speaker 6>android and then we're going to make them insecure.</v>

1977
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 6>I do it to ever make a girl do dress up bro.</v>

1978
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.990
<v Speaker 6>Who says</v>

1979
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:51.520
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1980
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 6>I tried to take away your favorite thing in life.</v>

1981
01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.431
<v Speaker 6>Go like,</v>

1982
01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:56.330
<v Speaker 6>who the fuck are you?</v>

1983
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:04.630
<v Speaker 6>It's like saying never put salt on French fries.</v>

1984
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.280
<v Speaker 6>How far do you take dress up though?</v>

1985

2003
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.010
<v Speaker 6>There's a certain amount of dress up that you're allowed to do.</v>

2004
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.820

2017
01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:08.140
<v Speaker 6>like a girl likes to wear leather or she likes you to tie her up,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

2048
01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:04.591
<v Speaker 6>If TV was advanced enough to recognize that no one's being offended anymore by</v>

2049
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:05.833
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>

01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:07.450
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2052
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.190
<v Speaker 6>At a certain point in time they would have to,</v>

2053
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:09.491
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2054
01:08:09.491 --> 01:08:11.440
<v Speaker 6>they have to accept that when podcasts,</v>

2055
01:08:11.441 --> 01:08:14.890
<v Speaker 6>I'd having the same exact commercials and they're pretty close is television</v>

2056
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 6>then they're going</v>

2057
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.843
<v Speaker 2>to have to accept that.</v>

2058
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:17.330
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2059

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:20.810
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait for African Mama in their hand.</v>

2065
01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:20.961
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2066
01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:21.321

2071
01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 4>they asked him what his least favorite song was and he said that Macklemore song</v>

2072
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:31.790
<v Speaker 4>about thrift shops and he said,</v>

2073
01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 4>the reason is like,</v>

2074
01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:38.250
<v Speaker 4>it's like having to explain to your daughter what jizzing is or what,</v>

2075
01:08:40.341 --> 01:08:40.821
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2076
01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 4>Like when your kids listen to it or like there's apparently a song in the</v>

2077
01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:45.700
<v Speaker 4>Macklemore's song about pissing on,</v>

2078
01:08:45.701 --> 01:08:46.190

2082
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:49.603
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

2083
01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.750
<v Speaker 4>Kelly R.</v>

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:50.751
<v Speaker 4>Kelly.</v>

2085
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:54.230
<v Speaker 4>There's apparently some reference to our Kelly and the song and magical is</v>

2086
01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 4>pointing out how like it puts you in a weird place when your kid is asking who</v>

2087
01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 4>are Kelly is and why they're talking about him pissing his bed or what?</v>

2088
01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.171
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2089
01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:04.680
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2090
01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.640
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

2097
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.840
<v Speaker 4>If they're under 15 they're young.</v>

2098
01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:16.973
<v Speaker 4>That's rude.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well I think kids can get to this music.</v>

2127
01:09:46.021 --> 01:09:49.920
<v Speaker 4>I guess if I had kids it would put me in a weird predicament if I'm always</v>

2128
01:09:49.921 --> 01:09:54.540
<v Speaker 4>having to explain to them like adult concepts cause I have to either decide</v>

2129
01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:57.870
<v Speaker 4>between lying to them or like telling them the truth.</v>

2130
01:09:57.871 --> 01:10:00.270
<v Speaker 4>And that's a weird place to get into with a kid</v>

2131
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:05.000
<v Speaker 2>and the now in 2013 that's not really necessary anymore because by the time a</v>

2132
01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:06.680
<v Speaker 2>kid gets to be 13 years old,</v>

2133
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.950
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2134
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 2>they've seen it all.</v>

2135
01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2136
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 2>That's true to me.</v>

2137
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Remember how much shit you saw that your parents had no idea.</v>

2138
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Like did you ever see any like faces of death stuff?</v>

2139
01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2140
01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:15.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2141
01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2142
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:16.610
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2143
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2144
01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:19.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean we saw a lot of shit that you,</v>

2145
01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:19.820
<v Speaker 2>you didn't,</v>

2146
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.070
<v Speaker 2>no one ever saw before us.</v>

2147
01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>

2148
01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:22.901
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2149
01:10:22.901 --> 01:10:23.681
<v Speaker 4>But we never see,</v>

2150
01:10:23.681 --> 01:10:25.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean the stuff that kids are seeing now is just,</v>

2151
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2152
01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:29.700
<v Speaker 2>we were the first generation c we were the first people with VCRs.</v>

2153
01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:30.410
<v Speaker 2>See our,</v>

2154
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.350
<v Speaker 2>our family,</v>

2155
01:10:31.351 --> 01:10:34.560
<v Speaker 2>like our parents did not grow up with VCRs.</v>

2156
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2157
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:36.060
<v Speaker 2>So when they grew up,</v>

2158
01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.840
<v Speaker 2>either saw something on TV or you didn't and you didn't get to see it again.</v>

2159
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:40.500
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>

2160
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.630
<v Speaker 2>the only time you saw it again as if they played it again and they never played</v>

2161
01:10:42.631 --> 01:10:43.464
<v Speaker 2>anything again.</v>

2162
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.500
<v Speaker 2>They'd played a few movies like every now and then they'll take King Kong is</v>

2163
01:10:46.501 --> 01:10:47.191
<v Speaker 2>going to be on again.</v>

2164
01:10:47.191 --> 01:10:48.690
<v Speaker 2>You'd know when you'd wait for it.</v>

2165
01:10:48.691 --> 01:10:48.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2166
01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:50.730
<v Speaker 2>They have to watch it as it was happening.</v>

2167
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.360
<v Speaker 2>So our generation was the first generation that had tapes and we would get</v>

2168
01:10:56.491 --> 01:11:00.030
<v Speaker 2>something and stick it in something and press play when we wanted.</v>

2169
01:11:00.031 --> 01:11:01.660
<v Speaker 2>So we were the first people to,</v>

2170
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:05.610
<v Speaker 2>to take that next level information thing and right.</v>

2171
01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:10.690
<v Speaker 2>And what did we do with it faces a death barnyard Betty like some of the most</v>

2172
01:11:10.951 --> 01:11:12.600
<v Speaker 2>fucked up heinous things ever.</v>

2173
01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Like within a few years</v>

2174
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 6>of making VHS tapes,</v>

2175
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.590
<v Speaker 6>they had a whole series of faces of death and that's when the UFC came out.</v>

2176
01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:22.460
<v Speaker 6>And like all these different things like the early UFC is,</v>

2177
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:23.031
<v Speaker 6>we're like that.</v>

2178
01:11:23.031 --> 01:11:25.830
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of people thought that was what you were watching wasn't a martial</v>

2179
01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:26.250
<v Speaker 6>art.</v>

2180
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:29.340
<v Speaker 6>They thought what you were watching was just like some faces of death type</v>

2181
01:11:29.341 --> 01:11:29.581
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2182
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:29.731
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2183
01:11:29.731 --> 01:11:30.131
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

2184
01:11:30.131 --> 01:11:31.130
<v Speaker 6>but watching cage fighting.</v>

2185
01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:31.973
<v Speaker 6>This is crazy.</v>

2186
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.660
<v Speaker 6>It became a martial arts.</v>

2187
01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

2188
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.401
<v Speaker 6>Beginning.</v>

2189
01:11:34.401 --> 01:11:36.060
<v Speaker 6>It was like more of a freak show than anything.</v>

2190
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 6>Yup,</v>

2191
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 6>but the kids today,</v>

2192
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:38.760
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

2193
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.593
<v Speaker 6>that's a joke.</v>

2194
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:40.201
<v Speaker 6>The kids today,</v>

2195
01:11:40.201 --> 01:11:41.100
<v Speaker 6>like a beheading.</v>

2196
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:42.121
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>

2197
01:11:42.121 --> 01:11:44.400
<v Speaker 6>That's another thing I heard that foreign yard Betty</v>

2198
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.720
<v Speaker 4>for teenagers,</v>

2199
01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:48.480
<v Speaker 4>anal sex is second base.</v>

2200
01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Like they're fucking each other in the ass</v>

2201
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.250
<v Speaker 6>soul before they're having vaginal sex.</v>

2202
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.080
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2203
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2204
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.100
<v Speaker 6>That's like a night of making out.</v>

2205
01:11:56.101 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 6>You probably end up sticking your cock and a girl's ass.</v>

2206
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:00.983
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Well she knew your girlfriend was a dirty girl.</v>

2270
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.310

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 4>Like she was like that.</v>

2273
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:17.070
<v Speaker 4>You should have to wear it.</v>

2274
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.943
<v Speaker 6>Come on now.</v>

2275
01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.321
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

2276
01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:21.154
<v Speaker 6>In the swamp.</v>

2277
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.980
<v Speaker 6>That was your first girlfriend.</v>

2278
01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:24.460
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

2279
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.200
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2280
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:28.450
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2281
01:14:28.451 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 6>Albino and swell.</v>

2282
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.900
<v Speaker 6>That sounds like a Stephen Lynch movie.</v>

2283
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.310
<v Speaker 6>David David Lynch.</v>

2284
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 6>Stephen Lynch is a singer.</v>

2285
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.373
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

2286
01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 6>that is a David Lynch.</v>

2287
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Movio translucent skin blue vein.</v>

2288
01:14:43.821 --> 01:14:44.141
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2289
01:14:44.141 --> 01:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>a swamp.</v>

2290
01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Blue van.</v>

2291
01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:48.850
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] long cliteracy you don't know whether you say something or not</v>

2292
01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:52.040
<v Speaker 6>that's going to deal with this.</v>

2293
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:53.380
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

2294
01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:53.820
<v Speaker 6>it's not</v>

2295
01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.720
<v Speaker 1>quite a finger,</v>

2296
01:14:54.721 --> 01:14:58.890
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's definitely a finger that's been bitten off like a nub.</v>

2297
01:14:59.130 --> 01:14:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It's enough.</v>

2298
01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's a finger.</v>

2299
01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:03.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like a finger that lost a bar fight.</v>

2300
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:07.110
<v Speaker 1>When do you talk about the length of a girl's clutter?</v>

2301
01:15:07.111 --> 01:15:10.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like what do you think immediately after you get done fucking her to your</v>

2302
01:15:10.471 --> 01:15:11.150
<v Speaker 1>friends?</v>

2303
01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it's,</v>

2304
01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.230
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how big it is.</v>

2305
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:14.580
<v Speaker 1>If it's totally normal,</v>

2306
01:15:14.581 --> 01:15:15.414
<v Speaker 1>it never comes up.</v>

2307
01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2308
01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:16.981
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2309
01:15:16.981 --> 01:15:17.814
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2310
01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I've never discussed the length of my life by my wife's cliteracy.</v>

2311
01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:21.840
<v Speaker 1>You should totally normal.</v>

2312
01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:22.853
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now,</v>

2313
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.910
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing special about it.</v>

2314
01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:26.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a regular vagina.</v>

2315
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:26.993
<v Speaker 1>It looks great.</v>

2316
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.990
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

2317
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.771
<v Speaker 1>Great good design.</v>

2318
01:15:28.771 --> 01:15:29.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to fuck with it.</v>

2319
01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need pin stripes,</v>

2320
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.943
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2321
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:33.390
<v Speaker 1>the crazy ones,</v>

2322
01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.740
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are weird,</v>

2323
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:38.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like what is that like why is there an evolutionary advantage for looking</v>

2324
01:15:38.731 --> 01:15:40.320
<v Speaker 1>like a Mousse with a gunshot hole in it?</v>

2325
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:41.890
<v Speaker 6>Oh his.</v>

2326
01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.500
<v Speaker 6>What is it about?</v>

2327
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:48.180
<v Speaker 6>Is it about some of them</v>

2328
01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:50.030
<v Speaker 1>that vary so widely,</v>

2329
01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.130
<v Speaker 1>but at least with a woman like it doesn't,</v>

2330
01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they vary so much and well I guess they do vary in size,</v>

2331
01:15:57.350 --> 01:16:01.480
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have any like social stigma attached to it and in fact have a</v>

2332
01:16:01.481 --> 01:16:02.190
<v Speaker 1>girl has a,</v>

2333
01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>a very small and a welcoming tight little area that's probably better than a big</v>

2334
01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:09.470
<v Speaker 1>crazy loose thing.</v>

2335
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:12.590
<v Speaker 1>So it works the opposite for them than it does for us.</v>

2336
01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.280
<v Speaker 1>For us,</v>

2337
01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>it's as evolutionary advantage to have a large penis.</v>

2338
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're big Rasputin looking.</v>

2339
01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.090
<v Speaker 1>We looked at Rasputin's yesterday.</v>

2340
01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.350

2341
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2342
01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.320
<v Speaker 4>I've seen Rasputin's cock jar.</v>

2343
01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:29.370
<v Speaker 4>I heard his story that Rasputin was at a bar and telling people that he was rice</v>

2344
01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:31.070
<v Speaker 4>Buton and they're like,</v>

2345
01:16:31.071 --> 01:16:31.491

01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:33.043
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

2353
01:16:40.611 --> 01:16:41.840
<v Speaker 4>It's 11 inches soft.</v>

2354
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:42.950
<v Speaker 4>It's a big jar too.</v>

2355
01:16:42.951 --> 01:16:46.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like that would not fit in a regular mayonnaise size jar.</v>

2356
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:47.263
<v Speaker 4>Costco Jar.</v>

2357
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:47.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2358
01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:51.350
<v Speaker 4>He would have to get a Costco Jelly bean jar if they have a special caulk jar.</v>

2359
01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.213
<v Speaker 4>It's just for Cox.</v>

2360
01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:52.541
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2361
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:53.374

2371
01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:12.750
<v Speaker 4>You can still feel evil coming off of it.</v>

2372
01:17:12.751 --> 01:17:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2380
01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.490
<v Speaker 1>It's freezing cold.</v>

2381
01:17:26.491 --> 01:17:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's an asshole.</v>

2382
01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:31.650

2383
01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:35.820
<v Speaker 1>So they're up there freezing their dicks off and one guy comes along just</v>

2384
01:17:35.821 --> 01:17:38.850
<v Speaker 1>swinging a monster hog and having a good old time.</v>

2399
01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.530
<v Speaker 4>you can't cheat with rescued because like if you're in bed with your wife and</v>

2400
01:18:06.531 --> 01:18:10.260
<v Speaker 4>you look down at her vagina and it looks like a sink hole,</v>

2404
01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.500
<v Speaker 4>That this is like,</v>

2405
01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:25.490
<v Speaker 4>it's a cock the size of the width of an encyclopedia.</v>

2406
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:28.800
<v Speaker 1>But regular vaginas have babies go through them,</v>

2407
01:18:28.801 --> 01:18:33.030
<v Speaker 1>which are much bigger than a cock and I snap like they snap right back.</v>

2408
01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.810
<v Speaker 4>If your wife gave birth the next day when you be able to tell dude,</v>

2409
01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:39.700
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2410
01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:41.770
<v Speaker 1>but Rasputin's Dick was not nine pounds.</v>

2411
01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.031
<v Speaker 1>I did have,</v>

2412
01:18:43.031 --> 01:18:44.080
<v Speaker 1>these are nine pounds,</v>

2413
01:18:44.081 --> 01:18:44.470
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2414
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Vaginas are crazy.</v>

2415
01:18:46.271 --> 01:18:47.104
<v Speaker 1>Oregon's,</v>

2416
01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:52.170
<v Speaker 1>they stretch out and pop out a baby and then snap back shut like a clam.</v>

2417
01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:54.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't snap back shut like I am.</v>

2418
01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a slow snapback.</v>

2419
01:18:57.150 --> 01:18:57.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2420
01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.560
<v Speaker 1>they stitch up stitch up any tearing.</v>

2421
01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:04.240
<v Speaker 1>They snapped back like it's like a slow congealing.</v>

2422
01:19:04.241 --> 01:19:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2423
01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:05.740
<v Speaker 1>How do you know now?</v>

2424
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:06.940
<v Speaker 1>I've been through it three times.</v>

2425
01:19:06.941 --> 01:19:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

2426
01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.740
<v Speaker 1>My wife's vagina is excellent.</v>

2427
01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.680
<v Speaker 1>They stitch that shit up there.</v>

2428
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.820
<v Speaker 1>There's some tearing and I think when they,</v>

2429
01:19:12.821 --> 01:19:13.600
<v Speaker 1>when they stitch it up,</v>

2430
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.120
<v Speaker 1>they have that Benny Hill music plan</v>

2431
01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.670
<v Speaker 1>because they know that you got to do it again.</v>

2432
01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:21.850
<v Speaker 1>He's just going to get pregnant again.</v>

2433
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:23.020
<v Speaker 1>What would that one more time.</v>

2434
01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:23.900
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2435
01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:24.733
<v Speaker 1>Damn man.</v>

2436
01:19:28.710 --> 01:19:29.461
<v Speaker 4>It is weird though.</v>

2437
01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:31.560
<v Speaker 4>How nature did didn't build in the,</v>

2438
01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2439
01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.960
<v Speaker 4>it's weird that that's,</v>

2440
01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.460
<v Speaker 4>that there is a tear.</v>

2441
01:19:35.461 --> 01:19:36.480
<v Speaker 4>It's funny that it's,</v>

2442
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:40.560
<v Speaker 4>it's not built so that it just pops a baby out without there being damaged or</v>

2443
01:19:40.561 --> 01:19:41.100
<v Speaker 4>pain.</v>

2444
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:41.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2445
01:19:41.251 --> 01:19:44.430
<v Speaker 1>that's how chimps do you ever see chimps give birth now pull up,</v>

2446
01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:46.350
<v Speaker 1>see if you could see a chimp giving birth.</v>

2447
01:19:46.351 --> 01:19:46.531
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2448
01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:47.490
<v Speaker 1>we've got a video online.</v>

2449
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:51.390
<v Speaker 1>The way chimps give birth as they just reach in and pull it out and that's it</v>

2450
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:52.303
<v Speaker 1>and they're done.</v>

2451
01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.780
<v Speaker 1>They just reach in,</v>

2452
01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:55.710
<v Speaker 1>pull the baby out,</v>

2453
01:19:55.711 --> 01:19:56.544
<v Speaker 1>put it down,</v>

2454
01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:00.870
<v Speaker 1>clean it off a little bit and they don't come out helpless either mean obviously</v>

2455
01:20:00.871 --> 01:20:02.400
<v Speaker 1>they need their mother but they're not like us.</v>

2456
01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:05.460
<v Speaker 1>We come out like incredibly help us for a long time.</v>

2457
01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.271
<v Speaker 1>We can't even walk,</v>

2458
01:20:06.271 --> 01:20:07.020
<v Speaker 1>we can't do shit.</v>

2459
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 1>We can't even control our own</v>

2460
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.461
<v Speaker 6>heads.</v>

2461
01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:09.390
<v Speaker 6>We just fall forward.</v>

2462
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:10.121
<v Speaker 6>We are,</v>

2463
01:20:10.121 --> 01:20:14.340
<v Speaker 6>our heads are so big that we have to be born like way earlier in the process</v>

2464
01:20:14.341 --> 01:20:18.840
<v Speaker 6>than other animals and our minds are so complex that the gestation process takes</v>

2465
01:20:18.841 --> 01:20:19.674
<v Speaker 6>a long time here.</v>

2466
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.630
<v Speaker 6>What this that's the baby.</v>

2467
01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 6>She leans back like she's in an old school,</v>

2468
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:30.531
<v Speaker 6>Traci lords movie and she just grabs a hold of the hair on the baby and she's</v>

2469
01:20:31.441 --> 01:20:33.060
<v Speaker 6>just squeezing it out.</v>

2470
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.820
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't seem like she's in any pain at all.</v>

2471
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:37.253
<v Speaker 6>And she's,</v>

2472
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 6>she just squeezing on her very casual,</v>

2473
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.830
<v Speaker 6>her vagina and a,</v>

2474
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.620
<v Speaker 6>the baby heads is slowly popping out and she's just trying to figure out when to</v>

2475
01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:49.410
<v Speaker 6>get a grip on it and the males coming over to check it out.</v>

2476
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:51.180
<v Speaker 6>There's no doctors,</v>

2477
01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.890
<v Speaker 6>not a sanitary environment.</v>

2478
01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.990
<v Speaker 6>I terrible mural,</v>

2479
01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.850
<v Speaker 6>not a Filipino lady to be seen.</v>

2480
01:20:58.350 --> 01:21:00.420
<v Speaker 6>Try going to a hospital and not seeing a Filipino.</v>

2481
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:01.973
<v Speaker 6>Good luck.</v>

2482
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.851
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why,</v>

2483
01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 6>but that is true.</v>

2484
01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:05.070
<v Speaker 6>They just make awesome nurses.</v>

2485
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:10.080
<v Speaker 6>They're drawn to hospitals like math and she's like sitting there while this a</v>

2486
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.430
<v Speaker 6>baby's coming out of her body.</v>

2487
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.220
<v Speaker 6>It just,</v>

2488
01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:12.550
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2489
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:17.550
<v Speaker 6>the evolutionary process is so strange and when you see like a life coming out</v>

2490
01:21:19.471 --> 01:21:20.304
<v Speaker 6>of a life,</v>

2491
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:22.770
<v Speaker 6>it's one of the weirdest things you get.</v>

2492
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.710
<v Speaker 6>I've seen it several times now.</v>

2493
01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:26.573
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2494
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 6>twice in person and it's a,</v>

2495
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.630
<v Speaker 6>it's a trip man.</v>

2496
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:31.673
<v Speaker 6>It's really a trip.</v>

2497
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:34.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm assuming that's her mate,</v>

2498
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.650
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know like the other ones like watching,</v>

2499
01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:39.060
<v Speaker 6>he's concerned it's insurance.</v>

2500
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 6>She's most likely a whore and she probably fucked every champion the whole</v>

2501
01:21:42.271 --> 01:21:42.580
<v Speaker 6>group.</v>

2502
01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:44.790
<v Speaker 6>But she's just trying to look at this.</v>

2503
01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:45.683
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2504
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.440
<v Speaker 6>She's,</v>

2505
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 6>she's just bending over and he's checking it out now and she's like,</v>

2506
01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:49.741
<v Speaker 6>what do you see?</v>

2507
01:21:49.741 --> 01:21:50.370
<v Speaker 6>Flexible.</v>

2508
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:50.641
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:21:50.641 --> 01:21:50.971
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>

2510
01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 6>what do you think?</v>

2511
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.440
<v Speaker 6>Is it ready?</v>

2512
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.960
<v Speaker 6>And he just know,</v>

2513
01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:54.983
<v Speaker 6>hmm.</v>

2514
01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:56.131
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2515
01:21:56.131 --> 01:21:56.964
<v Speaker 6>And she's like,</v>

2516
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:58.350
<v Speaker 6>it's so weird.</v>

2517
01:21:58.410 --> 01:21:59.191
<v Speaker 6>Like I'll get it now.</v>

2518
01:21:59.191 --> 01:22:00.420
<v Speaker 6>She's squeezing them out there.</v>

2519
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:00.751
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

2520
01:22:00.751 --> 01:22:02.880
<v Speaker 6>This is crazy plot.</v>

2521
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:04.810
<v Speaker 6>Oh Damn.</v>

2522
01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.630
<v Speaker 6>That needs to be an animated Gif file.</v>

2523
01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 6>Like the moment the baby comes out and the puddle that creates and the,</v>

2524
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:11.251
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2525
01:22:11.251 --> 01:22:12.850
<v Speaker 6>the male is it?</v>

2526
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.970
<v Speaker 6>Of course she's eating the placenta,</v>

2527
01:22:14.971 --> 01:22:15.721
<v Speaker 6>the ether percent there.</v>

2528
01:22:15.721 --> 01:22:16.554
<v Speaker 6>Right away.</v>

2529
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:18.360
<v Speaker 6>I've heard that you should do that.</v>

2530
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:19.500
<v Speaker 6>That is a fucking trip.</v>

2531
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.580
<v Speaker 6>That is it.</v>

2532
01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:21.413
<v Speaker 6>Such a trip.</v>

2533
01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.200
<v Speaker 6>What's really true and so sweet.</v>

2534
01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.010
<v Speaker 6>They're both licking the little chin.</v>

2535
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 6>What's really a trip is that chimpanzees are a,</v>

2536
01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:32.610
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a distant relative of us.</v>

2537
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.140
<v Speaker 6>And at one point in time,</v>

2538
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:38.250
<v Speaker 6>our ancient ancient ancestors would probably very similar to this and that</v>

2539
01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:42.150
<v Speaker 6>something happened and we kept going and we went from that to this.</v>

2540
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.290
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2541
01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:44.780
<v Speaker 6>that that seems a lot,</v>

2542
01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:49.270
<v Speaker 6>a lot sweeter and more natural than doing it in some sterile room.</v>

2543
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.880
<v Speaker 6>People wearing weird clothes.</v>

2544
01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:52.410
<v Speaker 6>Well that's not sterile.</v>

2545
01:22:52.411 --> 01:22:53.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's not natural.</v>

2546
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:54.061
<v Speaker 6>That was in a zoo,</v>

2547
01:22:54.061 --> 01:22:54.600
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

2548
01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.040
<v Speaker 6>That was on a slab of concrete.</v>

2549
01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:56.730
<v Speaker 6>How,</v>

2550
01:22:56.730 --> 01:22:59.640
<v Speaker 6>how natural is it for a chimp to give birth on concrete?</v>

2551
01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:00.091
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

2552
01:23:00.091 --> 01:23:00.924
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2553
01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:03.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why I said kind of fucked up about the baby coming out on that hard</v>

2554
01:23:03.691 --> 01:23:04.081
<v Speaker 6>surface.</v>

2555
01:23:04.081 --> 01:23:05.620
<v Speaker 6>Like if they were in jungle,</v>

2556
01:23:05.621 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 6>the jungle</v>

2557
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.910
<v Speaker 1>soft.</v>

2558
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like when we were in Seattle looking for big for it to set the ground.</v>

2559
01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2560
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:10.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2561
01:23:10.211 --> 01:23:10.610
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2562
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:11.750
<v Speaker 3>It's very soft.</v>

2563
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Like you could shoot out a kid there with no problem.</v>

2564
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2565
01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.930
<v Speaker 3>If you heard about the father Zod and the source family,</v>

2566
01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:18.793
<v Speaker 3>do you know about this?</v>

2567
01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.430
<v Speaker 3>What father's Od and the source family and the source family?</v>

2568
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.331
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

2569
01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:26.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a cult and I can't remember if it's Manson or father's side,</v>

2570
01:23:26.121 --> 01:23:26.841
<v Speaker 3>but in these calls,</v>

2571
01:23:26.841 --> 01:23:27.530
<v Speaker 3>you know the lemon,</v>

2572
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:29.720
<v Speaker 3>of course they give birth after they get impregnated.</v>

2573
01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2574
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And this guy,</v>

2575
01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.501
<v Speaker 3>as I recall,</v>

2576
01:23:33.501 --> 01:23:34.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think of it's Manson.</v>

2577
01:23:34.821 --> 01:23:36.320
<v Speaker 3>I got my coat leaders make step.</v>

2578
01:23:36.321 --> 01:23:40.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember which one but in one of these look up father Zod umbilical</v>

2579
01:23:40.521 --> 01:23:41.354
<v Speaker 3>cord,</v>

2580
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:43.260
<v Speaker 1>that classic search</v>

2581
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:47.940
<v Speaker 1>we NSA is knocking on my door as we speak.</v>

2582
01:23:47.941 --> 01:23:48.774
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

2583
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2584
01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2585
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:51.611
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2586
01:23:51.611 --> 01:23:52.860
<v Speaker 3>it's just as documentary where it's,</v>

2587
01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:56.580
<v Speaker 3>it was the point is that a woman gave birth and I can't remember if it's Manson</v>

2588
01:23:56.581 --> 01:23:57.361
<v Speaker 3>her father's out,</v>

2589
01:23:57.361 --> 01:24:02.130
<v Speaker 3>but one of them chewed the umbilical cord off like bid it bit through.</v>

2590
01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.130
<v Speaker 3>It is probably your father is odd cause I never heard that story.</v>

2591
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:05.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2592
01:24:05.491 --> 01:24:07.470
<v Speaker 3>it's father's Zach because you'd hear about it with Manson.</v>

2593
01:24:07.471 --> 01:24:08.430
<v Speaker 3>It was father's out,</v>

2594
01:24:08.431 --> 01:24:10.050
<v Speaker 3>but it kind of makes sense.</v>

2595
01:24:10.051 --> 01:24:10.650
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>

2596
01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:14.850
<v Speaker 1>now looking at that video of that chimpanzee given birth on the floor,</v>

2597
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:16.980
<v Speaker 1>that zoo like seeing that animal,</v>

2598
01:24:16.981 --> 01:24:19.320
<v Speaker 1>how alien that is to you or I,</v>

2599
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.690
<v Speaker 1>but not that much.</v>

2600
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is alien,</v>

2601
01:24:22.801 --> 01:24:23.461
<v Speaker 1>it's an animal.</v>

2602
01:24:23.461 --> 01:24:26.520
<v Speaker 1>But it's kind of human like and a lot of ways sure.</v>

2603
01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.241
<v Speaker 1>Aware,</v>

2604
01:24:27.241 --> 01:24:28.080
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

2605
01:24:28.081 --> 01:24:29.550
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to what's going on,</v>

2606
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:30.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2607
01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:31.030
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2608
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:33.420
<v Speaker 1>the two arms and two legs thing.</v>

2609
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2610
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's so similar.</v>

2611
01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:39.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's so strange and it's so strange to think that somewhere in the past</v>

2612
01:24:39.871 --> 01:24:42.210
<v Speaker 1>that's if you believe in evolution,</v>

2613
01:24:42.630 --> 01:24:43.590
<v Speaker 1>which you shouldn't,</v>

2614
01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:44.820
<v Speaker 1>which you shouldn't,</v>

2615
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:47.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's somewhere in the past allegedly,</v>

2616
01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:51.750
<v Speaker 1>we were something like that and that we were all sort of,</v>

2617
01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:52.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2618
01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.990
<v Speaker 1>developing along a similar line.</v>

2619
01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.120
<v Speaker 1>And one of us became,</v>

2620
01:24:57.121 --> 01:24:57.840
<v Speaker 1>you and I,</v>

2621
01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.310
<v Speaker 1>one of us became a Homosapien,</v>

2622
01:24:59.311 --> 01:25:00.090
<v Speaker 1>became a human being.</v>

2623
01:25:00.090 --> 01:25:00.923
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2624
01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:03.240
<v Speaker 1>But there's other ones.</v>

2625
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:05.100
<v Speaker 1>This is the Homo Floresiensis,</v>

2626
01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:07.320
<v Speaker 1>that little hobbit man and the island of Flores.</v>

2627
01:25:07.321 --> 01:25:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2628
01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:09.150
<v Speaker 1>There's neanderthal.</v>

2629
01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Notice how I said tall because I'm very educated.</v>

2630
01:25:12.061 --> 01:25:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

2631
01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2632
01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the old way I'm current.</v>

2633
01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2634
01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.753
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2635
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:19.560
<v Speaker 3>I how I judge a man by the way.</v>

2636
01:25:19.561 --> 01:25:21.040
<v Speaker 3>He pronounces neanderthals.</v>

2637
01:25:21.330 --> 01:25:21.720
<v Speaker 3>You're tall.</v>

2638
01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.531
<v Speaker 3>You're kind of an asshole.</v>

2639
01:25:22.531 --> 01:25:23.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm an asshole.</v>

2640
01:25:23.641 --> 01:25:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2641
01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:24.653
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

2642
01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:25.860
<v Speaker 3>That's how I'm Anderson.</v>

2643
01:25:25.861 --> 01:25:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Cooper says neanderthal because you're right.</v>

2644
01:25:28.021 --> 01:25:28.560
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

2645
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting neanderthal</v>

2646
01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:32.520
<v Speaker 3>southern wrong with that.</v>

2647
01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:33.683
<v Speaker 3>The underdog.</v>

2648
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.771
<v Speaker 3>It sounds better.</v>

2649
01:25:34.771 --> 01:25:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2650
01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.813
<v Speaker 3>over the job</v>

2651
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:36.763
<v Speaker 1>I would have Flores,</v>

2652
01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:37.603
<v Speaker 1>ma'am,</v>

2653
01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:39.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a three foot tall hobbit man.</v>

2654
01:25:39.351 --> 01:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Really fascinating thing that until a few a few years ago,</v>

2655
01:25:42.681 --> 01:25:44.240
<v Speaker 1>they thought it was just horse shit.</v>

2656
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:48.170
<v Speaker 1>They really had no idea that 10,000 plus years ago there was this little tiny</v>

2657
01:25:48.171 --> 01:25:52.100
<v Speaker 1>man running around and running around the same time there was grown humans like</v>

2658
01:25:52.101 --> 01:25:54.380
<v Speaker 1>you and I like or rather our size.</v>

2659
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:55.983
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2660
01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.830
<v Speaker 1>even though we're both short the,</v>

2661
01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:58.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2662
01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.620
<v Speaker 1>the question has always been,</v>

2663
01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:01.813
<v Speaker 1>are there others?</v>

2664
01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>And the question always been if</v>

2665
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.761
<v Speaker 2>there were others,</v>

2666
01:26:04.761 --> 01:26:05.930
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck would they be hiding?</v>

2667
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2668
01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:06.920
<v Speaker 2>If there's an aisle,</v>

2669
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:07.101
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2670
01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 2>they didn't find out about gorillas and to the early 19 hundreds,</v>

2671
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:10.910
<v Speaker 2>but the deal,</v>

2672
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:13.730
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of a disingenuous thing to say though,</v>

2673
01:26:13.731 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 2>because the world of the 19 hundreds doesn't even remotely resemble the world</v>

2674
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:18.950
<v Speaker 2>that we see today.</v>

2675
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2676
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Because the world that we see today,</v>

2677
01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:20.900
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2678
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:25.700
<v Speaker 2>we pretty much have a good account of what's alive in almost every place.</v>

2679
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:26.151
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2680
01:26:26.151 --> 01:26:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Might've missed a few spots.</v>

2681
01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some weird shit,</v>

2682
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 2>like every now and then they'll find like a weird frog and New Guinea or a D in</v>

2683
01:26:32.181 --> 01:26:32.751
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam.</v>

2684
01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:34.220
<v Speaker 2>It's been hiding in the jungle and they're like,</v>

2685
01:26:34.221 --> 01:26:35.054
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2686
01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.240
<v Speaker 2>But where people are not willing to go is with another intelligent animal.</v>

2687
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:44.360
<v Speaker 2>You could say you found a previously unknown deer in Vietnam,</v>

2688
01:26:44.361 --> 01:26:45.560
<v Speaker 2>which did happen recently.</v>

2689
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2690
01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:46.731
<v Speaker 2>A couple of years ago.</v>

2691
01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:47.360
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2692
01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.200
<v Speaker 2>big animal,</v>

2693
01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:49.760
<v Speaker 2>like a size of a whitetail deer,</v>

2694
01:26:49.761 --> 01:26:52.310
<v Speaker 2>completely different species they weren't aware of before,</v>

2695
01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:54.710
<v Speaker 2>but it lives in the jungle and you go,</v>

2696
01:26:54.711 --> 01:26:54.921
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2697
01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I could kind of see that happen,</v>

2698
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:58.790
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of an intelligent thing,</v>

2699
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.490
<v Speaker 2>that's where people won't budge.</v>

2700
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:05.330
<v Speaker 2>The idea of an intelligent ape like human,</v>

2701
01:27:05.331 --> 01:27:06.290
<v Speaker 2>like thing,</v>

2702
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:11.690
<v Speaker 2>another branch on the evolutionary chain of lower hominids to human being</v>

2703
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.710
<v Speaker 2>another branch.</v>

2704
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.251
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2705
01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:16.340
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting how in the news when you hear about,</v>

2706
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 5>they discovered a new lizard in the Amazon.</v>

2707
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:19.731
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2708
01:27:19.731 --> 01:27:19.941
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2709
01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:20.600
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2710
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.231
<v Speaker 5>Who Cares?</v>

2711
01:27:21.231 --> 01:27:22.640
<v Speaker 5>I'll think about that for four seconds.</v>

2712
01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:23.660
<v Speaker 5>It's not interesting at all.</v>

2713
01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:25.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't even want to look at a picture of it.</v>

2714
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:25.641
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2715
01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:27.320
<v Speaker 5>But if they came out and said,</v>

2716
01:27:27.321 --> 01:27:32.321
<v Speaker 5>we found an intelligent apelike being living in its own civilization and the</v>

2717
01:27:32.511 --> 01:27:34.100
<v Speaker 5>depths of the rain forest,</v>

2718
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:36.230
<v Speaker 5>that would make news forever.</v>

2719
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2720
01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:37.710
<v Speaker 5>So change the world.</v>

2721
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:38.061
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2722
01:27:38.061 --> 01:27:38.301
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

2723
01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:39.260
<v Speaker 5>we're so,</v>

2724
01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:40.970
<v Speaker 5>it is interesting that we do,</v>

2725
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:45.500
<v Speaker 5>it's not a surprise any other species that gets discovered out in the great vast</v>

2726
01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:46.990
<v Speaker 5>wilderness that still exist,</v>

2727
01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.110
<v Speaker 5>but for whatever reason,</v>

2728
01:27:48.111 --> 01:27:52.660
<v Speaker 5>we immediately disregard the idea that there could be another form of super</v>

2729
01:27:52.661 --> 01:27:53.840
<v Speaker 5>advanced primate.</v>

2730
01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Others.</v>

2731
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:56.530
<v Speaker 2>And they found primates very recently.</v>

2732
01:27:56.531 --> 01:27:56.970
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2733
01:27:56.970 --> 01:27:58.630
<v Speaker 2>they found this little pygmy primate.</v>

2734
01:27:58.830 --> 01:28:00.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a little tiny little monkey thing.</v>

2735
01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:01.990
<v Speaker 2>It's really small though.</v>

2736
01:28:01.991 --> 01:28:04.020
<v Speaker 2>So we don't really give a shit about it now.</v>

2737
01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2738
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:05.150
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

2739
01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:06.160
<v Speaker 2>You found a tiny monkey,</v>

2740
01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.290
<v Speaker 2>but if you found a seven foot tall monkey,</v>

2741
01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:10.970
<v Speaker 2>they would go ho Lee shit.</v>

2742
01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.560
<v Speaker 2>What is it</v>

2743
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.730
<v Speaker 5>that if it didn't,</v>

2744
01:28:13.731 --> 01:28:14.330
<v Speaker 5>they just fine,</v>

2745
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:16.610
<v Speaker 5>but didn't they just find something akin to that?</v>

2746
01:28:16.611 --> 01:28:16.791
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2747
01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:17.610
<v Speaker 5>didn't you?</v>

2748
01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:17.960
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2749
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.610
<v Speaker 5>what did you call,</v>

2750
01:28:18.610 --> 01:28:20.240
<v Speaker 5>it's called the shit.</v>

2751
01:28:20.241 --> 01:28:22.220
<v Speaker 5>It's some very rare carnivorous apes.</v>

2752
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2753
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Pull up an image of the Bondo ape.</v>

2754
01:28:25.461 --> 01:28:29.390
<v Speaker 2>You could see one that got shot and you can see this animal and this is an</v>

2755
01:28:29.391 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 2>animal that,</v>

2756
01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:30.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2757
01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:34.490
<v Speaker 2>up until I think 1996 they didn't have any photos of it.</v>

2758
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:39.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a wildlife photographer from Switzerland named Carl Armand and Carl</v>

2759
01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:40.311
<v Speaker 2>Armaun went to,</v>

2760
01:28:40.311 --> 01:28:41.930
<v Speaker 2>that's a really old picture,</v>

2761
01:28:41.931 --> 01:28:42.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2762
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a picture from like the early 19 hundreds it could be a,</v>

2763
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:47.451
<v Speaker 2>I think that is,</v>

2764
01:28:47.451 --> 01:28:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a picture where it was a huge chimpanzee and they didn't know</v>

2765
01:28:50.721 --> 01:28:51.520
<v Speaker 2>why that,</v>

2766
01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:51.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2767
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:52.730
<v Speaker 2>that chimp was,</v>

2768
01:28:52.731 --> 01:28:53.564
<v Speaker 2>was so big.</v>

2769
01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:54.920
<v Speaker 2>That's the one that got shot.</v>

2770
01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a,</v>

2771
01:28:56.190 --> 01:28:58.580
<v Speaker 2>a chimpanzee that's way larger.</v>

2772
01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.110
<v Speaker 2>The other TV doesn't work.</v>

2773
01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2774
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:01.243
<v Speaker 2>it's off.</v>

2775
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:01.561
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2776
01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 2>For a reason.</v>

2777
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2778
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:03.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2779
01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:04.290
<v Speaker 1>That CBC,</v>

2780
01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:04.621
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

2781
01:29:04.621 --> 01:29:04.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2782
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:06.000
<v Speaker 1>but you can just look at it,</v>

2783
01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:06.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2784
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:06.661
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2785
01:29:06.661 --> 01:29:07.494
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to look at it.</v>

2786
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.730
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2787
01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you can see that thing behind you.</v>

2788
01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Just look at it and just this not looking for happy.</v>

2789
01:29:12.091 --> 01:29:12.571
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

2790
01:29:12.571 --> 01:29:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to stumble onto that thing.</v>

2791
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 1>They shot it,</v>

2792
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.840
<v Speaker 1>but that's that.</v>

2793
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:16.920
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a gorilla.</v>

2794
01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:19.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like a chimpanzee and it looks like a gorilla.</v>

2795
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's called the Bondo ape,</v>

2796
01:29:21.450 --> 01:29:24.160
<v Speaker 1>and up until the 1990s this thing was just a,</v>

2797
01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:25.800
<v Speaker 1>it was a myth.</v>

2798
01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a legend.</v>

2799
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:30.780
<v Speaker 1>It's an enormous chimpanzee and the locals in the Congo,</v>

2800
01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.580
<v Speaker 1>they say there's two types of chimps.</v>

2801
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.930
<v Speaker 1>There's the tree beaders and the lion killers and the tree beaters are these</v>

2802
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.900
<v Speaker 1>smaller chimps that who swing from tree to tree.</v>

2803
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.280
<v Speaker 1>The lion killers are these bondo apes that are giant champs that sleep on the</v>

2804
01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:45.610
<v Speaker 1>ground like gorillas.</v>

2805
01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2806
01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:46.980
<v Speaker 1>They're not scared of anything.</v>

2807
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.080
<v Speaker 1>They sleep on the ground.</v>

2808
01:29:48.081 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to hide in the trees.</v>

2809
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:50.161
<v Speaker 1>Like to this day,</v>

2810
01:29:50.161 --> 01:29:53.340
<v Speaker 1>the reason why people have their master bedroom on the top floor,</v>

2811
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:54.000
<v Speaker 1>it was the whole,</v>

2812
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.650
<v Speaker 1>the whole chimpanzee idea,</v>

2813
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:59.280
<v Speaker 1>or you get to the the highest branches where you're the most protected and</v>

2814
01:29:59.281 --> 01:30:00.114
<v Speaker 1>that's where you rest.</v>

2815
01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:01.130
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

2816
01:30:01.131 --> 01:30:02.000
<v Speaker 5>I never knew that,</v>

2817
01:30:02.001 --> 01:30:02.301
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2818
01:30:02.301 --> 01:30:03.200
<v Speaker 5>you're absolutely right.</v>

2819
01:30:03.201 --> 01:30:04.430
<v Speaker 5>What the house,</v>

2820
01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:05.930
<v Speaker 5>it's at the top of the building.</v>

2821
01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:07.530
<v Speaker 5>That's the best part of the building.</v>

2822
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.960
<v Speaker 5>Just the leopards can't get there.</v>

2823
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.800
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2824
01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2825
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:11.330
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

2826
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.823
<v Speaker 5>That is crazy.</v>

2827
01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:13.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2828
01:30:13.571 --> 01:30:17.170
<v Speaker 1>these animals that are so big that they're not even scared,</v>

2829
01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.690
<v Speaker 1>they don't go to the top of the tree.</v>

2830
01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:22.660
<v Speaker 1>So probably the branches would break cause they're probably several hundred</v>

2831
01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:22.860
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

2832
01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2833
01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not like a small chimpanzee.</v>

2834
01:30:24.871 --> 01:30:27.790
<v Speaker 1>You mean they're like three plus maybe even four.</v>

2835
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2836
01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.120
<v Speaker 1>So you're dealing with an enormous chimpanzee that occasionally will walk</v>

2837
01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:31.840
<v Speaker 1>upright.</v>

2838
01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:32.290
<v Speaker 1>There's phone,</v>

2839
01:30:32.290 --> 01:30:33.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a camera trap photo of one.</v>

2840
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.050
<v Speaker 1>So if you can pull that up though,</v>

2841
01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Karl Armaun camera trap chimpanzee,</v>

2842
01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you can see this thing walking upright and they're six feet tall.</v>

2843
01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2844
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:42.423
<v Speaker 1>It's enormous.</v>

2845
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:43.360
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about chimp,</v>

2846
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:47.560
<v Speaker 1>that's four inches taller than me and it's huge.</v>

2847
01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Just gigantic muscles.</v>

2848
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Probably as strong as all like a thousand pound man.</v>

2849
01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2850
01:30:53.170 --> 01:30:56.170
<v Speaker 1>And they got a video of one eating a fucking leper.</v>

2851
01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:59.550
<v Speaker 5>And here's the important note in relation to Sasquatch,</v>

2852
01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:01.260
<v Speaker 5>they just found the thing,</v>

2853
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:05.130
<v Speaker 5>1990 you have a six foot chimp that walks up right?</v>

2854
01:31:05.370 --> 01:31:06.870
<v Speaker 5>Wandering around in the,</v>

2855
01:31:06.871 --> 01:31:07.430
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

2856
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:08.070
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2857
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.940
<v Speaker 5>in nature.</v>

2858
01:31:08.941 --> 01:31:11.250
<v Speaker 5>And no one's discovered it until just now.</v>

2859
01:31:11.251 --> 01:31:13.350
<v Speaker 5>No one's gotten proof of it till just now.</v>

2860
01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2861
01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Look at this thing.</v>

2862
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:16.040
<v Speaker 1>This is the picture of it walking.</v>

2863
01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:17.720
<v Speaker 1>It's walking upright.</v>

2864
01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a shit resolution.</v>

2865
01:31:19.281 --> 01:31:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see in that photo,</v>

2866
01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:24.830
<v Speaker 1>but that thing is walking hunched over and upright and it's six feet tall.</v>

2867
01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Those are devil chimps.</v>

2868
01:31:25.731 --> 01:31:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Their heads look like skulls.</v>

2869
01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:27.741
<v Speaker 1>Look at their heads.</v>

2870
01:31:27.741 --> 01:31:28.400
<v Speaker 1>They were enormous.</v>

2871
01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:28.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2872
01:31:28.551 --> 01:31:31.820
<v Speaker 1>they have a crest on their head like a gorilla that the only other chimpanzees</v>

2873
01:31:31.821 --> 01:31:34.040
<v Speaker 1>and the only other a primate besides gorillas,</v>

2874
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:35.810
<v Speaker 1>they have a crest on their head like that.</v>

2875
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:38.630
<v Speaker 1>So they thought initially before they ran DNA tests on them,</v>

2876
01:31:38.631 --> 01:31:41.810
<v Speaker 1>they thought initially that they were a hybrid between a gorilla and a</v>

2877
01:31:41.811 --> 01:31:42.644
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee,</v>

2878
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.310
<v Speaker 1>but now it appears that it's just a subset of this chimpanzee if he's a species.</v>

2879
01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:46.711
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2880
01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:51.711
<v Speaker 5>so to me that that is one of the things that exist in the world that made me</v>

2881
01:31:52.471 --> 01:31:57.300
<v Speaker 5>think it's possible that there is a Yeti or a Sasquatch because w how could you</v>

2882
01:31:57.301 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 5>not discover something that's that size,</v>

2883
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:02.320
<v Speaker 4>that that is that unique?</v>

2884
01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't,</v>

2885
01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:08.040
<v Speaker 4>if something like that can hide from modern society for so long after the</v>

2886
01:32:08.441 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 4>invention of cameras,</v>

2887
01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:13.210
<v Speaker 4>after the invention of helicopters,</v>

2888
01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:16.960
<v Speaker 4>then why couldn't there be something like a Sasquatch or a Yeti or something</v>

2889
01:32:16.961 --> 01:32:17.351
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

2890
01:32:17.351 --> 01:32:17.691
<v Speaker 4>Still out?</v>

2891
01:32:17.691 --> 01:32:17.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2892
01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:18.140
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2893
01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:18.471
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2894
01:32:18.471 --> 01:32:19.520
<v Speaker 1>They found the gorilla,</v>

2895
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:21.230
<v Speaker 1>like we said in the early 19 hundreds.</v>

2896
01:32:21.231 --> 01:32:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It didn't find this for almost a hundred years after that.</v>

2897
01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2898
01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And we know the chimpanzees are intelligent.</v>

2899
01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:26.360
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2900
01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:29.450
<v Speaker 1>but we also know that they're not nearly as intelligent as people.</v>

2901
01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that thing was hiding from people or it was just in a place that</v>

2902
01:32:32.901 --> 01:32:34.700
<v Speaker 1>was so remote and so hard to get to.</v>

2903
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:36.860
<v Speaker 1>The Congo is enormous.</v>

2904
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2905
01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:37.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2906
01:32:37.341 --> 01:32:40.670
<v Speaker 1>it's really impossible for us to wrap our heads around it.</v>

2907
01:32:40.671 --> 01:32:43.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost as wide as the United States is.</v>

2908
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>It's huge,</v>

2909
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I think is that they're correct.</v>

2910
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:47.083
<v Speaker 1>Google that place.</v>

2911
01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2912
01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:48.171
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2913
01:32:48.171 --> 01:32:48.920
<v Speaker 1>it's enormous.</v>

2914
01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2915
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:50.301
<v Speaker 1>it's many,</v>

2916
01:32:50.301 --> 01:32:50.601
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2917
01:32:50.601 --> 01:32:50.901
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2918
01:32:50.901 --> 01:32:52.580
<v Speaker 1>many millions of square miles.</v>

2919
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2920
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:53.571
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

2921
01:32:53.571 --> 01:32:57.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not without outside the realm of possibility that this almost impenetrable</v>

2922
01:32:57.381 --> 01:32:59.270
<v Speaker 1>jungle can hold a bunch of different animals in it.</v>

2923
01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:03.350
<v Speaker 1>But the difference being this animal looks like another animal that we already</v>

2924
01:33:03.351 --> 01:33:03.980
<v Speaker 1>knew about.</v>

2925
01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:05.450
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's not that crazy.</v>

2926
01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2927
01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot is a totally new thing.</v>

2928
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2929
01:33:08.721 --> 01:33:11.390
<v Speaker 1>you're saying there's an animal that no one's ever found.</v>

2930
01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.141
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that.</v>

2931
01:33:12.141 --> 01:33:12.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the Congo.</v>

2932
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

2933
01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Louise from top to bottom.</v>

2934
01:33:16.371 --> 01:33:17.990
<v Speaker 1>It's almost the same height as,</v>

2935
01:33:17.991 --> 01:33:18.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2936
01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.393
<v Speaker 1>as the United States.</v>

2937
01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.293
<v Speaker 1>That's giant.</v>

2938
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's all jungle.</v>

2939
01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.680
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2940
01:33:24.681 --> 01:33:25.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2941
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:27.380
<v Speaker 1>the idea that this is a big foot though,</v>

2942
01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.010
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets a real squirrely because you're talking about a totally</v>

2943
01:33:31.011 --> 01:33:36.011
<v Speaker 1>undiscovered primate that lives around people and gets real close to people,</v>

2944
01:33:37.071 --> 01:33:38.690
<v Speaker 1>but never when they have their cameras out.</v>

2945
01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Never a picture that is,</v>

2946
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:44.610
<v Speaker 4>are a picture like what you just showed me at the Bondo ape.</v>

2947
01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:47.410
<v Speaker 4>Never a picture or video where you,</v>

2948
01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 4>it's indisputable.</v>

2949
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:49.220
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2950
01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:50.500
<v Speaker 4>it's very similar to you,</v>

2951
01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 4>fos or goes through any other thing like that.</v>

2952
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:53.561
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2953
01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:58.561
<v Speaker 4>every picture is easily discounted or at least,</v>

2954
01:33:58.890 --> 01:34:00.330
<v Speaker 1>or not quite good enough.</v>

2955
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:01.183
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2956
01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Not quite good enough.</v>

2957
01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Every photos like,</v>

2958
01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:04.261
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2959
01:34:04.261 --> 01:34:05.700
<v Speaker 1>that might be Sasquatch.</v>

2960
01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:07.023
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

2961
01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:07.861
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2962
01:34:07.861 --> 01:34:08.880
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell</v>

2963
01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:13.440
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] not a single camera trap.</v>

2964
01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you want any camera traps are out there now hunters used them,</v>

2965
01:34:16.321 --> 01:34:19.200
<v Speaker 1>they set them up on trails and they put these things out there.</v>

2966
01:34:19.201 --> 01:34:21.240
<v Speaker 1>And what they do is they take a photo.</v>

2967
01:34:21.241 --> 01:34:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Either they have two ways of doing it.</v>

2968
01:34:23.011 --> 01:34:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Either they take a photo every three or four seconds or five seconds or whatever</v>

2969
01:34:26.401 --> 01:34:26.761
<v Speaker 1>you said it,</v>

2970
01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:27.850
<v Speaker 1>four or they,</v>

2971
01:34:27.851 --> 01:34:29.250
<v Speaker 1>they act on motion.</v>

2972
01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.490
<v Speaker 1>So when they see something walking in front of them,</v>

2973
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:33.420
<v Speaker 1>a flash will go off and they take a photo.</v>

2974
01:34:33.570 --> 01:34:34.031
<v Speaker 1>So they will,</v>

2975
01:34:34.031 --> 01:34:36.120
<v Speaker 1>it'll deal either be night vision and the work at night,</v>

2976
01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:37.620
<v Speaker 1>or they'll work on a flash system.</v>

2977
01:34:37.650 --> 01:34:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2978
01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.630
<v Speaker 1>None of these things let me ever caught us up</v>

2979
01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:42.580
<v Speaker 4>and I play Sasquatch advocate ears,</v>

2980
01:34:42.581 --> 01:34:42.970
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

2981
01:34:42.970 --> 01:34:43.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2982
01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:44.820
<v Speaker 4>so you've,</v>

2983
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:46.630
<v Speaker 4>you actually pointed out this,</v>

2984
01:34:46.631 --> 01:34:51.631
<v Speaker 4>these tigers that were on some other island that on an island that like evolved</v>

2985
01:34:51.911 --> 01:34:52.390
<v Speaker 4>in sense,</v>

2986
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:53.350
<v Speaker 4>it's lions actually.</v>

2987
01:34:53.410 --> 01:34:54.250
<v Speaker 4>Why Africa?</v>

2988
01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.570
<v Speaker 4>So relentless enemies.</v>

2989
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.410
<v Speaker 4>National Geographic special.</v>

2990
01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:57.681
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2991
01:34:57.681 --> 01:34:58.240
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2992
01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:03.240
<v Speaker 5>why I point that only because we've seen cases where evolution</v>

2993
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:05.990
<v Speaker 5>happens rapidly.</v>

2994
01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:07.550
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't happen over the course of,</v>

2995
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:08.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2996
01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:09.530
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>

2997
01:35:09.531 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it seems to happen in a really fast way and there would be an</v>

2998
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:18.850
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary advantage for a being like a Sasquatch to avoid humans.</v>

2999
01:35:19.341 --> 01:35:20.030
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3000
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:24.170
<v Speaker 5>there's an evolutionary advantage to any creature avoiding humans because we</v>

3001
01:35:24.171 --> 01:35:25.700
<v Speaker 5>like to eat things.</v>

3002
01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:26.750
<v Speaker 5>We love eating.</v>

3003
01:35:26.751 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 5>Things are turning them into our slaves.</v>

3004
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:33.020
<v Speaker 5>So there's an evolutionary advantage to staying the hell away from us.</v>

3005
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:34.040
<v Speaker 5>So in that way,</v>

3006
01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:35.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3007
01:35:35.010 --> 01:35:40.010
<v Speaker 5>if a primate somehow evolved in the same way we did and we've made super</v>

3008
01:35:40.311 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 5>computers and robots and space shuttles,</v>

3009
01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:44.120
<v Speaker 5>if for whatever reason,</v>

3010
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:45.290
<v Speaker 5>something similar to us,</v>

3011
01:35:45.291 --> 01:35:45.860
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't know it,</v>

3012
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.060
<v Speaker 5>a different direction,</v>

3013
01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.660
<v Speaker 5>which is the direction of being closer to nature tied into the earth.</v>

3014
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:55.930
<v Speaker 5>Part of that evolution would be avoiding the crazy ball monkeys.</v>

3015
01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:57.770
<v Speaker 5>They eat you,</v>

3016
01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 5>they enslave you,</v>

3017
01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:03.230
<v Speaker 5>they will have sex with you if they can stay away from them.</v>

3018
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:06.470
<v Speaker 5>So in that way it could make sense that a super advanced primary,</v>

3019
01:36:06.471 --> 01:36:10.100
<v Speaker 5>it will be able to smell a human scent on a device like that.</v>

3020
01:36:10.101 --> 01:36:10.910
<v Speaker 5>And they just stay,</v>

3021
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:11.810
<v Speaker 5>stay away from it.</v>

3022
01:36:11.811 --> 01:36:12.644
<v Speaker 5>They avoid it.</v>

3023
01:36:12.670 --> 01:36:13.010
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3024
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:18.010
<v Speaker 5>Why couldn't there be some new reclusive primate animals run away from me all</v>

3025
01:36:18.081 --> 01:36:18.914
<v Speaker 5>the time?</v>

3026
01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.070
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

3027
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.791
<v Speaker 2>It is possible.</v>

3028
01:36:20.791 --> 01:36:21.870
<v Speaker 2>And when you say it like that,</v>

3029
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:23.790
<v Speaker 2>you bring up a lot of not of awesome points.</v>

3030
01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:24.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3031
01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:29.100
<v Speaker 2>if you were going to be a primate that was super intelligent and figured out how</v>

3032
01:36:29.101 --> 01:36:29.881
<v Speaker 2>to live in the woods,</v>

3033
01:36:29.881 --> 01:36:30.840
<v Speaker 2>the smartest thing to do,</v>

3034
01:36:30.841 --> 01:36:33.900
<v Speaker 2>it'd be don't let people know about you ever stay away and mean.</v>

3035
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:36.090
<v Speaker 2>The real question is how smart are these things?</v>

3036
01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3037
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:37.940
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to the,</v>

3038
01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:38.251
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3039
01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:38.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3040
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3041
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:39.300
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

3042
01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:43.260
<v Speaker 2>let's give a broad spectrum of wackiness and she talked to the,</v>

3043
01:36:43.261 --> 01:36:44.400
<v Speaker 2>for the UFO hunters,</v>

3044
01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:46.740
<v Speaker 2>the wackiest of wacky thank their people.</v>

3045
01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:52.100
<v Speaker 2>They think that they are the spiritual beings that are very human,</v>

3046
01:36:52.711 --> 01:36:53.550
<v Speaker 2>like inform,</v>

3047
01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:57.660
<v Speaker 2>like they think they have a human face is just a very dark face and that they're</v>

3048
01:36:57.661 --> 01:37:01.650
<v Speaker 2>just covered in hair and they were a type of wild human that lives in the woods.</v>

3049
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3050
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.903
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

3051
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:04.230
<v Speaker 2>there's some really,</v>

3052
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:05.281
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

3053
01:37:05.281 --> 01:37:07.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of variation in what they believe that they're capable of.</v>

3054
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3055
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:13.310
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately they're talking about a giant bipedal ape that no one's taken a</v>

3056
01:37:14.011 --> 01:37:14.520
<v Speaker 2>picture of.</v>

3057
01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3058
01:37:15.090 --> 01:37:16.320
<v Speaker 2>It's gets a little sketchy.</v>

3059
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:16.691
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3060
01:37:16.691 --> 01:37:16.871
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3061
01:37:16.871 --> 01:37:17.201
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3062
01:37:17.201 --> 01:37:17.740
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3063
01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:19.150
<v Speaker 5>to play Sasquatch advocate,</v>

3064
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:21.460
<v Speaker 5>if you look at a monkey jump,</v>

3065
01:37:21.730 --> 01:37:23.740
<v Speaker 5>like whenever you see a monkey run up a tree,</v>

3066
01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:24.671
<v Speaker 5>just a monkey.</v>

3067
01:37:24.671 --> 01:37:27.700
<v Speaker 5>If you watch how graceful and powerful those things are,</v>

3068
01:37:27.701 --> 01:37:31.600
<v Speaker 5>and you consider you ever being able to do that in a million years,</v>

3069
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:36.100
<v Speaker 5>you see how much more advanced in certain ways just a chimpanzee is.</v>

3070
01:37:36.210 --> 01:37:36.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3071
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:40.930
<v Speaker 5>So imagine if something had an equivalent form of advancement when it came to</v>

3072
01:37:40.931 --> 01:37:44.500
<v Speaker 5>being able to camouflage themselves or to hide,</v>

3073
01:37:45.010 --> 01:37:45.341
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3074
01:37:45.341 --> 01:37:50.341
<v Speaker 5>maybe these things are just so good at hiding that maybe the part of evolution</v>

3075
01:37:50.741 --> 01:37:54.730
<v Speaker 5>that made chimpanzees able to climb a tree in five seconds,</v>

3076
01:37:54.850 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 5>and humans able to build</v>

3077
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.873
<v Speaker 4>a Chrysler,</v>

3078
01:37:56.970 --> 01:38:01.970
<v Speaker 4>maybe that part of evolution made these beings able to hide and as super skilled</v>

3079
01:38:03.001 --> 01:38:04.650
<v Speaker 4>way they can cover their tracks,</v>

3080
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.090
<v Speaker 4>they can hide in the shadows.</v>

3081
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:06.781
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

3082
01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:11.220
<v Speaker 4>It would be a great advancement for a being to be able to hide an a.</v>

3083
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:12.383
<v Speaker 4>And w</v>

3084
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.911
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3085
01:38:13.911 --> 01:38:14.340
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

3086
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:14.901
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

3087
01:38:14.901 --> 01:38:15.501
<v Speaker 2>You're absolutely right.</v>

3088
01:38:15.501 --> 01:38:17.750
<v Speaker 2>A great advancement for a being to be able to hide though.</v>

3089
01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:18.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll say it.</v>

3090
01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.380
<v Speaker 4>It would be a great advancement for a being to be able to hide that way.</v>

3091
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3092
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:26.520
<v Speaker 2>He pull up a video of bear runs up tree startles hunter.</v>

3093
01:38:26.521 --> 01:38:27.354
<v Speaker 2>You know that video.</v>

3094
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:29.100
<v Speaker 2>This is a pretty famous video.</v>

3095
01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:30.900
<v Speaker 2>These guys bow hunting and while their bow hunting,</v>

3096
01:38:30.901 --> 01:38:34.380
<v Speaker 2>this bear just decides to make a break for it and runs up the tree.</v>

3097
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Not that weird.</v>

3098
01:38:36.231 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 2>And you know bears climb trees.</v>

3099
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:38.790
<v Speaker 2>I think we both know,</v>

3100
01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.030
<v Speaker 2>but did you have any fucking idea how fast they can do it?</v>

3101
01:38:42.090 --> 01:38:47.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't have this fair gets 20 feet up that tree in a matter of seconds like</v>

3102
01:38:48.901 --> 01:38:53.220
<v Speaker 2>this and all of a sudden he's up there looking eye to eye with this hunter.</v>

3103
01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3104
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I just want you to see,</v>

3105
01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:56.700
<v Speaker 2>just to put it in perspective,</v>

3106
01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:56.950
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

3107
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:58.350
<v Speaker 2>let's look at it just to,</v>

3108
01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.000
<v Speaker 2>just to get a peek at it.</v>

3109
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:00.863
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

3110
01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:01.733
<v Speaker 2>So here's the guy.</v>

3111
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:03.390
<v Speaker 2>The bear comes close to him.</v>

3112
01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is the same one.</v>

3113
01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Did you check this one was sideways.</v>

3114
01:39:06.721 --> 01:39:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I was trying it</v>

3115
01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:08.500
<v Speaker 10>get something fast.</v>

3116
01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:09.963
<v Speaker 10>Let's see.</v>

3117
01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.030
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean it's sideways?</v>

3118
01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:12.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3119
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:13.183
<v Speaker 2>that one I pulled up.</v>

3120
01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.670
<v Speaker 2>The video was sideways.</v>

3121
01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:15.953
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

3122
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Pull up.</v>

3123
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Let me see what the other video looked like.</v>

3124
01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.113
<v Speaker 10>Let me say it.</v>

3125
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.671
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3126
01:39:22.671 --> 01:39:23.241
<v Speaker 2>it's sideways.</v>

3127
01:39:23.241 --> 01:39:23.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3128
01:39:23.361 --> 01:39:24.290
<v Speaker 2>that's the right video.</v>

3129
01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:26.660
<v Speaker 2>But does it stay sideways the whole time?</v>

3130
01:39:26.690 --> 01:39:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even bother to look.</v>

3131
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.281
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

3132
01:39:28.281 --> 01:39:29.061
<v Speaker 2>go a little further up.</v>

3133
01:39:29.061 --> 01:39:30.590
<v Speaker 2>You might figure out what the fuck he's doing wrong.</v>

3134
01:39:30.591 --> 01:39:30.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3135
01:39:30.741 --> 01:39:31.574
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

3136
01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Now get a little bit further up and here's the bear.</v>

3137
01:39:35.241 --> 01:39:35.811
<v Speaker 2>Now watch this.</v>

3138
01:39:35.811 --> 01:39:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

3139
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.771
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

3140
01:39:36.771 --> 01:39:37.604
<v Speaker 2>Bear move.</v>

3141
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.301
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3142
01:39:38.301 --> 01:39:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Give us some volume.</v>

3143
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:39.621
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3144
01:39:39.621 --> 01:39:40.520
<v Speaker 2>The bears are already up.</v>

3145
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Give us a volume and take it to right when the bear makes a run for it.</v>

3146
01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.970
<v Speaker 2>So the dude is up in this tree,</v>

3147
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Stan,</v>

3148
01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.190
<v Speaker 2>he puts this food out and the way you f you hunt for bears and a lot of places,</v>

3149
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:54.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not legal in California this way,</v>

3150
01:39:54.201 --> 01:39:57.410
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of places they let you use bait and buy bait.</v>

3151
01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:58.880
<v Speaker 2>The usually mean donuts.</v>

3152
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.923
<v Speaker 2>They take a,</v>

3153
01:39:59.930 --> 01:40:00.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3154
01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:01.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3155
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:01.160
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3156
01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:05.630
<v Speaker 2>they take donuts or something sweet and they put them in a barrel so that this</v>

3157
01:40:05.631 --> 01:40:05.990
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>

3158
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:08.540
<v Speaker 2>we'll go to that barrel and then while he's looking for his food,</v>

3159
01:40:08.541 --> 01:40:09.374
<v Speaker 2>that's when he killed him.</v>

3160
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:10.470
<v Speaker 2>It's really trying to do shit.</v>

3161
01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:11.840
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't look fun at all.</v>

3162
01:40:12.170 --> 01:40:13.130
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of Douchey.</v>

3163
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:15.680
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm watching this bear run,</v>

3164
01:40:15.710 --> 01:40:16.543
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

3165
01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:17.473
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>

3166
01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:17.751
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3167
01:40:17.751 --> 01:40:20.960
<v Speaker 2>he makes a bolt for it and then just put it on rump.</v>

3168
01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.610
<v Speaker 9>Ah,</v>

3169
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:25.303
<v Speaker 10>watch this.</v>

3170
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:28.070
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3171
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:30.830
<v Speaker 2>The guy obviously fucked with his camera here.</v>

3172
01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:31.580
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

3173
01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:32.413
<v Speaker 2>this is wrong.</v>

3174
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:34.160
<v Speaker 2>You can show it.</v>

3175
01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.360
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with this video?</v>

3176
01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Is this a bad video?</v>

3177
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Why would not say in this?</v>

3178
01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3179
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:42.713
<v Speaker 2>Figure it out.</v>

3180
01:40:42.850 --> 01:40:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Figure it out.</v>

3181
01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Something wrong with the video.</v>

3182
01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.201
<v Speaker 2>That here's,</v>

3183
01:40:45.201 --> 01:40:45.601
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

3184
01:40:45.601 --> 01:40:48.980
<v Speaker 2>the point is that this bear runs up this tree.</v>

3185
01:40:48.981 --> 01:40:51.200
<v Speaker 2>The way you could run straight,</v>

3186
01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 2>like he literally runs up the tree.</v>

3187
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3188
01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:55.930
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty fucking insane,</v>

3189
01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.793
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3190
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:58.000
<v Speaker 2>This is not the same video.</v>

3191
01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:58.893
<v Speaker 2>You can stop now,</v>

3192
01:40:58.930 --> 01:40:59.351
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

3193
01:40:59.351 --> 01:41:00.184
<v Speaker 5>here's the,</v>

3194
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:01.570
<v Speaker 5>here's the essence of the thing.</v>

3195
01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:05.320
<v Speaker 5>When you look at a chimpanzee and you look at a human,</v>

3196
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:06.490
<v Speaker 5>what are some of the similarities?</v>

3197
01:41:06.491 --> 01:41:06.611
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3198
01:41:06.611 --> 01:41:09.970
<v Speaker 5>the similarities are both have figured out how to use tools in a rudimentary</v>

3199
01:41:09.971 --> 01:41:10.181
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

3200
01:41:10.181 --> 01:41:13.720
<v Speaker 5>Chimpanzees use stakes to get termites out of the ground.</v>

3201
01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:16.690
<v Speaker 5>Humans use cars to get to their jobs.</v>

3202
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.673
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3203
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:18.663
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3204
01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:19.990
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>

3205
01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:20.824
<v Speaker 5>why is it,</v>

3206
01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:21.873
<v Speaker 5>why isn't it,</v>

3207
01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:22.803
<v Speaker 5>why isn't,</v>

3208
01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.890
<v Speaker 5>why isn't there the possibility than another primate,</v>

3209
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:30.760
<v Speaker 5>instead of evolving the ability to use tools or instead of just evolving that</v>

3210
01:41:30.761 --> 01:41:32.530
<v Speaker 5>ability they used,</v>

3211
01:41:32.650 --> 01:41:35.470
<v Speaker 5>they evolved the ability to camouflage themselves.</v>

3212
01:41:35.471 --> 01:41:36.700
<v Speaker 5>Because in nature,</v>

3213
01:41:36.701 --> 01:41:37.534
<v Speaker 5>if you're a hunter,</v>

3214
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:40.210
<v Speaker 5>what's a better skill than to be able to hide?</v>

3215
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:43.300
<v Speaker 5>There's almost no better skill in nature.</v>

3216
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:48.040
<v Speaker 5>Chameleons are almost every creature that is a predator.</v>

3217
01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.480
<v Speaker 5>There's skin has adapted to their surroundings in a way that makes them blend in</v>

3218
01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 5>so that they could be a more powerful and efficient Predator in that way.</v>

3219
01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:02.220
<v Speaker 5>Why wouldn't a primate now just evolve a skin color or hair color that makes</v>

3220
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:04.270
<v Speaker 5>them blend in with their environment,</v>

3221
01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:08.620
<v Speaker 5>but the ability to hide and a true super advanced way.</v>

3222
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:09.111
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3223
01:42:09.111 --> 01:42:09.230
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3224
01:42:09.230 --> 01:42:11.510
<v Speaker 2>So I'm gonna play devil's advocate please.</v>

3225
01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:12.890
<v Speaker 2>And this is not necessarily what I believe,</v>

3226
01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.970
<v Speaker 2>but if there was really an animal like this,</v>

3227
01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.080
<v Speaker 2>there would be something.</v>

3228
01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Now all you have is like the theater Roosevelt wrote about it in a story.</v>

3229
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3230
01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:23.620
<v Speaker 2>You know about his time,</v>

3231
01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:24.590
<v Speaker 2>his time in the woods,</v>

3232
01:42:24.591 --> 01:42:27.350
<v Speaker 2>but when a dude gets killed by a wild man,</v>

3233
01:42:27.351 --> 01:42:27.610
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

3234
01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3235
01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:29.210
<v Speaker 2>who knows what really happened,</v>

3236
01:42:29.211 --> 01:42:29.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3237
01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:33.170
<v Speaker 2>And then 19 whatever the fuck it was back when teddy was running around.</v>

3238
01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:38.780
<v Speaker 2>The reality of life today is that if you're dealing with a very populated area,</v>

3239
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:40.700
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a fucking camera on their phone.</v>

3240
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3241
01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:44.870
<v Speaker 2>If everyone has a camera on their phone and no one is getting a photo of this</v>

3242
01:42:44.871 --> 01:42:45.350
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

3243
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:48.560
<v Speaker 2>how many human beings are traveling through the areas where these things live</v>

3244
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.870
<v Speaker 2>and not one person gets a picture.</v>

3245
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:52.100
<v Speaker 2>And now here's the other problem.</v>

3246
01:42:53.630 --> 01:42:54.680
<v Speaker 2>It's iconic.</v>

3247
01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:56.540
<v Speaker 2>It's an archetype.</v>

3248
01:42:56.570 --> 01:43:01.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing that people go to right away is I think it's very similar to the</v>

3249
01:43:01.101 --> 01:43:02.720
<v Speaker 2>gray alien with the big eyes.</v>

3250
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3251
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:06.110
<v Speaker 2>I think if you are not sure what you're seeing,</v>

3252
01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:08.990
<v Speaker 2>your mind will create this thing.</v>

3253
01:43:08.991 --> 01:43:13.991
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons that I say this is because I read a lot about hunting</v>

3254
01:43:14.031 --> 01:43:18.800
<v Speaker 2>accidents and one of the things that has happened in hunting accidents is that</v>

3255
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:23.750
<v Speaker 2>people who are experienced hunters who know that in order to bag a deer,</v>

3256
01:43:23.751 --> 01:43:27.470
<v Speaker 2>you have to capitalize on a very split moment,</v>

3257
01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:32.330
<v Speaker 2>a very small window in time where you got to capitalize on that in order to get</v>

3258
01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:33.164
<v Speaker 2>the kill right.</v>

3259
01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:33.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3260
01:43:33.561 --> 01:43:37.790
<v Speaker 2>people have shot people accidentally and sworn up and down.</v>

3261
01:43:37.791 --> 01:43:38.720
<v Speaker 2>They saw a deer,</v>

3262
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:42.290
<v Speaker 2>they swore up and down that they saw a dean.</v>

3263
01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3264
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.790
<v Speaker 2>And when you're talking about big foot and you're talking about bigfoot</v>

3265
01:43:45.791 --> 01:43:46.790
<v Speaker 2>sightings you're talking about,</v>

3266
01:43:46.791 --> 01:43:47.241
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3267
01:43:47.241 --> 01:43:47.961
<v Speaker 2>it's not a mystery.</v>

3268
01:43:47.961 --> 01:43:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're talking about,</v>

3269
01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:49.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3270
01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.920
<v Speaker 2>finding Rumpelstiltskin or something else.</v>

3271
01:43:51.921 --> 01:43:54.440
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something that people have repeated the same stories over</v>

3272
01:43:54.441 --> 01:43:55.290
<v Speaker 2>and over and over again.</v>

3273
01:43:56.450 --> 01:44:00.500
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something that we have a reference to in our heads,</v>

3274
01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:02.030
<v Speaker 2>and when you see something,</v>

3275
01:44:02.031 --> 01:44:05.810
<v Speaker 2>you might see just a whisper of something you don't know what the fuck you saw.</v>

3276
01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:08.390
<v Speaker 2>You saw something through the trees and it's dark out there.</v>

3277
01:44:08.391 --> 01:44:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3278
01:44:08.710 --> 01:44:11.620
<v Speaker 2>busy canopy of leaves and it's never sunny out,</v>

3279
01:44:11.621 --> 01:44:11.870
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3280
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It's always rainy and cloudy.</v>

3281
01:44:13.401 --> 01:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>So what are you really seeing?</v>

3282
01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3283
01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.240
<v Speaker 2>But by the time a week goes by,</v>

3284
01:44:17.241 --> 01:44:18.260
<v Speaker 2>or a month goes by,</v>

3285
01:44:18.261 --> 01:44:19.430
<v Speaker 2>or maybe even an hour,</v>

3286
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe it takes you three hours to walk to your car and you're an idiot.</v>

3287
01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:25.610
<v Speaker 2>And you convince yourself in those three hours that you saw his face and it</v>

3288
01:44:25.611 --> 01:44:27.110
<v Speaker 2>looked at you and it read your mind.</v>

3289
01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:30.910
<v Speaker 2>You might be so pumped up with adrenaline and fear and,</v>

3290
01:44:30.911 --> 01:44:31.280
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3291
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.180
<v Speaker 2>and who knows?</v>

3292
01:44:32.181 --> 01:44:37.181
<v Speaker 2>Just longing for a life with excitement where you're not wandering through the</v>

3293
01:44:37.791 --> 01:44:39.770
<v Speaker 2>woods looking for fucking shadows.</v>

3294
01:44:39.850 --> 01:44:40.240
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>

3295
01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.830
<v Speaker 5>half the people in the forest or high at any time,</v>

3296
01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:44.413
<v Speaker 5>please stop.</v>

3297
01:44:44.530 --> 01:44:45.560
<v Speaker 5>Nobody goes into the,</v>

3298
01:44:46.090 --> 01:44:48.190
<v Speaker 2>we can only base that grateful dead can.</v>

3299
01:44:48.191 --> 01:44:52.290
<v Speaker 2>We can only base that on our own personal experience and with you and I was 100%</v>

3300
01:44:52.291 --> 01:44:54.030
<v Speaker 2>so it's 100% of the people in the woods or high.</v>

3301
01:44:54.150 --> 01:44:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3302
01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's all we have.</v>

3303
01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.410
<v Speaker 2>We should have got those big foot Chi Psi.</v>

3304
01:44:58.050 --> 01:44:59.070
<v Speaker 2>That's where we fucked up.</v>

3305
01:44:59.490 --> 01:45:00.540
<v Speaker 2>They were just drunk.</v>

3306
01:45:00.930 --> 01:45:01.770
<v Speaker 2>We should've got him high.</v>

3307
01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3308
01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:03.003
<v Speaker 2>Big different results.</v>

3309
01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:03.510
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3310
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:04.050
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3311
01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:05.100
<v Speaker 5>I really mean it though.</v>

3312
01:45:05.101 --> 01:45:08.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying that people go into the woods and they get hi.</v>

3313
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:09.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3314
01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:09.900
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

3315
01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:11.310
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to take mushrooms,</v>

3316
01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.140
<v Speaker 5>what did people always say?</v>

3317
01:45:13.170 --> 01:45:15.500
<v Speaker 5>Go take them and then nature takes them in the forest.</v>

3318
01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:15.930
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3319
01:45:15.930 --> 01:45:20.930
<v Speaker 5>and that way I would say that a lot of the observers who are experiencing these</v>

3320
01:45:21.331 --> 01:45:21.581
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

3321
01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:25.220
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the people in the woods or maybe under the influence of Ntl of</v>

3322
01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.093
<v Speaker 5>intoxicants,</v>

3323
01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.330
<v Speaker 5>but you don't need to be right.</v>

3324
01:45:27.331 --> 01:45:28.860
<v Speaker 5>If I'm a kid out in the woods,</v>

3325
01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:29.431
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3326
01:45:29.431 --> 01:45:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I can hear anything,</v>

3327
01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3328
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:33.380
<v Speaker 5>She thinks you can see things.</v>

3329
01:45:33.450 --> 01:45:34.500
<v Speaker 5>Dragons,</v>

3330
01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.520
<v Speaker 5>big elves.</v>

3331
01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:37.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3332
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:38.760
<v Speaker 5>Cause think of the woods.</v>

3333
01:45:38.761 --> 01:45:39.720
<v Speaker 5>There's no light.</v>

3334
01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.670
<v Speaker 5>Trees are shifting around.</v>

3335
01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:44.850
<v Speaker 5>It would be very easy to project anything.</v>

3336
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:47.530
<v Speaker 2>And you know that there's a real danger.</v>

3337
01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:48.993
<v Speaker 2>What was that noise?</v>

3338
01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:50.613
<v Speaker 11>Hello?</v>

3339
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:52.470
<v Speaker 11>Hello.</v>

3340
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:54.000
<v Speaker 2>There was a real danger.</v>

3341
01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.020
<v Speaker 2>There's a real danger.</v>

3342
01:45:55.021 --> 01:45:56.130
<v Speaker 2>There's mountain lions,</v>

3343
01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.000
<v Speaker 2>there's bears,</v>

3344
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.930
<v Speaker 2>there's wolves.</v>

3345
01:45:58.170 --> 01:46:02.220
<v Speaker 2>The woods contain real things that will kill you and forget about poisonous</v>

3346
01:46:02.221 --> 01:46:03.360
<v Speaker 2>spiders and stinks.</v>

3347
01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.130
<v Speaker 2>There's mountain lions,</v>

3348
01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:07.320
<v Speaker 2>bears and wolves and the woods.</v>

3349
01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.760
<v Speaker 2>So there's a real fear.</v>

3350
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:10.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's a really highly charged environment.</v>

3351
01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:12.840
<v Speaker 5>So what you mentioned earlier,</v>

3352
01:46:12.841 --> 01:46:17.841
<v Speaker 5>how people prefer to have rooms on the top floor of a building or a house.</v>

3353
01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:24.140
<v Speaker 5>Examples like that show how embedded into our species is the trauma of having to</v>

3354
01:46:25.861 --> 01:46:28.620
<v Speaker 5>deal with predators in the wild.</v>

3355
01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:30.540
<v Speaker 5>The wildness that we evolved in.</v>

3356
01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.720
<v Speaker 5>So it makes sense that somehow inside of our neurology is imprinted the remnants</v>

3357
01:46:37.861 --> 01:46:40.620
<v Speaker 5>of the these predatorial forces,</v>

3358
01:46:40.621 --> 01:46:45.621
<v Speaker 5>the kind of combined racial memory of all the things that used to hunt us in</v>

3359
01:46:46.130 --> 01:46:47.250
<v Speaker 5>Itas and when we,</v>

3360
01:46:47.251 --> 01:46:47.520
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

3361
01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:48.360
<v Speaker 5>when we go in the woods,</v>

3362
01:46:48.361 --> 01:46:49.194
<v Speaker 5>even today,</v>

3363
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:54.470
<v Speaker 5>maybe our brains still are on alert or on guard for these things that used to</v>

3364
01:46:54.691 --> 01:46:59.220
<v Speaker 5>terrorize our ancestors and people who see big foot or really just seeing a</v>

3365
01:46:59.221 --> 01:47:01.710
<v Speaker 5>projection of this thing out into nature.</v>

3366
01:47:02.150 --> 01:47:07.150
<v Speaker 2>It could be that it also could be a reaction to being in the wilderness itself,</v>

3367
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:11.870
<v Speaker 2>which is mostly being experienced by people who aren't native to the wilderness</v>

3368
01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.280
<v Speaker 2>when they're having these experiences.</v>

3369
01:47:13.281 --> 01:47:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Even if they like,</v>

3370
01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.650
<v Speaker 2>like normal campers,</v>

3371
01:47:15.651 --> 01:47:16.820
<v Speaker 2>the camp on every weekend,</v>

3372
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:18.990
<v Speaker 2>they don't live there every day they,</v>

3373
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:22.730
<v Speaker 2>they live there in short bursts and then they run back to civilization.</v>

3374
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.940
<v Speaker 2>So in living in that environment,</v>

3375
01:47:25.941 --> 01:47:29.500
<v Speaker 2>there must be some thinking where you're,</v>

3376
01:47:29.501 --> 01:47:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you wonder what it would be like to survive out here.</v>

3377
01:47:32.511 --> 01:47:32.751
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

3378
01:47:32.751 --> 01:47:34.940
<v Speaker 2>would it be like to survive out here without nature,</v>

3379
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:36.740
<v Speaker 2>could an intelligent being do it?</v>

3380
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's out there.</v>

3381
01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe my would brother is out there right now.</v>

3382
01:47:41.271 --> 01:47:41.780
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

3383
01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:46.250
<v Speaker 2>my ape monkey would brother who's just as smart as me,</v>

3384
01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:51.340
<v Speaker 2>but chooses to not engage and remain on the outskirts of society,</v>

3385
01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:55.220
<v Speaker 2>eating off the land with its intelligent mind.</v>

3386
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Hiding from people.</v>

3387
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:59.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3388
01:47:59.270 --> 01:48:00.200
<v Speaker 2>it's possible,</v>

3389
01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that likely.</v>

3390
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:07.663
<v Speaker 2>It's not likely.</v>

3391
01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:08.600
<v Speaker 2>That's what sucks.</v>

3392
01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:10.040
<v Speaker 2>But why is it so sexy?</v>

3393
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Why is it such a sexy idea?</v>

3394
01:48:11.481 --> 01:48:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Why is the idea of seeing big foot one of the most exciting things?</v>

3395
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:15.770
<v Speaker 2>If you said to me,</v>

3396
01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

3397
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:21.910
<v Speaker 2>would you rather be able to fly without a plane anywhere you want it in the</v>

3398
01:48:22.491 --> 01:48:27.491
<v Speaker 2>world for 30 whole days or go hiking and actually meet big foot?</v>

3399
01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3400
01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I would say I'll take big foot.</v>

3401
01:48:32.690 --> 01:48:35.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll take big foot over 30 days of awesomeness.</v>

3402
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:36.590
<v Speaker 2>What does every great dream?</v>

3403
01:48:36.591 --> 01:48:37.370
<v Speaker 2>You're flying,</v>

3404
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:39.560
<v Speaker 2>you're flying and every great dream and then you land on a girl wants to have</v>

3405
01:48:39.561 --> 01:48:40.340
<v Speaker 2>sex with you.</v>

3406
01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what every great dream is,</v>

3407
01:48:41.690 --> 01:48:42.500
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

3408
01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:43.100
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

3409
01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you that if you gave me 30 days of that,</v>

3410
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:47.630
<v Speaker 2>I would say no.</v>

3411
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I would rather meet big for it because I've got some questions I want to know if</v>

3412
01:48:52.071 --> 01:48:52.904
<v Speaker 2>it's real</v>

3413
01:48:53.110 --> 01:48:53.291
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

3414
01:48:53.291 --> 01:48:54.190
<v Speaker 5>You know it's real.</v>

3415
01:48:54.191 --> 01:48:55.000
<v Speaker 5>If you meet it,</v>

3416
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:55.850
<v Speaker 5>then what do you have to,</v>

3417
01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.920
<v Speaker 5>that's why I'm willing to,</v>

3418
01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:58.240
<v Speaker 5>big foot's going to say to you,</v>

3419
01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:58.550
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3420
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:59.051
<v Speaker 5>it's going to say,</v>

3421
01:48:59.051 --> 01:49:00.250
<v Speaker 5>why didn't you fly?</v>

3422
01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:01.781
<v Speaker 5>Look at me.</v>

3423
01:49:01.781 --> 01:49:03.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm covered in fleas.</v>

3424
01:49:03.341 --> 01:49:04.660
<v Speaker 5>I live out here and shit.</v>

3425
01:49:04.661 --> 01:49:05.320
<v Speaker 5>Land.</v>

3426
01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:10.000
<v Speaker 5>You could have flown around for 30 days in assignment and talk to some hairy</v>

3427
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:14.210
<v Speaker 5>failed monkey hiding from its Tinier,</v>

3428
01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:15.011
<v Speaker 5>smaller,</v>

3429
01:49:15.011 --> 01:49:16.180
<v Speaker 5>far smarter.</v>

3430
01:49:16.181 --> 01:49:17.014
<v Speaker 5>Brethren,</v>

3431
01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:22.450
<v Speaker 5>pick flying pig flying</v>

3432
01:49:23.210 --> 01:49:23.570
<v Speaker 2>mad.</v>

3433
01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:23.751
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3434
01:49:23.751 --> 01:49:23.940
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3435
01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:24.860
<v Speaker 2>don't even have a phone.</v>

3436
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3437
01:49:25.670 --> 01:49:26.960
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking stores out here.</v>

3438
01:49:26.961 --> 01:49:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I killed elk with my face.</v>

3439
01:49:28.890 --> 01:49:32.310
<v Speaker 5>I've been drinking my own piss for the last thousand years.</v>

3440
01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:37.050
<v Speaker 5>They never have to worry about running out of water,</v>

3441
01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:39.300
<v Speaker 5>but they've never found a water collection device.</v>

3442
01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:41.580
<v Speaker 5>So that would mean that they would have to live near streams.</v>

3443
01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:42.151
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3444
01:49:42.151 --> 01:49:42.391
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3445
01:49:42.391 --> 01:49:42.631
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3446
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot.</v>

3447
01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:43.500
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

3448
01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:46.700
<v Speaker 5>there's clearly a lot of problems with it here.</v>

3449
01:49:47.130 --> 01:49:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3450
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 5>they're really big</v>

3451
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.520
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

3452
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.240
<v Speaker 2>but then here's,</v>

3453
01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

3454
01:49:49.630 --> 01:49:50.980
<v Speaker 2>here's some on the pro side.</v>

3455
01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Here's one of the things that they always say.</v>

3456
01:49:53.010 --> 01:49:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Why are we found a big foot body?</v>

3457
01:49:54.850 --> 01:49:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3458
01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:55.451
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3459
01:49:55.451 --> 01:49:57.310
<v Speaker 2>here's one thing that you need to think.</v>

3460
01:49:57.311 --> 01:49:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Consider,</v>

3461
01:49:57.970 --> 01:49:59.620
<v Speaker 2>when was the last time you saw a dead mountain lion?</v>

3462
01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3463
01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of God damn mountain lions.</v>

3464
01:50:02.321 --> 01:50:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean like a thousand of them in probably southern California alone.</v>

3465
01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:07.361
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

3466
01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:08.260
<v Speaker 2>they're all over the place.</v>

3467
01:50:08.261 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them.</v>

3468
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:10.060
<v Speaker 2>They're not like a big foot.</v>

3469
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:11.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a mythical creature.</v>

3470
01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:13.750
<v Speaker 2>It's something that we absolutely have evidence of it,</v>

3471
01:50:13.770 --> 01:50:14.950
<v Speaker 2>but we never see a dead one.</v>

3472
01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:16.300
<v Speaker 2>But they must die.</v>

3473
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:17.060
<v Speaker 2>They must.</v>

3474
01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:20.810
<v Speaker 5>If you believe the idea that a big foot is something that has evolved,</v>

3475
01:50:21.050 --> 01:50:25.190
<v Speaker 5>it's ability to hide in a way that's exponentially greater than any other</v>

3476
01:50:25.191 --> 01:50:25.581
<v Speaker 5>animal.</v>

3477
01:50:25.581 --> 01:50:30.581
<v Speaker 5>Then you can also add to that the idea that they would know to bury their dead.</v>

3478
01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:32.960
<v Speaker 5>We bury our dead.</v>

3479
01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.090
<v Speaker 5>When was the last time you saw a dead human?</v>

3480
01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:35.931
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3481
01:50:35.931 --> 01:50:37.940
<v Speaker 5>unless you're living in Syria right now,</v>

3482
01:50:37.941 --> 01:50:38.481
<v Speaker 5>you've probably,</v>

3483
01:50:38.481 --> 01:50:38.901
<v Speaker 5>it's probably,</v>

3484
01:50:38.901 --> 01:50:40.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean you don't see them that often.</v>

3485
01:50:40.461 --> 01:50:41.271
<v Speaker 5>It's a rarity.</v>

3486
01:50:41.271 --> 01:50:42.410
<v Speaker 5>We bury our dead.</v>

3487
01:50:42.411 --> 01:50:44.810
<v Speaker 5>It's not like dead bodies are always dead.</v>

3488
01:50:44.811 --> 01:50:48.500
<v Speaker 5>Humans are laying around and just saying maybe these apes or whatever they are,</v>

3489
01:50:48.501 --> 01:50:49.490
<v Speaker 5>they bury their dead,</v>

3490
01:50:49.491 --> 01:50:51.830
<v Speaker 5>which is why we don't see their corpses anywhere.</v>

3491
01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3492
01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:56.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good point and it's a very good possibility if they really were</v>

3493
01:50:56.461 --> 01:50:57.360
<v Speaker 2>this intelligent thing.</v>

3494
01:50:57.361 --> 01:50:58.194
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

3495
01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:59.970
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys that we talked to,</v>

3496
01:51:00.090 --> 01:51:01.290
<v Speaker 2>this guy talk to,</v>

3497
01:51:01.291 --> 01:51:03.170
<v Speaker 2>to talk to who the fucking money,</v>

3498
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:04.410
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

3499
01:51:04.410 --> 01:51:05.280
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys we talked,</v>

3500
01:51:05.281 --> 01:51:07.470
<v Speaker 2>it was a guy named William Jev Nick,</v>

3501
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:12.590
<v Speaker 2>and he is a guy who had his own experience with Sasquatch when he was 14 years</v>

3502
01:51:13.441 --> 01:51:16.350
<v Speaker 2>old and the guy did not seem like a cook.</v>

3503
01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:17.430
<v Speaker 2>He was not,</v>

3504
01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:19.740
<v Speaker 2>he did not register at all.</v>

3505
01:51:19.741 --> 01:51:20.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll say that again,</v>

3506
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:21.240
<v Speaker 2>did not seem like a Kook.</v>

3507
01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:22.680
<v Speaker 2>He did not register it all.</v>

3508
01:51:22.681 --> 01:51:25.560
<v Speaker 2>My crazy scale seemed like a very reasonable guy.</v>

3509
01:51:25.590 --> 01:51:30.060
<v Speaker 2>He's an author and he was telling his experience and he was saying that when he</v>

3510
01:51:30.061 --> 01:51:31.230
<v Speaker 2>was 14 years old,</v>

3511
01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:31.760
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3512
01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.930
<v Speaker 2>he saw a fucking Sasquatch.</v>

3513
01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I believe he believes it.</v>

3514
01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:38.973
<v Speaker 2>He believes it.</v>

3515
01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:39.851
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3516
01:51:39.851 --> 01:51:42.400
<v Speaker 5>I think there are people who believe they seen this thing.</v>

3517
01:51:43.150 --> 01:51:43.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3518
01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:47.530
<v Speaker 5>it's for sure there's no question but that there are people who believe that</v>

3519
01:51:47.531 --> 01:51:48.430
<v Speaker 5>they seen a thing,</v>

3520
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:52.270
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't mean that they've actually seen the thing.</v>

3521
01:51:52.630 --> 01:51:57.630
<v Speaker 5>There's people in Alabama who think there's a Leprechaun and the inner cities,</v>

3522
01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:00.100
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean it's there.</v>

3523
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:03.860
<v Speaker 2>This dude thinks he knows where borough ground this.</v>

3524
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:04.191
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3525
01:52:04.191 --> 01:52:05.090
<v Speaker 2>that's why that's different.</v>

3526
01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:07.550
<v Speaker 2>This is where it gets weird and this is what,</v>

3527
01:52:07.551 --> 01:52:08.600
<v Speaker 2>this is where I had to go.</v>

3528
01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:09.643
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3529
01:52:09.710 --> 01:52:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Because he was making sense to me.</v>

3530
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

3531
01:52:14.130 --> 01:52:14.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3532
01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:15.530
<v Speaker 2>a reasonable man.</v>

3533
01:52:15.531 --> 01:52:17.120
<v Speaker 2>He obviously was educated.</v>

3534
01:52:17.210 --> 01:52:18.590
<v Speaker 2>He spoke very well.</v>

3535
01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:19.391
<v Speaker 2>We were having a,</v>

3536
01:52:19.391 --> 01:52:21.230
<v Speaker 2>a nice smooth conversation.</v>

3537
01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:24.110
<v Speaker 2>And then he tells me that he knows we're burial around is okay.</v>

3538
01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:29.450
<v Speaker 2>He tells me he knows where a burial ground is and he says he's known it for 20</v>

3539
01:52:29.451 --> 01:52:30.284
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3540
01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.810
<v Speaker 2>So I stop and I'm going,</v>

3541
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:33.081
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3542
01:52:33.081 --> 01:52:34.010
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

3543
01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

3544
01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:35.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3545
01:52:35.091 --> 01:52:36.140
<v Speaker 2>where a burial ground is,</v>

3546
01:52:36.141 --> 01:52:36.830
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3547
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:37.011
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3548
01:52:37.011 --> 01:52:37.844
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>

3549
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you go and dig it up?</v>

3550
01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.580
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3551
01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3552
01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:41.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3553
01:52:41.661 --> 01:52:42.650
<v Speaker 2>the Sasquatch,</v>

3554
01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:44.540
<v Speaker 2>they're not gonna like it if you do that.</v>

3555
01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Let me you something.</v>

3556
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.380
<v Speaker 2>And this is the same thing that Tom Powell said.</v>

3557
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:49.131
<v Speaker 2>Tom Powell,</v>

3558
01:52:49.131 --> 01:52:49.964
<v Speaker 2>who was a,</v>

3559
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:50.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3560
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:55.510
<v Speaker 2>a teacher in Oregon also told us that he's had Sasquatch experiences,</v>

3561
01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:59.420
<v Speaker 2>also told us that he wasn't a believer until something happened.</v>

3562
01:52:59.421 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 2>And then he saw it and then all of a sudden became a believer but also told us</v>

3563
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:04.100
<v Speaker 2>he knows where Barrow Grind is.</v>

3564
01:53:04.670 --> 01:53:05.503
<v Speaker 2>When I said,</v>

3565
01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:06.830
<v Speaker 2>tell me where it is,</v>

3566
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:07.371
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3567
01:53:07.371 --> 01:53:08.181
<v Speaker 2>you tell me where it is,</v>

3568
01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring in a bunch of mercenaries and we'll dig the shit up.</v>

3569
01:53:11.050 --> 01:53:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3570
01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:12.290
<v Speaker 2>let's find out what's up.</v>

3571
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:13.041
<v Speaker 2>You tell me,</v>

3572
01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:13.874
<v Speaker 2>you know where it is.</v>

3573
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:15.380
<v Speaker 2>If it's really a dangerous area,</v>

3574
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring in a bunch of dudes with guns.</v>

3575
01:53:16.701 --> 01:53:17.930
<v Speaker 2>It won't be dangerous anymore.</v>

3576
01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:20.810
<v Speaker 2>We'll bring in people with shovels and we'll dig it up.</v>

3577
01:53:21.170 --> 01:53:22.003
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

3578
01:53:22.130 --> 01:53:22.881
<v Speaker 2>If it's still there,</v>

3579
01:53:22.881 --> 01:53:23.480
<v Speaker 2>we'll dig it up.</v>

3580
01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.313
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3581
01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.273
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3582
01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:29.720
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they haven't done that is where I start going,</v>

3583
01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:32.870
<v Speaker 2>when are we really dealing with here?</v>

3584
01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3585
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:37.250
<v Speaker 2>When you're dedicating your life to this thing that you have zero evidence of,</v>

3586
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:37.701
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

3587
01:53:37.701 --> 01:53:38.870
<v Speaker 2>what are we really doing here?</v>

3588
01:53:38.930 --> 01:53:41.870
<v Speaker 2>And when you're telling me that you saw this thing when you were 14 years old,</v>

3589
01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>

3590
01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I believe that you believe you.</v>

3591
01:53:45.741 --> 01:53:47.780
<v Speaker 2>It's w that's what I mean when I say I believe you.</v>

3592
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3593
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:49.430
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know.</v>

3594
01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I when people tell me stories about shit that I just did five years ago,</v>

3595
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.741
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3596
01:53:54.741 --> 01:53:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3597
01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:56.673
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

3598
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about him.</v>

3599
01:53:58.821 --> 01:53:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even,</v>

3600
01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I forgot he was even there.</v>

3601
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:04.760
<v Speaker 2>And then you start re re imaging,</v>

3602
01:54:04.810 --> 01:54:05.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3603
01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:06.410
<v Speaker 2>The past in your mind.</v>

3604
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And I think that when you're dealing with something as insane as seen big foot,</v>

3605
01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:13.070
<v Speaker 2>especially big foot when you're 14 years old,</v>

3606
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:18.500
<v Speaker 2>it gets real sketchy so that when you're repeating the story x amount of years</v>

3607
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

3608
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:20.090
<v Speaker 2>you're basically lying.</v>

3609
01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3610
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm basically lying when I talk about my childhood.</v>

3611
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:23.991
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3612
01:54:23.991 --> 01:54:26.720
<v Speaker 2>I know some very vague facts about my childhood.</v>

3613
01:54:26.721 --> 01:54:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3614
01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.250
<v Speaker 2>But when I tell you,</v>

3615
01:54:28.530 --> 01:54:30.950
<v Speaker 2>I can remember this like it was yesterday,</v>

3616
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:35.360
<v Speaker 2>me and Grandpa was fishing and Grandpa was the only one that paid attention to</v>

3617
01:54:35.361 --> 01:54:36.860
<v Speaker 2>me and he cared.</v>

3618
01:54:36.861 --> 01:54:37.820
<v Speaker 2>And why I caught that fish.</v>

3619
01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:38.654
<v Speaker 2>He was so happy.</v>

3620
01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking remember what Grandpa was it.</v>

3621
01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.571
<v Speaker 2>He might've been drunk.</v>

3622
01:54:41.571 --> 01:54:42.440
<v Speaker 2>He might've passed out.</v>

3623
01:54:42.441 --> 01:54:43.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to made it all up.</v>

3624
01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I might have,</v>

3625
01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:45.490
<v Speaker 2>might have danced it all in my head.</v>

3626
01:54:45.491 --> 01:54:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3627
01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:47.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what I did five days ago.</v>

3628
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:49.430
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3629
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:51.200
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing's a murky blur.</v>

3630
01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:53.720
<v Speaker 5>I can barely remember what I had for breakfast.</v>

3631
01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3632
01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3633
01:54:56.530 --> 01:54:59.680
<v Speaker 2>So when someone tells you about a big foot story,</v>

3634
01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it may or may not be an accurate story.</v>

3635
01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.050
<v Speaker 5>I would say it is not an accurate story.</v>

3636
01:55:06.051 --> 01:55:07.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe in big foot.</v>

3637
01:55:07.431 --> 01:55:08.600
<v Speaker 5>And I think that the,</v>

3638
01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:08.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3639
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:09.351
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>

3640
01:55:09.351 --> 01:55:10.000
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3641
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:10.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3642
01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.110
<v Speaker 5>having played Sasquatch advocate,</v>

3643
01:55:12.111 --> 01:55:12.944
<v Speaker 5>I have to say,</v>

3644
01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:14.090
<v Speaker 5>let me give you an example.</v>

3645
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:15.051
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3646
01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:16.730
<v Speaker 5>where a big foot burial ground is,</v>

3647
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:17.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3648
01:55:17.130 --> 01:55:17.330
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3649
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:18.021
<v Speaker 5>you know that,</v>

3650
01:55:18.021 --> 01:55:18.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3651
01:55:18.471 --> 01:55:20.000
<v Speaker 5>this thing I can tell you there,</v>

3652
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:21.350
<v Speaker 5>I could take you there.</v>

3653
01:55:21.410 --> 01:55:21.801
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3654
01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:22.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3655
01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:22.371
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3656
01:55:22.371 --> 01:55:23.750
<v Speaker 5>where a big foot burial ground is.</v>

3657
01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:29.500
<v Speaker 5>This would be one of the most monumental anthropological discoveries of,</v>

3658
01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:33.440
<v Speaker 5>of our generation,</v>

3659
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.951
<v Speaker 5>of maybe,</v>

3660
01:55:33.951 --> 01:55:34.790
<v Speaker 5>of our time.</v>

3661
01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:38.960
<v Speaker 5>And you're not letting your species know about this thing.</v>

3662
01:55:39.370 --> 01:55:39.700
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>

3663
01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:40.370
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3664
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:40.491
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3665
01:55:40.491 --> 01:55:40.941
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>

3666
01:55:40.941 --> 01:55:41.610
<v Speaker 5>Dunkin,</v>

3667
01:55:41.610 --> 01:55:42.443
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3668
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:43.540
<v Speaker 5>when you've squatting,</v>

3669
01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:43.990
<v Speaker 5>as long as I</v>

3670
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.680
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

3671
01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:49.680
<v Speaker 2>you basically consider the squatch to be somewhat like family and a,</v>

3672
01:55:49.831 --> 01:55:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider these things to be creatures.</v>

3673
01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I consider these things to be my would brethren and my forest friends.</v>

3674
01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:58.300
<v Speaker 5>Can I ask you something?</v>

3675
01:55:59.230 --> 01:56:00.760
<v Speaker 5>Character Joe Rogan's playing.</v>

3676
01:56:01.330 --> 01:56:03.220
<v Speaker 5>Are you on a TV show right now?</v>

3677
01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:04.311
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3678
01:56:04.311 --> 01:56:08.540
<v Speaker 2>occasionally I am on a TV show looking for squatch squashing.</v>

3679
01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:12.430
<v Speaker 5>So you're revealing to the entire planet the existence of big foot,</v>

3680
01:56:12.431 --> 01:56:14.650
<v Speaker 5>but you don't want to prove it with a burial ground.</v>

3681
01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:14.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3682
01:56:14.871 --> 01:56:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the snippets of your tone,</v>

3683
01:56:16.551 --> 01:56:16.771
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

3684
01:56:16.771 --> 01:56:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Can,</v>

3685
01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you right now when I'm looking for squatch,</v>

3686
01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:21.290
<v Speaker 2>it is 100%.</v>

3687
01:56:21.710 --> 01:56:25.460
<v Speaker 2>There's no bad intention involved.</v>

3688
01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.370
<v Speaker 2>I have love for the squatch.</v>

3689
01:56:28.610 --> 01:56:30.890
<v Speaker 2>The squatch community recognize me.</v>

3690
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:31.521
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3691
01:56:31.521 --> 01:56:33.980
<v Speaker 2>I know their favorite food is peanut butter and Jelly.</v>

3692
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I leave it in the gifting tree outside my house and it's often gone when I</v>

3693
01:56:37.311 --> 01:56:38.144
<v Speaker 2>return.</v>

3694
01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:39.770
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3695
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:40.603
<v Speaker 2>Well I gotta go.</v>

3696
01:56:40.670 --> 01:56:41.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you like?</v>

3697
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Don't go and get the check.</v>

3698
01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:43.220
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3699
01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:46.130
<v Speaker 2>A man who lives on nothing but water and air.</v>

3700
01:56:46.131 --> 01:56:46.281
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3701
01:56:46.281 --> 01:56:47.150
<v Speaker 2>no water shit.</v>

3702
01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:48.073
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>

3703
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:48.671
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

3704
01:56:48.671 --> 01:56:49.240
<v Speaker 5>But you,</v>

3705
01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:52.270
<v Speaker 5>to me it seems like it's absolutely,</v>

3706
01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:55.870
<v Speaker 5>if they have discovered some proof of these um,</v>

3707
01:56:55.930 --> 01:56:56.860
<v Speaker 5>beings existing,</v>

3708
01:56:56.861 --> 01:57:01.861
<v Speaker 5>I think it is unethical to not reveal it because the ethical thing to do would</v>

3709
01:57:02.261 --> 01:57:06.100
<v Speaker 5>be to show the burial grounds so that we can create nature preserves to protect</v>

3710
01:57:06.101 --> 01:57:10.330
<v Speaker 5>these precious woodland creatures from logging and all the variety of things</v>

3711
01:57:10.331 --> 01:57:11.164
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

3712
01:57:11.230 --> 01:57:15.340
<v Speaker 2>you really think that the government is going to protect the squatch.</v>

3713
01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3714
01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:16.931
<v Speaker 2>This was the other thing.</v>

3715
01:57:16.931 --> 01:57:17.680
<v Speaker 2>This guy believes,</v>

3716
01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:21.820
<v Speaker 2>this guy believes that the government actually is aware of the squatch.</v>

3717
01:57:21.821 --> 01:57:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3718
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:26.860
<v Speaker 2>and the government is hiding the squatch because the government thinks that</v>

3719
01:57:27.130 --> 01:57:31.780
<v Speaker 2>society itself would fall apart much like an alien invasion,</v>

3720
01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:35.290
<v Speaker 2>much like in an alien invasion scenario,</v>

3721
01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.030
<v Speaker 2>religion would fall apart.</v>

3722
01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:40.720
<v Speaker 2>How do you explain the giant wood man that was not in the Bible?</v>

3723
01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:41.531
<v Speaker 2>How do you explain it?</v>

3724
01:57:41.531 --> 01:57:43.210
<v Speaker 2>10 foot tall person thing.</v>

3725
01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:44.141
<v Speaker 2>Who lives in the,</v>

3726
01:57:44.141 --> 01:57:47.260
<v Speaker 2>in the woods and can spot camera traps a mile away.</v>

3727
01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:48.173
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

3728
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:49.071
<v Speaker 5>There's a scar.</v>

3729
01:57:49.071 --> 01:57:51.980
<v Speaker 5>Squatch I'm going to burn down the White House,</v>

3730
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:52.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3731
01:57:52.130 --> 01:57:52.190
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

3732
01:57:52.190 --> 01:57:52.851
<v Speaker 2>Now here we go.</v>

3733
01:57:52.851 --> 01:57:53.541
<v Speaker 2>Proponent.</v>

3734
01:57:53.541 --> 01:57:54.374
<v Speaker 2>Here's proponent,</v>

3735
01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:55.071
<v Speaker 2>pull up.</v>

3736
01:57:55.071 --> 01:57:59.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a photo of gigantic [inaudible] and there's a gigantic pithy guests that</v>

3737
01:57:59.481 --> 01:58:01.610
<v Speaker 2>is right beside.</v>

3738
01:58:01.611 --> 01:58:03.170
<v Speaker 2>It's standing beside a person.</v>

3739
01:58:03.171 --> 01:58:03.381
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

3740
01:58:03.381 --> 01:58:04.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a recreation.</v>

3741
01:58:04.401 --> 01:58:08.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a man in a recreation of this animal and this is where it gets really</v>

3742
01:58:08.691 --> 01:58:09.260
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

3743
01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Gigantic [inaudible] is an animal that they found out about in the posit carry</v>

3744
01:58:14.151 --> 01:58:14.600
<v Speaker 2>shop.</v>

3745
01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.420
<v Speaker 2>There's that photo and then there's another one that's kind of even more</v>

3746
01:58:17.421 --> 01:58:20.360
<v Speaker 2>interesting because they did it in front of a jungle.</v>

3747
01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:20.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3748
01:58:20.631 --> 01:58:21.464
<v Speaker 2>that one right there.</v>

3749
01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Now look at this fucking thing.</v>

3750
01:58:24.170 --> 01:58:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Spread this out.</v>

3751
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's crazy.</v>

3752
01:58:26.570 --> 01:58:28.670
<v Speaker 2>That was real.</v>

3753
01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:30.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a real animal.</v>

3754
01:58:30.861 --> 01:58:32.030
<v Speaker 2>They have bones.</v>

3755
01:58:32.031 --> 01:58:33.290
<v Speaker 2>They have teeth.</v>

3756
01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:37.520
<v Speaker 2>They know that this thing was bipedal base in the shape of his lower jaw.</v>

3757
01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:42.940
<v Speaker 2>This was an animal that existed is as a hundred thousand years ago and existed</v>

3758
01:58:43.931 --> 01:58:48.820
<v Speaker 2>in Asia and they didn't find out about this to the 1920s there was a guy who</v>

3759
01:58:48.821 --> 01:58:50.380
<v Speaker 2>went into an apothecary shop.</v>

3760
01:58:50.381 --> 01:58:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I should probably credit him here.</v>

3761
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:52.271
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

3762
01:58:52.271 --> 01:58:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Gigantic.</v>

3763
01:58:53.171 --> 01:58:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh pick.</v>

3764
01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:55.570
<v Speaker 2>It kind of looks like an orangutan.</v>

3765
01:58:56.170 --> 01:58:56.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3766
01:58:56.591 --> 01:59:00.760
<v Speaker 2>But except stands up on its fucking hind legs and it's 10 feet tall.</v>

3767
01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:01.361
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

3768
01:59:01.361 --> 01:59:02.194
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3769
01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:03.761
<v Speaker 2>it will be.</v>

3770
01:59:03.761 --> 01:59:08.050
<v Speaker 2>So then if you saw an orangutan in the zoo and right behind it was that,</v>

3771
01:59:08.051 --> 01:59:08.321
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

3772
01:59:08.321 --> 01:59:09.400
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>

3773
01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:11.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a 10 foot tall.</v>

3774
01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Rang Tang that walks like a person.</v>

3775
01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

3776
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

3777
01:59:18.010 --> 01:59:21.160
<v Speaker 4>I just liked the idea of those two actually being friends in real life,</v>

3778
01:59:21.161 --> 01:59:22.540
<v Speaker 4>like a superhero team.</v>

3779
01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:23.051
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3780
01:59:23.051 --> 01:59:23.980
<v Speaker 4>This is the guy's name.</v>

3781
01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:25.040
<v Speaker 4>The gentleman's name is [inaudible]</v>

3782
01:59:25.150 --> 01:59:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Ralph.</v>

3783
01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Yvonne calling's Wald,</v>

3784
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Cohen's Wald,</v>

3785
01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Ralph Vaughan Cohen's wall.</v>

3786
01:59:32.110 --> 01:59:36.160
<v Speaker 2>And he was in the apothecary shop in China and there's a,</v>

3787
01:59:36.161 --> 01:59:41.161
<v Speaker 2>it was in a light Ching Cave in light Luzio China.</v>

3788
01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:42.790
<v Speaker 2>I might've said that wrong.</v>

3789
01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3790
01:59:43.630 --> 01:59:48.630
<v Speaker 2>he found these teeth as well as several job bones and this apothecary shop.</v>

3791
01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:51.290
<v Speaker 2>And he apparently he was a,</v>

3792
01:59:51.330 --> 01:59:51.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3793
01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:52.421
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

3794
01:59:52.421 --> 01:59:53.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3795
01:59:53.110 --> 01:59:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I believe he's an anthropologist.</v>

3796
01:59:55.780 --> 02:00:00.780
<v Speaker 2>And he went and he found these bones and I think he recognized right away that</v>

3797
02:00:01.841 --> 02:00:02.860
<v Speaker 2>these were primate.</v>

3798
02:00:03.050 --> 02:00:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3799
02:00:03.610 --> 02:00:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And that they were way too big to be human and way too big to be gorilla.</v>

3800
02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:09.041
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

3801
02:00:09.041 --> 02:00:11.080
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

3802
02:00:11.190 --> 02:00:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3803
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:14.410
<v Speaker 2>The people in the Chinese apothecary shop just thought they had some random</v>

3804
02:00:14.411 --> 02:00:14.800
<v Speaker 2>bones.</v>

3805
02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3806
02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:18.790
<v Speaker 2>And they actually were calling them dragging bones.</v>

3807
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3808
02:00:19.330 --> 02:00:20.020
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3809
02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:24.370
<v Speaker 2>they trace these teeth back to their source and it resulted in recovery,</v>

3810
02:00:24.371 --> 02:00:28.030
<v Speaker 2>have more teeth and a rather complete large mandible.</v>

3811
02:00:28.210 --> 02:00:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Now by 1958,</v>

3812
02:00:30.190 --> 02:00:35.190
<v Speaker 2>it says here on Wikipedia that three mandibles and 1300 teeth had been</v>

3813
02:00:35.321 --> 02:00:36.154
<v Speaker 2>discovered.</v>

3814
02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:37.410
<v Speaker 2>So they know that this is a,</v>

3815
02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:42.630
<v Speaker 2>for sure real animal and the most recent fossils are a hundred thousand years</v>

3816
02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:43.420
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

3817
02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.780
<v Speaker 2>That's when you look at that thing and you hear a big foot story.</v>

3818
02:00:47.110 --> 02:00:47.620
<v Speaker 2>That's fuck,</v>

3819
02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:48.880
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking big foot.</v>

3820
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean that thing next to that guy is big foot.</v>

3821
02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3822
02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:52.983
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

3823
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:54.880
<v Speaker 4>they didn't find a skull.</v>

3824
02:00:55.090 --> 02:00:58.210
<v Speaker 4>They found teeth in a job bone and they made Chubak out of it.</v>

3825
02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:00.360
<v Speaker 4>They didn't find a skull.</v>

3826
02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:01.830
<v Speaker 4>It's true shape</v>

3827
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:02.641
<v Speaker 2>of the lower jaw.</v>

3828
02:01:02.641 --> 02:01:05.970
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't determine that this was a bipedal animal.</v>

3829
02:01:06.010 --> 02:01:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3830
02:01:06.630 --> 02:01:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's not determined it's hair color.</v>

3831
02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:09.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3832
02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:10.050
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3833
02:01:10.050 --> 02:01:10.980
<v Speaker 2>that's totally made up.</v>

3834
02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:12.570
<v Speaker 2>That's also with Neanderthal,</v>

3835
02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:12.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3836
02:01:12.901 --> 02:01:15.890
<v Speaker 2>within thall notice I said all this time when,</v>

3837
02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:16.411
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

3838
02:01:16.411 --> 02:01:16.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3839
02:01:16.830 --> 02:01:18.630
<v Speaker 2>look at neanderthal imagery,</v>

3840
02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:19.620
<v Speaker 2>that's all made up.</v>

3841
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:20.341
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3842
02:01:20.341 --> 02:01:21.040
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

3843
02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:25.410
<v Speaker 2>a guy who thought of Neanderthal is a Predator and he had this whole paper that</v>

3844
02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:26.221
<v Speaker 2>he wrote and,</v>

3845
02:01:26.221 --> 02:01:26.430
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3846
02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:31.430
<v Speaker 2>and he even had a video made of proposing that neanderthal had black skin,</v>

3847
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:33.510
<v Speaker 2>like a gorilla.</v>

3848
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:37.410
<v Speaker 2>And that neanderthal where these super muscular predators that hunted humans,</v>

3849
02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we drove them to extinction.</v>

3850
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:42.600
<v Speaker 2>And he actually bases this on the shape of their jaw.</v>

3851
02:01:42.601 --> 02:01:43.040
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

3852
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:45.950
<v Speaker 2>we impose human characteristics to neanderthals,</v>

3853
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:47.110
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at it in the end,</v>

3854
02:01:47.111 --> 02:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>are tall skull next to a homosapien skull,</v>

3855
02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.270
<v Speaker 2>they're very different.</v>

3856
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:52.130
<v Speaker 2>The shape of the eyes different.</v>

3857
02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:52.491
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3858
02:01:52.491 --> 02:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>if we know the chimpanzees exist and we know the grills exist and we know that</v>

3859
02:01:55.971 --> 02:02:00.350
<v Speaker 2>their facial structure is actually more similar to a neanderthal than ours are.</v>

3860
02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3861
02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:03.590
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't we assume that they had skin coloring and,</v>

3862
02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:03.970
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3863
02:02:03.970 --> 02:02:07.550
<v Speaker 2>and skin texture that was very guerrilla like right.</v>

3864
02:02:07.551 --> 02:02:09.260
<v Speaker 2>And so this guy made this video,</v>

3865
02:02:09.261 --> 02:02:12.290
<v Speaker 2>see if you could pull that up neander tall as a,</v>

3866
02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>as a Predator</v>

3867
02:02:15.170 --> 02:02:15.951
<v Speaker 2>of humans,</v>

3868
02:02:15.951 --> 02:02:17.630
<v Speaker 2>as a Predator of humans,</v>

3869
02:02:17.690 --> 02:02:21.530
<v Speaker 2>free tour of humans.</v>

3870
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what I find.</v>

3871
02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:27.140
<v Speaker 2>It's called them and us.</v>

3872
02:02:27.170 --> 02:02:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3873
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:28.910
<v Speaker 2>So look up them,</v>

3874
02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:31.280
<v Speaker 2>them and us how the neanderthals were a oppressed.</v>

3875
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:32.710
<v Speaker 2>But this guy had um,</v>

3876
02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.610
<v Speaker 2>images that he created and he,</v>

3877
02:02:35.611 --> 02:02:39.540
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book detailing this theory and I'm,</v>

3878
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:44.560
<v Speaker 2>his theory was that we had excepted a vision of what Niana tall looked on,</v>

3879
02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:45.890
<v Speaker 2>looked at,</v>

3880
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:48.890
<v Speaker 2>looked like based entirely on what we look like,</v>

3881
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:49.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3882
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.791
<v Speaker 2>And he saying,</v>

3883
02:02:49.791 --> 02:02:49.911
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3884
02:02:49.911 --> 02:02:52.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence of that and you might as well,</v>

3885
02:02:52.731 --> 02:02:56.000
<v Speaker 2>you might as well look at it as being far closer to a gorilla.</v>

3886
02:02:56.150 --> 02:03:01.090
<v Speaker 2>And he gives a bunch of reasons that have to do with the size of the bones.</v>

3887
02:03:01.091 --> 02:03:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3888
02:03:01.610 --> 02:03:03.320
<v Speaker 2>They had much different bone structure than us.</v>

3889
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:06.020
<v Speaker 2>They were like 200 plus pounds and they were like five feet tall.</v>

3890
02:03:06.110 --> 02:03:07.580
<v Speaker 2>They were totally weird looking.</v>

3891
02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:08.930
<v Speaker 2>There were not like a person.</v>

3892
02:03:08.970 --> 02:03:09.540
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3893
02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:11.970
<v Speaker 4>it's just in the reconstruction that you just showed me.</v>

3894
02:03:12.330 --> 02:03:15.840
<v Speaker 4>If you're saying this came from teeth and a jawbone and you're saying this was</v>

3895
02:03:15.841 --> 02:03:17.580
<v Speaker 4>done by the professor,</v>

3896
02:03:17.581 --> 02:03:20.970
<v Speaker 4>Loreal guy in the picture with the hairy Orangutang like thing,</v>

3897
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:23.670
<v Speaker 4>I want to know where did you get the hair color from?</v>

3898
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Why is the hair color that long?</v>

3899
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:27.530
<v Speaker 4>This being it'll know.</v>

3900
02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:27.841
<v Speaker 4>Listen.</v>

3901
02:03:27.841 --> 02:03:28.240
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3902
02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.550
<v Speaker 4>You're right about that for sure.</v>

3903
02:03:29.650 --> 02:03:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Because I think anybody could take a few teeth in a Java on and stick that into</v>

3904
02:03:33.811 --> 02:03:35.400
<v Speaker 4>a Sasquatch replica and say,</v>

3905
02:03:35.401 --> 02:03:35.701
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3906
02:03:35.701 --> 02:03:37.130
<v Speaker 4>it's proof mom.</v>

3907
02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3908
02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:38.281
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>

3909
02:03:38.281 --> 02:03:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3910
02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:39.923
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could,</v>

3911
02:03:40.110 --> 02:03:41.490
<v Speaker 2>but what we do know,</v>

3912
02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just speculation,</v>

3913
02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:43.621
<v Speaker 2>but we do know this is,</v>

3914
02:03:43.621 --> 02:03:44.520
<v Speaker 2>this is a real animal.</v>

3915
02:03:45.090 --> 02:03:46.410
<v Speaker 2>So whatever this was,</v>

3916
02:03:46.650 --> 02:03:47.760
<v Speaker 2>whether it looked like that.</v>

3917
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3918
02:03:48.090 --> 02:03:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Or it didn't look like that.</v>

3919
02:03:49.230 --> 02:03:50.760
<v Speaker 2>We know it was huge.</v>

3920
02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:51.061
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3921
02:03:51.061 --> 02:03:52.890
<v Speaker 2>this is absolutely gigantic,</v>

3922
02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.480
<v Speaker 2>far bigger than any primate that's ever lived since then or before then.</v>

3923
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:58.343
<v Speaker 2>As far as we know,</v>

3924
02:03:58.400 --> 02:03:59.960
<v Speaker 4>if you look in the book of Genesis,</v>

3925
02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:02.960
<v Speaker 4>there's reference to these beings called the nephilim.</v>

3926
02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:05.450
<v Speaker 4>Then nephilim were these giants.</v>

3927
02:04:05.451 --> 02:04:07.760
<v Speaker 4>They said they were giants during this time.</v>

3928
02:04:07.761 --> 02:04:08.270
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3929
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:09.103
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3930
02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:09.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3931
02:04:09.471 --> 02:04:10.820
<v Speaker 4>who knows whether that's real or not.</v>

3932
02:04:10.821 --> 02:04:15.821
<v Speaker 4>But I think all mythologies have referenced to these giant human things that</v>

3933
02:04:16.191 --> 02:04:17.390
<v Speaker 4>used to wander the earth.</v>

3934
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3935
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.221
<v Speaker 2>we know,</v>

3936
02:04:18.221 --> 02:04:20.440
<v Speaker 2>think about human giants that we know about.</v>

3937
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

3938
02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Think about guys like Shaquille O'Neal or Hong Man,</v>

3939
02:04:23.351 --> 02:04:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Troy or real giants,</v>

3940
02:04:24.701 --> 02:04:24.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3941
02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot of physical problems.</v>

3942
02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:29.200
<v Speaker 2>And then think about what it takes to create a fossil.</v>

3943
02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:31.150
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly difficult to create a fossil.</v>

3944
02:04:31.151 --> 02:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>The only way you create a fossils,</v>

3945
02:04:32.321 --> 02:04:35.710
<v Speaker 2>if you get caught in a landslide or a volcano or something happens where it</v>

3946
02:04:35.711 --> 02:04:36.550
<v Speaker 2>preserves your body,</v>

3947
02:04:36.551 --> 02:04:37.770
<v Speaker 2>you can get in mud.</v>

3948
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:39.720
<v Speaker 2>But most of us are not going to be fossils.</v>

3949
02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Most of us are just going to rot.</v>

3950
02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:43.530
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go into the ground and then worms are going to eat us,</v>

3951
02:04:43.531 --> 02:04:44.640
<v Speaker 2>and then we're going to cease to exist.</v>

3952
02:04:44.641 --> 02:04:48.000
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to be transmuted into the next age of the afternoon.</v>

3953
02:04:48.001 --> 02:04:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I haven't praise,</v>

3954
02:04:49.041 --> 02:04:49.730
<v Speaker 2>praise,</v>

3955
02:04:49.730 --> 02:04:50.563
<v Speaker 2>praise Shiva.</v>

3956
02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.680
<v Speaker 2>But what we,</v>

3957
02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:57.450
<v Speaker 2>what we do know is that there's been people our size and then there's been these</v>

3958
02:04:57.451 --> 02:04:58.530
<v Speaker 2>little tiny hobbit people.</v>

3959
02:04:58.560 --> 02:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3960
02:04:59.010 --> 02:05:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be ridiculous to think that it's not possible.</v>

3961
02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:02.690
<v Speaker 2>They could have been giant piece.</v>

3962
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:03.251
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3963
02:05:03.251 --> 02:05:04.630
<v Speaker 5>There was giant lizards,</v>

3964
02:05:04.631 --> 02:05:05.560
<v Speaker 5>giant birds.</v>

3965
02:05:05.561 --> 02:05:07.330
<v Speaker 5>There's been giant elephants.</v>

3966
02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:08.560
<v Speaker 5>Giant Tiger's.</v>

3967
02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:10.570
<v Speaker 5>If you go down to the labrea tar pits,</v>

3968
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:14.260
<v Speaker 5>just check out the sculptures of the dire wolves out there.</v>

3969
02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:17.140
<v Speaker 5>Those things used to wander around Los Angeles.</v>

3970
02:05:17.170 --> 02:05:18.003
<v Speaker 5>How big were they?</v>

3971
02:05:18.010 --> 02:05:19.030
<v Speaker 5>Huge.</v>

3972
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:21.040
<v Speaker 5>Like horse size wolf.</v>

3973
02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:21.893
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3974
02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:23.560
<v Speaker 5>Direwolves Los Angeles.</v>

3975
02:05:23.590 --> 02:05:24.423
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3976
02:05:25.450 --> 02:05:26.820
<v Speaker 5>Now they're not going to be horse size.</v>

3977
02:05:26.821 --> 02:05:27.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna say probably huge.</v>

3978
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.740
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3979
02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:29.110
<v Speaker 5>did you?</v>

3980
02:05:29.110 --> 02:05:29.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3981
02:05:29.291 --> 02:05:29.740
<v Speaker 5>It's okay.</v>

3982
02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:30.573
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry about it.</v>

3983
02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:31.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3984
02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:33.820
<v Speaker 5>did you ever Dire Wolf Los Angeles?</v>

3985
02:05:35.050 --> 02:05:36.830
<v Speaker 5>She's going to bring up a crappy band.</v>

3986
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Remains of nearly 2000 dire wolf's were Exuma.</v>

3987
02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:43.250
<v Speaker 2>They lived 9,000 years ago.</v>

3988
02:05:43.251 --> 02:05:43.461
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3989
02:05:43.461 --> 02:05:45.610
<v Speaker 2>How big were they or not?</v>

3990
02:05:45.810 --> 02:05:46.643
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say</v>

3991
02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 5>there were huge.</v>

3992
02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:48.480
<v Speaker 5>All I believe you bro.</v>

3993
02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:49.620
<v Speaker 5>Look at,</v>

3994
02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:49.891
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3995
02:05:49.891 --> 02:05:50.250
<v Speaker 5>look at,</v>

3996
02:05:50.250 --> 02:05:53.100
<v Speaker 5>look at a saber tooth tigers for God's sake.</v>

3997
02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:54.361
<v Speaker 5>Look at those things.</v>

3998
02:05:54.361 --> 02:05:56.100
<v Speaker 5>Those things used to wander around La.</v>

3999
02:05:56.190 --> 02:05:56.371
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4000
02:05:56.371 --> 02:05:56.911
<v Speaker 5>not only that,</v>

4001
02:05:56.911 --> 02:05:58.290
<v Speaker 5>that was only like 10,000 years ago.</v>

4002
02:05:58.320 --> 02:05:58.521
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4003
02:05:58.521 --> 02:06:03.480
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that there were giant humans are giant primates is not,</v>

4004
02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:06.750
<v Speaker 5>to me a particularly shocking notion.</v>

4005
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:11.820
<v Speaker 5>I believe that it's just hard for me to imagine that one of them has managed to</v>

4006
02:06:11.821 --> 02:06:13.590
<v Speaker 5>somehow exist in the present day.</v>

4007
02:06:13.770 --> 02:06:14.640
<v Speaker 5>It's also disturbed</v>

4008
02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:14.910
<v Speaker 2>bang.</v>

4009
02:06:14.910 --> 02:06:16.650
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the things that we resist.</v>

4010
02:06:16.651 --> 02:06:19.110
<v Speaker 2>We resist danger that we're not aware of.</v>

4011
02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:20.100
<v Speaker 2>When you're resistant,</v>

4012
02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:20.581
<v Speaker 2>like call,</v>

4013
02:06:20.581 --> 02:06:21.270
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

4014
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to someone about a,</v>

4015
02:06:22.591 --> 02:06:23.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4016
02:06:23.090 --> 02:06:25.410
<v Speaker 2>this is a community that's experiencing,</v>

4017
02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:26.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4018
02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:26.401
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4019
02:06:26.401 --> 02:06:26.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4020
02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:30.600
<v Speaker 2>they live near a factory and they're experiencing like all these issues.</v>

4021
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:32.550
<v Speaker 2>And I was talking to someone who,</v>

4022
02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:32.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4023
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:33.601
<v Speaker 2>it was saying like,</v>

4024
02:06:33.601 --> 02:06:34.201
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

4025
02:06:34.201 --> 02:06:34.890
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

4026
02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:37.320
<v Speaker 2>this community might be poisoned because of his factory.</v>

4027
02:06:37.530 --> 02:06:38.610
<v Speaker 2>And then I talked to another guy,</v>

4028
02:06:38.611 --> 02:06:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4029
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.900
<v Speaker 2>oh listen,</v>

4030
02:06:39.901 --> 02:06:41.070
<v Speaker 2>that's nonsense.</v>

4031
02:06:41.071 --> 02:06:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something that if that was true and he starts rattling off some</v>

4032
02:06:45.451 --> 02:06:46.620
<v Speaker 2>reasons why he doesn't believe it's true.</v>

4033
02:06:46.621 --> 02:06:48.470
<v Speaker 2>And then I asked him if he had looked into it and he hadn't.</v>

4034
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:49.411
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized,</v>

4035
02:06:49.411 --> 02:06:49.651
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4036
02:06:49.651 --> 02:06:54.180
<v Speaker 2>we're dealing with like reactions that humans have when we want to categorize</v>

4037
02:06:54.181 --> 02:06:59.181
<v Speaker 2>dangers and we want to put them in it clearly definable categories and we have</v>

4038
02:06:59.461 --> 02:07:00.960
<v Speaker 2>to wonder whether we want to worry about them.</v>

4039
02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:03.360
<v Speaker 2>And some things you worry about never take place.</v>

4040
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:04.470
<v Speaker 2>And if that's happens,</v>

4041
02:07:04.471 --> 02:07:07.680
<v Speaker 2>then you're a little worry wart and you're a pussy and then you're ruining</v>

4042
02:07:07.681 --> 02:07:08.440
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

4043
02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:08.591
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4044
02:07:08.591 --> 02:07:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Because you're a big wimp and people don't want to be a big wimp.</v>

4045
02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:13.500
<v Speaker 2>So when people don't want to be a big Wimp,</v>

4046
02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:17.970
<v Speaker 2>they dismiss things that may or may not be real and may or may not be a danger.</v>

4047
02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:20.190
<v Speaker 2>And they do it as a defense mechanism.</v>

4048
02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:24.640
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not entirely objective the reaction to any,</v>

4049
02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.493
<v Speaker 2>any thing.</v>

4050
02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:25.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4051
02:07:25.711 --> 02:07:28.170
<v Speaker 2>when you bring up big foot people immediately,</v>

4052
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:29.143
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4053
02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:30.031
<v Speaker 2>shy,</v>

4054
02:07:30.031 --> 02:07:32.340
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna love for big foot guide and look for the,</v>

4055
02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:32.581
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4056
02:07:32.581 --> 02:07:33.480
<v Speaker 2>what else are you going to look for?</v>

4057
02:07:33.481 --> 02:07:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Leprechauns well,</v>

4058
02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:36.630
<v Speaker 2>let me know when you find a Pegasus</v>

4059
02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:37.040
<v Speaker 6>out there,</v>

4060
02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:37.660
<v Speaker 6>fella,</v>

4061
02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:40.930
<v Speaker 6>and take a ride around the world in the flying in horse,</v>

4062
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:42.430
<v Speaker 6>it's probably real.</v>

4063
02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 6>I mean the Greeks made a statue of it.</v>

4064
02:07:44.471 --> 02:07:44.951
<v Speaker 6>Why would they,</v>

4065
02:07:44.951 --> 02:07:45.461
<v Speaker 6>why,</v>

4066
02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:46.030
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4067
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:47.350
<v Speaker 6>Why would they lie?</v>

4068
02:07:47.530 --> 02:07:52.090
<v Speaker 6>And what he's doing by berating you and by dismissing this topic is not just</v>

4069
02:07:52.091 --> 02:07:55.150
<v Speaker 6>dismissing something that is preposterous and is ludicrous and stupid,</v>

4070
02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:58.510
<v Speaker 6>but he's also making himself feel better because he's scared because he's a</v>

4071
02:07:58.511 --> 02:07:59.231
<v Speaker 6>scared little bitch.</v>

4072
02:07:59.231 --> 02:08:03.940
<v Speaker 6>Worried about that guy started big foot and his giant Rasputin Dwarfing Dick,</v>

4073
02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:06.850
<v Speaker 6>big foot must have a dick like a giraffe.</v>

4074
02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:10.060
<v Speaker 6>It was probably like a giraffe neck tied to his cock.</v>

4075
02:08:10.090 --> 02:08:13.120
<v Speaker 6>It's just is gigantic and it's probably black,</v>

4076
02:08:13.121 --> 02:08:13.954
<v Speaker 6>like coal.</v>

4077
02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:15.850
<v Speaker 6>I'm scared of so many things.</v>

4078
02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:18.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm scared of taking my shirt off at a swimming pool,</v>

4079
02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:21.440
<v Speaker 6>but I am not scared of bigfoot.</v>

4080
02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:25.270
<v Speaker 6>And my reason for not believing in bigfoot is not because I'm afraid that my</v>

4081
02:08:25.271 --> 02:08:26.470
<v Speaker 6>belief in bigfoot,</v>

4082
02:08:26.670 --> 02:08:30.760
<v Speaker 6>some big foot's gonna come trouncing into my house in Silverlake.</v>

4083
02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

4084
02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:32.711
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe in,</v>

4089
02:08:36.630 --> 02:08:37.780

4092
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:43.450
<v Speaker 6>I like to watch bobcat calls,</v>

4093
02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:43.661

4096
02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:47.350
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>

4097
02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:48.850
<v Speaker 6>You'll shit your pants,</v>

4098
02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.520
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna be afraid to get out of the car and take a leak if it's dark out</v>

4099
02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:52.960
<v Speaker 6>and you're near a patch of woods.</v>

4100
02:08:57.710 --> 02:08:58.180
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

4101
02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:01.480

4102
02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:04.930
<v Speaker 6>but I know that we both think it's an interesting subject.</v>

4103
02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:06.033
<v Speaker 6>Why is that?</v>

4104
02:09:06.370 --> 02:09:06.581
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4105
02:09:06.581 --> 02:09:08.050
<v Speaker 6>because it's a beautiful idea.</v>

4106
02:09:08.051 --> 02:09:13.051
<v Speaker 6>It's this idea of a being that is somehow managed to evolve to a place past the</v>

4107
02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:19.000
<v Speaker 6>intelligence of chimpanzees and gorillas and yet simultaneously has reached this</v>

4108
02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:23.110
<v Speaker 6>harmony with nature and is living out there and some kind of beautiful</v>

4109
02:09:23.111 --> 02:09:25.540
<v Speaker 6>primordial pagan state.</v>

4110
02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:28.540
<v Speaker 6>There's something really wonderful about that idea.</v>

4111
02:09:28.630 --> 02:09:30.100
<v Speaker 6>It's like avatar depression.</v>

4112
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:31.143
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4113
02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:33.460
<v Speaker 6>It's like a version of Avatar depression.</v>

4114
02:09:33.490 --> 02:09:34.090
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4115
02:09:34.090 --> 02:09:36.490
<v Speaker 6>Like when people went to see that movie Avatar,</v>

4116
02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.360
<v Speaker 6>when you see those noble people who would never lie,</v>

4117
02:09:40.361 --> 02:09:44.950
<v Speaker 6>and although they may exhibit a little bit of jealousy and they take that fake</v>

4118
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:49.510
<v Speaker 6>Navi into their arms because they're beautiful people and they get their</v>

4119
02:09:49.511 --> 02:09:51.820
<v Speaker 6>internet from a tree and it comes down from this,</v>

4120
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:55.270
<v Speaker 6>this have some sort of a wifi thing where it's like the float and whatever,</v>

4121
02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:56.860
<v Speaker 6>they can hide their tails.</v>

4122
02:09:56.890 --> 02:09:57.251
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4123
02:09:57.251 --> 02:09:58.030
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

4124
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:59.980
<v Speaker 6>But there's something about that that's wonderful.</v>

4125
02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:04.460
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things that you and I experienced is we went and we,</v>

4126
02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:09.180
<v Speaker 6>we went to mount Rainier with the lovely and talented cast and crew and we,</v>

4127
02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.200
<v Speaker 6>we went up there and we wandered through those woods and we went to a bunch of</v>

4128
02:10:14.351 --> 02:10:17.800
<v Speaker 6>different areas where people have claimed to have seen Sasquatch before.</v>

4129
02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:19.480
<v Speaker 6>And the thing that's struck me,</v>

4130
02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:24.220
<v Speaker 6>besides the fact that it was unbelievably beautiful up there,</v>

4131
02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:28.510
<v Speaker 6>I have never been to the woods of the Pacific northwest in my adult life.</v>

4132
02:10:28.810 --> 02:10:31.630
<v Speaker 6>I actually talked to my dad about it and he said we went camping up there when</v>

4133
02:10:31.631 --> 02:10:33.590
<v Speaker 6>we were was when I was much,</v>

4134
02:10:33.591 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 6>much younger.</v>

4135
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I think I won like seven and I don't remember it because apparently it was like</v>

4136
02:10:37.191 --> 02:10:40.730
<v Speaker 1>rainy and miserable and we hated it and we got out of there like it wouldn't be</v>

4137
02:10:40.731 --> 02:10:42.770
<v Speaker 1>like the funnest place to go camping,</v>

4138
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:45.530
<v Speaker 1>but it literally is an,</v>

4139
02:10:45.531 --> 02:10:46.011
<v Speaker 1>I hate the word,</v>

4140
02:10:46.011 --> 02:10:46.550
<v Speaker 1>literally.</v>

4141
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.930
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

4142
02:10:46.930 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Used it really is like you're stepping into another dementia.</v>

4143
02:10:50.841 --> 02:10:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4144
02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:55.370
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful and it's so rich with plant life.</v>

4145
02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4146
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:57.320
<v Speaker 1>it's the plant life.</v>

4147
02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>This is how you consider it.</v>

4148
02:10:58.790 --> 02:11:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend that the,</v>

4149
02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.140
<v Speaker 1>the salt lake is a blank slate.</v>

4150
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:04.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4151
02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Salt Lake in Utah was that flat?</v>

4152
02:11:06.171 --> 02:11:09.890
<v Speaker 1>The flat plains or there's the salt flats where they race cars,</v>

4153
02:11:09.891 --> 02:11:12.080
<v Speaker 1>they take cars and the going a thousand miles an hour because there's nothing</v>

4154
02:11:12.081 --> 02:11:12.371
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

4155
02:11:12.371 --> 02:11:13.204
<v Speaker 1>but it's flat salt.</v>

4156
02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:14.073
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4157
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:17.480
<v Speaker 1>If that's a flat plane and that's a zero life environment.</v>

4158
02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:19.183
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

4159
02:11:19.610 --> 02:11:24.010
<v Speaker 1>the rain forests of the Pacific northwest is a 100% life environment.</v>

4160
02:11:24.010 --> 02:11:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4161
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Every inch is taken up by plant life.</v>

4162
02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:29.270
<v Speaker 1>There's elk running across.</v>

4163
02:11:29.450 --> 02:11:32.210
<v Speaker 1>We stepped an elk shit every other step everywhere.</v>

4164
02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.200
<v Speaker 1>It was everywhere.</v>

4165
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:35.060
<v Speaker 1>We were driving down the road.</v>

4166
02:11:35.090 --> 02:11:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Elk would just walk right in front of us.</v>

4167
02:11:36.531 --> 02:11:38.570
<v Speaker 1>These giant wild cows,</v>

4168
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 1>which are more related to cows in the yard to a deer.</v>

4169
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

4170
02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:42.531
<v Speaker 1>she huge,</v>

4171
02:11:42.531 --> 02:11:43.041
<v Speaker 1>enormous,</v>

4172
02:11:43.041 --> 02:11:46.160
<v Speaker 1>four or 500 pound animals just walking across the street.</v>

4173
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:49.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a wild place to sit.</v>

4174
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:51.380
<v Speaker 1>You have an accurate account on that.</v>

4175
02:11:51.381 --> 02:11:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you going up there and measuring shit.</v>

4176
02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Who's going up there?</v>

4177
02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:55.011
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4178
02:11:55.011 --> 02:11:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's right next to Seattle,</v>

4179
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:59.420
<v Speaker 1>even though it's 50 plus miles outside of Seattle,</v>

4180
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.880
<v Speaker 1>no one's going into those words.</v>

4181
02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:03.373
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

4182
02:12:03.710 --> 02:12:05.900
<v Speaker 1>And when you're there and you take that in,</v>

4183
02:12:06.230 --> 02:12:07.790
<v Speaker 1>that's when you really start considering it.</v>

4184
02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:09.620
<v Speaker 1>You really started going with eight maybe.</v>

4185
02:12:09.930 --> 02:12:10.763
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4186
02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:12.630
<v Speaker 5>You know when I went out there,</v>

4187
02:12:12.631 --> 02:12:14.790
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize how dense it was out there.</v>

4188
02:12:14.791 --> 02:12:14.931
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4189
02:12:14.931 --> 02:12:16.440
<v Speaker 5>I had never considered that.</v>

4190
02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:20.280
<v Speaker 5>And when you see how dense it is and how thick it is out there,</v>

4191
02:12:20.670 --> 02:12:25.320
<v Speaker 5>then you do start entertaining the idea that there's the possibility that some</v>

4192
02:12:25.321 --> 02:12:30.321
<v Speaker 5>extremely endangered being could be hiding out in these depths because people</v>

4193
02:12:30.451 --> 02:12:31.440
<v Speaker 5>aren't going to go into that.</v>

4194
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:35.100
<v Speaker 5>What purpose do people have for going into that stuff?</v>

4195
02:12:35.130 --> 02:12:35.390
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

4196
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:40.390
<v Speaker 5>I imagine that there's naturalists and maybe hardcore hikers who are crossing</v>

4197
02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:44.730
<v Speaker 5>maybe point 10th of a percent of that terrain,</v>

4198
02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:45.860
<v Speaker 5>if that,</v>

4199
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:46.380
<v Speaker 5>if that,</v>

4200
02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:46.890
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4201
02:12:46.890 --> 02:12:51.540
<v Speaker 5>so in that way you could see how there could be a being existing out there that</v>

4202
02:12:51.541 --> 02:12:53.010
<v Speaker 5>maybe hadn't been discovered yet</v>

4203
02:12:53.730 --> 02:12:58.730
<v Speaker 1>and when we sent the drones up into the sky to like overlook the area and when</v>

4204
02:12:59.371 --> 02:13:03.240
<v Speaker 1>you put the goggles on and you could see through the drones and you're flying</v>

4205
02:13:03.241 --> 02:13:04.074
<v Speaker 1>over the,</v>

4206
02:13:04.290 --> 02:13:06.240
<v Speaker 1>it's majestic.</v>

4207
02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4208
02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is majestic.</v>

4209
02:13:08.461 --> 02:13:11.580
<v Speaker 1>It is unlike any place that I have ever been to in my life.</v>

4210
02:13:11.581 --> 02:13:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I was humbled by the life.</v>

4211
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4212
02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Humbled by the plant life.</v>

4213
02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.460
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the amount of trees that you see up there in the density</v>

4214
02:13:20.461 --> 02:13:20.641
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

4215
02:13:20.641 --> 02:13:22.020
<v Speaker 1>All that is just like,</v>

4216
02:13:22.050 --> 02:13:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it puts you right in your place.</v>

4217
02:13:23.971 --> 02:13:27.480
<v Speaker 1>It just goes sit down and look at this and you,</v>

4218
02:13:27.481 --> 02:13:27.721
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4219
02:13:27.721 --> 02:13:29.100
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like psychedelic,</v>

4220
02:13:29.250 --> 02:13:30.680
<v Speaker 1>like you walk into those forests,</v>

4221
02:13:30.690 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 1>it's almost the whole world changes and when you're in there,</v>

4222
02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:38.130
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be in another dementia.</v>

4223
02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4224
02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:43.910
<v Speaker 1>It's so not the human world and you walk in and every hour or so you'll find</v>

4225
02:13:45.961 --> 02:13:48.420
<v Speaker 1>some shit on the ground that a person left behind,</v>

4226
02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>but you're on.</v>

4227
02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Once you're cutting one path,</v>

4228
02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:55.200
<v Speaker 1>how much are you dealing with around you that you never see?</v>

4229
02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 1>If you lived up there in the Pacific northwest for the rest of your natural life</v>

4230
02:13:59.761 --> 02:14:02.400
<v Speaker 1>and just every day you just crossed a,</v>

4231
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:07.320
<v Speaker 1>a certain area off your list and just walked up and down and up and down and you</v>

4232
02:14:07.321 --> 02:14:08.160
<v Speaker 1>made a grid,</v>

4233
02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:09.040
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4234
02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die before you ever see true.</v>

4235
02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Even a tiny fraction of the woods that are around you.</v>

4236
02:14:16.170 --> 02:14:18.210
<v Speaker 5>And even with all the logging going on up there,</v>

4237
02:14:18.211 --> 02:14:21.300
<v Speaker 5>it's not happening in every single part of that area.</v>

4238
02:14:21.301 --> 02:14:21.820
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

4239
02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:22.421
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

4240
02:14:22.421 --> 02:14:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'd want to make the argument for us and intelligent animal being able</v>

4241
02:14:25.211 --> 02:14:26.044
<v Speaker 1>to avoid you.</v>

4242
02:14:26.410 --> 02:14:30.160
<v Speaker 1>How much easier is it to know you're there then when you're chopping fucking</v>

4243
02:14:30.161 --> 02:14:32.220
<v Speaker 1>trees down with a saw that go,</v>

4244
02:14:32.221 --> 02:14:33.054
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4245
02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening for elk SnapID twigs.</v>

4246
02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:39.031
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4247
02:14:39.031 --> 02:14:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And I hear a fucking saw and I smelled that stinky fuel burning.</v>

4248
02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:43.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4249
02:14:43.770 --> 02:14:43.970
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4250
02:14:43.970 --> 02:14:44.181
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

4251
02:14:44.181 --> 02:14:44.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4252
02:14:44.450 --> 02:14:47.300
<v Speaker 5>if a gorilla for whatever reason,</v>

4253
02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:49.700
<v Speaker 5>got pushed out of a van in the middle of Brooklyn,</v>

4254
02:14:50.450 --> 02:14:53.900
<v Speaker 5>it would stick out in the most profound way.</v>

4255
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:58.490
<v Speaker 5>It would within four seconds around the entire world will be videos of a gorilla</v>

4256
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:59.383
<v Speaker 5>in Brooklyn.</v>

4257
02:14:59.510 --> 02:15:04.510
<v Speaker 5>And the same way a human wandering through the Pacific northwest with our stinky</v>

4258
02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:10.540
<v Speaker 5>perfumes and deodorants on smelling of the cheese burger you just ate before.</v>

4259
02:15:10.551 --> 02:15:11.360
<v Speaker 5>You're weird,</v>

4260
02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:12.680
<v Speaker 5>impotent little hike,</v>

4261
02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:13.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4262
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:15.080
<v Speaker 5>two miles into the wilderness,</v>

4263
02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:17.150
<v Speaker 5>that would be so easy to avoid.</v>

4264
02:15:17.151 --> 02:15:18.920
<v Speaker 5>Creatures can already avoid us.</v>

4265
02:15:19.070 --> 02:15:19.750
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>

4266
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Cotton root beer farts.</v>

4267
02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4268
02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:23.260
<v Speaker 1>we're in doctor Scholls.</v>

4269
02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Bud Light in your backpack.</v>

4270
02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Old Spice on your stupid armpits.</v>

4271
02:15:27.221 --> 02:15:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4272
02:15:27.930 --> 02:15:28.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4273
02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:31.440
<v Speaker 5>This think of your tumor is coming out of your mouth.</v>

4274
02:15:31.530 --> 02:15:36.000
<v Speaker 1>They smell that stupid fluoride toothpaste you wash your face with.</v>

4275
02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.370
<v Speaker 5>So it'd be so we would,</v>

4276
02:15:37.371 --> 02:15:40.040
<v Speaker 5>we stick out like a sore thumb in that,</v>

4277
02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:41.000
<v Speaker 5>in that terrain,</v>

4278
02:15:41.001 --> 02:15:42.170
<v Speaker 5>even though our ancestors,</v>

4279
02:15:42.171 --> 02:15:43.220
<v Speaker 5>that's what we used to live in.</v>

4280
02:15:43.221 --> 02:15:44.210
<v Speaker 5>We were born into that.</v>

4281
02:15:44.211 --> 02:15:46.730
<v Speaker 5>It used to be where we were born into that wilderness.</v>

4282
02:15:46.731 --> 02:15:50.060
<v Speaker 5>And there's something that happens when you go out there under that wildness</v>

4283
02:15:50.061 --> 02:15:53.450
<v Speaker 5>where some mild little shift happens to you.</v>

4284
02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:53.811
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4285
02:15:53.811 --> 02:15:57.410
<v Speaker 5>there is something that happens in another part of your mind begins to activate</v>

4286
02:15:57.411 --> 02:15:58.221
<v Speaker 5>when you're out there.</v>

4287
02:15:58.221 --> 02:16:02.510
<v Speaker 5>And I think that part of your mind that activates is the part of the mind that</v>

4288
02:16:02.511 --> 02:16:05.810
<v Speaker 5>Sasquatch hunters use when they hallucinate.</v>

4289
02:16:05.811 --> 02:16:06.680
<v Speaker 5>They're imaginary.</v>

4290
02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:08.203
<v Speaker 5>They see,</v>

4291
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4292
02:16:10.791 --> 02:16:13.400
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately that might be actually what's happening.</v>

4293
02:16:13.670 --> 02:16:14.211
<v Speaker 1>That's what's,</v>

4294
02:16:14.211 --> 02:16:14.541
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

4295
02:16:14.541 --> 02:16:14.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4296
02:16:14.810 --> 02:16:19.810
<v Speaker 1>that's what's the most messy part of this situation is that you can't pick a</v>

4297
02:16:20.751 --> 02:16:21.584
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

4298
02:16:22.070 --> 02:16:25.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be the guy that says no Sasquatch.</v>

4299
02:16:25.221 --> 02:16:27.260
<v Speaker 1>You guys are silly because that guy's a dick.</v>

4300
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4301
02:16:27.770 --> 02:16:28.161
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4302
02:16:28.161 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to be the guy that goes</v>

4303
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:30.940
<v Speaker 6>all Sasquatch,</v>

4304
02:16:30.941 --> 02:16:35.260
<v Speaker 6>bigfoot research centers of America and gets it tattooed on your ass either</v>

4305
02:16:35.530 --> 02:16:36.970
<v Speaker 6>because that guy's a dick as well.</v>

4306
02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be a guy squatting.</v>

4307
02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:45.070
<v Speaker 6>What does squatch what is,</v>

4308
02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:45.701
<v Speaker 6>what'd you say?</v>

4309
02:16:45.701 --> 02:16:47.250
<v Speaker 6>Squatch was again when we were out there.</v>

4310
02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:50.800
<v Speaker 6>Watch is then a name for the uh,</v>

4311
02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:55.830
<v Speaker 6>dried semen that accrues and the hair and the beard hair truckers.</v>

4312
02:16:56.101 --> 02:17:01.101
<v Speaker 6>You've been hanging out at truck stop glory holes called squad.</v>

4313
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:03.470
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4314
02:17:03.470 --> 02:17:04.303
<v Speaker 6>I shit.</v>

4315
02:17:04.610 --> 02:17:06.640
<v Speaker 6>And then you got some squats and your beer brother.</v>

4316
02:17:06.641 --> 02:17:10.570
<v Speaker 6>He's the reason why the hardcore homos at truck stops only on mustaches.</v>

4317
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:13.550
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4318
02:17:13.550 --> 02:17:16.030
<v Speaker 6>Because we all know the hardcore gay dudes.</v>

4319
02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:18.370
<v Speaker 6>There's like three types of people that have mustaches.</v>

4320
02:17:18.371 --> 02:17:18.941
<v Speaker 6>Mexicans,</v>

4321
02:17:18.941 --> 02:17:21.270
<v Speaker 6>John Stossel and hardcore gay dude inhaler.</v>

4322
02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:25.780
<v Speaker 6>The kind of hardcore gay dudes that were like leather biker hats and like cutoff</v>

4323
02:17:25.781 --> 02:17:27.370
<v Speaker 6>Jean shorts with Timberland's.</v>

4324
02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:28.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4325
02:17:28.690 --> 02:17:29.523
<v Speaker 6>Hardcore,</v>

4326
02:17:30.090 --> 02:17:30.923
<v Speaker 6>hardcore,</v>

4327
02:17:33.330 --> 02:17:34.320
<v Speaker 6>thick pasty.</v>

4328
02:17:34.330 --> 02:17:37.780
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to avoid squash and they don't want to deal with Washington squat</v>

4329
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.680
<v Speaker 6>beard.</v>

4330
02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:43.060
<v Speaker 6>It's annoying clumps up and it smells like dried bleach,</v>

4331
02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:44.141
<v Speaker 6>burnt rubber.</v>

4332
02:17:44.141 --> 02:17:45.100
<v Speaker 6>When you wash it out.</v>

4333
02:17:45.101 --> 02:17:48.130
<v Speaker 6>Greg Fitzsimmons goes on stage in San Francisco where we're doing San Francisco</v>

4334
02:17:48.131 --> 02:17:48.964
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

4335
02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:50.260
<v Speaker 6>He goes on stage and he goes,</v>

4336
02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:52.210
<v Speaker 6>you know what I love about San Francisco?</v>

4337
02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:54.830
<v Speaker 6>He's still have real faggots.</v>

4338
02:17:55.380 --> 02:18:00.380
<v Speaker 6>I think it was real guys with like Jean leather vest on but and cutoff Jean</v>

4339
02:18:03.131 --> 02:18:05.230
<v Speaker 6>shorts and that's hilarious.</v>

4340
02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:08.770
<v Speaker 6>Like the Blue Oyster bar and police academy,</v>

4341
02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:10.600
<v Speaker 6>there was a lot of gay people in the crowd too.</v>

4342
02:18:10.810 --> 02:18:11.461
<v Speaker 6>And they,</v>

4343
02:18:11.461 --> 02:18:12.370
<v Speaker 6>they loved it.</v>

4344
02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:13.360
<v Speaker 6>They were cheering,</v>

4345
02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:14.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4346
02:18:14.110 --> 02:18:14.470
<v Speaker 6>and that,</v>

4347
02:18:14.470 --> 02:18:18.220
<v Speaker 6>that kind of stuff drives me crazy because on paper or if you put that on the</v>

4348
02:18:18.221 --> 02:18:18.760
<v Speaker 6>Internet,</v>

4349
02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:19.990
<v Speaker 6>people can get mad at him.</v>

4350
02:18:20.290 --> 02:18:20.491
<v Speaker 6>He could.</v>

4351
02:18:20.491 --> 02:18:20.670
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

4352
02:18:20.670 --> 02:18:24.430
<v Speaker 6>but Greg Fitzsimmons is like one of the least homophobic guys you will ever meet</v>

4353
02:18:24.431 --> 02:18:25.000
<v Speaker 6>in your life.</v>

4354
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.570
<v Speaker 6>Like he has a great story about wanting to find out whether or not he was in the</v>

4355
02:18:28.571 --> 02:18:29.920
<v Speaker 6>gay sex when he was young.</v>

4356
02:18:30.010 --> 02:18:35.010
<v Speaker 6>So he like got drunk and got up his courage and then like found a guy and his</v>

4357
02:18:35.081 --> 02:18:38.740
<v Speaker 6>gay area that he knew and went to the woods with them and then fucking panicked</v>

4358
02:18:38.741 --> 02:18:39.574
<v Speaker 6>and ran away.</v>

4359
02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:40.070
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

4360
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.903
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

4361
02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:45.040
<v Speaker 6>but like he's not even remotely homophobic.</v>

4362
02:18:45.041 --> 02:18:46.690
<v Speaker 6>Like he's not afraid of telling that story.</v>

4363
02:18:46.691 --> 02:18:47.890
<v Speaker 6>He's not homophobic at all.</v>

4364
02:18:48.010 --> 02:18:50.050
<v Speaker 6>So when he goes up there and says,</v>

4365
02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:53.680
<v Speaker 6>I love San Francisco is still has a lot of faggots.</v>

4366
02:18:53.710 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4367
02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:54.850
<v Speaker 6>And like they,</v>

4368
02:18:54.850 --> 02:18:56.410
<v Speaker 6>they like were clapping.</v>

4369
02:18:56.590 --> 02:19:00.430
<v Speaker 6>I saw a gay couple that were like going there,</v>

4370
02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:01.780
<v Speaker 6>cause he was saying it was,</v>

4371
02:19:01.810 --> 02:19:02.600
<v Speaker 6>it was in,</v>

4372
02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:04.450
<v Speaker 6>within coming from anger or fear.</v>

4373
02:19:04.451 --> 02:19:08.320
<v Speaker 6>It's coming from an accurate assessment of San Francisco.</v>

4374
02:19:08.321 --> 02:19:09.154
<v Speaker 6>And that's fine.</v>

4375
02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:10.023
<v Speaker 6>It's not a,</v>

4376
02:19:10.030 --> 02:19:11.680
<v Speaker 6>it's not a black or white issue.</v>

4377
02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:12.370
<v Speaker 6>Not to Hertz.</v>

4378
02:19:12.370 --> 02:19:12.760
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

4379
02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:13.001
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

4380
02:19:13.001 --> 02:19:13.300
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4381
02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:16.480
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of shit going on when you say that word because a lot of shit,</v>

4382
02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:18.010
<v Speaker 6>you can say it in a beautiful way.</v>

4383
02:19:18.130 --> 02:19:22.870
<v Speaker 6>And the way he was saying it was describing a wild looseness and an acceptance</v>

4384
02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:26.860
<v Speaker 6>of homosexuality in San Francisco that allows men to be really flamboyant.</v>

4385
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:27.783
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4386
02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:28.790
<v Speaker 6>that's a good thing.</v>

4387
02:19:28.850 --> 02:19:29.270
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

4388
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:30.170
<v Speaker 6>That's a good thing.</v>

4389
02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:31.880
<v Speaker 6>So what he was saying was a good thing,</v>

4390
02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:35.870
<v Speaker 6>but that's what's pissing me off about this current state of like criticizing</v>

4391
02:19:35.871 --> 02:19:38.720
<v Speaker 6>standup comedy is if it's a statement,</v>

4392
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:40.310
<v Speaker 6>these are not statements.</v>

4393
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:41.990
<v Speaker 6>We're saying we're saying wacky shit,</v>

4394
02:19:42.170 --> 02:19:43.003
<v Speaker 6>we're just talking.</v>

4395
02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:45.710
<v Speaker 6>What makes the thing offensive is the energy behind it.</v>

4396
02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:49.910
<v Speaker 6>When you hear a fundamentalist right wing Christian,</v>

4397
02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:51.740
<v Speaker 6>say homosexual,</v>

4398
02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:54.260
<v Speaker 6>it's the same way as when you hear a Nazi,</v>

4399
02:19:54.261 --> 02:19:55.520
<v Speaker 6>say the word Jew,</v>

4400
02:19:55.521 --> 02:19:58.580
<v Speaker 6>it comes out in this like sizzling.</v>

4401
02:19:58.760 --> 02:19:59.240
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

4402
02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:00.350
<v Speaker 6>it's the sound of like,</v>

4403
02:20:00.351 --> 02:20:00.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4404
02:20:00.591 --> 02:20:05.150
<v Speaker 6>and the alien when they kill the alien and that acid drips through the metal,</v>

4405
02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:06.290
<v Speaker 6>it's that same,</v>

4406
02:20:06.470 --> 02:20:10.910
<v Speaker 6>just vile is dripping hate homeless.</v>

4407
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:14.390
<v Speaker 6>It's like all the hate inside.</v>

4408
02:20:14.391 --> 02:20:18.710
<v Speaker 6>That person is coming through the window of the word homosexual and that's</v>

4409
02:20:18.711 --> 02:20:19.430
<v Speaker 6>offensive.</v>

4410
02:20:19.430 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 6>But when Greg Fitzsimmons says Faggot,</v>

4411
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:24.830
<v Speaker 6>that's like somebody throwing glitter in front of a disco ball.</v>

4412
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:28.760
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing dangerous or angry or pissed off as sweet.</v>

4413
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.260
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing bad about it.</v>

4414
02:20:30.261 --> 02:20:31.580
<v Speaker 6>And isn't it funny that when,</v>

4415
02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:34.670
<v Speaker 6>this is something that took a while for humans to figure out,</v>

4416
02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:39.440
<v Speaker 6>but now there is a knee jerk reaction that when someone rallies against</v>

4417
02:20:39.441 --> 02:20:44.360
<v Speaker 6>homosexuals is angry about homosexuals as fighting off homosexuals.</v>

4418
02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:47.480
<v Speaker 6>They're most likely k 100% k most likely gay.</v>

4419
02:20:47.550 --> 02:20:49.730
<v Speaker 6>Just so when did people figure that out?</v>

4420
02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:54.680
<v Speaker 6>Was it 1980 I don't know how it even happened.</v>

4421
02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:56.750
<v Speaker 6>I think that's way more recent that people want to admit.</v>

4422
02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:00.470
<v Speaker 6>I think the idea like was really crystallized with Ted Haggard.</v>

4423
02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:01.880
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

4424
02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:06.170
<v Speaker 6>When that guy got busted in his gay prostitute friend who likes to do math with,</v>

4425
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:07.430
<v Speaker 6>went on CNN and was like,</v>

4426
02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:08.313
<v Speaker 6>that guy's crazy.</v>

4427
02:21:08.490 --> 02:21:09.323
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4428
02:21:09.970 --> 02:21:11.360
<v Speaker 6>I might be a gay prostitute.</v>

4429
02:21:11.361 --> 02:21:12.560
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't mess with my clients,</v>

4430
02:21:12.561 --> 02:21:16.220
<v Speaker 6>but this guy's fucked up mind guys,</v>

4431
02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:18.680
<v Speaker 6>this guy's out there fucking making mistakes.</v>

4432
02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:19.490
<v Speaker 6>The weight,</v>

4433
02:21:19.490 --> 02:21:22.970
<v Speaker 6>the weight Christians come out of the closet is they say they hate gay people.</v>

4434
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:25.280
<v Speaker 6>That's how you know you're gay.</v>

4435
02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:30.170
<v Speaker 6>If you ever ever hear a Christian talk about how bad it is to be a homosexual,</v>

4436
02:21:30.171 --> 02:21:31.520
<v Speaker 6>it's 100% you're like,</v>

4437
02:21:31.521 --> 02:21:32.750
<v Speaker 6>you poor bastard.</v>

4438
02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:34.190
<v Speaker 6>Just do it.</v>

4439
02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:35.070
<v Speaker 6>True,</v>

4440
02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:35.903
<v Speaker 6>true.</v>

4441
02:21:35.970 --> 02:21:36.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4442
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:37.460
<v Speaker 6>And who cares?</v>

4443
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:38.670
<v Speaker 6>It's like the what?</v>

4444
02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:41.690
<v Speaker 6>What's good about being gay is you get to find out who's an idiot around you.</v>

4445
02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 6>If you came out and you were gay and some people got upset at you,</v>

4446
02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:45.920
<v Speaker 6>great.</v>

4447
02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:47.420
<v Speaker 6>You found the idiots in your neighborhood.</v>

4448
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:47.661
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4449
02:21:47.661 --> 02:21:48.790
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately for a lot of people,</v>

4450
02:21:48.791 --> 02:21:49.970
<v Speaker 6>if their fucking parents,</v>

4451
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.983
<v Speaker 6>I mean when you,</v>

4452
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:55.460
<v Speaker 6>when you look at when they post letters on reddit where like people come out of</v>

4453
02:21:55.461 --> 02:21:59.180
<v Speaker 6>the closet and their parents write letters saying you have to leave the house</v>

4454
02:21:59.181 --> 02:22:00.410
<v Speaker 6>and will never talk to you again.</v>

4455
02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:01.280
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

4456
02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:01.610
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4457
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:02.750
<v Speaker 6>they got off light man.</v>

4458
02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:03.611
<v Speaker 6>If they had good friends,</v>

4459
02:22:03.611 --> 02:22:04.221
<v Speaker 6>they got off light.</v>

4460
02:22:04.221 --> 02:22:05.054
<v Speaker 6>I swear to God.</v>

4461
02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:07.100
<v Speaker 6>If my parents would like that and I was gay,</v>

4462
02:22:07.101 --> 02:22:08.450
<v Speaker 6>I swear to got to be happy.</v>

4463
02:22:08.810 --> 02:22:09.730
<v Speaker 6>Now tonight,</v>

4464
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.670
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4465
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:15.670
<v Speaker 6>2013 at 45 you mean you escape from using with mass holes in a certain point in</v>

4466
02:22:16.671 --> 02:22:17.091
<v Speaker 6>your life,</v>

4467
02:22:17.091 --> 02:22:19.790
<v Speaker 6>you have to realize that your family is not just what you were born with,</v>

4468
02:22:19.791 --> 02:22:20.050
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

4469
02:22:20.050 --> 02:22:21.250
<v Speaker 6>It's also what you accept,</v>

4470
02:22:21.370 --> 02:22:23.690
<v Speaker 6>what you bring into your world and what you create when you,</v>

4471
02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:24.060
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4472
02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:25.350
<v Speaker 6>When you're 14 right?</v>

4473
02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 6>Of course and</v>

4474
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.670
<v Speaker 4>your worst.</v>

4475
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:28.650
<v Speaker 4>Think about just just think of the reverse.</v>

4476
02:22:28.651 --> 02:22:32.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like if when I was 15 and I knew that,</v>

4477
02:22:32.250 --> 02:22:37.250
<v Speaker 4>I told my parents that I loved going down on this veiny albino and,</v>

4478
02:22:38.470 --> 02:22:39.180
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

4479
02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I would like to thank that.</v>

4480
02:22:40.341 --> 02:22:41.180
<v Speaker 2>If you are my son,</v>

4481
02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I could work through that with you.</v>

4482
02:22:43.370 --> 02:22:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I would like to tell you that listen,</v>

4483
02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:47.180
<v Speaker 2>there's no perfection to this life.</v>

4484
02:22:47.181 --> 02:22:49.880
<v Speaker 2>And there's the beautiful thing about life is it everybody likes something</v>

4485
02:22:49.881 --> 02:22:50.510
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

4486
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.931
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4487
02:22:50.931 --> 02:22:51.980
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody is different.</v>

4488
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Some people have blue eyes,</v>

4489
02:22:53.181 --> 02:22:53.951
<v Speaker 2>some people love to suck.</v>

4490
02:22:53.951 --> 02:22:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Cock.</v>

4491
02:22:54.490 --> 02:22:54.860
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4492
02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:56.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying sucking cock.</v>

4493
02:22:56.031 --> 02:22:56.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking,</v>

4494
02:22:56.490 --> 02:23:01.400
<v Speaker 4>imagine if you as a child knew that talking about you,</v>

4495
02:23:01.730 --> 02:23:06.200
<v Speaker 4>telling your parents that you like licking pussy would get you thrown out of</v>

4496
02:23:06.201 --> 02:23:07.040
<v Speaker 4>your house.</v>

4497
02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:09.680
<v Speaker 4>Imagine the horror of that.</v>

4498
02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:11.390
<v Speaker 4>Like your entire sex drive.</v>

4499
02:23:11.391 --> 02:23:11.750
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

4500
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:13.550
<v Speaker 4>In a teenager you,</v>

4501
02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:16.880
<v Speaker 4>your sex drive is like you have sclerosis explosive.</v>

4502
02:23:16.881 --> 02:23:17.714
<v Speaker 4>And to know that,</v>

4503
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:22.460
<v Speaker 4>revealing that that Makin revealing that mechanism to your parents could</v>

4504
02:23:22.461 --> 02:23:24.350
<v Speaker 4>actually get you banished from,</v>

4505
02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:25.670
<v Speaker 4>could make you homeless.</v>

4506
02:23:25.860 --> 02:23:28.080
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying when you're 14 that's fun.</v>

4507
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:28.711
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

4508
02:23:28.711 --> 02:23:30.030
<v Speaker 2>But you know what the real problem is?</v>

4509
02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Human beings have isolated themselves into these much,</v>

4510
02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:38.271
<v Speaker 2>much more small and more segregated communities.</v>

4511
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.110
<v Speaker 2>And we call them families,</v>

4512
02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:40.501
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4513
02:23:40.501 --> 02:23:43.260
<v Speaker 2>And we know we're not in a community anymore that has a hundred people in it.</v>

4514
02:23:43.261 --> 02:23:44.870
<v Speaker 2>We're all going hunting together and,</v>

4515
02:23:45.010 --> 02:23:45.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4516
02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:47.430
<v Speaker 2>and sharing festivities were on the fire.</v>

4517
02:23:47.850 --> 02:23:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Now we're in these communities where we have tribes of like a very small group</v>

4518
02:23:51.001 --> 02:23:51.960
<v Speaker 2>at four or five people.</v>

4519
02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:52.440
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4520
02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:52.651
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4521
02:23:52.651 --> 02:23:53.580
<v Speaker 2>my tribe is a,</v>

4522
02:23:53.581 --> 02:23:54.570
<v Speaker 2>I have three daughters in May.</v>

4523
02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:55.433
<v Speaker 2>That's my tribe,</v>

4524
02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:55.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4525
02:23:55.741 --> 02:23:59.310
<v Speaker 2>and I have friends who I allow into my camp occasionally and we break bread and</v>

4526
02:23:59.311 --> 02:24:00.990
<v Speaker 2>then they go back to their tents and that's it.</v>

4527
02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:01.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4528
02:24:01.221 --> 02:24:03.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's the reality of modern man.</v>

4529
02:24:03.570 --> 02:24:04.403
<v Speaker 2>The old days,</v>

4530
02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:05.491
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4531
02:24:05.491 --> 02:24:07.380
<v Speaker 2>tribes up together and they got,</v>

4532
02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:07.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4533
02:24:07.741 --> 02:24:08.071
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

4534
02:24:08.071 --> 02:24:11.510
<v Speaker 2>60 people and they got together and they all knew everybody and they,</v>

4535
02:24:11.511 --> 02:24:11.810
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4536
02:24:11.810 --> 02:24:16.810
<v Speaker 2>they existed in these communities where they all shared hunting duties and</v>

4537
02:24:16.951 --> 02:24:19.080
<v Speaker 2>cleaning duties and parental duties.</v>

4538
02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:21.810
<v Speaker 2>And that was how people lived a long time ago.</v>

4539
02:24:21.811 --> 02:24:25.320
<v Speaker 2>What were we really fucked up as we removed accountability,</v>

4540
02:24:25.650 --> 02:24:27.570
<v Speaker 2>when we stopped being communal,</v>

4541
02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:29.700
<v Speaker 2>we stopped being communal in our child rearing.</v>

4542
02:24:29.701 --> 02:24:31.320
<v Speaker 2>We stopped being communal in our,</v>

4543
02:24:31.321 --> 02:24:32.580
<v Speaker 2>our our relationships.</v>

4544
02:24:32.650 --> 02:24:33.483
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4545
02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:38.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's where like bitch behavior comes from to when you got a guy who like</v>

4546
02:24:38.891 --> 02:24:43.891
<v Speaker 2>starts texting your wife or your girlfriend or you know a girl you're dating and</v>

4547
02:24:44.850 --> 02:24:46.590
<v Speaker 2>says like stupid shit about you.</v>

4548
02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Like that's supposed to all be done.</v>

4549
02:24:48.331 --> 02:24:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Like out in the open.</v>

4550
02:24:49.470 --> 02:24:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4551
02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:53.040
<v Speaker 2>When a guy starts sneaking around on Facebook and saying mean shit about you to</v>

4552
02:24:53.050 --> 02:24:53.520
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

4553
02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:54.353
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing?</v>

4554
02:24:54.450 --> 02:24:55.890
<v Speaker 2>He's revealing his wheat genetics.</v>

4555
02:24:55.891 --> 02:24:56.700
<v Speaker 2>He's a loser.</v>

4556
02:24:56.700 --> 02:24:59.100
<v Speaker 2>The guy's a bitch and the girl will never respect him.</v>

4557
02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:00.000
<v Speaker 2>What he's doing,</v>

4558
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:00.241
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4559
02:25:00.241 --> 02:25:00.600
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

4560
02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:01.470
<v Speaker 2>she knows what he's doing.</v>

4561
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:02.700
<v Speaker 2>She knows he's being like,</v>

4562
02:25:02.701 --> 02:25:04.800
<v Speaker 2>we can see creepy and Shitty,</v>

4563
02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:07.010
<v Speaker 2>but they think we'll just turn to tell you that goes,</v>

4564
02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:07.950
<v Speaker 2>doesn't appreciate you.</v>

4565
02:25:08.250 --> 02:25:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I know he does where he is with you.</v>

4566
02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:13.920
<v Speaker 2>I see that you're hurting on the inside and then just want to look totally</v>

4567
02:25:13.921 --> 02:25:14.754
<v Speaker 2>platonic.</v>

4568
02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I am your friend.</v>

4569
02:25:15.931 --> 02:25:16.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4570
02:25:16.351 --> 02:25:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4571
02:25:16.750 --> 02:25:17.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4572
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you're very beautiful and I would be honored if you ever be with me,</v>

4573
02:25:20.011 --> 02:25:23.130
<v Speaker 2>but I know you're known to be so friends.</v>

4574
02:25:23.350 --> 02:25:24.670
<v Speaker 2>This guy's an asshole.</v>

4575
02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Why does that Guy Exist?</v>

4576
02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Because you can't go hunting with them.</v>

4577
02:25:27.101 --> 02:25:30.820
<v Speaker 2>And woopsie got hit by our streets beer book now that he's supposed to take that</v>

4578
02:25:30.821 --> 02:25:31.591
<v Speaker 2>guy with you on,</v>

4579
02:25:31.591 --> 02:25:31.820
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

4580
02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:33.430
<v Speaker 2>the manly duties and throw him in a lake,</v>

4581
02:25:33.431 --> 02:25:36.390
<v Speaker 2>some white sand pits made for that type of human.</v>

4582
02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:40.030
<v Speaker 2>That type of behavior is not supposed to be fostered to the point where he's,</v>

4583
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.281
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4584
02:25:40.281 --> 02:25:42.370
<v Speaker 2>a member of society,</v>

4585
02:25:42.371 --> 02:25:43.660
<v Speaker 2>a trusted member of society.</v>

4586
02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:45.460
<v Speaker 2>But oftentimes in communities,</v>

4587
02:25:45.610 --> 02:25:47.350
<v Speaker 2>people deal with deceptive,</v>

4588
02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:48.910
<v Speaker 2>like traders,</v>

4589
02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:52.390
<v Speaker 2>traders of their friendship traders of there because we've separated,</v>

4590
02:25:52.391 --> 02:25:53.860
<v Speaker 2>we've removed accountability.</v>

4591
02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:58.090
<v Speaker 2>You can shut your door and lock it and just send the country email and everybody</v>

4592
02:25:58.091 --> 02:26:01.060
<v Speaker 2>has removed themselves from this process of,</v>

4593
02:26:01.630 --> 02:26:02.360
<v Speaker 2>of community.</v>

4594
02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:02.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4595
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:03.080
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4596
02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:03.500
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

4597
02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:05.210
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing how are,</v>

4598
02:26:05.570 --> 02:26:05.930
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

4599
02:26:05.930 --> 02:26:08.600
<v Speaker 4>how bad that is for our continued evolution.</v>

4600
02:26:08.601 --> 02:26:09.920
<v Speaker 4>The fact that people like that,</v>

4601
02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:11.053
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4602
02:26:11.890 --> 02:26:14.780
<v Speaker 4>have any kind of impact at all is pretty horrific.</v>

4603
02:26:14.810 --> 02:26:16.940
<v Speaker 4>And that's where Avatar depression comes in</v>

4604
02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:21.370
<v Speaker 2>cause it shit doesn't exist in Avatar and it doesn't exist in the squash</v>

4605
02:26:21.371 --> 02:26:22.180
<v Speaker 2>community either.</v>

4606
02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4607
02:26:22.390 --> 02:26:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any bitch squashes.</v>

4608
02:26:24.490 --> 02:26:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I think squash is in my mind.</v>

4609
02:26:26.170 --> 02:26:26.411
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4610
02:26:26.411 --> 02:26:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not the real in my world squashes are noble,</v>

4611
02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:30.610
<v Speaker 2>they're very smart.</v>

4612
02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:32.380
<v Speaker 2>They run after elk and they check them.</v>

4613
02:26:32.410 --> 02:26:33.340
<v Speaker 2>They probably choke them.</v>

4614
02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:34.990
<v Speaker 2>They'd probably get a good strong rear naked.</v>

4615
02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:35.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4616
02:26:35.261 --> 02:26:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably just break their necks.</v>

4617
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4618
02:26:36.900 --> 02:26:37.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4619
02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Alex probably made out of Styrofoam compared to a squat</v>

4620
02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:41.560
<v Speaker 4>when we went squashing one of those guys said,</v>

4621
02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:43.270
<v Speaker 4>I liked what you said that because it is true.</v>

4622
02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:44.680
<v Speaker 4>When we went squatting,</v>

4623
02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:45.760
<v Speaker 4>when we thought we went through,</v>

4624
02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.060
<v Speaker 4>a few people can say that we went squashing and I remember one of the,</v>

4625
02:26:49.061 --> 02:26:53.170
<v Speaker 4>I clearly remember one of our fellows squashers our teachers squatters.</v>

4626
02:26:53.350 --> 02:26:58.350
<v Speaker 4>They said that the way the Sasquatch hunts is it breaks the leg of the elk and</v>

4627
02:26:58.661 --> 02:27:00.670
<v Speaker 4>then after snapping it's leg,</v>

4628
02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:01.930
<v Speaker 4>that's when it kills it.</v>

4629
02:27:01.931 --> 02:27:03.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why it doesn't kill it all at once,</v>

4630
02:27:03.551 --> 02:27:04.241
<v Speaker 4>but it grabs,</v>

4631
02:27:04.241 --> 02:27:08.320
<v Speaker 4>it breaks its leg and then lets it kind of pull itself through the wilderness</v>

4632
02:27:08.321 --> 02:27:09.220
<v Speaker 4>and then eats it.</v>

4633
02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:11.770
<v Speaker 4>That's the way the noble Sasquatch hunts.</v>

4634
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:16.270
<v Speaker 4>It also can turn into a bird and it also can sound like a leaf blower.</v>

4635
02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I can also tell you that that gentleman,</v>

4636
02:27:18.491 --> 02:27:21.580
<v Speaker 2>the same gentleman that told you that story also told me that one time he was in</v>

4637
02:27:21.581 --> 02:27:23.920
<v Speaker 2>front of a blackberry Bush and he heard a frog.</v>

4638
02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:24.731
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

4639
02:27:24.731 --> 02:27:25.090
<v Speaker 2>read it,</v>

4640
02:27:25.090 --> 02:27:25.541
<v Speaker 2>read it,</v>

4641
02:27:25.541 --> 02:27:26.200
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

4642
02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:30.040
<v Speaker 2>now why would a frog behind in a blackberry Bush?</v>

4643
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.431
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

4644
02:27:30.431 --> 02:27:31.530
<v Speaker 2>you know what I thought about?</v>

4645
02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:31.871
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4646
02:27:31.871 --> 02:27:33.040
<v Speaker 2>that's probably a big foot.</v>

4647
02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4648
02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:34.150
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

4649
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:35.710
<v Speaker 2>So just say no.</v>

4650
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:36.783
<v Speaker 2>Same Guy.</v>

4651
02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:37.781
<v Speaker 2>I came,</v>

4652
02:27:37.781 --> 02:27:37.991
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

4653
02:27:37.991 --> 02:27:41.290
<v Speaker 2>there's some critical thinking right there that it should be in the CIA.</v>

4654
02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

4655
02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Hear a frog.</v>

4656
02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:47.620
<v Speaker 2>It's near a blackberry.</v>

4657
02:27:47.621 --> 02:27:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Bush must be an undiscovered primate of enormous proportions.</v>

4658
02:27:54.850 --> 02:27:55.511
<v Speaker 2>Fucking shit.</v>

4659
02:27:55.511 --> 02:27:56.260
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>

4660
02:27:56.260 --> 02:27:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a crazy frog.</v>

4661
02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a frog.</v>

4662
02:27:58.961 --> 02:27:59.281
<v Speaker 2>That eight,</v>

4663
02:27:59.281 --> 02:28:01.870
<v Speaker 2>a psychedelic mushroom doesn't know what the fuck is going on.</v>

4664
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:03.580
<v Speaker 2>He's hiding in bushes.</v>

4665
02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:04.900
<v Speaker 2>He can't even eat berries.</v>

4666
02:28:04.901 --> 02:28:06.160
<v Speaker 2>He's lying on his back.</v>

4667
02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:06.860
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

4668
02:28:06.860 --> 02:28:07.480
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

4669
02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:12.480
<v Speaker 2>he's flying on a rainbow glitter all the way to Jupiter that he's a frog and</v>

4670
02:28:14.231 --> 02:28:18.340
<v Speaker 2>he's understanding space travel for the first time and he knows that he's got a</v>

4671
02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:20.500
<v Speaker 2>couple minutes to go before the silicide and leaves the system and then it</v>

4672
02:28:20.501 --> 02:28:21.291
<v Speaker 2>becomes a frog again.</v>

4673
02:28:21.291 --> 02:28:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Just what's around flies.</v>

4674
02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Can I make one point real quick about this?</v>

4675
02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I think squashing is the hiking what renaissance fairs are to parks.</v>

4676
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:34.020
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4677
02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:34.670
<v Speaker 1>it's I,</v>

4678
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:35.503
<v Speaker 1>how do I say that better?</v>

4679
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4680
02:28:35.690 --> 02:28:35.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4681
02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:36.370
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4682
02:28:36.370 --> 02:28:39.350
<v Speaker 1>I just watch watching in history to history.</v>

4683
02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I think squashing is to hiking what renaissance fairs are to history.</v>

4684
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a way to turn hiking into this exciting play time,</v>

4685
02:28:50.271 --> 02:28:51.104
<v Speaker 1>play time.</v>

4686
02:28:51.350 --> 02:28:52.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

4687
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is as that you totally right.</v>

4688
02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I think you're totally right.</v>

4689
02:28:56.620 --> 02:28:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And I met with a guy named Scott Nelson and he's a crypto linguist.</v>

4690
02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:00.681
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

4691
02:29:00.681 --> 02:29:05.681
<v Speaker 1>he worked for the US Navy for almost 20 years to ciphering languages and he</v>

4692
02:29:06.891 --> 02:29:09.140
<v Speaker 1>played me some authentic,</v>

4693
02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing air quotes.</v>

4694
02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4695
02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Authentic,</v>

4696
02:29:12.890 --> 02:29:15.880
<v Speaker 1>big foot language and I want to play it for you because it's,</v>

4697
02:29:15.881 --> 02:29:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fascinating stuff.</v>

4698
02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:18.313
<v Speaker 1>He played me,</v>

4699
02:29:18.380 --> 02:29:19.820
<v Speaker 1>this is what's disturbing though.</v>

4700
02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:22.940
<v Speaker 1>He played me two very different recordings.</v>

4701
02:29:23.210 --> 02:29:26.390
<v Speaker 1>One of them sounded like total dog shit and I listened to it.</v>

4702
02:29:26.391 --> 02:29:26.691
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4703
02:29:26.691 --> 02:29:27.650
<v Speaker 1>does not a big foot.</v>

4704
02:29:27.651 --> 02:29:29.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a guy and he goes,</v>

4705
02:29:29.211 --> 02:29:30.470
<v Speaker 1>no person could make that sound.</v>

4706
02:29:30.471 --> 02:29:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4707
02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:31.150
<v Speaker 1>oh good.</v>

4708
02:29:31.150 --> 02:29:31.341
<v Speaker 1>We'll go.</v>

4709
02:29:31.341 --> 02:29:31.911
<v Speaker 1>We'll go there.</v>

4710
02:29:31.911 --> 02:29:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I made the sound like I made the same sound.</v>

4711
02:29:34.041 --> 02:29:37.160
<v Speaker 1>It really did sound but he played me another one that was called,</v>

4712
02:29:37.161 --> 02:29:38.600
<v Speaker 1>they call it Samurai chatter.</v>

4713
02:29:38.650 --> 02:29:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4714
02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:40.730
<v Speaker 1>That is really weird.</v>

4715
02:29:40.830 --> 02:29:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Cool and I would love it if once this show comes on the air,</v>

4716
02:29:44.390 --> 02:29:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of you are going to be like,</v>

4717
02:29:45.711 --> 02:29:46.850
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking bullshit.</v>

4718
02:29:46.851 --> 02:29:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I can explain.</v>

4719
02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:52.900
<v Speaker 1>I am a language expert and had some very educated points about this,</v>

4720
02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:56.330
<v Speaker 1>this language that he had heard online.</v>

4721
02:29:56.660 --> 02:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Now he went into this a complete skeptic.</v>

4722
02:29:59.930 --> 02:30:04.040
<v Speaker 1>He had no idea that there was like a big foot community out there and no idea</v>

4723
02:30:04.041 --> 02:30:05.960
<v Speaker 1>that people who are scientists took it seriously,</v>

4724
02:30:06.290 --> 02:30:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but his son was doing a project and it was playing him this big foot stuff and</v>

4725
02:30:11.031 --> 02:30:12.390
<v Speaker 1>him being in crypto linguistics like,</v>

4726
02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:12.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4727
02:30:12.561 --> 02:30:12.951
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

4728
02:30:12.951 --> 02:30:13.784
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

4729
02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

4730
02:30:14.450 --> 02:30:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And so he plays it and listens to it over and over again and immediately</v>

4731
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:22.250
<v Speaker 1>recognizes that this is a language and that's where it gets weird because you're</v>

4732
02:30:22.251 --> 02:30:23.840
<v Speaker 1>talking about a guy who is a,</v>

4733
02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:27.500
<v Speaker 1>a real bonafide expert in human language.</v>

4734
02:30:27.770 --> 02:30:31.700
<v Speaker 1>He's an expert in phonemes and different,</v>

4735
02:30:31.730 --> 02:30:33.000
<v Speaker 1>different aspects of,</v>

4736
02:30:33.001 --> 02:30:33.241
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

4737
02:30:33.241 --> 02:30:35.510
<v Speaker 1>of human language and how to distinguish them.</v>

4738
02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:37.880
<v Speaker 1>So he's what's called a crypto linguists was mean.</v>

4739
02:30:37.881 --> 02:30:41.060
<v Speaker 1>She would take a language that's an unknown language and decipher it.</v>

4740
02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4741
02:30:41.540 --> 02:30:43.730
<v Speaker 1>So he listens to this and um,</v>

4742
02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:46.400
<v Speaker 1>and he decides this is a real thing.</v>

4743
02:30:46.430 --> 02:30:46.611
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4744
02:30:46.611 --> 02:30:47.180
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

4745
02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:48.440
<v Speaker 1>So he thinks that big foot's real.</v>

4746
02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play you what he played for me.</v>

4747
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

4748
02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:51.373
<v Speaker 1>Chuck this</v>

4749
02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:56.810
<v Speaker 12>who several years had a cabin way up in the remotest parts of the Sierras,</v>

4750
02:30:57.450 --> 02:30:58.320
<v Speaker 12>northern California.</v>

4751
02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:00.730
<v Speaker 12>And he was there one time with a friend and uh,</v>

4752
02:31:00.810 --> 02:31:04.530
<v Speaker 12>every evening they used to have some absolutely bizarre noises.</v>

4753
02:31:05.010 --> 02:31:05.180
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>

4754
02:31:05.180 --> 02:31:05.561
<v Speaker 12>cool.</v>

4755
02:31:05.561 --> 02:31:09.180
<v Speaker 12>So then they couldn't figure out what the hell it was and I'm so they took the</v>

4756
02:31:09.390 --> 02:31:12.330
<v Speaker 12>tape recorder one time and this is what the record is.</v>

4757
02:31:12.390 --> 02:31:13.223
<v Speaker 12>Listen to this shit.</v>

4758
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:23.970
<v Speaker 13>It is very bizarre indeed.</v>

4759
02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:47.760
<v Speaker 6>We decided to record the sounds fucking weird that I was in a cabinet and I</v>

4760
02:31:48.521 --> 02:31:49.354
<v Speaker 6>heard that,</v>

4761
02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:50.080
<v Speaker 6>oh Jesus,</v>

4762
02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:51.220
<v Speaker 6>my hair would Tommy.</v>

4763
02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:54.310
<v Speaker 6>Why Low Creek Bobcat Goldthwait sticks.</v>

4764
02:31:54.550 --> 02:31:55.900
<v Speaker 6>People look into it.</v>

4765
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:58.110
<v Speaker 6>They are very encouraged.</v>

4766
02:31:58.111 --> 02:31:58.330
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

4767
02:31:58.330 --> 02:31:59.990
<v Speaker 6>This is more of this or is it more sounds.</v>

4768
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:01.240
<v Speaker 6>These sounds,</v>

4769
02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:03.310
<v Speaker 6>scroll a little further ahead and give me some more of this,</v>

4770
02:32:03.730 --> 02:32:04.563
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4771
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.823
<v Speaker 13>Listen to this.</v>

4772
02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:16.940
<v Speaker 2>So this is what he determined.</v>

4773
02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:22.180
<v Speaker 2>He listened to this and he listened to the sounds and it was his expert opinion</v>

4774
02:32:24.711 --> 02:32:27.940
<v Speaker 2>that these are not sounds that are created by a human bot.</v>

4775
02:32:27.970 --> 02:32:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4776
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.760
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

4777
02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:29.010
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4778
02:32:29.010 --> 02:32:32.210
<v Speaker 2>the tone that this speed of the pitch though,</v>

4779
02:32:32.211 --> 02:32:36.800
<v Speaker 2>the way that the language is being like exhibited,</v>

4780
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:42.190
<v Speaker 2>he believed that this is a language but that it's not being used by a human</v>

4781
02:32:42.531 --> 02:32:42.800
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

4782
02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:43.551
<v Speaker 4>It sounds chimp,</v>

4783
02:32:43.551 --> 02:32:44.900
<v Speaker 4>like it does sound like,</v>

4784
02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:48.260
<v Speaker 4>it definitely sounds like a gorilla mixed in with,</v>

4785
02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:50.510
<v Speaker 4>I see why they call it Samurai it sounds like.</v>

4786
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:51.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4787
02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:51.741
<v Speaker 4>Asian.</v>

4788
02:32:51.741 --> 02:32:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Somehow there's something underneath it.</v>

4789
02:32:54.140 --> 02:32:56.590
<v Speaker 4>I would love to slow it down and hear what it is.</v>

4790
02:32:56.860 --> 02:32:57.551
<v Speaker 2>Well he did.</v>

4791
02:32:57.551 --> 02:32:57.971
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

4792
02:32:57.971 --> 02:32:58.840
<v Speaker 2>He slowed it down.</v>

4793
02:32:58.841 --> 02:33:00.220
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting that you say that.</v>

4794
02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:05.020
<v Speaker 2>He slowed it down from me and he broke down very specific aspects of it that he</v>

4795
02:33:05.021 --> 02:33:06.520
<v Speaker 2>recognized as language.</v>

4796
02:33:06.521 --> 02:33:07.354
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

4797
02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:07.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4798
02:33:07.571 --> 02:33:10.930
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a guy who was a crypto linguist expert,</v>

4799
02:33:10.931 --> 02:33:12.850
<v Speaker 2>a language expert for the navy,</v>

4800
02:33:13.210 --> 02:33:15.490
<v Speaker 2>so he knows what he's talking about and it is very,</v>

4801
02:33:15.491 --> 02:33:16.360
<v Speaker 2>very compelling.</v>

4802
02:33:16.750 --> 02:33:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where that came from though.</v>

4803
02:33:18.390 --> 02:33:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4804
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean they say that it was a bunch of people in the Sierra Nevada's and they</v>

4805
02:33:21.881 --> 02:33:22.714
<v Speaker 2>recorded this.</v>

4806
02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:27.900
<v Speaker 2>All we're hearing is some really weird noises that a language experts say sounds</v>

4807
02:33:28.871 --> 02:33:30.070
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of an animal.</v>

4808
02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:30.933
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

4809
02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:33.550
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4810
02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:34.690
<v Speaker 2>but you're not even close.</v>

4811
02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:35.543
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4812
02:33:36.530 --> 02:33:37.090
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4813
02:33:37.090 --> 02:33:39.610
<v Speaker 2>there's some quality to it that just doesn't seem human.</v>

4814
02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong because,</v>

4815
02:33:40.871 --> 02:33:41.440
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4816
02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:41.741
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

4817
02:33:41.741 --> 02:33:44.260
<v Speaker 2>we've all seen people that are impressionists that do things.</v>

4818
02:33:44.261 --> 02:33:44.531
<v Speaker 2>Do you go,</v>

4819
02:33:44.531 --> 02:33:45.520
<v Speaker 2>how are you doing that?</v>

4820
02:33:45.550 --> 02:33:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4821
02:33:45.730 --> 02:33:45.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4822
02:33:45.941 --> 02:33:46.870
<v Speaker 2>we've all seen that.</v>

4823
02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:47.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4824
02:33:47.141 --> 02:33:47.481
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

4825
02:33:47.481 --> 02:33:47.800
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

4826
02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:48.633
<v Speaker 2>it might be,</v>

4827
02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4828
02:33:48.790 --> 02:33:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I can make a dog when your dog.</v>

4829
02:33:50.050 --> 02:33:50.883
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4830
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:53.703
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

4831
02:33:53.770 --> 02:33:54.600
<v Speaker 2>that's a dog.</v>

4832
02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:56.650
<v Speaker 2>But it's not a doubt this don't do that.</v>

4833
02:33:57.910 --> 02:34:00.160
<v Speaker 2>We ever do that to your kids when they're sleeping?</v>

4834
02:34:00.190 --> 02:34:00.850
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4835
02:34:00.850 --> 02:34:01.683
<v Speaker 2>How rude.</v>

4836
02:34:02.170 --> 02:34:02.711
<v Speaker 2>One time though,</v>

4837
02:34:02.711 --> 02:34:03.730
<v Speaker 2>when we were on fear factor,</v>

4838
02:34:03.970 --> 02:34:04.511
<v Speaker 2>there was this,</v>

4839
02:34:04.511 --> 02:34:04.781
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4840
02:34:04.781 --> 02:34:08.410
<v Speaker 2>this group of people and they were blindfolded and we led them into this,</v>

4841
02:34:08.411 --> 02:34:08.561
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4842
02:34:08.561 --> 02:34:09.251
<v Speaker 2>this room,</v>

4843
02:34:09.251 --> 02:34:11.080
<v Speaker 2>or they didn't know what the stunt was,</v>

4844
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:13.240
<v Speaker 2>so they couldn't see it because it was a big wheel.</v>

4845
02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:13.811
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

4846
02:34:13.811 --> 02:34:15.250
<v Speaker 2>they would have saw it immediately and said,</v>

4847
02:34:15.251 --> 02:34:16.084
<v Speaker 2>what's the wheel for?</v>

4848
02:34:16.210 --> 02:34:17.043
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

4849
02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:18.060
<v Speaker 2>him in blindfolded.</v>

4850
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.790
<v Speaker 3>So as they bring it in,</v>

4851
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:19.623
<v Speaker 3>blindfold them and go,</v>

4852
02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:27.660
<v Speaker 7>they would shit their pants dirty fucks.</v>

4853
02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:30.610
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what a person can and can't make with the noise,</v>

4854
02:34:30.611 --> 02:34:33.430
<v Speaker 3>cause I have to make some weird noises with my boss and the guy from police</v>

4855
02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:34.060
<v Speaker 3>academy.</v>

02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

4858
02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Colin's low could easily do something like that.</v>

4859
02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:39.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4860
02:34:39.851 --> 02:34:42.850
<v Speaker 3>So you can't just say because you're hearing some strange,</v>

4861
02:34:42.851 --> 02:34:47.410
<v Speaker 3>guttural orc like language that it's definitely a big foot.</v>

4862
02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:49.990
<v Speaker 3>That's something that could easily be fake Dunkin.</v>

4863
02:34:49.991 --> 02:34:52.210
<v Speaker 3>There's only one way to solve this problem.</v>

4864
02:34:52.650 --> 02:34:53.020
