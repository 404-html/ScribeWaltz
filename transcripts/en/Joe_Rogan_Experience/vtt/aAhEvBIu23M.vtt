<v Speaker 1>As advertised.</v>

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a great vagina,</v>

41
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>not just a good vagina,</v>

42
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.870

47
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

48
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Warms the human body.</v>

49
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Does it make it feels like a human body.</v>

50
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I did one of those sleeps here today where you wake up and you're just</v>

51
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>completely like,</v>

52
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.911
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

53
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to do anything.</v>

54
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just going to lay here and just kind of stretch out a little.</v>

55
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw the flashlight on my nightstand,</v>

56
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

57
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.241
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

58
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to go deep with this shit.</v>

59
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It just clean.</v>

60
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>It had never been used before.</v>

61
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It was one of these new ones.</v>

62
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And I got this lotion.</v>

63
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>It was every time I come,</v>

64
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll just do it in the morning,</v>

65
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>then I'll go back to bed.</v>

66
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

67
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>talk for some reason that morning not fills me with energy.</v>

68
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm like that time to start the day that p Boehner where you,</v>

70
00:01:55.941 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>you actually bypassed the p and still comic or even go pee.</v>

71
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

72
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:01.531
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

73
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a talent right there.</v>

74
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Those nighttime boners are so important to hotel rooms to go to bed beat off</v>

75
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>right before you go to bed,</v>

76
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>like in the hotel room.</v>

77
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you're on the road,</v>

78
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>you know you have a hard time sleeping.</v>

79
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>That's when those nighttime masturbation,</v>

80
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>my worst times when I'm on the road,</v>

81
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>flashlight will come in handy and I know I'm gonna hold a seat for two hours.</v>

82
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to go to radio and I'd like to beat off into a sock,</v>

83
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

84
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I want a hot,</v>

85
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to reuse that sock just for morning radio.</v>

86
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to use a fresh soc for it right on the word.</v>

87
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't bring the flashlight with you though.</v>

88
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>That's like the lineup.</v>

89
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Something about travel.</v>

90
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.721
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

91
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:40.411
<v Speaker 1>wow man.</v>

92
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.244

93
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>you're admitting that you can't even go wherever we're a couple of days without</v>

95
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>beating off like such a blatant admission.</v>

96
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Just committing to it so much so that you're,</v>

97
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not worried about being stopped at the airport and search for sex toys.</v>

98
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>They should have a travel flashlight.</v>

99
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.561
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

100
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what happened.</v>

101
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>You Know Veronica Ricci,</v>

102
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

103
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>she went to</v>

105
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v Speaker 2>Israel,</v>

106
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

107
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.960
<v Speaker 2>last week I went there by herself and they thought she was a spy and so they</v>

109
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.030
<v Speaker 2>went through it,</v>

110
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>her luggage for like four days and they shouldn't have luggage for four days.</v>

111
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.720
<v Speaker 2>And they were like asking her,</v>

112
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 2>because I guess they thought she was like a,</v>

113
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 2>like a terrorist of some sort because there's no other like girls her age,</v>

114
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 2>that they are not Jewish is visiting Israel right now I guess.</v>

116
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.310
<v Speaker 2>And so she got like,</v>

117
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>she had to buy a whole all know she had to buy all new clothes and then she said</v>

120
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people played elbows and she's like,</v>

121
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:38.531

123
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 3>So just because she came there by herself,</v>

124
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.470
<v Speaker 3>they thought that she was a terrorist,</v>

125
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.983
<v Speaker 3>searching everybody</v>

126

00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:18.614
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

190
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how everybody's body works.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Everybody's body works different.</v>

192
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.070
<v Speaker 3>I could never claim that something that's effective for me is effective for you.</v>

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.070
<v Speaker 3>There's some things that other people are allergic to that I'm not.</v>

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

196
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how your brain works.</v>

197
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:35.510
<v Speaker 3>Maybe your brain works better than mine all the time anyway.</v>

198
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.021
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

199
00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 3>maybe some people need nootropics and some people are like those kids that can</v>

200
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:43.850
<v Speaker 3>look out a window of an airplane and then draw everything they saw and exact</v>

201
00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:44.540
<v Speaker 3>proportion.</v>

202
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

206
00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 3>Maybe his brain is just working like in that function in that regard,</v>

207
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.370
<v Speaker 3>like so much higher rpms and mind can ever achieve ever.</v>

208
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.623
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

209
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 3>But I from me,</v>

210
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.060

215
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was legit when I was fucking people up in video games.</v>

216
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.051
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

217
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 3>my video game synapses would just stop fire.</v>

218
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

219

225
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

226
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 3>It's when you're playing a really intense game of counterstrike or something</v>

227
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

228
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.701
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

229
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I never got into that game,</v>

230
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 3>but because I was really more one on one games,</v>

231
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 3>but there was a lot of dudes who would play counterstrike and these</v>

232
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers were like literally virtually going to war that have a land</v>

233
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 3>together and then I'll be screaming out instructions at each other and they all</v>

234
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 3>had headphones on and they'd be playing.</v>

235
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 3>Some dudes on the other side of the room,</v>

236
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 3>they were at war.</v>

237
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of shit going on.</v>

238
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.221
<v Speaker 3>They had that.</v>

239
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 3>They had that kid who got a concussion in football and then killed himself like</v>

240
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:50.294
<v Speaker 3>a day later.</v>

241
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 3>I said he shouldn't have done anything that would stimulate the brain too much,</v>

242
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 3>but he's playing video games all day and they're like,</v>

243
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.461
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

244
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Do not do that.</v>

245
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

246
00:06:57.341 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Your video games and concerts like you need to rest your brain for a little</v>

247
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:00.490
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

248
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

249
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Video Games are really intensely and it like intensely exciting for the brain</v>

250
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 3>and about a lot of weird areas,</v>

251
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.231
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

252
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean they get you like you're really at boards,</v>

253
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 3>digital wars going on,</v>

254
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

255
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 3>especially the live one on one internet battles.</v>

256
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 3>When I first found out that you could,</v>

257
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 3>you could actually play a game with someone live on the Internet.</v>

258
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was the coolest fucking thing I've ever heard of.</v>

259
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>The first I didn't know anything about pains.</v>

260
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 3>So the first time I did it I'd like get logged on to servers and like Sweden and</v>

261
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:31.941
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

262

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

266
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.033
<v Speaker 3>But it's pretty cool.</v>

267
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Huge lag time.</v>

268
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Like your people are disappearing in front of you.</v>

269
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 3>You're shooting rockets.</v>

270
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not getting all the packets from the game because they're so far</v>

271
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

272
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 3>So you would have like a big ping time to them.</v>

273
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 3>We had,</v>

274
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 3>we had Ethan that in college,</v>

275
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.660

276
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

277
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Inbetween levels.</v>

278
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Like whoever won that race,</v>

279
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:54.171
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

280
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 3>we'd all just pour out into the halls and start like mocking each other for</v>

281
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:57.261
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

282
00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 3>while they were loading up the next level.</v>

283
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 3>It was super fun.</v>

284
00:07:59.630 --> 00:07:59.781

00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:05.380
<v Speaker 3>what video games can do like as far as like,</v>

290
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 3>like that sort of a sense of a team game.</v>

291
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Almost like a team chess match.</v>

292
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing like video games.</v>

293
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean chess is a brilliant game.</v>

294
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:14.560
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing game for,</v>

295
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 3>for like 25 straight hours playing video games.</v>

296
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:19.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

297
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 3>You don't get tired.</v>

298
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 3>You want to keep going.</v>

299
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 3>It's higher to 2:00 AM 8:00 AM you wait,</v>

300
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 3>you get away from the game and your hands are shaking.</v>

301
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Your whole body is pulsating with adrenaline.</v>

302
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:29.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

303
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:30.021
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

304
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 3>We used to have these ones,</v>

305
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 3>these quake lan matches what we would all get together and we would like have</v>

306
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:37.110
<v Speaker 3>death matches where like we would uh,</v>

307
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 3>either have team matches where it'd be our team and we'd go against other teams.</v>

308
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 3>That was always real fun.</v>

309
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Or we would just fuck each other up.</v>

310
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 3>We would just have melees where anybody was against everybody.</v>

311
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 3>We just run into a room and everybody fucking kill everybody until there's one</v>

312
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 3>last man standing.</v>

313
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 3>We should talk about this on the podcast.</v>

314
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 3>We should know.</v>

315
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

316
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.521
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

317
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:57.354
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't.</v>

318
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard the most people will get this part right?</v>

319
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

320
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 3>We have to make our commercials really?</v>

321
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Commercials.</v>

322
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

323
00:09:03.051 --> 00:09:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Eventually I have to shorten these notes because this big,</v>

324
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 3>because this stuff doesn't get put on.</v>

325
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Sirius radio.</v>

338
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.020
<v Speaker 3>We've been talking for like 10 15 minutes about how fucking awesome video games</v>

339
00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:49.870
<v Speaker 3>can be and so the serious stuff starts right now.</v>

340
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

341
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:50.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

342
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

343
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Sort of.</v>

344
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

345
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.530
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot to do it whenever they want.</v>

346
00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:55.660
<v Speaker 3>It really should just record the commercials.</v>

347
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm they maybe not.</v>

348
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.960
<v Speaker 3>People like it like this.</v>

349
00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

350
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.520
<v Speaker 3>Some people don't.</v>

351
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

352
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.230
<v Speaker 3>it gives people a reason to listen.</v>

353
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

354
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:05.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a conversation more than anything,</v>

355
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.243
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

356
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

357
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:07.653
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

358
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more effective.</v>

359
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.190
<v Speaker 3>I've been listening to us on Sirius radio so much lately.</v>

360
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

361
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 3>it changes my whole look of how we,</v>

362
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.390
<v Speaker 3>I did this part of the podcast.</v>

363
00:10:16.391 --> 00:10:20.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it's seems really legit when you're just driving around and you just</v>

364
00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:22.000
<v Speaker 3>flip a radio station and you're like,</v>

365
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:22.571
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

366
00:10:22.571 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 3>That's me.</v>

367
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.511
<v Speaker 3>Hear you.</v>

368
00:10:23.511 --> 00:10:24.520
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

369
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:25.030
<v Speaker 3>it is radio.</v>

370
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.930
<v Speaker 3>It's still is like wow.</v>

371
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.793
<v Speaker 3>It's still theirs.</v>

372
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

373
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also with the idea of the radio is it's people that don't necessarily</v>

374
00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:31.480
<v Speaker 3>want to hear you,</v>

375
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.460
<v Speaker 3>so you want to be like a little better for them.</v>

376
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.830
<v Speaker 3>You know the beans with the people that are already like you,</v>

377
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.210
<v Speaker 3>like your podcast fans,</v>

378
00:10:37.211 --> 00:10:38.044
<v Speaker 3>you already got them.</v>

379
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.350
<v Speaker 3>But if you're on serious and you know when they click on and you're stumbling</v>

380
00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:43.390
<v Speaker 3>through your words and sound like a retard,</v>

381
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.071
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

382
00:10:45.071 --> 00:10:45.611
<v Speaker 3>Who is this?</v>

383
00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:45.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

384
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.510
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

385
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.400
<v Speaker 3>The fear factor guy has a radio show.</v>

386
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.020
<v Speaker 3>He's saying I'm too much,</v>

387
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.681
<v Speaker 3>but he's saying,</v>

388
00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:51.760
<v Speaker 3>you know every other thing,</v>

389
00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:52.594
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

390
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

391
00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:54.520
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hate that.</v>

392
00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:54.881
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

393
00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:57.460
<v Speaker 3>you know the ones that catch about your Sam,</v>

394
00:10:57.461 --> 00:10:58.750
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching that lately.</v>

395
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:59.261
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

396
00:10:59.261 --> 00:11:00.430
<v Speaker 3>I watched a MC,</v>

397
00:11:00.431 --> 00:11:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Chris was on your podcast.</v>

398
00:11:01.871 --> 00:11:02.591
<v Speaker 3>Very Nice Guy,</v>

399
00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Mc Chris.</v>

400
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.690
<v Speaker 3>And this is not a criticism of him,</v>

401
00:11:04.691 --> 00:11:07.480
<v Speaker 3>but it made me realize about myself that he says,</v>

402
00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:08.470
<v Speaker 3>you know a lot.</v>

403
00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:09.011
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

404
00:11:09.011 --> 00:11:09.850
<v Speaker 3>God damn bitch.</v>

405
00:11:09.851 --> 00:11:10.450
<v Speaker 3>You do too.</v>

406
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.410
<v Speaker 3>That's what I said to myself.</v>

407
00:11:11.411 --> 00:11:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

408
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:12.101
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

409
00:11:12.101 --> 00:11:13.180
<v Speaker 3>you know all the time,</v>

410
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:13.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

411
00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:15.250
<v Speaker 3>when you see that somebody else who can see it in yourself,</v>

412
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

413
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like a trickery for um,</v>

414
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

415
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:19.271
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

416
00:11:19.271 --> 00:11:20.800
<v Speaker 3>you're pretending you're saying,</v>

417
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

418
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.440
<v Speaker 3>but you're saying it with two words.</v>

419
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

420
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.181
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

421
00:11:25.181 --> 00:11:25.421
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

422
00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:25.720
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

423
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:25.931
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

424
00:11:25.931 --> 00:11:26.231
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

425
00:11:26.231 --> 00:11:27.064
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

426
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.673
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

427
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

428
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.790
<v Speaker 3>what do I say a lot you say,</v>

429
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:31.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

00:11:31.031 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 3>to a lot of us do.</v>

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:32.440
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

432
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:32.891

435
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:36.010
<v Speaker 3>one of us starts doing it.</v>

436
00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:36.751
<v Speaker 3>Then we all just saw,</v>

437
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 3>everyone just starts killing argued on the worst thing I say a lot.</v>

438
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.500
<v Speaker 3>I think like maybe yes,</v>

439
00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:42.370
<v Speaker 3>you are a big like,</v>

440
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:42.731
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

441
00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:43.481
<v Speaker 3>You say like a lot,</v>

442
00:11:43.481 --> 00:11:47.470
<v Speaker 3>a lot of girls say like a lot because that's my way of saying like,</v>

443
00:11:47.471 --> 00:11:48.910
<v Speaker 3>here I'll give you a different,</v>

444
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.823
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

445
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

446
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.300
<v Speaker 3>well it's good when it works.</v>

447
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 3>That is what you say.</v>

448
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 3>But if it's just like,</v>

449
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 3>you know this like,</v>

450
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.341
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like,</v>

451
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

452
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.953
<v Speaker 3>and there's like,</v>

453
00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

454
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.521
<v Speaker 3>are you serious?</v>

455
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Like is this like,</v>

456
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure like Whoa,</v>

457
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

458
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

459
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.203
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

460
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it in our feet in the future.</v>

461
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:12.780
<v Speaker 3>Somehow we're not doc talk and we're going to have her phone talk for us.</v>

462
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 3>You said something really interesting the other day that I've been really</v>

463
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 3>thinking of when it was a very valid point.</v>

464
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 3>You were saying that that's what autism is.</v>

465
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what people that are emotionless and that's what it's eventually</v>

466
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.493
<v Speaker 3>digitally,</v>

467
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 3>there really won't be a need for emotions anymore and it's like that might be</v>

468
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 3>the next stage.</v>

469
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.141
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

470
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people speculated that what some of the autism spectrum disorders are,</v>

471
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.940
<v Speaker 3>is the human body possibly making a change possibly for some new development.</v>

472
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.231
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

473
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:45.740
<v Speaker 3>It could be a lot of different things.</v>

474
00:12:45.741 --> 00:12:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

475
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 3>they say there's environmental factors like look,</v>

476
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people say that it's toxins.</v>

477
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.940
<v Speaker 3>There's been arguments about vaccinations and all sorts of different things.</v>

478
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

479
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that they don't know what it is or maybe it's that it's just</v>

480
00:12:58.061 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 3>being diagnosed more.</v>

481
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 3>There's arguments both ways,</v>

482
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.480
<v Speaker 3>but something's happening and there's a lot of kids that are experiencing this</v>

483
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 3>sort of a disassociated behavior,</v>

484
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.481
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

485
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:08.140
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

486
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.381
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

487
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 3>it's super unfortunate,</v>

488
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:15.030
<v Speaker 3>but it might be representing according to people way smarter than me.</v>

489
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 3>So I don't even know exactly what they're meaning by this.</v>

490
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

491
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.550
<v Speaker 3>But they're saying that it might be representing a next stage of human beings</v>

492
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 3>and that as a result of all of our,</v>

493
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 3>like technological connection with each other and you know,</v>

494
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.311
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

495
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 3>being able to text and send pictures and do everything sort of virtually to each</v>

496
00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

497
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.990
<v Speaker 3>that slowly the human body is having less and less of a need of the extreme sort</v>

498
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:50.521
<v Speaker 3>of emotional interaction that has sort of gotten us to where we are today.</v>

499
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 3>I got addicted to the,</v>

500
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.560
<v Speaker 3>to the computer and the phone.</v>

501
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

502
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like it takes me two hours to go,</v>

503
00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:01.420
<v Speaker 3>just start taking a shower cause I didn't want me to talk to this again.</v>

504
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 3>And the Facebook and then Twitter.</v>

505
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 3>It's something unhealthy.</v>

506
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:06.110
<v Speaker 3>There's something going on with it.</v>

507
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 3>There's something fascinating about it is just like what we were talking about</v>

508
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 3>earlier about video games that we were saying that video games are so</v>

509
00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:13.984
<v Speaker 3>stimulated.</v>

510
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Like you never get tired of just the light is that a lot of it maybe great.</v>

511
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Then the visuals,</v>

512
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 3>really cool graphics.</v>

513
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 3>It's the challenge and people that want to be a challenge.</v>

514
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:24.341
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

515
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

516
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.593
<v Speaker 3>it's like anything,</v>

517
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.850
<v Speaker 3>well it's also replacing all that,</v>

518
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 3>those instincts that are in our DNA that sort of got us to where we are today.</v>

519
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.041
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

520
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching this.</v>

521
00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:35.024
<v Speaker 3>It's still,</v>

522
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.620
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

523
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 3>Sit still and just look at things.</v>

524
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:37.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

525
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:38.344
<v Speaker 3>Move your wrist.</v>

526
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

527
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

528
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's replacing going out and killing animals.</v>

529
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:44.590
<v Speaker 3>That's replacing,</v>

530
00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:46.630
<v Speaker 3>fighting off the enemy that's replacing,</v>

531
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

532
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:48.250
<v Speaker 3>swimming to safety.</v>

533
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause your boat breaks a hole in it.</v>

534
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.141
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

535
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the world that we're living in there.</v>

536
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:58.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not filled with all these needs for violent explosions and running away</v>

537
00:14:58.521 --> 00:15:01.280
<v Speaker 3>from danger and all the shit bodies program for.</v>

538
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.511
<v Speaker 3>So instead it's,</v>

539
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:07.511
<v Speaker 3>it's slowly entering to some sort of a symbiotic relationship with machines.</v>

540
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 3>And as it enters into this relationship with the machines,</v>

541
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 3>it becomes less and less emotional.</v>

542
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 3>It's less and less interactive with humans.</v>

543
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Less and less dependent on that.</v>

544
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:21.890
<v Speaker 3>And perhaps one day ultimately not dependent at all because one day ultimately</v>

545
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 3>if you expand on how far,</v>

546
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 3>how much of a connection we have with computers now and how this didn't even</v>

547
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:30.050
<v Speaker 3>exist at all just a hundred years ago,</v>

548
00:15:30.051 --> 00:15:30.890
<v Speaker 3>no electronics,</v>

549
00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 3>no nothing a hundred years ago.</v>

550
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.291
<v Speaker 3>Think of it.</v>

551
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not outside the realm of possibility to envision some sort of a permanent</v>

552
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 3>and direction that humans are going to have with some sort of electronic and</v>

553
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.260
<v Speaker 3>mark clause that would come out to hold your phone when you're typing on it.</v>

554
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Something where you know you're much more interactive virtually than you ever</v>

555
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:56.351
<v Speaker 3>are physically and that you will eventually become a part of a fucking system.</v>

556
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.741
<v Speaker 3>Like you will,</v>

557
00:15:57.741 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 3>you'll become an emotional wreck.</v>

558
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Hard integrated or Yup.</v>

559
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.230
<v Speaker 3>A Borg for real nuts.</v>

560
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

561
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Super Possible.</v>

562
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.811
<v Speaker 3>Super Possible.</v>

563
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:06.870
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a way more evolved.</v>

564
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

565
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.731
<v Speaker 3>you gotta think,</v>

566
00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

567
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.970
<v Speaker 3>we're hanging onto these goddamn emotions,</v>

568
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Speaker 3>these things that make us fly planes into buildings and these things that make</v>

569
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 3>us want to,</v>

570
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

571
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Jack other people,</v>

572
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:20.790
<v Speaker 3>and I was reading CNN today and I'm that guy in,</v>

573
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.991
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

574
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's Liberia.</v>

575
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 3>There's just one of them got convicted,</v>

576
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.970
<v Speaker 3>sent a message to the other tyrants.</v>

577
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 3>I ain't gonna send shipper a message.</v>

652
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:32.940

653
00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:33.774
<v Speaker 3>Lord.</v>

654

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

660
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 3>But I mean the fact that he was able to kill and eat babies and they don't want</v>

661
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:44.754
<v Speaker 3>him in jail.</v>

662

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

663
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.210
<v Speaker 3>He would kill and eat innocent children cause he had a change of heart soon</v>

664
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:49.044
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

665
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:49.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

666
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:50.760
<v Speaker 3>He found the Lord.</v>

667
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

668

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

669
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:52.020
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

670
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.720
<v Speaker 3>well it was just a rehab and he's already rehab.</v>

671
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

672
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.471
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's,</v>

673
00:18:55.471 --> 00:18:56.304
<v Speaker 3>he's out.</v>

674
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.173
<v Speaker 3>He's good.</v>

675
00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 3>He feels bad before it's totally bad for you or whatever.</v>

676
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think he was because he was hungry.</v>

677
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 3>You only did it because he wanted to be invincible and need to do to be</v>

678
00:19:08.041 --> 00:19:08.461
<v Speaker 3>invincible.</v>

679
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 3>You had to do something unbelievably heinous.</v>

680
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.380
<v Speaker 3>And in times of war you had to be willing to eat.</v>

681
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.120
<v Speaker 3>You'd get like their energy,</v>

682
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.003
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

683
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.191
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

684
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:20.130
<v Speaker 3>you're committing so far to terror and horror,</v>

685
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.690
<v Speaker 3>you would probably be,</v>

686
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:22.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

687
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:26.430
<v Speaker 3>the preserve occur mentality that they must've had to be able to do that to</v>

688
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:27.420
<v Speaker 3>innocent children.</v>

689
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.841
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

690
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:30.180
<v Speaker 3>it's just to be completely inhuman like that.</v>

691
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 3>And then the fact that this guy,</v>

692
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 3>all he has to do is I'm just learn about some old stuff and learn about Jesus</v>

693
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 3>and find the word of God and where everyone's like,</v>

725
00:20:07.621 --> 00:20:08.454
<v Speaker 3>I noticed the war.</v>

726
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:09.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

727
00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Catholicism.</v>

728
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:10.741
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing,</v>

729
00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:11.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

730
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fuck anybody.</v>

731
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.271
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

732
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:13.890
<v Speaker 3>no fucking done period.</v>

733
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.160
<v Speaker 3>But I think that's the only one that requires you to be completely celebrate,</v>

734
00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:20.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

735
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

736
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Other ones just to have to be married.</v>

737
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:22.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

738
00:20:22.131 --> 00:20:22.650
<v Speaker 3>monks,</v>

739
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.870
<v Speaker 3>monks aren't like right back Buddhist monks are,</v>

740
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:25.090
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

741
00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.250
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

742
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.341
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

743
00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:26.570
<v Speaker 3>that's supposed to fuck that.</v>

744
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.181
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

745
00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:28.410
<v Speaker 3>So they'll go without talking to her.</v>

746
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.421
<v Speaker 3>They had this,</v>

747
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:30.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

748
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

749
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.360
<v Speaker 3>interview with the Dalai Lama recently.</v>

750
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 3>It's funny that everybody's like,</v>

751
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 3>listen to this dude.</v>

752
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.691
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

753
00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:38.250
<v Speaker 3>it was a real weird thing.</v>

754
00:20:38.251 --> 00:20:38.760
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

755
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:40.020
<v Speaker 3>they asked him about women.</v>

757
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.441
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

758
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:40.681
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

759
00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:40.810
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

760
00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'm attracted to women,</v>

761
00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:43.620
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>

762
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.371
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

763
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 3>it's so much work and I can't do this Dalai Lama that.</v>

764
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

765
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 5>I love his Twitter.</v>

766
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.940
<v Speaker 5>I always check it as it goes.</v>

767
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.251
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

768
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:51.710
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

769
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.040
<v Speaker 5>he really is a cool guy,</v>

770
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:54.790
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

771
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

772
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:55.983
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

773
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.800
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

774
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

775
00:20:57.641 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 5>He's all positive.</v>

776
00:20:58.930 --> 00:20:59.571
<v Speaker 5>It's funny,</v>

777
00:20:59.571 --> 00:21:00.020
<v Speaker 5>Lama,</v>

778
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.760
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

779
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.031
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

780
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 5>his argument about,</v>

781
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

782
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.340
<v Speaker 5>being a relationship,</v>

783
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:03.731
<v Speaker 5>she's like,</v>

784
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 5>Huh,</v>

785
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.521
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

786
00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 5>it's too much trouble.</v>

787
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 5>It's not trail off at ease.</v>

788
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is.</v>

789
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.460
<v Speaker 5>He's writing a lot of ways.</v>

790
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 5>So he has sex though.</v>

791
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 5>He would go have a relationship.</v>

792
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:13.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he has it ever has.</v>

793
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.510
<v Speaker 5>I think that's who's a title Mama.</v>

794
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.353
<v Speaker 5>Where did he come from?</v>

795
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 5>Sea as he was born.</v>

796
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:18.454
<v Speaker 5>The Dalai Lama.</v>

797
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.181
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

798
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:19.610
<v Speaker 5>It was one of,</v>

799
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.480
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things where you're sort of a,</v>

800
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.050
<v Speaker 5>I can't think he's like the 16th or something like that.</v>

801
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:24.931
<v Speaker 5>It's what it is,</v>

802
00:21:24.931 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 5>is beyond ridiculous.</v>

803
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 5>It's not just a dude.</v>

804
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.160
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking of the Gandhi.</v>

805
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.821
<v Speaker 5>Is it dude?</v>

806
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 5>It's been like,</v>

807
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.821
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

808
00:21:31.821 --> 00:21:32.980
<v Speaker 5>He's a completely different guy.</v>

809
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.380
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

810
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

811
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 5>they should have met though.</v>

812
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.753
<v Speaker 5>I know</v>

813
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.280
<v Speaker 5>they did.</v>

814
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 5>Do we know if they didn't?</v>

815
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.193
<v Speaker 5>I wish they did,</v>

816
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.230
<v Speaker 5>but it looks like he's old enough to known Gandy.</v>

817
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:44.981
<v Speaker 5>How old was gone?</v>

818
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:45.081
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

819
00:21:45.081 --> 00:21:46.030
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of Dalai Lama's.</v>

820
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:47.830
<v Speaker 5>Then there was some bidding at one when he was around.</v>

821
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there was Gandhi around forties,</v>

822
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:51.671
<v Speaker 5>50s,</v>

823
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:52.504
<v Speaker 5>60s.</v>

824
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the 19 hundreds of thing.</v>

825
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.633
<v Speaker 5>Do you see Adam?</v>

826
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.483
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

827
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.500
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy came Oco.</v>

828
00:21:57.501 --> 00:21:58.840
<v Speaker 5>I did that presidents.</v>

829
00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.743
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

830
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:00.191
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

831
00:22:00.191 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 5>What did he exactly say?</v>

832
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:02.224
<v Speaker 5>Can you pull it up?</v>

833
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

834
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:02.670
<v Speaker 5>did,</v>

835
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.740
<v Speaker 5>that was the word about the big marijuana he did.</v>

836
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.730
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

837
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.563
<v Speaker 5>That's so good.</v>

838
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 5>He started if he was okay,</v>

839
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:11.470
<v Speaker 5>he started strong and I'm going a little slow for a while and then by the time</v>

840
00:22:11.471 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 5>we got to the marijuana I was like tuned out already.</v>

841
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:13.960
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

842
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.171
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

843
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:14.910
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

844
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 5>I think there's just skirting over my head and then he ended up strong.</v>

845
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.060
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

846
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.251
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

847
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:19.970
<v Speaker 5>it was just an uncomfortable situation.</v>

848
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 5>You asked like how many people here have not smoked pot?</v>

849
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

850
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 5>And then like maybe a quarter of the crowd raise our hand and then I think he</v>

851
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:27.130
<v Speaker 5>made his point from there.</v>

852
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:27.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

853
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:30.160
<v Speaker 5>It's play the shit out of it.</v>

854
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

855
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:31.923
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful.</v>

856
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.150
<v Speaker 5>Now this is the whole thing.</v>

857
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

858
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.290
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

860
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:36.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>lobbyists and celebrities.</v>

875
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.800
<v Speaker 6>Everything that is wrong with America is here in this</v>

876
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:06.683
<v Speaker 4>from tonight.</v>

877
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.191
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately,</v>

878
00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:09.911
<v Speaker 6>the speaker of the house,</v>

879
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:10.550
<v Speaker 6>John Bain,</v>

880
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.351
<v Speaker 6>was on my class,</v>

881
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 6>I think from last year.</v>

882
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 6>Nancy Pelosi believes in lipstick the same way she believes in government.</v>

883
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Speaker 6>Too much is never enough.</v>

884
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.833
<v Speaker 6>Jake tapper.</v>

885
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.730
<v Speaker 6>That's how he was discovered.</v>

886
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.790
<v Speaker 6>Some people say Mitt Romney will be elected president because he's</v>

887
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:26.290
<v Speaker 5>secondly,</v>

888
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:26.900
<v Speaker 5>we're really smart,</v>

889
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:27.551
<v Speaker 5>but what are you doing?</v>

890
00:23:27.551 --> 00:23:28.100
<v Speaker 5>Bryan?</v>

891
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:28.581
<v Speaker 5>Five is off.</v>

892
00:23:28.581 --> 00:23:30.050
<v Speaker 5>Then I'm going to play a little bit,</v>

893
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.263
<v Speaker 4>right</v>

894
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.210
<v Speaker 6>any end.</v>

895
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.340
<v Speaker 6>Rick Santorum may not have won the nomination,</v>

896
00:23:37.341 --> 00:23:39.410
<v Speaker 6>but he succeeded in getting his message out,</v>

897
00:23:39.411 --> 00:23:43.160
<v Speaker 6>not just to Americans but to people all a flat the world.</v>

898
00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.550
<v Speaker 6>Paul is still in there.</v>

899
00:23:48.551 --> 00:23:49.720
<v Speaker 6>He's still sticking with it to me.</v>

900
00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:53.080
<v Speaker 6>Ron Paul looks like the guy who gets unloaded hooded at the end of every Scooby</v>

901
00:23:53.081 --> 00:23:53.914
<v Speaker 6>doo epics.</v>

902
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.990
<v Speaker 6>It's great to see the Gingrich's here tonight because I guess that means the</v>

903
00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:04.824
<v Speaker 6>check cleared.</v>

904
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.230
<v Speaker 6>Oh Shit.</v>

905
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:08.790
<v Speaker 6>Nude.</v>

906
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.361
<v Speaker 6>I have a question.</v>

907
00:24:09.361 --> 00:24:12.810
<v Speaker 6>How can you be against gay marriage when you yourself are the son of two gay</v>

908
00:24:12.811 --> 00:24:13.650
<v Speaker 6>parents,</v>

909
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:18.390
<v Speaker 6>the Michelin man and the stay puft marshmallow man stumble a marshmallow.</v>

910
00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:20.640
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand politicians who are against gay marriage.</v>

911
00:24:20.641 --> 00:24:23.280
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand anyone is against gay marriage and where when you really</v>

912
00:24:23.281 --> 00:24:24.114
<v Speaker 6>think about it,</v>

913
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.770
<v Speaker 6>aren't all marriages kind of gay?</v>

914
00:24:25.771 --> 00:24:26.604
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

915
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:27.563
<v Speaker 4>hello</v>

916
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.150
<v Speaker 6>as a man when you get married,</v>

917
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 6>essentially what you're saying is I will never touch another woman as long as I</v>

918
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:34.610
<v Speaker 6>live now.</v>

919
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 6>Let's put jewelry on each other and dance.</v>

920
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.040
<v Speaker 6>Not that it's any of my business,</v>

921
00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:41.641
<v Speaker 6>Mr Gingrich,</v>

922
00:24:41.641 --> 00:24:43.890
<v Speaker 6>but why are you waiting until Tuesday to drop out of this?</v>

923
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:44.821
<v Speaker 6>Just do it now.</v>

924
00:24:44.821 --> 00:24:44.971
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

925
00:24:44.971 --> 00:24:45.121
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

00:24:45.121 --> 00:24:46.350
<v Speaker 6>it's time to meet or get off.</v>

927
00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:47.184
<v Speaker 6>The Pot.</v>

928
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.270
<v Speaker 6>Electoral process has changed a lot over the last 10 years.</v>

929
00:24:51.271 --> 00:24:51.661
<v Speaker 6>As you know,</v>

930
00:24:51.661 --> 00:24:53.170
<v Speaker 6>the president of finally gave in and</v>

931
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.250
<v Speaker 6>of Guardian and hit one of those big boxes of all the different kinds of chips</v>

932
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.790
<v Speaker 6>we can get to the pot part.</v>

933
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.813
<v Speaker 6>Super committed.</v>

934
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.790
<v Speaker 6>Super Committees are two committees.</v>

935
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.500
<v Speaker 6>What super cuts is to cuts the TV in 2000 and list of Madison.</v>

936
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:21.480
<v Speaker 6>Let's take a quick poll is so good at this is your hand if you've never smoked</v>

937
00:25:21.481 --> 00:25:22.314
<v Speaker 6>pot.</v>

938
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.561
<v Speaker 6>Brit Hume,</v>

939
00:25:27.561 --> 00:25:28.580
<v Speaker 6>he's high riding now</v>

940
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.830
<v Speaker 6>he's on his fourth almond macaroon.</v>

941
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.761
<v Speaker 6>Mr President,</v>

942
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 6>I hope you don't think I'm out of line here,</v>

943
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:39.500
<v Speaker 6>but marijuana is something that real people care about and the fact that you</v>

944
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 6>believe Speaker Baner when he tells you he's still has control of his party,</v>

945
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:45.980
<v Speaker 6>leads me to believe that you must be smoking some crazy great weed yourself.</v>

946
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

947
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 6>Woody Harrelson just woke up.</v>

948
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

949
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.271
<v Speaker 6>As we know now,</v>

950
00:25:52.271 --> 00:25:53.200
<v Speaker 6>last year at this dinner,</v>

951
00:25:53.201 --> 00:25:56.920
<v Speaker 6>President Obama had his team on the way to kill Osama bin Laden it.</v>

952
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

953
00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:58.750
<v Speaker 3>He's so good at that,</v>

954
00:25:58.751 --> 00:25:59.230
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

955
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.450
<v Speaker 3>That guy is a,</v>

956
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.080
<v Speaker 3>he's in my opinion,</v>

957
00:26:02.081 --> 00:26:04.030
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the best talk show host alive.</v>

958
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

959
00:26:04.241 --> 00:26:05.074
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty fun.</v>

960
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.970
<v Speaker 3>He's the best at like weaving between ninth is sort of a subtle,</v>

961
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

962
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:15.451
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking around like way of talking with like being like a very,</v>

963
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:22.480
<v Speaker 3>very professional expressive and Alex or it's like he's so good at it man.</v>

964
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.770
<v Speaker 3>I think he's got a few times to watch cause fire guys a warm up so it'll stand</v>

965
00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.410
<v Speaker 3>like a thought.</v>

966
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he gets the credit he deserves.</v>

967
00:26:27.881 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 3>I think Jimmy Kim was the best talk show host in the country and the other one's</v>

968
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:31.420
<v Speaker 3>all done right.</v>

969
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Well except I still love Letterman cause he's just,</v>

970
00:26:35.171 --> 00:26:36.340
<v Speaker 3>to me Letterman is just,</v>

971
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.540
<v Speaker 3>he's a staple.</v>

972
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:37.721
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

973
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:38.011
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

974
00:26:38.011 --> 00:26:40.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch those things cause we grew up interview that.</v>

975
00:26:40.361 --> 00:26:41.194
<v Speaker 3>He'll do,</v>

976
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:41.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

977
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.390
<v Speaker 3>once a year.</v>

978
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.673
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

979
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

980
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I've always just the guy he's sold,</v>

981
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 3>he's got so much histories.</v>

982
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean Letterman is so good.</v>

983
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 3>He's so quick.</v>

984
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

985
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Spin around for so long.</v>

986
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:53.770
<v Speaker 3>And I think Jon Stewart too.</v>

987
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch Jon Stewart is it's so committed to politics and that that</v>

988
00:26:57.961 --> 00:26:58.580
<v Speaker 3>political shit.</v>

989
00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:58.711
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

990
00:26:58.711 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch it as much.</v>

991
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe as I would if it was a,</v>

992
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:02.010
<v Speaker 3>just a,</v>

993
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.590
<v Speaker 3>like if Jon Stewart had his own show instead of just the daily show,</v>

994
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:07.740
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's also one of the past matter goes on it all the time now.</v>

995
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

996
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:09.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

997
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:09.601
<v Speaker 3>I'll magical.</v>

998
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:10.321
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the,</v>

999
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:11.154
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1001
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:13.280

1002
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Whatever correspondence.</v>

1003
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 3>How magical is this shit?</v>

1004
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.180
<v Speaker 3>He's such a great guy.</v>

1005
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 3>That uh,</v>

1007
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 3>that guy's the best til easily.</v>

1008
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:22.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1009
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the best at political stuff that cove the shore.</v>

1010
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.510
<v Speaker 3>That fucking tastes great until he does.</v>

1011
00:27:27.511 --> 00:27:27.811
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1012
00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 3>how does it keep this character?</v>

1013
00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:30.474
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1014
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 3>it keeps it going to take the opposite approach.</v>

1015
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Smart opposite side.</v>

1016
00:27:34.561 --> 00:27:35.970
<v Speaker 3>In order to mark that opposite side.</v>

1017

1062
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:33.951
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

1063
00:28:33.951 --> 00:28:34.320
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:35.220
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>

1066
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:35.910
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

1067
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:36.743
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1068
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like some kinds of company that's there.</v>

1069
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1070
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.890
<v Speaker 1>She goes see Israel and yoga retreat and,</v>

1071
00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 1>and so because you bought her ticket last second and uh,</v>

1072
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.880
<v Speaker 1>because she was going by herself,</v>

1073
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I guess she,</v>

1074
00:28:49.271 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1075
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 1>she's not Jewish.</v>

1076
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:53.670
<v Speaker 1>And I guess it's at a time of war kind of.</v>

1077
00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of worry right now.</v>

1078
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.490
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1079
00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.430
<v Speaker 1>so they took her luggage for like three or four days and uh,</v>

1080
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:04.310
<v Speaker 1>she had to buy all new clothes and they thought she wears,</v>

1081
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1082
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>got questioned up and down,</v>

1083
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:06.811
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1084
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1085
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess they really thought that she was some kind of like,</v>

1086
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1087
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:11.874
<v Speaker 1>terrorist thing.</v>

1088
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 1>There was a girl who was a Jewish photographer when she was over in Israel and</v>

1089
00:29:15.061 --> 00:29:16.770
<v Speaker 1>she was taking pictures and they leave.</v>

1090
00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:21.510
<v Speaker 1>What's no of a artwork like a Palestinian graffiti.</v>

1091
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1092
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.200
<v Speaker 1>since she had a photo of it on her laptop,</v>

1093
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.630
<v Speaker 1>the guys at the Israel,</v>

1094
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the tea has their version of Tsa.</v>

1095
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 1>They shot her laptop,</v>

1096
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.580
<v Speaker 1>the shot it,</v>

1097
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Speaker 1>they fucking shot it and they gave it back to her.</v>

1098
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.710
<v Speaker 1>They blew a hole through it.</v>

1099
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:37.731
<v Speaker 1>Can I think,</v>

1101
00:29:37.731 --> 00:29:38.880
<v Speaker 1>just take out the hard drive and go,</v>

1102
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:39.220
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1103
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.500
<v Speaker 1>here's your laptop back.</v>

1104
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.963
<v Speaker 3>Where did they shoot?</v>

1105
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.320
<v Speaker 3>They shot it in the back.</v>

1106
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 3>She heard a bang and then the guy comes out and gives her a laptop and it's got</v>

1107
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 3>a bullet hole on it.</v>

1108
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1109
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.213
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1110
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I think he's trying to let her know,</v>

1111
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:54.020
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>

1112
00:29:54.021 --> 00:29:54.854
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1113
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he knew that she was a journalist.</v>

1114
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 3>I think she probably thought she was someone that was seeing this and she was</v>

1115
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:02.830
<v Speaker 3>taking pictures of it,</v>

1116
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 3>like she thought it was funny or cool or whatever for whatever disrespectful</v>

1117
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:07.661
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

1118
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:10.390
<v Speaker 3>This chick had it on her laptop and his eyes and he was like,</v>

1119
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:10.481
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1120
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:11.020
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

1121
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:11.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1122
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 3>you let you like looking at that and you're like looking at someone talking shit</v>

1123
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 3>about us,</v>

1124
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 3>so he fucking,</v>

1125
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.810
<v Speaker 3>so he'd just run down a hall,</v>

1126
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.940
<v Speaker 3>pass on graffiti and shot it.</v>

1127
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:19.091
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1128
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 3>he checked all her stuff and as he's checking her laptop,</v>

1129
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:23.410
<v Speaker 3>he went through all of her photographs and as he's going through her</v>

1130
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:23.981
<v Speaker 3>photographs,</v>

1131
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:28.210
<v Speaker 3>he saw this antisemetic graffiti that she had photographs of,</v>

1132
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.290
<v Speaker 3>so he closes it,</v>

1133
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.210
<v Speaker 3>pushes it aside and fucking shoots it.</v>

1134
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1135
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.263
<v Speaker 3>pretty intense.</v>

1137
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I just know how to shoot.</v>

1138
00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:36.770
<v Speaker 2>She travels though.</v>

1139
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I know that she probably had at least 20 to 30 different vibrators or dildos are</v>

1140
00:30:41.571 --> 00:30:42.261
<v Speaker 2>sex toys in there,</v>

1141
00:30:42.261 --> 00:30:45.530
<v Speaker 2>so I wonder if that they thought all that shit with some kind of weapon,</v>

1142
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.130
<v Speaker 2>so I could just imagine all these Jewish guys like with these big vibrators.</v>

1143
00:30:49.131 --> 00:30:49.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1144
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's okay.</v>

1145
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:53.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:30:53.911 --> 00:30:55.130
<v Speaker 3>At least they searched everybody.</v>

1147
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.740
<v Speaker 3>There is such a massive difference between Jews in America,</v>

1148
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:59.783
<v Speaker 3>Jews in Israel,</v>

1149
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.820
<v Speaker 3>there's really no one's there to</v>

1150
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:04.950
<v Speaker 3>consider because of the aesthetics.</v>

1151
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.420
<v Speaker 2>She said she went right to the beach and it was just dirty and scary and then</v>

1152
00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:10.140
<v Speaker 2>she went to,</v>

1153
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1154
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.270
<v Speaker 2>a couple of the places that,</v>

1155
00:31:12.271 --> 00:31:15.480
<v Speaker 2>and it was just really freaky because there was people who are walking around</v>

1156
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.750
<v Speaker 2>with machine guns and then she said there was a lot of gay people and one of the</v>

1157
00:31:18.751 --> 00:31:19.560
<v Speaker 2>cities,</v>

1158
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 2>because I guess that's just new thing there,</v>

1159
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.280
<v Speaker 2>that new thing.</v>

1160
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.040

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.000
<v Speaker 7>The army people don't know all the time.</v>

1169
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.050
<v Speaker 7>It takes some time ago.</v>

1170
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:36.460

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.151
<v Speaker 7>Two and a half years.</v>

00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:40.650
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

1176
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.580
<v Speaker 7>What was it like for you?</v>

1177
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.833
<v Speaker 7>It was great.</v>

1178
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.770
<v Speaker 7>It's such a beautiful country and Jerusalem is all built out of stone,</v>

1179
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.920
<v Speaker 7>pretty much down the old Jerusalem and everywhere.</v>

1180
00:31:49.921 --> 00:31:50.754
<v Speaker 7>It's just like,</v>

1181
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:51.481
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1182
00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:51.990
<v Speaker 7>things are great.</v>

1183
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.870
<v Speaker 7>Everybody sort of knows each other a little bit.</v>

1184
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.741
<v Speaker 7>Not like completely,</v>

1185
00:31:55.741 --> 00:31:56.191
<v Speaker 7>but they're all,</v>

1186
00:31:56.191 --> 00:32:00.510
<v Speaker 7>I mean until recently you could hitchhike everywhere really in between places</v>

1187
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.430
<v Speaker 7>and you just tell him completely different now though,</v>

1188
00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:03.110
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1189
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.270
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.240
<v Speaker 7>the intifadas change the tanks,</v>

1191
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.650
<v Speaker 7>but the uprising,</v>

1192
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.080
<v Speaker 7>the Palestinian uprising,</v>

1193
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:10.471
<v Speaker 7>that's what they call it.</v>

1194
00:32:10.471 --> 00:32:12.030
<v Speaker 7>The end of file [inaudible] so yeah,</v>

1195
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.893
<v Speaker 7>that's what they call it.</v>

1196
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.003
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

1197
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.050
<v Speaker 7>What is the issue giving up land?</v>

1198
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.670
<v Speaker 7>What's the actual issue?</v>

1199
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.070
<v Speaker 7>Actual issues Palestinians started in,</v>

1200
00:32:21.071 --> 00:32:22.740
<v Speaker 7>their chief tenant was,</v>

1201
00:32:22.741 --> 00:32:26.040
<v Speaker 7>we want to drive the Israelis into the sea and they're never going to give up on</v>

1202
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:26.760
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1203
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.570
<v Speaker 7>How was in their books?</v>

1204
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.403
<v Speaker 7>That's what they wanted.</v>

1205
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:33.750
<v Speaker 7>They will never rest until all the Israelis are driven into the oceans that says</v>

1206
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.530
<v Speaker 7>they want.</v>

1207
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.110
<v Speaker 7>So in the meantime you have to figure out a way to like appease enough of them</v>

1208
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 7>to give them the right amount of land and let the other ones not</v>

1209
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.780
<v Speaker 3>keep going to war with us with them.</v>

1210
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.340
<v Speaker 3>So when you say that that's in,</v>

1211
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:44.061
<v Speaker 3>it's in their book,</v>

1212
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 3>is that like in one of the religious books?</v>

1213
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:45.951
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1214
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:49.670
<v Speaker 3>the PLO when they started that was one of the Palestinian Liberation</v>

1215
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Organization and that was linked a lot of terrorist shit in the 1970s right?</v>

1216
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that the Munich Munich articles?</v>

1217
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:56.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:32:56.211 --> 00:32:57.044
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1219
00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.090
<v Speaker 3>the killings at the,</v>

1220
00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.331
<v Speaker 3>at the Olympic Games.</v>

1221
00:32:59.331 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1222
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.493
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1223
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.800
<v Speaker 7>So what's the other side say?</v>

1224
00:33:01.801 --> 00:33:01.981
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

1225
00:33:01.981 --> 00:33:02.071
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1226
00:33:02.071 --> 00:33:04.030
<v Speaker 7>what's their story like if you talked to Sam Aaa,</v>

1227
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:09.050
<v Speaker 7>what would he say that Pam would say he's Armenian and quit downplaying his</v>

1228
00:33:09.091 --> 00:33:11.820
<v Speaker 7>struggle for the struggle of the Palestinians.</v>

1229
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:12.421
<v Speaker 7>He goes,</v>

1230
00:33:12.421 --> 00:33:15.150
<v Speaker 7>no one ever fucking respects those Armenians.</v>

1231
00:33:15.151 --> 00:33:16.140
<v Speaker 7>The Turks wipe them out.</v>

1232
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:17.901
<v Speaker 3>Genocide.</v>

1233
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:21.340
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even hear about it until Manny GAM Berean I was doing,</v>

1234
00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 3>he kind of bursary of the Armenian genocide.</v>

1235
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:26.950
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1236
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:27.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm honest,</v>

1237
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't know about it.</v>

1238
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1239
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm ignorant to it.</v>

1240
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.190
<v Speaker 3>It was because the only 1 million people died.</v>

1241
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.293
<v Speaker 3>Got another word.</v>

1242
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:38.810
<v Speaker 3>Fucking incredible that there's been so many horrible things like that that have</v>

1243
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 3>happened in the history of the world.</v>

1244
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Rather,</v>

1245
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 3>you know that this Armenian genocide could be something that I wasn't aware of.</v>

1246
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's hate [inaudible] hate them.</v>

1249
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.600
<v Speaker 3>he was Turkish and they hated the Greeks.</v>

1250
00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Like Greeks and Turkish hated each other.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Cut boots.</v>

1258
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 3>I always thought it was so ridiculous.</v>

1259
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:08.324
<v Speaker 3>It was like a kibbutz.</v>

1260
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Turks and Greeks really in there in his eyes,</v>

1261
00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:12.951
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1262
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:13.401
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1263
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 3>it was like a serious conversation.</v>

1264
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:15.750
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

1265
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:16.490
<v Speaker 3>it was smart.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1267

<v Speaker 7>People get nationalistic.</v>

1268
00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.700
<v Speaker 7>I saw that bloody diva,</v>

1269
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.800
<v Speaker 7>a documentary about him wherever he was from going to war,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1271
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.113
<v Speaker 7>internal strife,</v>

1272
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.540
<v Speaker 7>maybe Czechoslovakia or Hungary and a,</v>

1273
00:34:27.541 --> 00:34:30.210
<v Speaker 7>and his teammates were like all abandoned him cause he wanted to like unity and</v>

1274
00:34:30.211 --> 00:34:31.170
<v Speaker 7>they wanted to break off.</v>

1275
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.990
<v Speaker 7>And there's all these like people there that were like 25,</v>

1276
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:34.411
<v Speaker 7>26,</v>

1277
00:34:34.411 --> 00:34:38.550
<v Speaker 7>like waving like the break off flags are getting really passionate.</v>

1278
00:34:38.551 --> 00:34:39.384
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

1279
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:39.661
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1280
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:41.010
<v Speaker 7>I've never been into shit like that.</v>

1281
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.820
<v Speaker 7>Like I'm just,</v>

1282
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.560
<v Speaker 7>we were all just like video games and whatever else.</v>

1283
00:34:43.561 --> 00:34:43.951
<v Speaker 7>There was like,</v>

1284
00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:45.240
<v Speaker 7>I can't imagine caring.</v>

1285
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:45.661
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1286
00:34:45.661 --> 00:34:47.010
<v Speaker 7>you had this enough,</v>

1287
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.270
<v Speaker 7>but you would if you were there.</v>

1288
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:48.800
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1289
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.300
<v Speaker 7>you will.</v>

1290
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.050
<v Speaker 7>What are the east coast was trying to break off and there was this nationalistic</v>

1291
00:34:52.051 --> 00:34:53.880
<v Speaker 7>feel for the east coast and we're different than them.</v>

1292
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.860
<v Speaker 7>Would you get caught up in it when you were little?</v>

1293
00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.440
<v Speaker 7>If you lived in that environment,</v>

1294
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:59.430
<v Speaker 7>it's unlikely you would,</v>

1295
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.380
<v Speaker 7>I guess be a Yankee Fan.</v>

1296
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 7>It's so easy to imitate your ass over.</v>

1297
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.560
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy to get sucked up in the wave of your atmosphere.</v>

1298
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.970
<v Speaker 3>It's just so weird when you think about how much human behavior can vary from</v>

1299
00:35:10.971 --> 00:35:11.990
<v Speaker 3>spot to spot.</v>

1300
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 3>We have no strife and soquel yeah,</v>

1301
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.570
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't,</v>

1302
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:14.841
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1303
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:15.261
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1304
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1305
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:19.490
<v Speaker 3>dealing with the weather that are only problems are so many of us and we need a</v>

1306
00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:20.120
<v Speaker 3>lot of food.</v>

1307
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 3>No War overseas us,</v>

1309
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:22.993
<v Speaker 3>we'd,</v>

1310
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:24.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1311
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.790
<v Speaker 3>your perspective here,</v>

1312
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:29.180
<v Speaker 3>that's why someone like Paris Hilton can be so offensive to people in other</v>

1313
00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:30.014
<v Speaker 3>parts of the world.</v>

1314
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.670
<v Speaker 3>Someone was just shallowly trying to attract attention to herself for no for no</v>

1315
00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:35.504
<v Speaker 3>reason at all.</v>

1316
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.050
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

1317
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.740
<v Speaker 3>when it's successful angers you.</v>

1318
00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:42.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like why is this even projected in front of me in a time where people are</v>

1319
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:43.680
<v Speaker 3>just dying?</v>

1320
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Paris Hilton.</v>

1321
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.141
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1322
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons because there's so vapid cause behind wanting to be</v>

1323
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.870
<v Speaker 3>famous only for being famous.</v>

1324
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 3>It's so vapid.</v>

1325
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.480
<v Speaker 3>There's enough other people who are into it.</v>

1326
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Well this is why they keep it on like that and the Kardashians.</v>

1327
00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 3>The issue is it opened up a whole new category of human being and that category</v>

1328
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:06.410
<v Speaker 3>of human being is the same as professional celebrity for no reasons.</v>

1329
00:36:06.411 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Celebrity,</v>

1330
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.461
<v Speaker 3>the the,</v>

1331
00:36:07.461 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1332
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.170
<v Speaker 3>the person who sneaks through the net and creates a whole new genre and it's</v>

1333
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 3>essentially Kim Kardashian is a reality celebrity,</v>

1334
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 3>but she's a hugely successful media personality and she did it from being just a</v>

1335
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:23.640
<v Speaker 3>person who fucked a guy in a video.</v>

1336
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:23.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1337
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is really like I'd heard dad was a lawyer.</v>

1338
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>

1340
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:29.780
<v Speaker 3>a famous and a lawyer,</v>

1341
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 3>a famous lawyer who got Oj Simpson off,</v>

1342
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.830
<v Speaker 3>but the whole thing behind it is that it's this,</v>

1343
00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:40.440
<v Speaker 3>this weird desire to get attention for no reason.</v>

1344
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>

1345
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 3>you want attention not offering anything.</v>

1346
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.840
<v Speaker 3>You just want people to look at you.</v>

1347
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:46.800
<v Speaker 3>You're not trying to sing,</v>

1348
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 3>he just want people to follow you around.</v>

1349
00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:50.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like a lot of people want that,</v>

1350
00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:52.230
<v Speaker 3>but only something that is so specific.</v>

1351
00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 3>It must be so hard to arrange.</v>

1352
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1353
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:54.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1354
00:36:54.991 --> 00:36:55.061
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1355
00:36:55.061 --> 00:36:56.670
<v Speaker 3>you're not trying to do anything.</v>

1356
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1357
00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.170
<v Speaker 3>I want to be famous.</v>

1358
00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.003
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

1359
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't do anything.</v>

1360
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.070
<v Speaker 3>But then people keep walking.</v>

1361
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Speaker 3>So then you feel entirely like,</v>

1362
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:02.251
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1363
00:37:02.251 --> 00:37:02.971
<v Speaker 3>lots of great stuff.</v>

1364
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1365
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 3>What are these great things you do?</v>

1366
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:04.941
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1367
00:37:04.941 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 3>she fucked on video.</v>

1368
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.211
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1369
00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:07.530
<v Speaker 3>really that was the catalyst.</v>

1370
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:08.670
<v Speaker 3>That's what started it all off.</v>

1371
00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.950
<v Speaker 3>So they both did the same thing.</v>

1372
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 3>They both fucked on video and that got him into the spotlight and now you're</v>

1373
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 3>getting the white spots now.</v>

1374
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:16.680
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing,</v>

1375
00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:16.940
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1376
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 3>It is really an amazing trick.</v>

1377
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:19.770
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>

1378
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.371
<v Speaker 3>It launched Paris,</v>

1379
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:20.820
<v Speaker 3>hold them from it.</v>

1380
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Just a model to of those reality shows.</v>

1381
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1382
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:24.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1383
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:25.171
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1384
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:25.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1385
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.900
<v Speaker 3>but Kim Kardashians far eclipse Paris Hilton,</v>

1386
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:31.620
<v Speaker 3>which is even more fantastic because Paris Hilton now does interviews and they</v>

1387
00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:31.981
<v Speaker 3>ask her,</v>

1388
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:33.510
<v Speaker 3>are you worried that your population,</v>

1389
00:37:33.511 --> 00:37:35.130
<v Speaker 3>your popularity might be waning?</v>

1390
00:37:35.131 --> 00:37:36.420
<v Speaker 3>And she got up and left.</v>

1391
00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:37.640
<v Speaker 3>He got pissed and totally,</v>

1392
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:37.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1393
00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Told her publicist deserve it.</v>

1394
00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Why would it go away?</v>

1395
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.211
<v Speaker 3>That's still done.</v>

1396
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:43.044
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

1397
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:44.150
<v Speaker 3>So how could it go?</v>

1398
00:37:44.151 --> 00:37:44.821
<v Speaker 3>He's not thinking.</v>

1399
00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 3>He's nearly as clearly as yo,</v>

1400
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.710
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

1401
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.341
<v Speaker 3>she's thinking,</v>

1402
00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:48.390
<v Speaker 3>why would a,</v>

1403
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm still awesome,</v>

1404
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Ashley.</v>

1405
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.543
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

1406
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 3>she's probably a fine person.</v>

1407
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:54.421
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1408
00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I probably know she was probably not a five.</v>

1409
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:57.990
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

1410
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 3>She's self a titled,</v>

1411
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.061
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

1412
00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:01.320
<v Speaker 3>She's probably a fine person.</v>

1413
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 3>I bet if she was sucking your cock,</v>

1414
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd have to be great at sucking Dick [inaudible] with her.</v>

1415
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.440
<v Speaker 3>You were hanging out with her and maybe she's a little crazy and she grew up</v>

1416
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:10.921
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>

1417
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:11.460
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>

1418
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.121
<v Speaker 3>she's a kind.</v>

1419
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I would give her a chance because I want the blow job.</v>

1420
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:14.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1421
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that'd be a real possibility.</v>

1422
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:17.160
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be mean right away,</v>

1423
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:19.370
<v Speaker 3>but there's no way she wouldn't be helping you right away,</v>

1424
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 3>but be batching your life in any way that's maybe not like a 5% chance.</v>

1425
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Maybe get her high on mushrooms and straighten her out.</v>

1426
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:26.281
<v Speaker 3>And Dude,</v>

1427
00:38:26.281 --> 00:38:27.060
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's you.</v>

1428
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's Ari who can straighten the whole thing out.</v>

1429
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Who better than the founder mushroom fest.</v>

1459
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.401

<v Speaker 3>if you thought he could fly,</v>

1463
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:08.800
<v Speaker 3>why don't you start off on the ground first?</v>

1464
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:09.941
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

1465

<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

1472
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Are you like a Hicks Joe?</v>

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.060
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1476
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.180
<v Speaker 3>I would ask to hear him say it taught me also had this,</v>

1477
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.700
<v Speaker 3>you never hear a positive drug store in the news.</v>

1478
00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:30.760
<v Speaker 3>And I don't want to butcher this because I don't want to paraphrase it,</v>

1479
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.410
<v Speaker 3>but as young man on acid,</v>

1480
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:32.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1481
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:36.130
<v Speaker 3>and it was a beautiful positive message that he learned from acid.</v>

1482
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1486
00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:48.010
<v Speaker 3>The human body is so fucking for some folks so fragile.</v>

1487
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>totally sounds like complete horse shit.</v>

1511
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.000
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1512
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.370
<v Speaker 3>the pictures are really bizarre man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1515
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 3>there's like actual fiber that's coming out of their skin.</v>

1520
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:40.841
<v Speaker 3>this is something,</v>

1521
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:45.160
<v Speaker 3>a fiber that they pulled out of someone's skin that had this more jealous.</v>

1522
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:45.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1524
00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:48.880
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a sweaters growing inside of you.</v>

1525
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.810
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a mosquito down of that.</v>

1526
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1527
00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Well that picture is like pretty extreme,</v>

1528
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.140
<v Speaker 3>but it goes around what a,</v>

1529
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:56.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1530
00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:59.020
<v Speaker 3>what a fucking weird disease man.</v>

1531
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:01.690
<v Speaker 3>And no one knows what the hell that is.</v>

1532
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1533
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:03.851
<v Speaker 3>these people,</v>

1534
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 3>some of them have gloves on and they have these fucking hairs that are growing</v>

1535
00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:09.070
<v Speaker 3>out of all over their body.</v>

1536
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a relatively new problems,</v>

1537
00:41:10.761 --> 00:41:14.050
<v Speaker 3>seems to be growing in leaps and bounds throughout the u s even in other</v>

1538
00:41:14.051 --> 00:41:14.471
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

1539
00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 3>Although condition where Jones possibly dates back to the 16 hundreds it's only</v>

1540
00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:20.980
<v Speaker 3>been since 2002 that it's become a modern,</v>

1541
00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 3>dank concern.</v>

1542
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.110
<v Speaker 3>It's probably has something to do it.</v>

1543
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:23.944
<v Speaker 3>The Internet.</v>

1544
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.023
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1545
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1546
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Like wifi where we're growing wires and you imagine if that was really what it</v>

1547
00:41:30.251 --> 00:41:31.350
<v Speaker 3>is growing in tennis.</v>

1548
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.440
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

1549
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:32.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1550
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:33.530
<v Speaker 3>crazy would be,</v>

1551
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 3>that's the next stage of development and autism and I'm tell us different</v>

1552
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:38.541
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1553
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 3>We can't keep thinking that we're going to stay the way we are.</v>

1554
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:42.381
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1555
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:42.570
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1556
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 3>is this supposed to happen so slowly that you would never in one lifetime notice</v>

1557
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:46.904
<v Speaker 3>any change?</v>

1558
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 3>How do we know that?</v>

1559
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:48.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1560
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:51.770
<v Speaker 3>there's been a lot of discrepancies about like how long it takes.</v>

1561
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

1562
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of arguments and disagreements about how long it takes for an</v>

1563
00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:56.450
<v Speaker 3>entity to evolve,</v>

1564
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.090
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that they know is the Congo.</v>

1565
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 3>The Congo is a kind of a crazy place where it used to be grasslands and then a</v>

1566
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:08.831
<v Speaker 3>rain forests essentially grew there really rapidly and over a period of 2000</v>

1567
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 3>years became a dent,</v>

1568
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 3>massive rain forest where it used to be grasslands,</v>

1569
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:19.391
<v Speaker 3>so all these grasslands animals got trapped in the jungle and had to evolve.</v>

1570
00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 3>They had to change and one of them,</v>

1571
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:21.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1572
00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:26.590
<v Speaker 3>an antelope thing called a Diker and how much time whims,</v>

1573
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.673
<v Speaker 3>how much time is this?</v>

1574
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Less than 2000 years.</v>

1575
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Swims underwater and eat fish.</v>

1576
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1577
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:33.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1578
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 3>It's in the answer when family,</v>

1579
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:35.810
<v Speaker 3>it's called,</v>

1580
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:37.160
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called a Diker.</v>

1581
00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1582
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1583
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.040
<v Speaker 3>It actually swims underwater and fucking eats fish.</v>

1584
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:42.860
<v Speaker 3>It can swim under water for a hundred yards.</v>

1585
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1586
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:43.931
<v Speaker 3>How is it?</v>

1587
00:42:43.931 --> 00:42:44.260
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

1588
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Speaker 3>where'd that come from?</v>

1589
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:45.951
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why.</v>

1590
00:42:45.951 --> 00:42:47.500
<v Speaker 3>They had to figure out how to survive.</v>

1591
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Somebody has the part like let's say grow a third eye.</v>

1592
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say somebody had the first pure person as it slowly developed to see</v>

1593
00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 3>through that somebody is going to be the first guy to have that.</v>

1594
00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 3>If something like that would mutate and happen and become a successful</v>

1595
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:00.981
<v Speaker 3>transition.</v>

1596
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:01.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1597
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 3>someone would have to be the first,</v>

1598
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 3>or at least have the first,</v>

1599
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:04.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1600
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 3>like stubs of it.</v>

1601
00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

1602
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.250
<v Speaker 3>like some people are born with like a little stub of a tail,</v>

1603
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:09.263
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1604
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1605
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.101
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

1606
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:10.880
<v Speaker 3>The Pink Tab,</v>

1607
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.200
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

1608
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 3>how come chimps don't have tails and we're supposed to be related to chimps,</v>

1609
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.760
<v Speaker 3>to chimps ever get they ever born with a little tail.</v>

1610
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Most of us don't have it though.</v>

1611
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:18.381
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1612
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Very few of us have it.</v>

1613
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's just a normal deformity.</v>

1614
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Just a normal slip of it's your brother's.</v>

1615
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Can anybody move it and then tail that would be fucked.</v>

1616
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you are a person you can wag your tail to as a cat tail that would</v>

1617
00:43:32.001 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 3>you even want to take it off?</v>

1618
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.483
<v Speaker 3>It's a cat tail.</v>

1619
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1620
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:36.440
<v Speaker 3>You'd probably find some weird pride out of it,</v>

1621
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:37.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's like it's not</v>

1622
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.710
<v Speaker 3>because of it.</v>

1623
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Ah.</v>

1624
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:41.391
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1625
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:42.530
<v Speaker 3>If you could do that flying,</v>

1626
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:44.330
<v Speaker 3>we'll end this shit like no problem.</v>

1627
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Cause you gotta kiss because of that.</v>

1628
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.161
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1629
00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:47.840
<v Speaker 3>cats have the most ridiculous balance,</v>

1630
00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:48.380
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1631
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:51.140
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to push cats off of like banisters.</v>

1632
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:52.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky enough that pastor batch and the cats like,</v>

1633
00:43:52.821 --> 00:43:57.440
<v Speaker 3>oh not all the way off like a weeble wobble then right back slide sideways on a</v>

1634
00:43:57.441 --> 00:43:58.274
<v Speaker 3>banister.</v>

1635
00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:03.370
<v Speaker 3>She see that video that chimp versus the cat UFC match.</v>

1636
00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1637
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 3>it's bad ass.</v>

1638
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Google it sometime.</v>

1639
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:07.064
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1640
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.641
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1641
00:44:07.641 --> 00:44:10.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a little monkey and a cat fighting or they're really fighting or they</v>

1642
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:10.851
<v Speaker 3>playing.</v>

1643
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:11.391
<v Speaker 3>They're playing.</v>

1644
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:12.270
<v Speaker 3>But the cat has,</v>

1645
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 3>some cats have really good Jujitsu.</v>

1646
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh they grew up around chit chats or you know,</v>

1647
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.281
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1648
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:20.570
<v Speaker 3>we're just comfortable with them cause they're really tiny.</v>

1649
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.630
<v Speaker 3>They're all fearful in Israel.</v>

1650
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 3>All cats.</v>

1651
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1652
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:26.900
<v Speaker 3>They brought him in and nobody has them as pets because they're so fucking</v>

1653
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:27.470
<v Speaker 3>disgusting.</v>

1654
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:32.030
<v Speaker 3>They brought them into to hunt rats and they just switched yet then they right.</v>

1655
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 3>No natural enemies.</v>

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 3>You guys should kill him off because I bet you got toxo plasma like a</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh Way.</v>

1669
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:55.110

1670
00:44:55.111 --> 00:44:59.220
<v Speaker 3>be fucking can I can say or maybe I just thought was just a normal cat and it</v>

1671
00:44:59.221 --> 00:45:00.054
<v Speaker 3>was just crazy.</v>

1672
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 3>Well feral cats or just wildcats.</v>

1673
00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1674
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.720
<v Speaker 3>it's an amazing difference.</v>

1675
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:04.230
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1676
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.063
<v Speaker 3>the way they behave.</v>

1677
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Barn cats or you're talking about,</v>

1678
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure farm cats can be feral to cancer.</v>

1679
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Just retarded big.</v>

1680
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.880
<v Speaker 3>The guy straight up on walls so high.</v>

1681
00:45:12.881 --> 00:45:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Like how are you going to get up there?</v>

1682
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 3>Feral cats or feral kitten and I uh,</v>

1683
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:21.180
<v Speaker 3>they only will connect themselves to one or two people.</v>

1684
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

1685
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:22.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1686
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 3>they really hate people.</v>

1687
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 3>I was the only person that this cat could like trust enough to pick up horses.</v>

1688
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:28.471
<v Speaker 3>And I could never,</v>

1689
00:45:28.471 --> 00:45:30.030
<v Speaker 3>if he was something was wrong with him,</v>

1690
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:31.140
<v Speaker 3>I can never bring him to the vet.</v>

1691
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.153
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't,</v>

1692
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 3>no one can take care of him but me,</v>

1693
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.070
<v Speaker 3>no one can even hold them at me.</v>

1694
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.110
<v Speaker 3>And I got him because a friend of mine,</v>

1695
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1696
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.311
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1697
00:45:38.311 --> 00:45:38.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1698
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.030
<v Speaker 3>was living in this apartment building and her and her boyfriend found them</v>

1699
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:42.960
<v Speaker 3>underneath the house.</v>

1700
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 3>They found like a whole litter of kittens and apparently the mother had died or</v>

1701
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:49.590
<v Speaker 3>something like that though it was a wild cat and she gave birth.</v>

1702
00:45:49.591 --> 00:45:51.450
<v Speaker 3>So they captured all the kittens.</v>

1703
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:52.480
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1704
00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.020
<v Speaker 3>then they started trying to find homes for them.</v>

1705
00:45:54.021 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1706
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:54.551
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1707

1708
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.210
<v Speaker 3>it's such a crazy story I got to take.</v>

1709
00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.050
<v Speaker 3>So I took it and I,</v>

1710
00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:58.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1711
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:03.680
<v Speaker 3>I had to stay in a room with it for two days because it was so crazy and so</v>

1712
00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:04.411
<v Speaker 3>nuts,</v>

1713

1715
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.110
<v Speaker 3>So I just put a room in my house.</v>

1716
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.541
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1719
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:16.700

1720
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 3>some books.</v>

1721
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1722
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1723
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:18.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1728

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.883
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

<v Speaker 7>they'll give you a kid,</v>

1795
00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.020

<v Speaker 7>I forgot.</v>

1799
00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.610
<v Speaker 7>And you've got to make sure nothing goes wrong with it.</v>

1800
00:48:13.611 --> 00:48:14.421
<v Speaker 7>If something goes wrong with it,</v>

1801
00:48:14.421 --> 00:48:15.021
<v Speaker 7>if it gets sick,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you're in trouble.</v>

1803
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.421
<v Speaker 7>You got to take care of it.</v>

1804
00:48:16.421 --> 00:48:19.460
<v Speaker 7>In addition to running all your laps and doing everything and doing all your</v>

1812
00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.420
<v Speaker 7>After you've cared for it for two weeks.</v>

1813
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:36.990
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible]</v>

1814
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.650
<v Speaker 5>bare hands,</v>

1815
00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:39.150
<v Speaker 5>not even like give it up for adoption.</v>

1816
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.963
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

1817
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:42.803
<v Speaker 5>What was,</v>

1818
00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:47.130
<v Speaker 5>what was the story in the Bible where God was telling someone to kill his son?</v>

1819
00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.053
<v Speaker 5>Abraham?</v>

1820
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.420
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1821
00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.190
<v Speaker 5>What was the story behind those test</v>

1822
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:52.980
<v Speaker 7>to kill Isaac is a kill eyes.</v>

1823
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:54.040
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

1824
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 7>it was,</v>

1825
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:54.930
<v Speaker 7>it was,</v>

1826
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1827
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.880
<v Speaker 7>was it not as firstborn what size he was first born.</v>

1828
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:00.183
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1829
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.060
<v Speaker 7>and then this is when those split off happened between the Arabs and the Jews.</v>

1830
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.020
<v Speaker 7>It was right then.</v>

1831
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:05.440
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>

1832
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:05.890
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1833
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:06.340
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

1834
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.460
<v Speaker 7>Because Isaac's brother was technically the first born,</v>

1835
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.480
<v Speaker 7>so he should have gotten the birthright and the Jews say that he,</v>

1836
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.400
<v Speaker 7>he didn't,</v>

1837
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.020
<v Speaker 7>he went to Isaac and then Jacob.</v>

1838
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:18.980
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1839
00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:21.110
<v Speaker 5>So God comes to Abraham,</v>

1840
00:49:21.111 --> 00:49:21.944
<v Speaker 5>I want you to kill us.</v>

1841
00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:23.000
<v Speaker 5>So he takes me to his mountain.</v>

1842
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1843
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.863
<v Speaker 7>Take your son.</v>

1844
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:26.190
<v Speaker 7>It takes them to this mountain,</v>

1845
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.360
<v Speaker 7>puts them up on an altar.</v>

1846
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.823
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1847
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:29.400
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1848
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.233
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

1849
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.400
<v Speaker 7>and then he goes to raise a knife over his head and</v>

1850
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.480
<v Speaker 5>God sent a sign.</v>

1851
00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 5>He sent the ram,</v>

1852
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 5>which is a normal thing.</v>

1853
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:40.870
<v Speaker 5>You sacrificed.</v>

1854
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.700
<v Speaker 5>He sent a ram right then.</v>

1855
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 5>And that was a sign even though rams were indigenous to that area at the time.</v>

1856
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.820
<v Speaker 5>It was definitely a sign from God,</v>

1857
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.060
<v Speaker 5>some retard God who couldn't fucking get his full words out.</v>

1858
00:49:52.061 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 5>So we just have to ramp and that obviously means don't kill your son killed this</v>

1859
00:49:56.171 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 5>ram instead of them blow the horn once or twice a year cause that's so obvious.</v>

1860
00:49:59.951 --> 00:50:00.790
<v Speaker 5>That's what it means.</v>

1861
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.870
<v Speaker 5>Cause he couldn't have just said,</v>

1862
00:50:01.871 --> 00:50:02.560
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1863
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.140
<v Speaker 5>don't kill your son and that's a good enough sign.</v>

1864
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:06.880
<v Speaker 5>He had to send a ram to walk by</v>

1865
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.530
<v Speaker 5>such stupid idiots.</v>

1866
00:50:10.531 --> 00:50:10.871
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

1867
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:12.460
<v Speaker 5>Once you realize what you're getting older,</v>

1868
00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:16.720
<v Speaker 5>you were a little kid and you got sent to Israel to study this 10 12 hours a day</v>

1869
00:50:16.721 --> 00:50:17.554
<v Speaker 5>like already did.</v>

1870
00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:20.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean you'd probably be pretty passionate about how are we supposed to take</v>

1871
00:50:20.231 --> 00:50:20.891
<v Speaker 5>that for granted?</v>

1872
00:50:20.891 --> 00:50:21.730
<v Speaker 5>He sent a sign,</v>

1873
00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:22.780
<v Speaker 5>it was a ram walk by.</v>

1874
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1875
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:23.951
<v Speaker 5>that's a sign.</v>

1876
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:25.530
<v Speaker 5>Obviously crazy was easy.</v>

1877
00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.560
<v Speaker 5>He was about to kill us,</v>

1878
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.970
<v Speaker 5>kill his son because God wanted him to.</v>

1879
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:29.990
<v Speaker 5>And then the issue became like,</v>

1880
00:50:29.991 --> 00:50:31.580
<v Speaker 5>while we were still religious with issue became like,</v>

1881
00:50:31.581 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 5>well why would God command that?</v>

1882
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.160
<v Speaker 5>Why would that be a test for him?</v>

1883
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:35.323
<v Speaker 5>Why would you do it?</v>

1884
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 5>And I just wanted to see,</v>

1885
00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 5>you knew if he was able to,</v>

1886
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:38.961
<v Speaker 5>but there was a test,</v>

1887
00:50:38.961 --> 00:50:39.471
<v Speaker 5>you're God,</v>

1888
00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:40.550
<v Speaker 5>you knew it was going to be able to,</v>

1889
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:42.770
<v Speaker 5>so like why wouldn't you just say,</v>

1890
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.041
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1891
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:43.281
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>

1892
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:43.840
<v Speaker 5>You're up for it.</v>

1893
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.840
<v Speaker 5>You know you would know more than anybody about how much of what you read when</v>

1894
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 5>you were reading the Talmud,</v>

1895
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 5>how much of what you've read had been translated several times.</v>

1896
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.910
<v Speaker 5>How many times had it been translated before it got to,</v>

1897
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.520
<v Speaker 5>when you read it in Modern Day Hebrew,</v>

1898
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:03.890
<v Speaker 5>how many times has it had been transferred to get to that?</v>

1899
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:04.580
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1900
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:05.170
<v Speaker 5>Well it was,</v>

1901
00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:05.640
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1902
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.060
<v Speaker 5>it's the Torah is written exactly the same as it always was.</v>

1903
00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:08.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh wait.</v>

1904
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1905
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.460
<v Speaker 5>So you read it in ancient Hebrew,</v>

1906
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.170
<v Speaker 5>even with the same shapes of the letters,</v>

1907
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.170
<v Speaker 5>he said the old testament that's different.</v>

1908
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1909
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:19.700
<v Speaker 5>Then this whole mode is that was handed down orally for awhile and they were</v>

1910
00:51:19.701 --> 00:51:22.310
<v Speaker 5>afraid it was gonna get lost because of some dispersion.</v>

1911
00:51:22.311 --> 00:51:23.540
<v Speaker 5>So they wrote it down.</v>

1912
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:25.310
<v Speaker 5>But the oldest versions of the Bible,</v>

1913
00:51:25.311 --> 00:51:26.330
<v Speaker 5>of the ancient Hebrew versions,</v>

1914
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:26.451
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1915
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 5>except for the Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>

1916
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.720
<v Speaker 5>which not technically considered the Bible,</v>

1917
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:31.760
<v Speaker 5>even though some of the stories are not 100% on those,</v>

1918
00:51:31.761 --> 00:51:32.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1919
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.330
<v Speaker 5>So they said that the oldest versions were in ancient Hebrew,</v>

1920
00:51:35.331 --> 00:51:36.230
<v Speaker 5>that they,</v>

1921
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 5>the real problem was that they,</v>

1922
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 5>when they translated it to Greek and Latin,</v>

1923
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 5>they said that they only knew like three quarters of the words in ancient Hebrew</v>

1924
00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.320
<v Speaker 5>this specific meetings to words,</v>

1925
00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 5>but they don't know all those because some of those words didn't make it to</v>

1926
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:51.764
<v Speaker 5>modern Hebrew.</v>

1927
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.630
<v Speaker 5>And they don't really have a good lineage to say like,</v>

1928
00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:53.890
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

1929
00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:55.100
<v Speaker 5>where was this exact words?</v>

1930
00:51:55.101 --> 00:51:55.934
<v Speaker 5>Like if I said,</v>

1931
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.863
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1932
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 5>let's just say gently or lovingly,</v>

1933
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.830
<v Speaker 5>they could mean the same thing.</v>

1934
00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:02.960
<v Speaker 5>It's certain times a gently said,</v>

1935
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:04.070
<v Speaker 5>whatever I lovingly said,</v>

1936
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:04.904
<v Speaker 5>it's simply similar,</v>

1937
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.900
<v Speaker 5>but there's differences.</v>

1938
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:07.400
<v Speaker 5>And that's what we have two different words.</v>

1939
00:52:07.401 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 5>When was this transition between ancient,</v>

1940
00:52:09.231 --> 00:52:10.340
<v Speaker 5>he ruined modern hero.</v>

1941
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:14.000
<v Speaker 5>Probably during the dispersion we got cast out to all different,</v>

1942
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:15.650
<v Speaker 5>that's when we got white juries and black jurors.</v>

1943
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 5>After that one's went to the,</v>

1944
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 5>what year was that?</v>

1945
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.373
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1946
00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.760
<v Speaker 5>And so so Israel or the Jews?</v>

1947
00:52:24.761 --> 00:52:25.790
<v Speaker 5>The the modern Jews.</v>

1948
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:28.880
<v Speaker 5>They kept the certain modern version of Hebrew.</v>

1949
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:30.020
<v Speaker 5>It was like 4,000 years ago.</v>

1950
00:52:30.021 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 5>Probably something like that.</v>

1951
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.270
<v Speaker 5>But you guys also have numbers,</v>

1952
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 5>which now they brought it back.</v>

1953
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:34.770
<v Speaker 5>They brought it back when they,</v>

1954
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:36.360
<v Speaker 5>when they went with them.</v>

1955
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:37.760
<v Speaker 5>Sort of a modern Hebrew I guess,</v>

1956
00:52:37.761 --> 00:52:40.310
<v Speaker 5>but they just sort of made it when they decided like what should our language</v>

1957
00:52:40.311 --> 00:52:40.441
<v Speaker 5>back?</v>

1958
00:52:40.441 --> 00:52:40.730
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

1959
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:42.110
<v Speaker 5>let's bring the Hebrew was a dead language.</v>

1960
00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:42.411
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1961
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:45.920
<v Speaker 5>it was a dead language Korean and all those people said,</v>

1962
00:52:45.921 --> 00:52:46.490
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1963
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:47.323
<v Speaker 5>when was this?</v>

1964
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.550
<v Speaker 5>1948 47 holy shit.</v>

1965
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.880
<v Speaker 5>Hebrew was a dead language notice.</v>

1966
00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:54.081
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1967
00:52:54.081 --> 00:52:55.460
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy number to speaking.</v>

1968
00:52:55.461 --> 00:52:56.720
<v Speaker 5>And there's some people that won't,</v>

1969
00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:58.730
<v Speaker 5>that they're treated is like holy,</v>

1970
00:52:58.731 --> 00:52:59.451
<v Speaker 5>that's a little much.</v>

1971
00:52:59.451 --> 00:53:00.231
<v Speaker 5>But the truth is holding,</v>

1972
00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:01.640
<v Speaker 5>they won't speak at the only speak good.</v>

1973
00:53:01.641 --> 00:53:02.211
<v Speaker 5>It's during the week.</v>

1974
00:53:02.211 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 5>And then Shabbat,</v>

1975
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:05.300
<v Speaker 5>that's when he hit him with the Hebrew.</v>

1976
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:06.140
<v Speaker 5>What is she had it?</v>

1977
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.590
<v Speaker 5>What's a different or weird bastardized mixture.</v>

1978
00:53:09.591 --> 00:53:11.330
<v Speaker 5>It's like southern talk creole.</v>

1979
00:53:11.331 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 5>It's like not quite English cause the mixture of Hebrew and like dramatic mixed</v>

1980
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:16.490
<v Speaker 5>with whatever country you're from.</v>

1981
00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.220
<v Speaker 5>When you talk to get you hard,</v>

1982
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:22.130
<v Speaker 5>there's no such things to get us to know because I mean when it talks about its</v>

1983
00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:22.910
<v Speaker 5>old.</v>

1984
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:23.743
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1985
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:24.950
<v Speaker 5>The Jewish?</v>

1986
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1987
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 5>like nobody talks</v>

1988
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.210
<v Speaker 3>like that anymore.</v>

1989
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 3>How much is different in that and and modern Hebrew.</v>

1990
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Yiddish.</v>

1991
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:32.850
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly dramatic.</v>

1992
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.630
<v Speaker 3>German.</v>

1993
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:38.630
<v Speaker 3>So you most most kids understand it like Israeli kids with the German kids,</v>

1994
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 3>you better get it better.</v>

1995
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1996
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1997
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:43.223
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1998
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1999
00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:46.380
<v Speaker 3>God that's so incredible.</v>

2000
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:48.660
<v Speaker 3>When you stop and think about how many different languages there are.</v>

2001
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:49.981
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2002
00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:53.490
<v Speaker 3>They all developed somewhat similarly in how long was it before they actually</v>

2003
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:54.900
<v Speaker 3>started writing shit down?</v>

2004
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:58.230
<v Speaker 3>How long did they have language before they are actually wrote things down?</v>

2005
00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Because I've waited a while before they put signs to it.</v>

2006
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Probably tens of thousands.</v>

2007
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:03.510
<v Speaker 3>It didn't happen the other way.</v>

2008
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:03.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2009
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:07.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long the first written language was,</v>

2010
00:54:07.051 --> 00:54:07.884
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>

2011
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it was more than 10,000 years ago.</v>

2012
00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:11.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2013
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:12.780
<v Speaker 3>Which is really like nothing.</v>

2014
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Here's kind of cranes.</v>

2015
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:16.600
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda hurts your head when he stopped.</v>

2016
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.360
<v Speaker 3>As long as we've been able to communicate without being there.</v>

2017
00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 3>Stop and trying to put your head around that.</v>

2018
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.670
<v Speaker 3>And the way,</v>

2019
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:26.160
<v Speaker 3>this is what I would always use as an example,</v>

2020
00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.950
<v Speaker 3>if I was in a crowd safe,</v>

2021
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I was doing a comedy show and there was 100 people in the audience.</v>

2022
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I would say what you guys represent,</v>

2023
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:34.800
<v Speaker 3>if you lived your lives,</v>

2024
00:54:34.801 --> 00:54:35.521
<v Speaker 3>birth to death,</v>

2025
00:54:35.521 --> 00:54:36.480
<v Speaker 3>it's just a little room,</v>

2026
00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.860
<v Speaker 3>a little tiny group of people,</v>

2027
00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:38.821
<v Speaker 3>100 people.</v>

2028
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:39.031
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2029
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:41.450
<v Speaker 3>but what you represent in terms of potential life,</v>

2030
00:54:41.451 --> 00:54:41.941
<v Speaker 3>his whole life,</v>

2031
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:42.810
<v Speaker 3>the next person was born.</v>

2032
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:43.651
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2033
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 3>If they lived there alone,</v>

2034
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.211
<v Speaker 3>their lives,</v>

2035
00:54:45.211 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 3>birth to death,</v>

2036
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:46.651
<v Speaker 3>to the Max,</v>

2037
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:47.640
<v Speaker 3>which is like a hundred years,</v>

2038
00:54:47.641 --> 00:54:49.290
<v Speaker 3>which is the most anybody ever lives.</v>

2039
00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 3>They represent 10,000 years.</v>

2040
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.600
<v Speaker 3>That's as long as that's incredible.</v>

2041
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.580
<v Speaker 3>That's as long as we know about human beings.</v>

2042
00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2043
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 3>But like 4,000 years ago when we got the Bible around.</v>

2044
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:00.251
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2045
00:55:00.251 --> 00:55:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2046
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:01.561
<v Speaker 3>100 people.</v>

2047
00:55:01.561 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 3>That's when not everyone was like better.</v>

2048
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:03.780
<v Speaker 3>One lived a hundred years.</v>

2049
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not 10,000 a hundred people living a hundred years.</v>

2050
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.300
<v Speaker 3>100 people living tennis is a thousand yeah.</v>

2051
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2052
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:12.330
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible man.</v>

2053
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Stop and think about that 10,000 years ago and it's just a little tiny room full</v>

2054
00:55:16.651 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 3>of people living there.</v>

2055
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Last birth to death represents the big fat long.</v>

2056
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 3>The distance between us of 10 day and nothing written.</v>

2057
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I have three math jokes.</v>

2058
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Yours is way better than all three of those three.</v>

2059
00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:29.221
<v Speaker 3>What jokes?</v>

2060
00:55:29.221 --> 00:55:30.054
<v Speaker 3>Math jokes.</v>

2061
00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I Call Matt jokes where there's numbers involved so they actually have to think</v>

2062
00:55:34.021 --> 00:55:34.854
<v Speaker 3>before they laugh.</v>

2063
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.540
<v Speaker 3>That's not really a math joke,</v>

2064
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's a what the fuck thinking thing.</v>

2065
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like you want to check as math.</v>

2066
00:55:39.991 --> 00:55:40.824
<v Speaker 3>It takes her a second.</v>

2067
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:45.890
<v Speaker 3>I've been really getting into game or game of Thrones first.</v>

2068
00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:46.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2069
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:46.920
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

2070
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.330
<v Speaker 3>It's the best show I've ever watched.</v>

2071
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I watched the whole for cause,</v>

2072
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.720
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I'd love that kind of Shit.</v>

2073
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:52.291
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2074
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Conan the barbarian type swords and sorcery shit.</v>

2075
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I love that stuff.</v>

2076
00:55:57.751 --> 00:55:58.584
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2077
00:55:58.590 --> 00:55:59.081
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

2078
00:55:59.081 --> 00:56:00.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm enjoying the fuck out of it.</v>

2079
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 3>But it's making me think,</v>

2080
00:56:01.621 --> 00:56:01.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2081
00:56:01.771 --> 00:56:03.330
<v Speaker 3>although obviously this is a work of,</v>

2082
00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:03.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2083
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:04.740
<v Speaker 3>fantasy fiction,</v>

2084
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.990
<v Speaker 3>it makes me think of what it must've been like,</v>

2085
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:07.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2086
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.050
<v Speaker 3>if you had to live like these people lived,</v>

2087
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:10.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2088
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.940
<v Speaker 3>with swords on horses.</v>

2089
00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:15.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a time where people actually lived like that.</v>

2090
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:16.260
<v Speaker 3>That is how they hunted.</v>

2091
00:56:16.261 --> 00:56:17.430
<v Speaker 3>They used bows and arrows.</v>

2092
00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:18.870
<v Speaker 3>They did live in these houses.</v>

2093
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:22.050
<v Speaker 3>They did have castles and they did have armies and they did have moats.</v>

2094
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.381
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2095
00:56:22.381 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 3>these are all realistic,</v>

2096
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 3>realistic depictions of a certain time,</v>

2097
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:29.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2098
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:31.780
<v Speaker 3>take away the sorcery and all the other crazy stuff.</v>

2099
00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.070
<v Speaker 3>There was people that in just a few thousand years ago live like that.</v>

2100
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to wrap your head around how short of a distance it is between that</v>

2101
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:45.481
<v Speaker 3>time when people lived like in the Robin Hood days and today it's like nothing.</v>

2102
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:45.840
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2103
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.540
<v Speaker 3>it'd be cool though.</v>

2104
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.280
<v Speaker 3>It would still be cool having like,</v>

2105
00:56:48.281 --> 00:56:48.641
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2106
00:56:48.641 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 3>I got these new silver horse shoes.</v>

2107
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen these things torsional or you know,</v>

2108
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.140
<v Speaker 3>even though you live back in those days,</v>

2109
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:58.730
<v Speaker 3>people were still making new things up and like,</v>

2110
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:00.910
<v Speaker 3>but the things where like differently they make up a new thing.</v>

2111
00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Every like red errors thing would come.</v>

2112
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there was little things here and there though.</v>

2113
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Just like everything.</v>

2114
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2115
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there was a few intervention.</v>

2116
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:10.540
<v Speaker 3>It was so lame.</v>

2117
00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Like well then they got Chinese finger traps.</v>

2118
00:57:12.071 --> 00:57:13.290
<v Speaker 3>They were blown away by that.</v>

2119
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:14.980
<v Speaker 3>That does a party favor.</v>

2120
00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:17.230
<v Speaker 3>But the Black Smith back then was like the apple,</v>

2121
00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.060
<v Speaker 3>like you would come in to come look at this thing.</v>

2122
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2123
00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:19.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2124
00:57:19.641 --> 00:57:21.310
<v Speaker 3>this is a new layer of artisans.</v>

2125
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.230
<v Speaker 3>That's something that's really getting lost.</v>

2126
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 3>You know we talked about that won't Aubrey was on here last,</v>

2127
00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:29.620
<v Speaker 3>we talked about that Musashi documentary.</v>

2128
00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2129
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:32.500
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

2130
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 3>they showed how they used to make Samurai swords and there's a few people alive</v>

2131
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:37.060
<v Speaker 3>but still make them that way today.</v>

2132
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2133
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>

2134
00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to be the ultimate craftsmen.</v>

2135
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:42.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2136
00:57:42.581 --> 00:57:47.581
<v Speaker 3>if you and I were left alone to figure it out on our own for a million years,</v>

2137
00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 3>we'd never figured out how to make a fucking Samurai sword.</v>

2138
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.880
<v Speaker 3>The way they do it is so incredible.</v>

2139
00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:52.350
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2140
00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.590
<v Speaker 3>they hammer it down,</v>

2141
00:57:53.591 --> 00:57:55.870
<v Speaker 3>then they fold it over and then they hammer it down.</v>

2142
00:57:55.871 --> 00:57:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Like they keep flattening it and hammering it and flattening it and hammering</v>

2143
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:04.060
<v Speaker 3>until it becomes this intense steel that you could just fucking slice through</v>

2144
00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:05.200
<v Speaker 3>bamboo.</v>

2145
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.190
<v Speaker 3>It mean it's really amazing watching the,</v>

2146
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:08.421
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2147
00:58:08.421 --> 00:58:08.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2148
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:10.090
<v Speaker 3>the artisan work,</v>

2149
00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 3>the craftsmanship and the,</v>

2150
00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge passed down through generations and generations of how to make a</v>

2151
00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:16.324
<v Speaker 3>sword.</v>

2152
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.721
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2153
00:58:16.721 --> 00:58:17.760
<v Speaker 3>when you stop and think about it,</v>

2154
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:22.030
<v Speaker 3>it's like how many people are out there in the world today that know how to make</v>

2155
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 3>anything even remotely like that.</v>

2156
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Everything we're buying that's manufactured is manufactured in some sort of a</v>

2157
00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:28.841
<v Speaker 3>factor.</v>

2158
00:58:28.841 --> 00:58:30.070
<v Speaker 3>And if you're going to buy a sword,</v>

2159
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 3>this is a big machine's going to cut it and make it with a computer on a laser</v>

2160
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:34.660
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

2161
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 3>There's not going to be some Japanese dude and flip flops with wooden bottom</v>

2162
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:39.041
<v Speaker 3>shoes.</v>

2163
00:58:39.041 --> 00:58:39.874
<v Speaker 3>Fucking wrong.</v>

2164
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.150
<v Speaker 3>It's wild to watch,</v>

2165
00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:43.391
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2166
00:58:43.391 --> 00:58:43.840
<v Speaker 3>It's wild.</v>

2167
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.010
<v Speaker 3>It's wild to watch what people used to have to do to make something,</v>

2168
00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:48.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2169
00:58:48.481 --> 00:58:48.650
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2170
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:49.483
<v Speaker 3>it really,</v>

2171
00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:53.400
<v Speaker 3>really makes you appreciate like how ridiculously easy,</v>

2172
00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:54.360
<v Speaker 3>easy limiting us.</v>

2173
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Now people are like,</v>

2174
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 3>I liked it better the other way.</v>

2175
00:58:55.931 --> 00:58:56.171
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2176
00:58:56.171 --> 00:58:57.004
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

2177
00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.430
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2178
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.670
<v Speaker 3>you just melt rocks,</v>

2179
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:01.001
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2180
00:59:01.001 --> 00:59:01.571
<v Speaker 3>Or something like that.</v>

2181
00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:01.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2182
00:59:01.721 --> 00:59:05.080
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a minor have to in the rocks to make steel.</v>

2183
00:59:05.081 --> 00:59:06.640
<v Speaker 3>You have to add things to it too.</v>

2184
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:09.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not just iron now to make steel,</v>

2185
00:59:09.161 --> 00:59:09.941
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to,</v>

2186
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:13.280
<v Speaker 3>we should actually look that up and like back in the back in the back in the</v>

2187
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:13.290
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2188
00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:13.520
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2189
00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.081
<v Speaker 3>what did they do?</v>

2190
00:59:14.081 --> 00:59:17.530
<v Speaker 3>Just took some rocks and while they have to heat things,</v>

2191
00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:18.790
<v Speaker 3>eat them up.</v>

2192
00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:19.170
<v Speaker 3>And they had a,</v>

2193
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 3>they had a mind the metal.</v>

2194
00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2195
00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2196
00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:23.840
<v Speaker 3>They have pockets of metal in the ground.</v>

2197
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.540
<v Speaker 3>They have to add stuff to,</v>

2198
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2199
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 3>to the steel.</v>

2200
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.580
<v Speaker 3>They have to add stuff.</v>

2201
00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Tired.</v>

2202
00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 3>It's combined.</v>

2203
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.681
<v Speaker 3>It's an alloy.</v>

2204
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Technically it says according to Wikipedia made by combining iron and another</v>

2205
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:36.081
<v Speaker 3>element,</v>

2206
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 3>usually carbon.</v>

2207
00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:42.161
<v Speaker 3>And when carbon is used it's content and the steels between oh 0.2% and 2.1% by</v>

2208
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:44.240
<v Speaker 3>weight dependent upon the grade.</v>

2209
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Who figured that out?</v>

2210
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:48.110
<v Speaker 3>That was given to us.</v>

2211
00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.940
<v Speaker 3>So I guess they had an ad shit.</v>

2212
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's like harder to someone else was like,</v>

2213
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:53.050
<v Speaker 3>why don't you add a carbon?</v>

2214
00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:53.751
<v Speaker 3>And the first guy was like,</v>

2215
00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

2216
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's been around for a long ass time to,</v>

2217
00:59:57.351 --> 01:00:00.280
<v Speaker 3>so who was the first person that somebody told somebody that's,</v>

2218
01:00:00.281 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't seem like that makes salience or no,</v>

2219
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 3>you know what the crazy shit in the world is steel cable.</v>

2220
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Who would have ever found some metal in the ground and thought for a second that</v>

2221
01:00:11.271 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 3>someone is going to take this shit and have so much of it did.</v>

2222
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:20.170
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have a fucking 5,000 foot long cable made us steel and they're</v>

2223
01:00:20.661 --> 01:00:25.661
<v Speaker 3>going to use that to suspend giant beams that weighed several hundred tons over</v>

2224
01:00:27.411 --> 01:00:28.244
<v Speaker 3>an ocean.</v>

2225
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Did you leave like steel cable,</v>

2226
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.250
<v Speaker 3>steel cable is crazy.</v>

2227
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Someone figured out how to take metal it out of the ground and stretch that</v>

2228
01:00:40.251 --> 01:00:40.461
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2229
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:41.420
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

2230
01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.501
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

2231
01:00:42.501 --> 01:00:43.900
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck are you?</v>

2232
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 3>How is it moving around?</v>

2233
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:46.760
<v Speaker 3>How are you making cables out of this?</v>

2234
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.110
<v Speaker 3>What did you do?</v>

2235
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:52.040
<v Speaker 3>They figured out how to not just make it but make it so it's big enough to pull</v>

2236
01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:52.874
<v Speaker 3>boats.</v>

2237
01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.440
<v Speaker 3>You can have giant,</v>

2238
01:00:54.441 --> 01:00:55.700
<v Speaker 3>huge ones that are there.</v>

2239
01:00:55.701 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 3>They're wider around in your body is,</v>

2240
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 3>and that's a cable and we just said take it for granted.</v>

2241
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh well I'm gonna just get a cable and put a winch on the front of my jeep in</v>

2242
01:01:04.131 --> 01:01:05.560
<v Speaker 3>case I get stuck out there.</v>

2243
01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 3>All four Waylon.</v>

2244
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:09.870
<v Speaker 3>You know people that have winches and shit so they can pull cars out,</v>

2245
01:01:09.871 --> 01:01:12.770
<v Speaker 3>would be like to be the cool guy who can pull you in an area that's still</v>

2246
01:01:12.771 --> 01:01:13.760
<v Speaker 3>capable of driving in the mud.</v>

2247
01:01:13.761 --> 01:01:13.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2248
01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking steel cable.</v>

2249
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:16.340
<v Speaker 3>That winches steel cable.</v>

2250
01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:16.641
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

2251
01:01:16.641 --> 01:01:18.440
<v Speaker 3>I get caught up and now she's going to snap your arm off.</v>

2252
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:19.581
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2253
01:01:19.581 --> 01:01:19.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2254
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:21.140
<v Speaker 3>It'll rip your body apart.</v>

2255
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:21.981
<v Speaker 3>Steel cable.</v>

2256
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 3>They can pick up trees with that shit.</v>

2257
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.770
<v Speaker 3>You gotta put a winch on.</v>

2258
01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the pounds,</v>

2259
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:27.200
<v Speaker 3>the power of the winch.</v>

2260
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:29.630
<v Speaker 3>But if it's good winch can pull hundreds of pounds.</v>

2261
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:31.220
<v Speaker 3>That's my black guys like it so much.</v>

2262
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.050
<v Speaker 3>I always hear him.</v>

2263
01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:32.570
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2264
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Like taking it from buildings,</v>

2265
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.173
<v Speaker 3>stealing cables.</v>

2266
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.591
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2267
01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:37.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a little cable stealing you.</v>

2268
01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Silly bitch though.</v>

2269
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Steel cable.</v>

2270
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't pay for it,</v>

2271
01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Brian.</v>

2272
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.593
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2273
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.880
<v Speaker 3>not like steel cables.</v>

2274
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about the first guy to invent wires who figured out how to stretch out</v>

2275
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:52.411
<v Speaker 3>some metals.</v>

2276
01:01:52.411 --> 01:01:53.570
<v Speaker 3>So real heroes,</v>

2277
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.780
<v Speaker 3>like the first guy who actually steel cable that somebody fucking figure that</v>

2278
01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:58.490
<v Speaker 3>out and then share that information with people.</v>

2279
01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.730
<v Speaker 3>I remember I used to have everybody did who figured that out though?</v>

2280
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.480
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy that lives in the neighborhood that would leave up a thing when</v>

2281
01:02:05.481 --> 01:02:07.160
<v Speaker 3>satellite dishes first came out,</v>

2282
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:10.730
<v Speaker 3>he would leave up like on telephone poles.</v>

2283
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.960
<v Speaker 3>This is how the dumpster,</v>

2284
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.610
<v Speaker 3>it was in 1993 he leave up a phone number and it would say,</v>

2285
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:16.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2286
01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 3>fix your satellite box to catch any,</v>

2287
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:20.783
<v Speaker 3>any channel.</v>

2288
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 3>And so you would give this guy your card and then they would,</v>

2289
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:24.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2290
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:24.721
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>

2291
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:25.081
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>

2292
01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2293
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 3>he would come back and bring the card back to you and it was doctored and the</v>

2294
01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:30.360

2394
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Really Young.</v>

2395
01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I took half an Adderall today.</v>

2396
01:04:57.121 --> 01:04:59.340
<v Speaker 2>This is like the second time I've ever done Adderall before.</v>

2397
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:02.970
<v Speaker 2>This is the first time that I feel like it.</v>

2398
01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:04.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like a sativa.</v>

2399
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I think if you are a fan of Adderall,</v>

2400
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.840
<v Speaker 2>if you've got a really good sativa,</v>

2401
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:11.340
<v Speaker 2>it'd be pretty similar.</v>

2402
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:12.780
<v Speaker 2>So I think so.</v>

2403

<v Speaker 5>Adderall,</v>

2409
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.450

2459
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:31.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2460
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.613
<v Speaker 5>let's talk about that.</v>

2461
01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:33.803
<v Speaker 5>Do.</v>

2462
01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Let's hear some new jokes every year.</v>

2463
01:06:35.771 --> 01:06:37.090
<v Speaker 5>It's like some notes of yours right now.</v>

2464
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:37.241
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2465
01:06:37.241 --> 01:06:38.110
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell you</v>

2466
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:43.710
<v Speaker 5>like here's the program really helped me when,</v>

2467
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.690
<v Speaker 5>when you're thinking in terms of this with Thompson grower as bill bitter about</v>

2468
01:06:46.691 --> 01:06:48.820
<v Speaker 5>it and he broke it down to what an hours and he goes,</v>

2469
01:06:48.821 --> 01:06:50.050
<v Speaker 5>that's five minutes a month.</v>

2470
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:53.830
<v Speaker 5>So if you get pretty much any new month that you're like,</v>

2471
01:06:53.831 --> 01:06:55.270
<v Speaker 5>am I in five minutes ahead of where I was?</v>

2472
01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:58.110
<v Speaker 5>And just time it that way and just keep a pace for yourself where you're at the</v>

2473
01:06:58.111 --> 01:06:59.350
<v Speaker 5>head of pace or behind pace.</v>

2474
01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:02.420
<v Speaker 5>I had five new minutes the first time on stage because I,</v>

2475
01:07:02.421 --> 01:07:04.360
<v Speaker 5>there was a bunch of shit that I had written that I,</v>

2476
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.590
<v Speaker 5>the last couple of months I hadn't committed to any new stuff.</v>

2477
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.690
<v Speaker 5>I was just trying to just completely tighten the old stuff except this</v>

2478
01:07:11.691 --> 01:07:13.510
<v Speaker 5>circumcision beard that just came out of nowhere.</v>

2479
01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:14.350
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't stop it.</v>

2480
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:15.600
<v Speaker 5>I had to put it on and it will,</v>

2481
01:07:15.601 --> 01:07:17.440
<v Speaker 5>it just fit in with all this other shit I had to.</v>

2482
01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 5>But other than that,</v>

2483
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:22.540
<v Speaker 5>oh my writing that I had from all that time is all bank rolled.</v>

2484
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.760
<v Speaker 5>So I just have to go over the writing.</v>

2485
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:30.090
<v Speaker 5>You know the fucking just nuttiness I just have to go over there cause you're</v>

2486
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:30.761
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2487
01:07:30.761 --> 01:07:31.600
<v Speaker 5>I've got stuff right now.</v>

2488
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.440
<v Speaker 5>So since I did still keep writing I,</v>

2489
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:36.610
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of ideas.</v>

2490
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:38.470
<v Speaker 5>I just have to sort of set them out.</v>

2491
01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 5>But this will make yourself go through him.</v>

2492
01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.350
<v Speaker 5>Did you end up doing the baby?</v>

2493
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:42.041
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2494
01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:42.161
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2495
01:07:42.161 --> 01:07:42.994
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do that one.</v>

2496
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:43.540
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2497
01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.550
<v Speaker 5>that's two specials.</v>

2498
01:07:44.551 --> 01:07:45.220
<v Speaker 5>A dumb joke.</v>

2499
01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.053
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be like,</v>

2500
01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:47.460
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2501
01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:47.561
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2502
01:07:47.561 --> 01:07:47.711
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2503
01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:47.951
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2504
01:07:47.951 --> 01:07:48.850
<v Speaker 5>I had a thought I hadn't thought.</v>

2505
01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:49.650
<v Speaker 5>Here's what you do.</v>

2506
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:50.151

2507
01:07:50.151 --> 01:07:52.060

2517
01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:06.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm so immature with my sense of humor that has so many jokes about someone</v>

2518
01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:07.234
<v Speaker 5>getting blown.</v>

2519
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:10.060
<v Speaker 5>Just actually use that to promote the special when you have it.</v>

2520
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.490
<v Speaker 5>Here's one for the next time you go to a big club,</v>

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2530
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.481
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

2531
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:26.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2532
01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.100
<v Speaker 3>it was the Atlanta thing.</v>

2533
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:28.934
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't it went great.</v>

2534
01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.051
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't have gone any better.</v>

2535
01:08:30.051 --> 01:08:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2536
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:32.630
<v Speaker 3>These crowds are completely different crowds.</v>

2537
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:37.400
<v Speaker 3>The crowds that we're getting now are 100% podcast fans and it's like,</v>

2538
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:40.190
<v Speaker 3>it's like hanging out and doing a show in front of our friends.</v>

2539
01:08:40.191 --> 01:08:42.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like a bunch of friends that we don't know that one.</v>

2540
01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.330
<v Speaker 3>The other people who come just to come for shows,</v>

2541
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.750
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

2542
01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:44.871
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2543
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:45.940
<v Speaker 3>this is a really fun thing.</v>

2544
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Do are so overwhelmingly nice.</v>

2545
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:49.240
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2546
01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.061
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

2547
01:08:50.061 --> 01:08:50.600
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2548
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how we did it.</v>

2549
01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:52.541
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>

2550
01:08:52.541 --> 01:08:54.140
<v Speaker 3>what exact the cottle exactly.</v>

2551
01:08:54.141 --> 01:08:56.390
<v Speaker 3>The combination was to create that,</v>

2552
01:08:56.391 --> 01:08:57.710
<v Speaker 3>but that's very unusual.</v>

2553
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:00.950
<v Speaker 3>It's very unusual when you talk to people that work at clubs and people that</v>

2554
01:09:00.951 --> 01:09:01.784
<v Speaker 3>work at theaters,</v>

2555
01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:04.100
<v Speaker 3>they go your crowds and nicest crowd we've ever seen ever.</v>

2556
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:04.921
<v Speaker 3>Pretty cool.</v>

2557
01:09:04.921 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It's even close.</v>

2558
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:06.410
<v Speaker 3>The good tippers.</v>

2559
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:06.800
<v Speaker 3>They're good.</v>

2560
01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 3>They're generous and they were fucking so pumped for the show.</v>

2561
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:10.401
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2562
01:09:10.401 --> 01:09:11.234
<v Speaker 3>It was nuts.</v>

2563
01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:12.610
<v Speaker 3>I was so comfortable.</v>

2564
01:09:12.611 --> 01:09:16.040
<v Speaker 3>It's the only time I've ever done a special where I didn't feel at all like,</v>

2565
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.671
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

2566
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:17.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm filming right now.</v>

2567
01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Or it was completely in the groove.</v>

2568
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I had done so much standup leading up to that too.</v>

2569
01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.810
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2570
01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.150
<v Speaker 3>I did all my work and then on top of that,</v>

2571
01:09:26.151 --> 01:09:27.230
<v Speaker 3>the crowd was amazing,</v>

2572
01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.000
<v Speaker 3>but now it's that.</v>

2573
01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:31.880
<v Speaker 3>The big challenge is to now to create a whole new hour,</v>

2574
01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:36.250
<v Speaker 3>so I have to really sit down and I have all these scattered notes.</v>

2575
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to do some organizing isis,</v>

2576
01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:39.050
<v Speaker 3>isis,</v>

2577
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.400
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do some ice house shows.</v>

2578
01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Can we do Wednesday?</v>

2579
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:43.223
<v Speaker 3>See if we could do Wednesday?</v>

2580
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Probably not.</v>

2581
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:46.543
<v Speaker 3>Probably not.</v>

2582
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:47.120
<v Speaker 3>If we can,</v>

2583
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:47.570
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>

2584
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:49.340
<v Speaker 3>This is what Louis said to after you do the first year,</v>

2585
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:51.530
<v Speaker 3>when you start the same process again the next year,</v>

2586
01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:53.270
<v Speaker 3>and it seems as daunting as it does right now,</v>

2587
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:53.870
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

2588
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:54.081
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

2589
01:09:54.081 --> 01:09:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I know this leads to a new hour of material.</v>

2590
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2591
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:57.111
<v Speaker 3>so it's okay,</v>

2592
01:09:57.111 --> 01:09:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I can do this.</v>

2593
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a bench pressing to get bigger.</v>

2594
01:09:59.060 --> 01:09:59.451
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2595
01:09:59.451 --> 01:10:02.330
<v Speaker 3>I know that writing to me is just like,</v>

2596
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:07.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like doing rounds on the bag or doing minutes on an elliptical machine.</v>

2597
01:10:07.821 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 3>You build endurance,</v>

2598
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:12.920
<v Speaker 3>you build like a groove and right now you know I'm in good writing shape.</v>

2599
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.401
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2600
01:10:13.401 --> 01:10:14.001
<v Speaker 3>I felt like when I,</v>

2601
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:18.110
<v Speaker 3>when I write a lot I get in a good way it's a muscle and now I can,</v>

2602
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I think it comes,</v>

2603
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:23.250
<v Speaker 3>it comes out better the more you use it and it comes out your,</v>

2604
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:25.780
<v Speaker 3>your editing skills on the fly get better.</v>

2605
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Better right now than you were five years ago.</v>

2606
01:10:27.261 --> 01:10:28.000
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago.</v>

2607
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:28.560
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2608
01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy that I,</v>

2610
01:10:31.201 --> 01:10:31.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2611
01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I always wondered what would happen as I got older.</v>

2612
01:10:33.711 --> 01:10:34.511
<v Speaker 3>Like if my standup,</v>

2613
01:10:34.511 --> 01:10:35.660
<v Speaker 3>it starts to suck one day.</v>

2614
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2615
01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 3>I always worried about that.</v>

2616
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I always worried about like hitting a peak and then not being good anymore.</v>

2617
01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:42.690
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's a plateau you can get.</v>

2618
01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:46.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like Kinda like pool where you can play later through stand up later</v>

2619
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.060
<v Speaker 3>interiors.</v>

2620
01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a 40 year old retirement moment.</v>

2621
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2622
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.281
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2623
01:10:49.281 --> 01:10:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it has to do with your physical health too.</v>

2624
01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:51.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2625
01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.270
<v Speaker 3>if you get depressed and you feel like shit,</v>

2626
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:56.540
<v Speaker 3>I bet your comedy is going to start to not be as fun and not be as good.</v>

2627
01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the commitments,</v>

2628
01:10:59.540 --> 01:10:59.691
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2629
01:10:59.691 --> 01:11:01.350
<v Speaker 3>he's different kinds of standup,</v>

2630
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2631
01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:02.483
<v Speaker 3>standups.</v>

2632
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.490
<v Speaker 3>Comedy almost depends on him being miserable.</v>

2633
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:05.950
<v Speaker 3>I think every,</v>

2634
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:07.520
<v Speaker 3>like almost every comic I know.</v>

2635
01:11:07.521 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 3>It seems like they're depressed and miserable.</v>

2636
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:11.090
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to be,</v>

2637
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.291
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily,</v>

2638
01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 3>but that can fuel you.</v>

2639
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:14.171
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2640
01:11:14.171 --> 01:11:16.050
<v Speaker 3>It can fuel you to go up there and get that charge.</v>

2641
01:11:16.051 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 3>Where I know in times of my life where I wasn't happy,</v>

2642
01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I would go on stage and kill it.</v>

2643
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:21.630
<v Speaker 3>At least feel like I can do something.</v>

2644
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2645
01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 3>It will at least feel like I'm capable of something.</v>

2646
01:11:25.621 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Like if I could go on stage,</v>

2647
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:27.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2648
01:11:27.061 --> 01:11:28.170
<v Speaker 3>from feeling like a loser,</v>

2649
01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling depressed.</v>

2650
01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I go on stage and get a bunch of people to laugh.</v>

2651
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:32.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll decide,</v>

2652
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:32.341
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2653
01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:32.591
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2654
01:11:32.591 --> 01:11:33.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not bad at this.</v>

2655
01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 3>I did a good job with this.</v>

2656
01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:35.181
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2657
01:11:35.181 --> 01:11:35.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2658
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 3>I can feel a little better now.</v>

2659
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.970
<v Speaker 3>A little pick me up short term.</v>

2660
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.000
<v Speaker 3>So they all give you a standing ovation before you even went on stage.</v>

2661
01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 3>I was nuts.</v>

2662
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.811
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2663
01:11:42.811 --> 01:11:43.644
<v Speaker 3>couldn't have been better,</v>

2664
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 3>couldn't not have been better.</v>

2665
01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:49.560
<v Speaker 3>And there was a lot of traffic because there were some crazy basketball games</v>

2666
01:11:49.561 --> 01:11:50.520
<v Speaker 3>going on at the same time.</v>

2667
01:11:50.521 --> 01:11:51.060
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

2668
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:51.421
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2669
01:11:51.421 --> 01:11:51.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2670
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.950
<v Speaker 3>we've got stuck.</v>

2671
01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Like there was,</v>

2672
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.200
<v Speaker 3>it was really hard for everybody to get there.</v>

2673
01:11:55.201 --> 01:11:57.870
<v Speaker 3>So the show didn't even start for like a half an hour late.</v>

2674
01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 3>So like everybody was building up.</v>

2675
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:01.350
<v Speaker 3>So when the lights went off and when,</v>

2676
01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:01.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2677
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I came on the microphone to introduce Joey,</v>

2678
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.060
<v Speaker 3>they went fucking crazy.</v>

2679
01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.620
<v Speaker 3>It was so funny because,</v>

2680
01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:08.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2681
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 3>my manager and uh,</v>

2682
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:10.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2683
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Shandra and Jeff there,</v>

2684
01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.313
<v Speaker 3>they're the best.</v>

2685
01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.060
<v Speaker 3>I've been with Jeff since I was an open miker essentially.</v>

2686
01:12:15.061 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Like he came and found me in Boston when I was a scrub.</v>

2687
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 3>And I think that one of the main reasons why I've been successful is that I</v>

2688
01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:23.550
<v Speaker 3>don't have to think about the business stuff.</v>

2689
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I just let him think about it.</v>

2690
01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.520
<v Speaker 3>And I just to do my comedy.</v>

2691
01:12:26.521 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about it cause cause he's the best.</v>

2692
01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:30.960
<v Speaker 3>But they were like,</v>

2693
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.093
<v Speaker 3>let's Ah,</v>

2694
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.320
<v Speaker 3>have you introduced offstage?</v>

2695
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Like just say your name clean and you come out alone.</v>

2696
01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:37.854
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2697
01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:38.700
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2698
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:39.690
<v Speaker 3>she always got to bring me up.</v>

2699
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.480
<v Speaker 3>What's your fans will want to see that too.</v>

2700
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:42.983
<v Speaker 3>Five seconds.</v>

2701
01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Joey has to bring me up this.</v>

2702
01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:45.200
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2703
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.500
<v Speaker 3>that's the Voodoo.</v>

2704
01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for the suggestion.</v>

2705
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.661
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to do that.</v>

2706
01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:49.530
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate your input,</v>

2707
01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:50.340
<v Speaker 3>but we're not.</v>

2708
01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:50.881
<v Speaker 3>But they were like,</v>

2709
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:52.040
<v Speaker 3>well let's just try it once.</v>

2710
01:12:52.041 --> 01:12:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2711
01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

2712
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Joey's going to bring me up.</v>

2713
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.421
<v Speaker 3>This is just,</v>

2714
01:12:54.421 --> 01:12:55.890
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to make sense.</v>

2715
01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.050
<v Speaker 3>It's just Joe is a product to talk about it.</v>

2716
01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:01.980
<v Speaker 3>It's brought me up and every special for the past eight,</v>

2717
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.731
<v Speaker 3>nine years,</v>

2718
01:13:02.731 --> 01:13:03.564
<v Speaker 3>whatever it's been.</v>

2719
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.710
<v Speaker 3>So they couldn't do it in Canada,</v>

2720
01:13:04.711 --> 01:13:05.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2721
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:05.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2722
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:07.770
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin and I tried to do a chant at the beginning of one of the specialist,</v>

2723
01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't work at all.</v>

2724
01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.453
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2725
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:12.143
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2726
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.700
<v Speaker 3>we were way too begged for,</v>

2727
01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:18.600
<v Speaker 3>we came up with that idea.</v>

2728
01:13:18.601 --> 01:13:18.921
<v Speaker 3>We talked,</v>

2729
01:13:18.921 --> 01:13:19.810
<v Speaker 3>we'd get the whole crowd,</v>

2730
01:13:19.811 --> 01:13:23.940
<v Speaker 3>the to Oma long and we got like maybe 30 people and then everyone's like,</v>

2731
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:24.630
<v Speaker 3>what's happening?</v>

2732
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:25.390
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

2733
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:26.480
<v Speaker 3>They were waiting for the punchline.</v>

2734
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:27.160
<v Speaker 3>That never was,</v>

2735
01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.510
<v Speaker 2>that shit is such a trip.</v>

2736
01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.660
<v Speaker 2>The second show Joe turned to me and goes,</v>

2737
01:13:31.661 --> 01:13:33.310
<v Speaker 2>do you want to go up and do five minutes?</v>

2738
01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:37.180
<v Speaker 2>And we just got done smoking a joint and I was stoned out of my mind.</v>

2739
01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I like that was I got to go up and it was pretty cool but it was still hard to</v>

2740
01:13:42.281 --> 01:13:43.930
<v Speaker 2>judge that many people like,</v>

2741
01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:44.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2742
01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:44.741
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

2743
01:13:44.741 --> 01:13:46.660
<v Speaker 2>30 people was doing it and it seemed like,</v>

2744
01:13:46.661 --> 01:13:46.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2745
01:13:46.841 --> 01:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>it's 30 out of a million.</v>

2746
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:50.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say your material dude,</v>

2747
01:13:50.901 --> 01:13:53.360
<v Speaker 3>but the one joke you have is fucking funny.</v>

2748
01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.680
<v Speaker 3>He's got one joke.</v>

2749
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:55.873
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2750
01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2751
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:58.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't say anything that'll give away.</v>

2752
01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.690
<v Speaker 3>It's one jug.</v>

2753
01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:00.980
<v Speaker 3>That's one of them where I go,</v>

2754
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:01.461
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

2755
01:14:01.461 --> 01:14:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I wish I thought that one up.</v>

2756
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.820
<v Speaker 3>You know when you hear somebody say something and just like fires off the door,</v>

2757
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:08.060
<v Speaker 3>that's a fun one to play with.</v>

2758
01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.071
<v Speaker 3>So much to do.</v>

2759
01:14:09.071 --> 01:14:11.800
<v Speaker 3>And watch over a thousand people laugh at was really fun.</v>

2760
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:15.210
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to watch someone go up that's never been in front of that,</v>

2761
01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.510
<v Speaker 3>that big of a crowd.</v>

2762
01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:18.010
<v Speaker 3>But they all were really friendly.</v>

2763
01:14:18.011 --> 01:14:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Like when you went on stage,</v>

2764
01:14:19.061 --> 01:14:20.560
<v Speaker 3>they give you a huge round of applause.</v>

2765
01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I know you're probably so then had a made you feel like,</v>

2766
01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2767
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.710
<v Speaker 3>they weren't,</v>

2768
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:23.981
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

2769
01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:26.380
<v Speaker 3>they were happy to see it so much better.</v>

2770
01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2771
01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.350
<v Speaker 3>Feeling so much better than the feeling you get when it's like,</v>

2772
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:29.741
<v Speaker 3>oh cool,</v>

2773
01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 3>you guys already know me.</v>

2774
01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Nobody takes more Internet shit than Brian.</v>

2775
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Nobody takes more.</v>

2776
01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:34.810
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2777
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:37.600
<v Speaker 3>you have more haters and more irrational,</v>

2778
01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:39.460
<v Speaker 3>angry people who love it though.</v>

2779
01:14:39.461 --> 01:14:39.731
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2780
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:40.564
<v Speaker 3>A certain party.</v>

2781
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2782
01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:41.501
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2783
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:41.621
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2784
01:14:41.621 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not comfortable.</v>

2785
01:14:43.170 --> 01:14:48.170
<v Speaker 3>And then there's always some weird sort of analysis of Brian and I's</v>

2786
01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:49.084
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

2787
01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:50.523
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2788
01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Brian and I are very different,</v>

2789
01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:54.010
<v Speaker 3>but obviously we like each other.</v>

2790
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:54.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2791
01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.010
<v Speaker 3>never had a job for more than 10 10 years</v>

2792
01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 3>is a long time.</v>

2793
01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:00.334
<v Speaker 3>We were going to go along.</v>

2794
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 3>But we like each other.</v>

2795
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:03.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2796
01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:04.150
<v Speaker 3>we liked each other a lot.</v>

2797
01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:04.280
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

2798
01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:04.511
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2799
01:15:04.511 --> 01:15:05.141
<v Speaker 3>I would say love,</v>

2800
01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:06.850
<v Speaker 3>but it sounds gay because he's right next to me.</v>

2801
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:07.990
<v Speaker 3>But of course I love him.</v>

2802
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.693
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2803
01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.870
<v Speaker 3>the reason why we've been,</v>

2804
01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:13.150
<v Speaker 3>we keep doing this is because it works well,</v>

2805
01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:14.080
<v Speaker 3>don't you say?</v>

2806
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2807
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.730
<v Speaker 3>he says ridiculous shit.</v>

2808
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:16.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2809
01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:16.721
<v Speaker 3>he thinks it.</v>

2810
01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:19.390
<v Speaker 3>But you say also some things that I don't think of.</v>

2811
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:20.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2812
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:20.290
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2813
01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:23.350
<v Speaker 3>you come at things from a weird perspective sometimes,</v>

2814
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:24.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2815
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:25.900
<v Speaker 3>but for whatever reason,</v>

2816
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.530
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2817
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:28.060
<v Speaker 3>people get angry at shit.</v>

2818
01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:29.340
<v Speaker 3>That man,</v>

2819
01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.690
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is take one thing.</v>

2820
01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.130
<v Speaker 3>You'll interject one thing and it will derail a conversation and sometimes it</v>

2821
01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:39.040
<v Speaker 3>works and sometimes you derail something and it becomes really funny and</v>

2822
01:15:39.041 --> 01:15:39.641
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it doesn't.</v>

2823
01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:39.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2824
01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:40.600
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

2825
01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 3>You never know until you try.</v>

2826
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what people don't understand that listening.</v>

2827
01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:47.020
<v Speaker 3>But they'll get so fucking angry at you and you're like,</v>

2828
01:15:47.021 --> 01:15:47.440
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2829
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.480
<v Speaker 3>get up and go out to,</v>

2830
01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 3>there's a conversation going on somewhere and you're listening in.</v>

2831
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.533
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2832
01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.590
<v Speaker 3>That's all that's happening here.</v>

2833
01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:56.380
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to get fucking spastic angry,</v>

2834
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:57.400
<v Speaker 3>fucking violent.</v>

2835
01:15:57.401 --> 01:15:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Mad,</v>

2836
01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.020
<v Speaker 3>like relaxed.</v>

2837
01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.410
<v Speaker 3>If you interrupt one more time,</v>

2838
01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kick him in his guns.</v>

2839
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.320
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way you've expressed like,</v>

2840
01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2841
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.090
<v Speaker 3>that's all they're trying to express.</v>

2842
01:16:07.091 --> 01:16:08.500
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way they can do that online.</v>

2843
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.600
<v Speaker 3>That's all they feel is.</v>

2844
01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:12.730
<v Speaker 3>So I have to say that I'm going to kill you.</v>

2845
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:14.080
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate criticism.</v>

2846
01:16:14.081 --> 01:16:14.711
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

2847
01:16:14.711 --> 01:16:15.760
<v Speaker 3>And it sounds like I don't,</v>

2848
01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:19.840
<v Speaker 3>cause I just get mad and blocked people when they say coffee things on Twitter</v>

2849
01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:20.530
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

2850
01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:21.520
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not gonna argue with you,</v>

2851
01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:21.880
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2852
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.340
<v Speaker 3>If you can't communicate with me like a normal human being,</v>

2853
01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:26.770
<v Speaker 3>if you can't communicate with me like you would if you just,</v>

2854
01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't care who I ever met.</v>

2855
01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:30.000
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

2856
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:30.520
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

2857
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 3>if I had to have a conversation with Adolf Hitler,</v>

2858
01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:34.661
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2859
01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:38.350
<v Speaker 3>If I had to go back in time and have a conversation with Adolph Hitler,</v>

2860
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't start calling them a comment and say crazy stupid shit to him.</v>

2861
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Even though I know he's a piece of shit,</v>

2862

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:38.040
<v Speaker 5>lighter does it at the end of the day though,</v>

3064
01:21:38.610 --> 01:21:39.810
<v Speaker 5>my friend was on it all the time.</v>

3065
01:21:39.811 --> 01:21:41.940
<v Speaker 5>Said that sometimes if he has to do something late at night,</v>

3066
01:21:41.941 --> 01:21:42.960
<v Speaker 5>like a late night show,</v>

3067
01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.720
<v Speaker 5>it's badly timed and you know,</v>

3068
01:21:45.730 --> 01:21:47.700
<v Speaker 5>because he takes his stuff at a certain time every day.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3073
01:21:51.301 --> 01:21:51.841
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's why,</v>

3074
01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:53.400
<v Speaker 5>but if I take one of those five hour energies,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Where'd you take him?</v>

3150
01:23:24.071 --> 01:23:24.610
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

3151
01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:26.430
<v Speaker 5>I took 20 grams and I went to the,</v>

3152
01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:26.681
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3153
01:23:26.681 --> 01:23:27.514
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3154
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.121
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3155
01:23:28.121 --> 01:23:31.030
<v Speaker 5>that's why it's like drinking a fucking bottle of Tequila and saying,</v>

3156
01:23:31.031 --> 01:23:31.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't like booths.</v>

3157
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 5>20 grams.</v>

3158
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.903
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3159
01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:35.003
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3160
01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like you're not a grams in a pound and a pound.</v>

3161
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

3162
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 5>An ounce is like,</v>

3163
01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:41.531
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3164
01:23:41.531 --> 01:23:42.041
<v Speaker 5>that's different.</v>

3165
01:23:42.041 --> 01:23:44.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many pounds.</v>

3166
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:44.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3167
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:45.251
<v Speaker 5>it's at what,</v>

3168
01:23:45.251 --> 01:23:45.971
<v Speaker 5>two and a half ounces?</v>

3169
01:23:45.971 --> 01:23:47.950
<v Speaker 5>I think two and a half ounces in a pound.</v>

3170
01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:48.821
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

3171
01:23:48.821 --> 01:23:49.654
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally wrong.</v>

3172
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:50.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many grams.</v>

3173
01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:52.990
<v Speaker 5>20 grams would be about an ounce.</v>

3174
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:53.913
<v Speaker 5>Would that be right?</v>

3175
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:58.750
<v Speaker 5>One pound equals 453 grams.</v>

3176
01:23:58.810 --> 01:23:59.141
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3177
01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:00.070
<v Speaker 5>So we took 20 rooms.</v>

3178
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:00.993
<v Speaker 5>Nowhere near a pound.</v>

3179
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3180
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.433
<v Speaker 5>nowhere near it.</v>

3181
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 5>But still he imagined you a pound of mushrooms.</v>

3182
01:24:05.531 --> 01:24:06.364
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3183
01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 5>Kill you.</v>

3184
01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:07.841
<v Speaker 5>What's the,</v>

3185
01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 5>I wonder,</v>

3186
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:09.220
<v Speaker 5>let's find out.</v>

3187
01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:09.491
<v Speaker 5>You would,</v>

3188
01:24:09.491 --> 01:24:10.140
<v Speaker 5>you might,</v>

3189
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.430
<v Speaker 5>you might die from eating the same thing of any one food.</v>

3190
01:24:12.431 --> 01:24:13.270
<v Speaker 5>I think the last time,</v>

3191
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:15.760
<v Speaker 5>the one time that I took it where I think I overdosed,</v>

3192
01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:21.570
<v Speaker 5>I think I came out to about a quarter in a like a,</v>

3193
01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:22.680
<v Speaker 5>an eight.</v>

3194
01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.513
<v Speaker 5>A quarter.</v>

3195
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:24.380
<v Speaker 5>A quarter.</v>

3196
01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:24.990
<v Speaker 5>An eighth.</v>

3197
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:27.070
<v Speaker 5>So one once I seen one,</v>

3198
01:24:27.071 --> 01:24:27.400
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>

3199
01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:27.611
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>

3200
01:24:27.611 --> 01:24:27.950
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>

3201
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:28.181
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>

3202
01:24:28.181 --> 01:24:28.630
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>

3203
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:28.811
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>

3204
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:29.770

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3207
01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:32.573
<v Speaker 5>it took three days.</v>

3208
01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:32.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3209
01:24:32.730 --> 01:24:33.191
<v Speaker 5>that's a lot.</v>

3210
01:24:33.191 --> 01:24:34.390
<v Speaker 5>What kind of mushrooms do you remember?</v>

3211
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if the ones that look like fake.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I like Mario Brother Mushrooms.</v>

3213
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:40.560

<v Speaker 5>like ridiculously fun.</v>

3215
01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.720
<v Speaker 5>280 milligrams per kilogram for a rat killer rot.</v>

01:24:57.401 --> 01:24:59.700
<v Speaker 5>the problem with all this LD 50 for rats.</v>

3225
01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:02.890
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of shit that kills animals that doesn't kill us,</v>

3226
01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.330
<v Speaker 5>but there are also a lot of things to kill both rats and us and there's also a</v>

<v Speaker 5>lot of things like way more things.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Date each other.</v>

3234
01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.270
<v Speaker 5>I've told this story before,</v>

3235
01:25:19.271 --> 01:25:20.660
<v Speaker 5>I killed a big ass rat,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

3238
01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:25.691
<v Speaker 5>I heard it stop,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the morning and there was nothing but skin,</v>

3241
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:33.790
<v Speaker 5>a little bit of skin and a tail.</v>

3242
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.680
<v Speaker 5>They ate that fucking rat.</v>

3243
01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.750
<v Speaker 5>We had a rather truth through its tail in order to get out.</v>

3244
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:38.880
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

3245

01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:43.750
<v Speaker 5>This route was a big fucking rat to man.</v>

3247
01:25:43.751 --> 01:25:46.990
<v Speaker 5>They had some big hill rats up there in the Hollywood hills.</v>

3248
01:25:46.991 --> 01:25:48.130
<v Speaker 5>I got a real problem.</v>

3249
01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:49.121
<v Speaker 5>And from New York,</v>

3250
01:25:49.121 --> 01:25:49.954
<v Speaker 5>they're everywhere.</v>

3251
01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:50.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3252
01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:51.133
<v Speaker 5>some dude was,</v>

3253
01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.780
<v Speaker 5>would you rather have mice or rats?</v>

3254
01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:53.973
<v Speaker 5>Mice.</v>

3255
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:57.170
<v Speaker 5>Mice by a long shot and time that that one guy that we had on the shed,</v>

3256
01:25:57.171 --> 01:25:58.004
<v Speaker 5>the hoarder guy,</v>

3257
01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.613
<v Speaker 5>what's his face?</v>

3258
01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:00.880
<v Speaker 5>I can't even think of his name right now,</v>

3259
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:02.350
<v Speaker 5>but we're looking at Matt.</v>

3260
01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 5>He said that he would rather have rats</v>

3261
01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:06.171
<v Speaker 3>and Anthony,</v>

3262
01:26:06.171 --> 01:26:06.441
<v Speaker 3>yesterday,</v>

3263
01:26:06.441 --> 01:26:08.950
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine lived in the Hollywood hills or his brother.</v>

3264
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.820
<v Speaker 3>His friend lives in the Hollywood hills and they were,</v>

3265
01:26:10.821 --> 01:26:11.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3266
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:13.070
<v Speaker 3>he had to like a dope house with a theater,</v>

3267
01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:14.660
<v Speaker 3>but when they were watching the movies,</v>

3268
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:14.991
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

3269
01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:16.090
<v Speaker 3>when the movie comes on,</v>

3270
01:26:16.110 --> 01:26:16.341
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

3271
01:26:16.341 --> 01:26:17.174
<v Speaker 3>put your feet up.</v>

3272
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Because sometimes rats run across the floor.</v>

3273
01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:20.361
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3274
01:26:20.361 --> 01:26:20.960
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3275
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.291
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3276
01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:21.501
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3277
01:26:21.501 --> 01:26:22.071
<v Speaker 3>I get away.</v>

3278
01:26:22.071 --> 01:26:22.881
<v Speaker 3>Worst movie.</v>

3279
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:23.181
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3280
01:26:23.181 --> 01:26:23.941
<v Speaker 3>if you live in the hills,</v>

3281
01:26:23.941 --> 01:26:24.940
<v Speaker 3>there's just no way to avoid them.</v>

3282
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:26.150
<v Speaker 3>What could you imagine?</v>

3283
01:26:26.151 --> 01:26:28.550
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to avoid rats in your fucking house.</v>

3284
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:30.283
<v Speaker 3>Like ants.</v>

3285
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:31.490
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy though.</v>

3286
01:26:31.491 --> 01:26:32.540

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 3>while I was watching some show on the,</v>

3295
01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3296
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:56.000
<v Speaker 3>one of those outdoor channels I was hunting and there's the dude's a chef,</v>

3297
01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that's called dead meat or something like that.</v>

3298
01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:59.420
<v Speaker 3>That's the name of the show.</v>

3299
01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:00.500
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3300
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.540
<v Speaker 3>he would go and he,</v>

3301
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 3>he'll shoot all kinds of weird things and cook them like all kinds of weird</v>

3302
01:27:05.781 --> 01:27:06.111
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

3303
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:07.610
<v Speaker 3>And so they cook nutria.</v>

3304
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.720
<v Speaker 3>They shot these nutrients,</v>

3305
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:12.090
<v Speaker 3>but there's a balancing nutrients for every nutrient you kill.</v>

3306
01:27:12.091 --> 01:27:13.190
<v Speaker 3>They give you five bucks.</v>

3307
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:13.671
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3308
01:27:13.671 --> 01:27:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3309
01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3310
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I've ever make a living that way.</v>

3311
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3312
01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:18.110
<v Speaker 3>If you have a seven inch tail and you know,</v>

3313
01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:18.500
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3314
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.281
<v Speaker 3>they're big man.</v>

3315
01:27:19.281 --> 01:27:20.210
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them.</v>

3316
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Do they attack people or they're just,</v>

3317
01:27:21.630 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3318
01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 3>they're vegetarians.</v>

3319
01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:24.470
<v Speaker 3>We just kill them.</v>

3320
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:25.700
<v Speaker 3>The problem is they're,</v>

3321
01:27:25.701 --> 01:27:27.830
<v Speaker 3>they're destroying the wetlands.</v>

3322
01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:28.550
<v Speaker 3>They are there.</v>

3323
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Their rate of erosion caused by nutrients.</v>

3324
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 3>Where does it come from?</v>

3325
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Some insane amount.</v>

3326
01:27:33.231 --> 01:27:34.940
<v Speaker 3>It was like they came from another country,</v>

3327
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.340
<v Speaker 3>350 yards or 350 acres a day.</v>

3328
01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 3>They were killer roading.</v>

3329
01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:42.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3330
01:27:42.351 --> 01:27:46.370
<v Speaker 3>These animals were eroding like an insane amount of ground they can cover in a</v>

3331
01:27:46.371 --> 01:27:50.000
<v Speaker 3>day and they're just jacking all these wetlands.</v>

3332
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.550
<v Speaker 3>And so since they started this bounty on him,</v>

3333
01:27:52.551 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 3>the show said that they dropped it down to 50 acres a day.</v>

3334
01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:56.180
<v Speaker 3>But there's still,</v>

3335
01:27:56.210 --> 01:27:57.830
<v Speaker 3>there's still fucking things up.</v>

3336
01:27:57.831 --> 01:27:58.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3337
01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.110
<v Speaker 3>it's like the bigger is a lot to lose.</v>

3338
01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.060
<v Speaker 3>One day day,</v>

3339
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:03.800
<v Speaker 3>they're just jacking these fucking,</v>

3340
01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.910
<v Speaker 3>all this wetlands,</v>

3341
01:28:04.911 --> 01:28:08.060
<v Speaker 3>they just kill all the vegetation and all these a swampy,</v>

3342
01:28:08.061 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 3>crazy areas.</v>

3343
01:28:08.961 --> 01:28:10.790
<v Speaker 3>They just kill all the vegetation there.</v>

3344
01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>

3345
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:13.840
<v Speaker 3>The fucking thing was like a dog man and the,</v>

3346
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:14.450
<v Speaker 3>this dude,</v>

3347
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:16.790
<v Speaker 3>they went out and they shot him and like an hour's time,</v>

3348
01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:20.300
<v Speaker 3>they shot like six or seven of them and they throw him in the boat and they took</v>

3349
01:28:20.301 --> 01:28:21.200
<v Speaker 3>them back and cook them.</v>

3350
01:28:21.650 --> 01:28:22.580

<v Speaker 3>If you're going to see a comic like Ari,</v>

3439
01:29:57.330 --> 01:30:01.200
<v Speaker 3>go to the best club in the FEC and country and the comedy works in Denver might</v>

3440
01:30:01.201 --> 01:30:02.040
<v Speaker 3>just be that club.</v>

3441
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:03.180
<v Speaker 3>If it's not the best club,</v>

3442
01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:03.901
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

3443
01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:04.734
<v Speaker 3>There's no better.</v>

3444
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.500
<v Speaker 3>There's no better club than the comedy works in Denver and there's no better</v>

3445
01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:08.021
<v Speaker 3>club in,</v>

3446
01:30:08.021 --> 01:30:08.854
<v Speaker 3>in the planet.</v>

3447
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:09.760
<v Speaker 3>There's just not,</v>

3448
01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.370
<v Speaker 3>there's the clubs that are just as good,</v>

3449
01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:12.990
<v Speaker 3>but there's no better cuts on any list of like,</v>

3450
01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:14.910
<v Speaker 3>these are the clubs I like to play before I stop.</v>

3451
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.620
<v Speaker 3>The comedy works in Denver is it's at the level of the best club in the country.</v>

3452
01:30:19.650 --> 01:30:22.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any one best club in the country cause there's like,</v>

3453
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.370
<v Speaker 3>like a helium and Philly that's the same level,</v>

3454
01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:26.430
<v Speaker 3>the same level.</v>

3455
01:30:26.431 --> 01:30:27.001
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

3456
01:30:27.001 --> 01:30:28.320
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing bad about that club.</v>

3457
01:30:28.321 --> 01:30:28.981
<v Speaker 3>It's perfect.</v>

3458
01:30:28.981 --> 01:30:31.290
<v Speaker 3>That's the one of the best clubs in the country and the I,</v>

3459
01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:31.891
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

3460
01:30:31.891 --> 01:30:34.590
<v Speaker 3>like helium and Philly and the comedy works in Denver.</v>

3461
01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:36.090
<v Speaker 3>They're the same level of club.</v>

3462
01:30:36.091 --> 01:30:38.340
<v Speaker 3>I think that that place is as good as it gets.</v>

3463
01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:39.173
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

3464
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:40.260
<v Speaker 3>it's the cream of the crop.</v>

3465
01:30:40.261 --> 01:30:41.320
<v Speaker 3>As far as comedy clubs go.</v>

3466
01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Denver is the stoniest coolest fucking city in the country.</v>

3467
01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I loved Denver.</v>

3468
01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Coming back to Columbus,</v>

3469
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

3470
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:50.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3471
01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:50.701
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3472
01:30:50.701 --> 01:30:51.534
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go from there.</v>

3473
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to book that.</v>

3474
01:30:52.290 --> 01:30:54.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm booking a bunch of shit now that I have to write a bunch of new stuff,</v>

3475
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:56.100
<v Speaker 3>so when it come to Columbus,</v>

3476
01:30:56.101 --> 01:30:56.701
<v Speaker 3>that's probably what I'll do.</v>

3477
01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:58.150
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably do the comedy club for a couple of times.</v>

3478
01:30:58.151 --> 01:30:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3479
01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:58.891
<v Speaker 3>the funny bugs,</v>

3480
01:30:58.891 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 3>a good club there,</v>

3481
01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:01.320
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it weird having that place?</v>

3482
01:31:01.321 --> 01:31:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't have a green room.</v>

3483
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:04.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like need them.</v>

3484
01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:05.430
<v Speaker 3>I kinda like it.</v>

3485
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.880
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

3486
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.780
<v Speaker 3>I like when you're roughing it.</v>

3487
01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3488
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.620
<v Speaker 3>I like when you have to live like that.</v>

3489
01:31:10.621 --> 01:31:11.820
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's realistic.</v>

3490
01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:12.450
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

3491
01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:15.000
<v Speaker 3>It's good for you when you have to be in the hallway warming up and it's fucking</v>

3492
01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:16.200
<v Speaker 3>people walking by with drinks.</v>

3493
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.431
<v Speaker 3>It seems stupid,</v>

3494
01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:18.264
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>

3495
01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:19.440
<v Speaker 3>I think all that stuff,</v>

3496
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.030
<v Speaker 3>you should never get away from that,</v>

3497
01:31:21.031 --> 01:31:21.630
<v Speaker 3>that all that,</v>

3498
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.200
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3499
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.460
<v Speaker 3>that's a real comedy club,</v>

3500
01:31:23.461 --> 01:31:24.030
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3501
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.390
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3502
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.780
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3503
01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:26.400
<v Speaker 3>that's where we all cut our teeth.</v>

3504
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:27.180
<v Speaker 3>That's where,</v>

3505
01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:30.390
<v Speaker 3>that's what's responsible for a lot of guys making a living.</v>

3506
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Those kinds of clubs,</v>

3507
01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:31.831
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3508
01:31:31.831 --> 01:31:32.880
<v Speaker 3>those are real places.</v>

3509
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:36.900
<v Speaker 3>When you're there for two or three hours over it just nice to have a place to</v>

3510
01:31:36.901 --> 01:31:37.580
<v Speaker 3>put your stuff,</v>

3511
01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:38.131
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

3512
01:31:38.131 --> 01:31:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Just go out and sit with the people at the bar who gives a fuck.</v>

3513
01:31:40.831 --> 01:31:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Just go hang out with people.</v>

3514
01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:46.110
<v Speaker 3>That patio is so big that he should just put a shed out there or an error.</v>

3515
01:31:46.111 --> 01:31:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Steam.</v>

3516
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:50.100
<v Speaker 3>What if you pulled up in one of those [inaudible] airstream trailer and every</v>

3517
01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.640
<v Speaker 3>bad ass patio because people can't smoke in the bars,</v>

3518
01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:54.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3519
01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that to get a lot of smoke,</v>

3520
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:55.950
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3521
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:56.783
<v Speaker 3>The laws now.</v>

3522
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.240
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3523
01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.380
<v Speaker 3>so you have to go outside to smoke.</v>

3524
01:31:59.170 --> 01:31:59.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3525
01:31:59.471 --> 01:32:04.240
<v Speaker 3>That's a that that law apparently is a big divider amongst the pool world.</v>

3526
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Pool players have really upset.</v>

3527
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3528
01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:07.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3529
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:07.930
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of guys,</v>

3530
01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:08.471
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3531
01:32:08.471 --> 01:32:09.131
<v Speaker 3>when the gambling,</v>

3532
01:32:09.131 --> 01:32:11.710
<v Speaker 3>they would just constantly be smoking or had the same problem.</v>

3533
01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3534
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:13.061
<v Speaker 3>They tried to get it out.</v>

3535
01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:13.780
<v Speaker 3>There was the last link,</v>

3536
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:14.613
<v Speaker 3>the leaf casinos.</v>

3537
01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:15.593
<v Speaker 3>The poker area.</v>

3538
01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:15.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3539
01:32:15.851 --> 01:32:16.511
<v Speaker 3>I know him for that.</v>

3540
01:32:16.511 --> 01:32:17.830
<v Speaker 3>That deep breath that I just took,</v>

3541
01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:18.910
<v Speaker 3>that was like a lot of guys,</v>

3542
01:32:18.911 --> 01:32:19.500
<v Speaker 3>they need that.</v>

3543
01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.333
<v Speaker 3>They needed that.</v>

3544
01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:23.440
<v Speaker 3>They needed that cigarette to calm them down.</v>

3545
01:32:23.441 --> 01:32:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Whether gamble.</v>

3546
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.791
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they needed it.</v>

3547
01:32:24.791 --> 01:32:25.840
<v Speaker 3>I think I just got used to it.</v>

3548
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.400
<v Speaker 3>I know they're resisting change.</v>

3549
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:29.440
<v Speaker 3>They're addicted and when they're addicted,</v>

3550
01:32:29.441 --> 01:32:29.741
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3551
01:32:29.741 --> 01:32:30.380
<v Speaker 3>you need it.</v>

3552
01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:30.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3553
01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:31.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3554
01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:34.420
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot of guys who just got really pissed off and they would start</v>

3555
01:32:34.421 --> 01:32:36.030
<v Speaker 3>going to places that would allow smoking,</v>

3556
01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.630
<v Speaker 3>would let you chain smoke.</v>

3557
01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:38.021
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

3558
01:32:38.021 --> 01:32:38.890
<v Speaker 3>I've thought like going out,</v>

3559
01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.270
<v Speaker 3>I can't just keep going outside.</v>

3560
01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:41.320
<v Speaker 3>I just want to keep going.</v>

3561
01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:43.850
<v Speaker 3>The only way they can make that different is if you,</v>

3562
01:32:43.851 --> 01:32:44.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3563
01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.520
<v Speaker 3>made it a private club.</v>

3564
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>

3565
01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.590
<v Speaker 3>I belonged to a cigar club.</v>

3566
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:50.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a very whole too schmaltzy me and my brother Matt.</v>

3567
01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.030

3568
01:32:52.031 --> 01:32:52.421
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3569
01:32:52.421 --> 01:32:52.690

3572
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:59.230

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3574
01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.870

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm a deal breaker up here at 17 and it's kind of a crazy place cause it's,</v>

3577
01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.530
<v Speaker 3>excellent food.</v>

3578
01:33:11.531 --> 01:33:12.730
<v Speaker 3>And there's all these rich guys out there.</v>

3654
01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's going to go away now just because of the fact that it's</v>

3655
01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:55.860
<v Speaker 3>changes to it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the economy.</v>

3693
01:35:42.891 --> 01:35:44.300
<v Speaker 3>this Trayvon Martin thing.</v>

3694
01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:49.580
<v Speaker 3>When that kid got shot and there was all these people are rallying one way or no</v>

3695
01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:49.870
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

3696
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:51.080
<v Speaker 3>no one really knows what happened.</v>

3697
01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3698
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:53.720
<v Speaker 3>No one does know what happened,</v>

3699
01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.130
<v Speaker 3>but my,</v>

3700
01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:55.700
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

3701
01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:56.511
<v Speaker 3>my feeling was like,</v>

3702
01:35:56.511 --> 01:35:56.751
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3703
01:35:56.751 --> 01:36:00.140
<v Speaker 3>when are we going to evolve past the point where that's even a concern.</v>

3704
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what I'm going to evolve past the point where people were breaking into</v>

3705
01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:05.090
<v Speaker 3>people's houses and stealing shit.</v>

3706
01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:08.480
<v Speaker 3>When are we going to evolve past the point where people are starting shit with</v>

3707
01:36:08.481 --> 01:36:09.860
<v Speaker 3>people because they're packing a gun.</v>

3708
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Is there ever going to come a time when that that's the past.</v>

3709
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:16.250
<v Speaker 3>We were not hacking each other with swords in the streets every day.</v>

3710
01:36:16.251 --> 01:36:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you live anymore,</v>

3711
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 3>everything has gotten radically improved.</v>

3712
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:24.030
<v Speaker 3>Security and safety radically improved every city,</v>

3713
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:25.850
<v Speaker 3>all over the world for animals here.</v>

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:26.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3715
01:36:26.391 --> 01:36:27.171
<v Speaker 3>but I know when they said,</v>

3716
01:36:27.171 --> 01:36:27.291
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3717
01:36:27.291 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 3>they said they were in lines after the tsunami and the Japanese people were in</v>

3718
01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:32.480
<v Speaker 3>lines waiting to get their food.</v>

3719
01:36:32.890 --> 01:36:36.320
<v Speaker 3>It's so nice that you wait in lines here and they don't so orderly and he was</v>

3720
01:36:36.321 --> 01:36:36.860
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3721
01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:37.011
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3722
01:36:37.011 --> 01:36:38.210
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way it should be.</v>

3723
01:36:38.230 --> 01:36:38.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3724
01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.410
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

3725
01:36:39.411 --> 01:36:41.960
<v Speaker 3>It's just we've become such animals that we think that's great.</v>

3726
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.321
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3727
01:36:42.321 --> 01:36:45.230
<v Speaker 3>we are a country without much history or tradition.</v>

3728
01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:45.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3729
01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.160
<v Speaker 3>we have a sort of a fake history and traditional,</v>

3730
01:36:48.161 --> 01:36:48.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3731
01:36:48.321 --> 01:36:49.820
<v Speaker 3>make a big deal out of our history.</v>

3732
01:36:49.821 --> 01:36:50.420
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm aware,</v>

3733
01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:50.780
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3734
01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:51.920
<v Speaker 3>I know my history.</v>

3735
01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.000
<v Speaker 3>You know what history,</v>

3736
01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:54.150
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of marauders,</v>

3737
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:58.340
<v Speaker 3>great grandfather started escapees from other countries at fucking came over</v>

3738
01:36:58.341 --> 01:37:00.620
<v Speaker 3>here and tortured and killed all the natives.</v>

3739
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Or you came later and,</v>

3740
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.500
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

3741
01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:02.781
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3742
01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:04.130
<v Speaker 3>well you came late at my history.</v>

3743
01:37:04.131 --> 01:37:05.540
<v Speaker 3>You're white trash.</v>

3744
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:06.920
<v Speaker 3>That's not a history.</v>

3745
01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.430
<v Speaker 3>It's silly when you stop and think about like say the history of China or the</v>

3746
01:37:10.431 --> 01:37:11.510
<v Speaker 3>history of Japan.</v>

3747
01:37:11.511 --> 01:37:14.450
<v Speaker 3>One Country that's been in one place for a thousands of years.</v>

3748
01:37:14.451 --> 01:37:19.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a true history to Japan and there's a history of obedience and</v>

3749
01:37:19.551 --> 01:37:21.790
<v Speaker 3>there's a history of order and discipline and it's,</v>

3750
01:37:21.791 --> 01:37:22.310
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

3751
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:24.980
<v Speaker 3>the tradition of it is far stronger than it is in this country.</v>

3752
01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:25.850
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>

3753
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Brian and I saw it when we went over there.</v>

3754
01:37:27.650 --> 01:37:30.710
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying that if I had to choose between living in Japan and live in a</v>

3755
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:33.330
<v Speaker 3>generic America Chimerica Jamiroquai</v>

3756
01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:38.240
<v Speaker 3>if I had to choose which child living in Japan or live in with Jamiroquai,</v>

3757
01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I would say I'm going to live in Japan because that would kill that dude.</v>

3758
01:37:43.150 --> 01:37:44.210
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't want to have as a roommate.</v>

3759
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Apparently he gets crazy.</v>

3760
01:37:45.231 --> 01:37:46.130
<v Speaker 3>I love his music though,</v>

3761
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:46.761
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong.</v>

3762
01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:49.040
<v Speaker 3>But apparently he gets crazy and throws punches at people and Shit.</v>

3763
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:50.060
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3764
01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:55.060
<v Speaker 3>Japan was so much more polite and orderly and even like when we were at though,</v>

3765
01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.430
<v Speaker 3>they didn't understand</v>

3766
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.760
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

3767
01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.260
<v Speaker 5>So when we're at the arena,</v>

3768
01:37:58.261 --> 01:38:02.880
<v Speaker 5>once we got in and I showed them that I had a badge they'd like talked about and</v>

3769
01:38:02.881 --> 01:38:03.091
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

3770
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:03.721
<v Speaker 5>now he's with me,</v>

3771
01:38:03.721 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 5>he's with me.</v>

3772
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:04.590
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3773
01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:05.423
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

3774
01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:06.460
<v Speaker 5>they just let you go,</v>

3775
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:07.580
<v Speaker 5>let you go.</v>

3776
01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't like that.</v>

3777
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:09.451
<v Speaker 5>At some point we were like,</v>

3778
01:38:09.451 --> 01:38:09.810
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3779
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:11.480
<v Speaker 5>obviously you can lie to me if you want,</v>

3780
01:38:11.481 --> 01:38:12.640
<v Speaker 5>but don't please don't do that.</v>

3781
01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:13.890
<v Speaker 5>I'll just check.</v>

3782
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:14.161
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3783
01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3784
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 5>there's a noticeable,</v>

3785
01:38:15.271 --> 01:38:16.820
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not saying it's a perfect society,</v>

3786
01:38:16.821 --> 01:38:18.000
<v Speaker 5>a utopia or anything like that,</v>

3787
01:38:18.001 --> 01:38:22.390
<v Speaker 5>but there's a notice belief up in inpatients in a noticeable leap up and</v>

3788
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.270
<v Speaker 5>kindness and the way people interacted with people.</v>

3789
01:38:24.271 --> 01:38:25.110
<v Speaker 5>It was really interesting.</v>

3790
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:25.941
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens.</v>

3791
01:38:25.941 --> 01:38:28.710
<v Speaker 5>We have unfettered access to a rape,</v>

3792
01:38:28.711 --> 01:38:28.921
<v Speaker 5>a ball,</v>

3793
01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:29.754
<v Speaker 5>Chinese women.</v>

3794
01:38:29.850 --> 01:38:30.683
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

3795
01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.400
<v Speaker 5>I fucking like just calm down,</v>

3796
01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:34.350
<v Speaker 5>just calm down and go right in London.</v>

3797
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:35.780
<v Speaker 5>Then go back to calm.</v>

3798
01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:37.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go back to Japan soon.</v>

3799
01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I think me and [inaudible].</v>

3800
01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.120

3801
01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:44.880
<v Speaker 5>they're going to get sexy?</v>

3802
01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:47.100
<v Speaker 5>Brad from stream has an office there,</v>

3803
01:38:47.101 --> 01:38:48.270
<v Speaker 5>so he goes all the time.</v>

3804
01:38:48.271 --> 01:38:48.750
<v Speaker 5>So it's picking.</v>

3805
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:49.441
<v Speaker 5>Next time it goes,</v>

3806
01:38:49.441 --> 01:38:51.240
<v Speaker 5>I might just go with them and just a hangout.</v>

3807
01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:51.810
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3808
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:52.111
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3809
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:52.581
<v Speaker 5>Well I,</v>

3810
01:38:52.581 --> 01:38:54.210
<v Speaker 5>I found it quite fascinating.</v>

3811
01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:55.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3812
01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:59.100
<v Speaker 5>I've been to several different countries now and it really does illuminate you.</v>

3813
01:38:59.101 --> 01:38:59.311
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3814
01:38:59.311 --> 01:39:02.040
<v Speaker 5>Ari and I went to Brazil recently and we were sitting,</v>

3815
01:39:02.041 --> 01:39:03.330
<v Speaker 5>it was like seven o'clock in the morning.</v>

3816
01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:07.140
<v Speaker 5>We may or may not have just smoked some weed and we're sitting on this balcony</v>

3817
01:39:07.170 --> 01:39:10.400
<v Speaker 5>overlooking this beach and it's fun was coming a,</v>

3818
01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:14.640
<v Speaker 5>the sun's coming up and we're watching all these kids play and play soccer.</v>

3819
01:39:14.641 --> 01:39:15.240
<v Speaker 5>And we were like,</v>

3820
01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:16.740
<v Speaker 5>who does this in America?</v>

3821
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.700
<v Speaker 5>It's 7:00 AM who does run out there and started playing soccer and the barefoot</v>

3822
01:39:20.701 --> 01:39:23.880
<v Speaker 5>crossing the street and these other kids got home from like going out.</v>

3823
01:39:23.881 --> 01:39:25.550
<v Speaker 5>But it was like they looked like they're hungry,</v>

3824
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:25.961
<v Speaker 5>they're tired,</v>

3825
01:39:25.961 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 5>they're still out with her holding their shoes.</v>

3826
01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we're just out.</v>

3827
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Brazil is better than America or Americas better than Brazil,</v>

3828
01:39:33.331 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 5>but I know that that way of living is better than the way that most people here</v>

3829
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:38.430
<v Speaker 5>live.</v>

3830
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.790
<v Speaker 5>I heard,</v>

3831
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:40.170
<v Speaker 5>I heard a quote recently,</v>

3832
01:39:40.171 --> 01:39:41.160
<v Speaker 5>I think it was mark twain,</v>

3833
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:43.020
<v Speaker 5>but Johnny [inaudible] had told me he goes up.</v>

3834
01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:43.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3835
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:44.690
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

3836
01:39:44.690 --> 01:39:45.450
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3837
01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:47.070
<v Speaker 5>comparison is the death of joy.</v>

3838
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.860
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3839
01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:48.150
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3840
01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:49.110
<v Speaker 5>who cares what better or worse?</v>

3841
01:39:49.111 --> 01:39:50.610
<v Speaker 5>I'll just tell you what the nice things we saw.</v>

3842
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.593
<v Speaker 5>That's beautiful.</v>

3843
01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:54.120
<v Speaker 5>Do you know in Japan that that government plays,</v>

3844
01:39:54.130 --> 01:39:55.260
<v Speaker 5>it pays your electricity.</v>

3845
01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:58.160
<v Speaker 5>They pay a lot of things that like one of those is going to change now that</v>

3846
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:00.210
<v Speaker 5>they're power plants or fucking melting into the earth.</v>

3847
01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.073
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3848
01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:04.380
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe they just started charging for and they could have a better profit to</v>

3849
01:40:04.381 --> 01:40:06.000
<v Speaker 5>make sure this doesn't happen in the future.</v>

3850
01:40:06.001 --> 01:40:08.340
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if that's even more profit on the,</v>

3851
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:09.360
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean with that too?</v>

3852
01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:10.171
<v Speaker 5>They're fucked.</v>

3853
01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:12.990
<v Speaker 5>Brian there they have a real problem with those three reactors.</v>

3854
01:40:12.991 --> 01:40:14.640
<v Speaker 5>How could they be possibly a fourth?</v>

3855
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:16.430
<v Speaker 5>How would the profits of salt,</v>

3856
01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.293
<v Speaker 5>the meltdown?</v>

3857
01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:17.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3858
01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:22.560
<v Speaker 5>because obviously it seems like their shit was built like retarded style,</v>

3859
01:40:22.590 --> 01:40:23.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3860
01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:23.560
<v Speaker 5>like they,</v>

3861
01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.200
<v Speaker 5>if they had like some more Pete,</v>

3862
01:40:25.201 --> 01:40:26.250
<v Speaker 5>like intelligent people going,</v>

3863
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.001
<v Speaker 5>wait a second,</v>

3864
01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:29.100
<v Speaker 5>why are you should not build it.</v>

3865
01:40:29.101 --> 01:40:33.370
<v Speaker 5>So it only goes to a way to 6.0 or 7.0 magnitude quake.</v>

3866
01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.960
<v Speaker 5>They had it up to an 8.2 8.2 it was a even larger than that.</v>

3867
01:40:36.961 --> 01:40:37.800
<v Speaker 5>It was like a nine.</v>

3868
01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.500
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you make that Shit 20 you know?</v>

3869
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.891
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3870
01:40:40.891 --> 01:40:41.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they can't.</v>

3871
01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.430
<v Speaker 5>The real,</v>

3872
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:45.620
<v Speaker 5>the reality is I just go deeper and yeah,</v>

3873
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:46.580
<v Speaker 5>I've just seen,</v>

3874
01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:48.480
<v Speaker 5>we didn't we just talk about this the other day.</v>

3875
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:49.920
<v Speaker 5>This is my take on,</v>

3876
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:50.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3877
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:51.290
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3878
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 5>the craziness of nuclear power was that it's</v>

3879
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.050
<v Speaker 3>only been around for less than a hundred years.</v>

3880
01:40:56.051 --> 01:40:57.370
<v Speaker 3>And think about it in a hundred years.</v>

3881
01:40:57.371 --> 01:40:58.360
<v Speaker 3>All the different,</v>

3882
01:40:58.361 --> 01:41:03.361
<v Speaker 3>huge cataclysmic disasters from Chernobyl to a three mile island to this one and</v>

3883
01:41:04.901 --> 01:41:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Fukushima.</v>

3884
01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 3>This is three giant,</v>

3885
01:41:07.301 --> 01:41:09.430
<v Speaker 3>huge ones that have taken place and they've,</v>

3886
01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:09.670
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3887
01:41:09.670 --> 01:41:11.620
<v Speaker 3>it's only been in less than a hundred years.</v>

3888
01:41:11.890 --> 01:41:13.180
<v Speaker 3>How long is nuclear power?</v>

3889
01:41:13.181 --> 01:41:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Thank you sir.</v>

3890
01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:15.040
<v Speaker 3>How long has new clip powerful?</v>

3891
01:41:15.041 --> 01:41:15.491
<v Speaker 3>See Two.</v>

3892
01:41:15.491 --> 01:41:15.611
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3893
01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:16.241
<v Speaker 3>coconut water,</v>

3894
01:41:16.241 --> 01:41:16.901
<v Speaker 3>my favorite.</v>

3895
01:41:16.901 --> 01:41:17.561
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious.</v>

3896
01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:18.520
<v Speaker 3>It comes from Thailand.</v>

3897
01:41:18.930 --> 01:41:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Can't be it.</v>

3898
01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.530
<v Speaker 3>If it tastes so good,</v>

3899
01:41:20.531 --> 01:41:21.670
<v Speaker 3>you think that it's got sugar in it.</v>

3900
01:41:21.671 --> 01:41:22.391
<v Speaker 3>And I even asked him,</v>

3901
01:41:22.391 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 3>I know you got sugar in the ship bench.</v>

3902
01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:24.740
<v Speaker 3>They sell it on it.</v>

3903
01:41:29.010 --> 01:41:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Where were we before we went in the coconut room?</v>

3904
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.863
<v Speaker 3>Nuclear.</v>

3905
01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:36.760
<v Speaker 3>The real issue is they don't know how to shut these fucking things off.</v>

3906
01:41:36.761 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 3>And that's terrifying.</v>

3907
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying that they,</v>

3908
01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:42.700
<v Speaker 3>they're willing to build something that they don't have an out clause with.</v>

3909
01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:45.040
<v Speaker 3>They were just hoping to keep the power on so they can cool.</v>

3910
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Keep it cooled off.</v>

3911
01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.310
<v Speaker 3>They should have never really wants to be without nuclear power.</v>

3912
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:49.750
<v Speaker 3>So to Sweden in 40 years,</v>

3913
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:50.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3914
01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I think Norway has moved towards that as well.</v>

3915
01:41:52.271 --> 01:41:54.550
<v Speaker 3>There's been a couple European countries that are considering this now.</v>

3916
01:41:54.551 --> 01:41:55.150
<v Speaker 3>They realize,</v>

3917
01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:55.540
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3918
01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:56.530
<v Speaker 3>they're very small.</v>

3919
01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:56.921
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3920
01:41:56.921 --> 01:41:58.180
<v Speaker 3>a lot of European countries.</v>

3921
01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Think about the impact of one nuclear power plant or two would have had on them</v>

3922
01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:04.630
<v Speaker 3>in Japan is very small and they're seeing,</v>

3923
01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.750
<v Speaker 3>they're seeing the impact of the radiation pretty far.</v>

3924
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:08.560
<v Speaker 3>There's some kind of met this might,</v>

3925
01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:10.540
<v Speaker 3>this is O'Brien dumb shit thing,</v>

3926
01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:11.570
<v Speaker 3>isn't there some kind of</v>

3927
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:17.650
<v Speaker 3>metal that they can almost as coke cover an entire reactor,</v>

3928
01:42:17.651 --> 01:42:17.860
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3929
01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:18.590
<v Speaker 3>like the shoe,</v>

3930
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:19.370
<v Speaker 3>like pewter,</v>

3931
01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:20.650
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to feel it's too hot.</v>

3932
01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Everything's gonna melt in it.</v>

3933
01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Everything's going to be nuclear reacted.</v>

3934
01:42:24.630 --> 01:42:25.330
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3935
01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand nuclear science enough to comment on it,</v>

3936
01:42:27.611 --> 01:42:28.690
<v Speaker 3>but what I understand,</v>

3937
01:42:28.691 --> 01:42:31.720
<v Speaker 3>they literally can't cool this thing off and they don't know what to do and</v>

3938
01:42:31.721 --> 01:42:34.510
<v Speaker 3>they're pouring ocean water on and try to cool off the reactors.</v>

3939
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.310
<v Speaker 3>They've eaten through their containment.</v>

3940
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:37.060
<v Speaker 3>They don't know where,</v>

3941
01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:40.000
<v Speaker 3>where it's going to go as far as like how much it's going to impact the soil.</v>

3942
01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.940
<v Speaker 3>They've never really had one meltdown like this before,</v>

3943
01:42:42.941 --> 01:42:44.980
<v Speaker 3>let alone three meltdown in one area.</v>

3944
01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:45.491
<v Speaker 3>In Japan,</v>

3945
01:42:45.491 --> 01:42:46.324
<v Speaker 3>they've never had this,</v>

3946
01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:49.120
<v Speaker 3>so they've got to learn from what happened in Chernobyl.</v>

3947
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if Trenoble his damage was as bad as this one is,</v>

3948
01:42:51.821 --> 01:42:56.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty fucking significant and this scary thing again is that there's</v>

3949
01:42:56.591 --> 01:42:59.020
<v Speaker 3>several of these things all over the place.</v>

3950
01:42:59.021 --> 01:42:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say several.</v>

3951
01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:01.820
<v Speaker 3>There's hundreds of moment of the world and if,</v>

3952
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:06.520
<v Speaker 3>if these reactors keep fucking up different spots of the world,</v>

3953
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:11.350
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have giant areas of our world that's contaminated in dead for</v>

3954
01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:14.920
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands of years and that's the reality that we're operating under</v>

3955
01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.180
<v Speaker 3>and living under right now.</v>

3956
01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:19.990
<v Speaker 3>While you and I are sitting here talking on this laptop and you know our,</v>

3957
01:43:19.991 --> 01:43:22.240
<v Speaker 3>our information is being passed through the Internet.</v>

3958
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:24.010
<v Speaker 3>There's lights that are on and you know,</v>

3959
01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.770
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to get in your car and you're going to go and electricity is</v>

3960
01:43:26.771 --> 01:43:28.840
<v Speaker 3>going to fucking power that gas meter.</v>

3961
01:43:28.841 --> 01:43:31.500
<v Speaker 3>When you pump gas at the gas station and there's going to be an electronic,</v>

3962
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.490
<v Speaker 3>all that shit is nuclear power,</v>

3963
01:43:33.491 --> 01:43:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Sun.</v>

3964
01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:37.000
<v Speaker 3>All that shit is built on the back of insanity.</v>

3965
01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Our entire civilization runs on an insane idea that we're going to take and</v>

3966
01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:44.530
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make a nuclear reaction.</v>

3967
01:43:44.531 --> 01:43:48.670
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make a fucking reactor and we're going to use this insanely hot</v>

3968
01:43:48.671 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 3>thing to burn water and creates steam and</v>

3969
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 5>the steam is going to power and make electricity.</v>

3970
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:56.120
<v Speaker 5>It's nuts.</v>

3971
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:57.380
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking crazy.</v>

3972
01:43:57.381 --> 01:43:59.150
<v Speaker 5>And it's how the whole country works.</v>

3973
01:43:59.390 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 5>The whole is essentially almost primarily on coal and nuclear power.</v>

3974
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:05.210
<v Speaker 5>So it's either giant fires or it's,</v>

3975
01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:05.691
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3976
01:44:05.691 --> 01:44:06.980
<v Speaker 5>some people in mill,</v>

3977
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.230
<v Speaker 5>there's a few places that have like windmill fields.</v>

3978
01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:10.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3979
01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.380
<v Speaker 5>dams can generate some electricity,</v>

3980
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:13.970
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of it that it's nuclear.</v>

3981
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.960
<v Speaker 5>A lot.</v>

3982
01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.210
<v Speaker 5>You ever been to that windmill fields?</v>

3983
01:44:17.211 --> 01:44:22.211
<v Speaker 5>That's like right outside of Los Angeles going up like we went to Joshua tree at</v>

3984
01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.170
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>

3985
01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:25.430
<v Speaker 5>She's just thousands of these red dots.</v>

3986
01:44:26.130 --> 01:44:28.940
<v Speaker 5>Like I had no idea what it was and I'm just driving on what the fuck was that?</v>

3987
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:29.390
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3988
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:30.060
<v Speaker 5>What is this?</v>

3989
01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.520
<v Speaker 5>It done a few fear factory.</v>

3990
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:32.630
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

3991
01:44:32.630 --> 01:44:33.080
<v Speaker 5>And those,</v>

3992
01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:33.411
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

3993
01:44:33.411 --> 01:44:35.930
<v Speaker 5>those fan things are so slim that you're like,</v>

3994
01:44:35.931 --> 01:44:36.171
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3995
01:44:36.171 --> 01:44:39.380
<v Speaker 5>How does this do anything small against steel cable.</v>

3996
01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:41.180
<v Speaker 5>Fucking wait Brian,</v>

3997
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.980
<v Speaker 5>how does your brain work?</v>

3998
01:44:42.981 --> 01:44:46.700
<v Speaker 5>Where we were on a conversation about nuclear power and stuff and you asked</v>

3999
01:44:46.701 --> 01:44:48.110
<v Speaker 5>about the safety of nuclear power.</v>

4000
01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:50.390
<v Speaker 5>How would that be an O'Bryant moment?</v>

4001
01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.920
<v Speaker 5>We're completely staying on topic and not making it,</v>

4002
01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:57.410
<v Speaker 5>because I was talking about pouring metal on top of a whole factory,</v>

4003
01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:00.080
<v Speaker 5>locking it down in a big metal box.</v>

4004
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:01.700
<v Speaker 5>Little toys used to buy when you're a kid,</v>

4005
01:45:01.701 --> 01:45:02.511
<v Speaker 5>like does it look cuter?</v>

4006
01:45:02.511 --> 01:45:03.344
<v Speaker 5>Toys like whatever,</v>

4007
01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:04.790
<v Speaker 5>whatever that is.</v>

4008
01:45:04.791 --> 01:45:07.190
<v Speaker 5>If you poured like a billion gallons of oil,</v>

4009
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:10.220
<v Speaker 5>I think the real issue is you see they can't cool it down.</v>

4010
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:12.460
<v Speaker 5>It's going to take forever to come up.</v>

4011
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:16.280
<v Speaker 5>How's other nuclear plants cool down the power to cool it down?</v>

4012
01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:21.770
<v Speaker 5>A lot of what's going on in a nuclear power plant is keeping it stable and</v>

4013
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:24.080
<v Speaker 5>making sure that there's not what's called a meltdown,</v>

4014
01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:27.200
<v Speaker 5>and I don't understand it enough to be just talking in vague terms,</v>

4015
01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:32.030
<v Speaker 5>but what happened with Fukushima was the earthquake and tsunami and flooding and</v>

4016
01:45:32.031 --> 01:45:34.190
<v Speaker 5>everything fucked up their backup generator,</v>

4017
01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:35.780
<v Speaker 5>so they had nothing,</v>

4018
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:37.460
<v Speaker 5>they had nothing to keep it powered,</v>

4019
01:45:37.461 --> 01:45:40.160
<v Speaker 5>so they had essentially eight hours before there was a meltdown,</v>

4020
01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:43.750
<v Speaker 5>so there's eight hours where they could just evacuate the area,</v>

4021
01:45:43.751 --> 01:45:45.440
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know,</v>

4022
01:45:45.441 --> 01:45:46.131
<v Speaker 5>but I'm sure,</v>

4023
01:45:46.131 --> 01:45:50.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's Bonnie's that had been born with no ears is weird mutants that</v>

4024
01:45:50.961 --> 01:45:52.870
<v Speaker 5>are starting to hear in the apple world,</v>

4025
01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:53.630
<v Speaker 5>the fish things,</v>

4026
01:45:53.630 --> 01:45:55.080
<v Speaker 5>they're just hanging out with visibility.</v>

4027
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:58.760
<v Speaker 5>Nonworking eyes just hanging out front with me and Joe,</v>

4028
01:45:58.761 --> 01:46:01.400
<v Speaker 5>you probably have whatever we have now in Japan.</v>

4029
01:46:02.970 --> 01:46:03.803
<v Speaker 5>That's like four.</v>

4030
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:05.360
<v Speaker 5>I was going to not eat the Sushi over there,</v>

4031
01:46:05.361 --> 01:46:06.290
<v Speaker 5>but it looks so delicious.</v>

4032
01:46:06.291 --> 01:46:06.621
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4033
01:46:06.621 --> 01:46:07.041
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4034
01:46:07.041 --> 01:46:07.874
<v Speaker 5>Let's let it rock.</v>

4035
01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:08.571
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4036
01:46:08.571 --> 01:46:10.580
<v Speaker 5>That lasted a half hour.</v>

4037
01:46:10.581 --> 01:46:10.881
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

4038
01:46:10.881 --> 01:46:12.860
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about how we weren't going to eat anything.</v>

4039
01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I'll just have 12 Sushi.</v>

4040
01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:17.091
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

4041
01:46:17.091 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 5>And everybody looked healthy.</v>

4042
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:19.820
<v Speaker 5>That's not how cancer has.</v>

4043
01:46:19.821 --> 01:46:19.941
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4044
01:46:19.941 --> 01:46:20.774
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4045
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:22.230
<v Speaker 5>we're a,</v>

4046
01:46:22.230 --> 01:46:24.620
<v Speaker 5>we were just talking to you and I were about mad cow.</v>

4047
01:46:24.621 --> 01:46:27.250
<v Speaker 5>They just found an episode of Tau.</v>

4048
01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:28.173
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4049
01:46:28.230 --> 01:46:30.680
<v Speaker 5>Then they said the only reason I found it is cause they random testing.</v>

4050
01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:31.580
<v Speaker 5>She's just didn't have,</v>

4051
01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:32.653
<v Speaker 5>didn't have the,</v>

4052
01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:34.310
<v Speaker 5>the symptoms at all.</v>

4053
01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:35.270
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't irritable.</v>

4054
01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:35.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4055
01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:36.081
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4056
01:46:36.081 --> 01:46:37.640
<v Speaker 5>but they said they ha they act a certain way.</v>

4057
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:38.001
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

4058
01:46:38.001 --> 01:46:38.661
<v Speaker 5>it's so scary.</v>

4059
01:46:38.661 --> 01:46:39.590
<v Speaker 5>They're feeding cows,</v>

4060
01:46:39.591 --> 01:46:44.150
<v Speaker 5>cows mad cow disease comes from them taking cows and then butchering them and</v>

4061
01:46:44.151 --> 01:46:48.320
<v Speaker 5>then grinding up their brain matter and all sorts of shit and using it for</v>

4062
01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:49.760
<v Speaker 5>protein that they</v>

4063
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.540
<v Speaker 3>feed the other cows.</v>

4064
01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm mixing them with the grants and cows aren't supposed to eat cows by the way.</v>

4065
01:46:55.021 --> 01:46:56.070
<v Speaker 3>So why are they doing this?</v>

4066
01:46:56.071 --> 01:46:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Really just to save money.</v>

4067
01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:57.331
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

4068
01:46:57.331 --> 01:46:57.781
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

4069
01:46:57.781 --> 01:47:00.720
<v Speaker 3>To save money because it makes us more effective feed.</v>

4070
01:47:00.721 --> 01:47:03.630
<v Speaker 3>You can force the cows to eat that shit and they will eat it and stay alive and</v>

4071
01:47:03.631 --> 01:47:08.100
<v Speaker 3>they get all fat fucked up and they get essentially what's called Jacob's</v>

4072
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:09.300
<v Speaker 3>crutchfields disease,</v>

4073
01:47:09.301 --> 01:47:14.130
<v Speaker 3>which is the same disease that savages and cannibals in New Guinea get where</v>

4074
01:47:14.131 --> 01:47:14.910
<v Speaker 3>they got the shakes.</v>

4075
01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:18.930
<v Speaker 3>They get this terrible neurological disorder from eating human brain because</v>

4076
01:47:18.931 --> 01:47:20.360
<v Speaker 3>your program can not eat.</v>

4077
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Not supposed to eat that up.</v>

4078
01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.134
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

4079
01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking trick by nature to make sure the cannibals don't survive.</v>

4080
01:47:25.801 --> 01:47:27.030
<v Speaker 3>A lion ate human Brian.</v>

4081
01:47:27.031 --> 01:47:27.841
<v Speaker 3>He no problem.</v>

4082
01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:28.674
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

4083
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Unless the lion ate a human who had Jacob's Creutzfeldt disease,</v>

4084
01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:37.320
<v Speaker 3>he could get it because he could get it from what are called prions and that's</v>

4085
01:47:37.321 --> 01:47:41.220
<v Speaker 3>the concern with people eating beef that came from England during a certain</v>

4086
01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:43.890
<v Speaker 3>period of time when mad cow disease was running rampant.</v>

4087
01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:46.890
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that you could have possibly gotten this.</v>

4088
01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Jacobs had people starts showing symptoms that ever,</v>

4089
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.410
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

4090
01:47:50.410 --> 01:47:50.670
<v Speaker 3>glove.</v>

4091
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:50.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4092
01:47:50.881 --> 01:47:51.061
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

4093
01:47:51.061 --> 01:47:52.860
<v Speaker 3>People die from mad cow disease.</v>

4094
01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.730
<v Speaker 3>And then the joke,</v>

4095
01:47:53.730 --> 01:47:55.050
<v Speaker 3>the prime minister of England was trying to say,</v>

4096
01:47:55.110 --> 01:47:57.840
<v Speaker 3>remember that was trying to say it's safe now switch that a burger to his</v>

4097
01:47:57.841 --> 01:47:58.500
<v Speaker 3>daughter.</v>

4098
01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.333
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

4099
01:47:59.850 --> 01:48:01.200
<v Speaker 3>this is how say how thick it is.</v>

4100
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.701
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

4101
01:48:02.701 --> 01:48:03.510
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

4102
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:05.160
<v Speaker 3>That's game of Thrones type shit.</v>

4103
01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Crazy asshole.</v>

4104
01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:07.350
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4105
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4106
01:48:07.861 --> 01:48:11.430
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing that there are so greedy and Stinky and disgusting that they've</v>

4107
01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:14.160
<v Speaker 3>actually decided that there's a good way to save money.</v>

4108
01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:14.821
<v Speaker 3>Feed cows,</v>

4109
01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:15.654
<v Speaker 3>cows.</v>

4110
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:16.441
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

4111
01:48:16.441 --> 01:48:18.180
<v Speaker 3>It's just a conti decision.</v>

4112
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Just the worst decision when any company that makes that decision,</v>

4113
01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.720
<v Speaker 3>the government should come in like storm troopers and closed their fucking shop</v>

4114
01:48:24.721 --> 01:48:27.510
<v Speaker 3>down and make it a socialist place.</v>

4115
01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.520
<v Speaker 3>It should take over and feed the cows.</v>

4116
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Only grass burger cans going to 'em.</v>

4117
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:33.170
<v Speaker 3>That's how bad I feel about it.</v>

4118
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:38.240
<v Speaker 3>To 'em safe chickens and something else and like like 2017 safe chickens,</v>

4119
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 3>free range range chance.</v>

4120
01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.221
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

4121
01:48:41.221 --> 01:48:43.780
<v Speaker 3>So those are more expensive but maybe,</v>

4122
01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:46.800
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're just like financials a little more on it won't make as much</v>

4123
01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:48.180
<v Speaker 3>definitions of free range.</v>

4124
01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I better pretty sloppy.</v>

4125
01:48:49.610 --> 01:48:50.820
<v Speaker 3>But free range is that they don't,</v>

4126
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.900
<v Speaker 3>they're not in cages.</v>

4127
01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:53.040
<v Speaker 3>They're in a giant pit.</v>

4128
01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:54.471
<v Speaker 3>That's probably what it is.</v>

4129
01:48:54.471 --> 01:48:55.950
<v Speaker 3>We're just looks like it's moving.</v>

4130
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4131
01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.040
<v Speaker 3>that's free range by the way.</v>

4132
01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 3>I forgot her and look through the screen door.</v>

4133
01:49:01.490 --> 01:49:03.000
<v Speaker 3>The cats move all at once.</v>

4134
01:49:03.001 --> 01:49:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it just looks like the floor is moving.</v>

4135
01:49:05.821 --> 01:49:07.620
<v Speaker 3>It looks like they're migrating to Diaz.</v>

4136
01:49:07.621 --> 01:49:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Is living in Iraq?</v>

4137
01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Like birds?</v>

4138
01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4139
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.790
<v Speaker 3>it's like 12 it's like a bunch of them have 12 now.</v>

4140
01:49:13.890 --> 01:49:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something like that.</v>

4141
01:49:14.850 --> 01:49:16.780
<v Speaker 3>I think an idea cause I went,</v>

4142
01:49:16.781 --> 01:49:21.240
<v Speaker 3>I need to get rid of one of my cats because it just doesn't work well with my</v>

4143
01:49:21.241 --> 01:49:22.950
<v Speaker 3>dog and the other cat hates it too,</v>

4144
01:49:22.951 --> 01:49:24.120
<v Speaker 3>so it's just miserable.</v>

4145
01:49:24.121 --> 01:49:25.830
<v Speaker 3>So I want to find like an old lady to give it to them.</v>

4146
01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:29.580
<v Speaker 3>But I was thinking about just like taking it over to his house and just kind of</v>

4147
01:49:29.581 --> 01:49:30.750
<v Speaker 3>like throwing it into the mix.</v>

4148
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you pawn it off on my ex girlfriends they've had,</v>

4149
01:49:33.301 --> 01:49:35.100
<v Speaker 3>they've pawned off dogs and cats on you.</v>

4150
01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:36.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4151
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.230
<v Speaker 3>I should know that's,</v>

4152
01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:38.193
<v Speaker 3>that's an old cat.</v>

4153
01:49:38.290 --> 01:49:40.010
<v Speaker 3>What about that's what grandmothers are foreign.</v>

4154
01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:41.550
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately all my grandmothers are dead.</v>

4155
01:49:41.551 --> 01:49:46.260
<v Speaker 3>But I used to always give them my cat like a dictionary and just slam that skull</v>

4156
01:49:46.290 --> 01:49:47.350
<v Speaker 3>giving you their cats.</v>

4157
01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Folk</v>

4158
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:50.200
<v Speaker 1>people need animals.</v>

4159
01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4160
01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I think companionship is fucking for sure.</v>

4161
01:49:54.230 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 1>If anyone in Los Angeles is old and needs a companion,</v>

4162
01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.050
<v Speaker 1>take your old Cathy,</v>

4163
01:49:58.110 --> 01:49:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you're hot shit.</v>

4164
01:49:59.021 --> 01:50:02.410
<v Speaker 1>He'll call me and then I'll see how as long as I can to live your hope it dies,</v>

4165
01:50:02.411 --> 01:50:02.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4166
01:50:02.591 --> 01:50:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like six more years if you come up going,</v>

4167
01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:07.893
<v Speaker 1>no you're not.</v>

4168
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:09.580
<v Speaker 1>What do you ever hope he dies?</v>

4169
01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4170
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't hope any animal dies,</v>

4171
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:13.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of,</v>

4172
01:50:13.890 --> 01:50:14.723
<v Speaker 1>do you want to be upset?</v>

4173
01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Is miserable cat right now and I feel really shitty for,</v>

4174
01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:22.210
<v Speaker 1>for even trying to give it a happy life right now.</v>

4175
01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so miserable?</v>

4176
01:50:23.801 --> 01:50:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Because you've got a second cat.</v>

4177
01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Cause I have a second cat and a dog and both of them fuck with those two.</v>

4178
01:50:28.991 --> 01:50:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Love each other and they're like a gang and they were just like,</v>

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.520
<v Speaker 1>what part of the world,</v>

4228
01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:04.120
<v Speaker 1>if I do Mondays for just for Comedians,</v>

4229
01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:07.120
<v Speaker 1>when I block out of an amount of time like that,</v>

4230
01:52:07.121 --> 01:52:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it's very selfish because I'm a father.</v>

4231
01:52:10.210 --> 01:52:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I could smoke pot and be functional,</v>

4232
01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.650
<v Speaker 1>but I have to be real particular about like where I,</v>

4233
01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:15.890
<v Speaker 1>where I do shrooms</v>

4234
01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:18.520
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

4235
01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I tell you the last time I did it,</v>

4236
01:52:19.710 --> 01:52:19.871
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4237
01:52:19.871 --> 01:52:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I was convinced I'm never going to do this shit ever again.</v>

4238
01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4239
01:52:24.610 --> 01:52:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I've done it since I was a young person and then I stopped for seven years and</v>

4240
01:52:29.471 --> 01:52:31.840
<v Speaker 1>then I always thought in that seven year time I'm like,</v>

4241
01:52:31.841 --> 01:52:32.620
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

4242
01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I've done everything I needed to do at that.</v>

4243
01:52:34.811 --> 01:52:35.740
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>

4244
01:52:35.741 --> 01:52:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Now I need.</v>

4245
01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:40.120
<v Speaker 1>But then I started dating younger girls and then I had to re go through all</v>

4246
01:52:40.121 --> 01:52:44.170
<v Speaker 1>their drug experiences and now I'm back into how I was when I was 21 again,</v>

4247
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

4248
01:52:45.351 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4249
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

4250
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.270
<v Speaker 3>all about the intent.</v>

4251
01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you trying to accomplish that are using it or you're trying to</v>

4252
01:52:50.631 --> 01:52:52.070
<v Speaker 3>find something out about yourself.</v>

4253
01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Are you trying to have like a spiritual journey that you go on or are you just</v>

4254
01:52:57.711 --> 01:53:01.220
<v Speaker 3>trying to play and party and get fucked up and say,</v>

4255
01:53:01.221 --> 01:53:01.330
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4256
01:53:01.330 --> 01:53:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe what I took?</v>

4257
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:02.511
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4258
01:53:02.511 --> 01:53:06.530
<v Speaker 3>I took so much because I think a lot of times when you do that and he don't go</v>

4259
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:08.660
<v Speaker 3>into a trip like you can,</v>

4260
01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.230
<v Speaker 3>you could take a mushroom trip for granted and a mushroom trip can kick your</v>

4261
01:53:12.231 --> 01:53:13.080
<v Speaker 3>fucking ass.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4263
01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:14.450

4264
01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:15.250
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4265
01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:16.120

4266
01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:17.010
<v Speaker 3>go to like a concert.</v>

4267
01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:19.393
<v Speaker 3>The quantity,</v>

4268
01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:20.610
<v Speaker 3>quantity,</v>

4269

4271
01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.930
<v Speaker 3>the quantity and who you're with,</v>

4272
01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:26.090
<v Speaker 3>where your state of mind you want to be with people you love.</v>

4273
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4277
01:53:29.331 --> 01:53:31.310
<v Speaker 3>when you do big doses like you did,</v>

4278
01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 3>you did a giant dose.</v>

4279
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I firmly believe that you should last time,</v>

4280
01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:38.360
<v Speaker 3>be prepared for a fucking journey through space.</v>

4281
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:39.141
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>

4282
01:53:39.141 --> 01:53:39.291
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4283
01:53:39.291 --> 01:53:41.690
<v Speaker 3>you should be someone who's been going to yoga class.</v>

4284
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.883
<v Speaker 3>You should be selling anything.</v>

4285
01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:43.611
<v Speaker 3>Sit down.</v>

4286
01:53:43.611 --> 01:53:44.030
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>

4287
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:45.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that's an overdose on mountain like,</v>

4288
01:53:45.630 --> 01:53:45.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4289
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:47.540
<v Speaker 3>there is such thing as overdose amount,</v>

4290
01:53:47.541 --> 01:53:48.374
<v Speaker 3>meaning</v>

4291
01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:50.243
<v Speaker 3>the rats,</v>

4292
01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:53.000
<v Speaker 3>the body immediately rejects any of it.</v>

4293
01:53:53.230 --> 01:53:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Like a small amount.</v>

4294
01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:55.040
<v Speaker 3>That's what an overdose.</v>

4295
01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:55.761
<v Speaker 3>It's like your body is like,</v>

4296
01:53:55.761 --> 01:53:56.210
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4297
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:56.690
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4298
01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Get this out of an overdose.</v>

4299
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:59.750
<v Speaker 3>You're reacting to that,</v>

4300
01:53:59.751 --> 01:54:00.584
<v Speaker 3>to that stuff.</v>

4301
01:54:01.050 --> 01:54:03.310
<v Speaker 3>This thing about mushrooms is it's not poison.</v>

4302
01:54:03.311 --> 01:54:04.220
<v Speaker 3>It's what's going to,</v>

4303
01:54:04.221 --> 01:54:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Jackie was like,</v>

4304
01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:06.600
<v Speaker 3>it's like saying salt as poison.</v>

4305
01:54:06.601 --> 01:54:07.431
<v Speaker 3>Salt doesn't poison,</v>

4306
01:54:07.431 --> 01:54:08.390
<v Speaker 3>but if you had a pound of it,</v>

4307
01:54:08.391 --> 01:54:09.190
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking dead.</v>

4308
01:54:09.190 --> 01:54:09.860
<v Speaker 3>It's the warm,</v>

4309
01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:10.041
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4310
01:54:10.041 --> 01:54:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms are the,</v>

4311
01:54:11.751 --> 01:54:12.081
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4312
01:54:12.081 --> 01:54:14.330
<v Speaker 3>the act of psychoactive ingredients and mushrooms.</v>

4313
01:54:14.331 --> 01:54:14.451
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

4314
01:54:14.451 --> 01:54:16.160
<v Speaker 3>it mimics human neuro chemistry.</v>

4315
01:54:16.161 --> 01:54:18.640
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's so powerful with mushrooms is,</v>

4316
01:54:18.641 --> 01:54:19.474
<v Speaker 3>is like for,</v>

4317
01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:20.470
<v Speaker 3>with silicide bananas,</v>

4318
01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to say it exactly,</v>

4319
01:54:21.711 --> 01:54:23.180
<v Speaker 3>but something like four phosphoryl,</v>

4320
01:54:23.181 --> 01:54:24.460
<v Speaker 3>oxy and,</v>

4321
01:54:24.461 --> 01:54:28.430
<v Speaker 3>and dimethyltryptamine and dimethyltryptamine is actually made by the human</v>

4322
01:54:28.431 --> 01:54:28.761
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

4323
01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:30.950
<v Speaker 3>So it's die methyl trip to me and plus something else.</v>

4324
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:35.600
<v Speaker 3>And it's some weird phosphorus something or another molecule attached to it</v>

4325
01:54:35.601 --> 01:54:36.860
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another that makes it different.</v>

4326
01:54:36.861 --> 01:54:37.694
<v Speaker 3>But whatever it is,</v>

4327
01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:39.620
<v Speaker 3>it's so close to human neuro chemistry.</v>

4328
01:54:39.621 --> 01:54:40.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not really a poison.</v>

4329
01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:45.080
<v Speaker 3>It's just some weird fucking side venture that you can take your mind on.</v>

4330
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:49.580
<v Speaker 3>So the danger is only in like spectacular doses to,</v>

4331
01:54:49.590 --> 01:54:53.060
<v Speaker 3>to actually worry about poisoning yourself to the three grams are fine.</v>

4332
01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4333
01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:54.500
<v Speaker 3>You could take,</v>

4334
01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:55.430
<v Speaker 3>you could take a lot.</v>

4335
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4336
01:54:55.731 --> 01:54:59.900
<v Speaker 3>I know many people that the five and 10 grams,</v>

4337
01:54:59.901 --> 01:55:03.320
<v Speaker 3>I've heard two grams from many different people and they are fine.</v>

4338
01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:03.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4339
01:55:03.651 --> 01:55:05.450
<v Speaker 3>there's scared as fuck.</v>

4340
01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:06.500
<v Speaker 3>And when they come out of it,</v>

4341
01:55:06.501 --> 01:55:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean they shot through the middle of the fucking rabbit hole and came back</v>

4342
01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:11.450
<v Speaker 3>with Robert Lewis cat.</v>

4343
01:55:11.451 --> 01:55:11.730
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>

4344
01:55:11.730 --> 01:55:12.830
<v Speaker 3>what does the guys about what you did?</v>

4345
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:13.903
<v Speaker 3>10 grams.</v>

4346
01:55:14.590 --> 01:55:15.680
<v Speaker 3>That's about 10 groups.</v>

4347
01:55:15.681 --> 01:55:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4348
01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Robert Louis Stevenson.</v>

4349
01:55:17.590 --> 01:55:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4350
01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Is he the one who wrote um,</v>

4351
01:55:19.610 --> 01:55:20.301
<v Speaker 3>Alice in wonderland,</v>

4352
01:55:20.301 --> 01:55:21.021
<v Speaker 3>which she wrote with this.</v>

4353
01:55:21.021 --> 01:55:21.791
<v Speaker 3>Let's just go with it.</v>

4354
01:55:21.791 --> 01:55:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Cause it wasn't like Lewis Carroll though,</v>

4355
01:55:23.211 --> 01:55:23.550
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

4356
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:28.550
<v Speaker 3>Was Carol's Carol Lewis Carroll multiply that times a middle ship.</v>

4357
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:30.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean all that stuff was,</v>

4358
01:55:30.450 --> 01:55:32.270
<v Speaker 3>that was all psychedelic inspired.</v>

4359
01:55:32.271 --> 01:55:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure all of his,</v>

4360
01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean it wasn't it supposed to be about assets supposed to be about that.</v>

4361
01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4362
01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.071
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

4363
01:55:37.071 --> 01:55:40.010
<v Speaker 3>you could take enough mushrooms that you could fucking lose your mind for sure.</v>

4364
01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.451
<v Speaker 3>I'm just super,</v>

4365
01:55:41.451 --> 01:55:42.250
<v Speaker 3>super hot.</v>

4366
01:55:42.250 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 3>No one has listening to this is going</v>

4367
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:44.873
<v Speaker 1>to take that much.</v>

4368
01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4369
01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 1>my legs do not work.</v>

4370
01:55:46.321 --> 01:55:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I fell to the ground.</v>

4371
01:55:47.401 --> 01:55:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Legs don't work.</v>

4372
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I thought as he's walking down the street,</v>

4373
01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:51.660
<v Speaker 1>my legs didn't work.</v>

4374
01:55:51.670 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I fell to the ground and I could not stand up.</v>

4375
01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:57.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good example for the youth of America.</v>

4376
01:55:57.690 --> 01:55:57.961
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4377
01:55:57.961 --> 01:55:59.480
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that's anything that is,</v>

4378
01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:03.090
<v Speaker 1>people should try it unless they done the research and make sure they're safe.</v>

4379
01:56:03.091 --> 01:56:04.620
<v Speaker 1>And I was talking about age.</v>

4380
01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:05.071
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

4381
01:56:05.071 --> 01:56:05.904
<v Speaker 1>That was 10 grams.</v>

4382
01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:06.773
<v Speaker 1>That was that.</v>

4383
01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:09.630
<v Speaker 1>That was when I took a quarter in an eighth.</v>

4384
01:56:09.631 --> 01:56:10.464
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is.</v>

4385
01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:12.803
<v Speaker 9>Whoa.</v>

4386
01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:15.793
<v Speaker 9>Whoa.</v>

4387
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:26.260
<v Speaker 1>The youth of America.</v>

4388
01:56:26.261 --> 01:56:27.730
<v Speaker 1>And they deserve better than that.</v>

4389
01:56:27.731 --> 01:56:28.564
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

4390
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:29.860
<v Speaker 1>you're a leader at this point.</v>

4391
01:56:29.861 --> 01:56:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to step up.</v>

4392
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll have it on here.</v>

4393
01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>

4394
01:56:32.830 --> 01:56:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Stop having your legs fall apart,</v>

4395
01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.053
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

4396
01:56:35.710 --> 01:56:36.880
<v Speaker 1>How many grams you think you did?</v>

4397
01:56:36.970 --> 01:56:38.740
<v Speaker 1>What you had this spectacular trip?</v>

4398
01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:39.191
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

4399
01:56:39.191 --> 01:56:40.120
<v Speaker 1>It's [inaudible].</v>

4400
01:56:40.330 --> 01:56:41.141
<v Speaker 1>That's what it comes out to.</v>

4401
01:56:41.141 --> 01:56:41.530
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

4402
01:56:41.530 --> 01:56:42.220
<v Speaker 1>10 to 11.</v>

4403
01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.053
<v Speaker 1>10 to 11 grounds.</v>

4404
01:56:43.770 --> 01:56:44.590
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

4405
01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:46.600
<v Speaker 1>What was the most memorable part of it?</v>

4406
01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4407
01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:49.420
<v Speaker 1>my hand turning into pyramids.</v>

4408
01:56:49.421 --> 01:56:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Gold Pyramids.</v>

4409
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4410
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:51.703
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

4411
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4412
01:56:52.330 --> 01:56:57.330
<v Speaker 1>when I puked it was all colors and it turned into trees and it like felt like</v>

4413
01:56:58.781 --> 01:57:00.910
<v Speaker 1>there was trees going in my mouth and stuff.</v>

4414
01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And then three is going into your mouth.</v>

4415
01:57:03.281 --> 01:57:04.090
<v Speaker 1>The wow.</v>

4416
01:57:04.090 --> 01:57:07.750
<v Speaker 1>The walls are made it like at a Lego's and they were just falling down and wow.</v>

4417
01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:09.350
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking crazy.</v>

4418
01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I know it's sick.</v>

4419
01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:10.821
<v Speaker 1>I now,</v>

4420
01:57:10.821 --> 01:57:11.770
<v Speaker 1>what thoughts did you have?</v>

4421
01:57:11.770 --> 01:57:12.760
<v Speaker 1>All this was going on.</v>

4422
01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4423
01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:13.871
<v Speaker 1>olive garden.</v>

4424
01:57:13.871 --> 01:57:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I ate too much.</v>

4425
01:57:14.801 --> 01:57:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I would poison.</v>

4426
01:57:15.641 --> 01:57:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't my legs working?</v>

4427
01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:18.063
<v Speaker 1>I'm puking.</v>

4428
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I tell.</v>

4429
01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really paranoid.</v>

4430
01:57:20.141 --> 01:57:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It was more like something I've never had my legs never work.</v>

4431
01:57:23.081 --> 01:57:23.914
<v Speaker 1>I've never had bought,</v>

4432
01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:28.540
<v Speaker 1>like I've trimmed off 100 times plus and I've never had it where like my body</v>

4433
01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:29.200
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't work.</v>

4434
01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.230
<v Speaker 1>So you were just so bunkered out that you literally couldn't figure out how to</v>

4435
01:57:32.231 --> 01:57:33.670
<v Speaker 1>use things I guess.</v>

4436
01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

4437
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I I recorded myself and I talked like I was fine and,</v>

4438
01:57:39.330 --> 01:57:40.300
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4439
01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:41.151
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

4440
01:57:41.151 --> 01:57:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I knew what was going on,</v>

4441
01:57:42.431 --> 01:57:43.181
<v Speaker 1>but it was more of like,</v>

4442
01:57:43.181 --> 01:57:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a poisoned.</v>

4443
01:57:44.890 --> 01:57:47.350
<v Speaker 1>What's like the best thing you ever learned from a trip?</v>

4444
01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:48.040
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

4445
01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:52.390
<v Speaker 1>what have you ever come out of a trip and had like this is like a real solid</v>

4446
01:57:52.391 --> 01:57:53.224
<v Speaker 1>revelation.</v>

4447
01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I always have revelations every single time.</v>

4448
01:57:57.911 --> 01:57:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Like the last one I did,</v>

4449
01:57:59.710 --> 01:58:00.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4450
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:01.390

4451
01:58:01.450 --> 01:58:01.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4452
01:58:01.811 --> 01:58:05.260
<v Speaker 1>I did an a shitty hotel room and I did a whole podcast with the other girl I did</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I will help people find it.</v>

4455
01:58:08.530 --> 01:58:08.801
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4460
01:58:14.591 --> 01:58:17.680
<v Speaker 1>people that people might be listening to this a hundred years from now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hopefully it sounds something cooler than I phones or Ipods,</v>

4468
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.800
<v Speaker 1>but quite,</v>

<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

4486
01:58:43.761 --> 01:58:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I could go into a place that's like a shitty environment.</v>

4487
01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Death Squad number 18.</v>

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:05.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4501
01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:07.060
<v Speaker 2>she just has had so much,</v>

4502
01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:08.590
<v Speaker 2>most of her life.</v>

4503
01:59:08.591 --> 01:59:10.150
<v Speaker 2>She had such bad s uh,</v>

4504
01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:12.970
<v Speaker 2>social anxiety that she would never even talk to anyone.</v>

4505
01:59:13.150 --> 01:59:16.300
<v Speaker 2>And then recently she started getting better with the help of actually had</v>

4506
01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:16.871
<v Speaker 2>Adderall it,</v>

4507
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:17.531
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not.</v>

4508
01:59:17.531 --> 01:59:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4509
01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:18.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4510
01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:19.061
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4511
01:59:19.061 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 2>so now she's actually being able to function and talk to people,</v>

4512
01:59:22.001 --> 01:59:23.320
<v Speaker 2>which is something that she,</v>

4513
01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:25.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like being reborn as an adult.</v>

4514
01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:27.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4515
01:59:27.490 --> 01:59:29.410
<v Speaker 2>she had the most fabulous,</v>

4516
01:59:29.411 --> 01:59:30.430
<v Speaker 2>wonderful time.</v>

4517
01:59:30.431 --> 01:59:30.791
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

4518
01:59:30.791 --> 01:59:35.500
<v Speaker 2>she found all this things and it was just the most ideal thing ever.</v>

4519
01:59:35.501 --> 01:59:37.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's like in a Shitty,</v>

4520
01:59:37.301 --> 01:59:37.541
<v Speaker 2>shitty,</v>

4521
01:59:37.541 --> 01:59:38.390
<v Speaker 2>shitty situation.</v>

4522
01:59:38.410 --> 01:59:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Amazing how the same stuff,</v>

4523
01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.100
<v Speaker 2>the same batch of the same drug.</v>

4524
01:59:42.130 --> 01:59:43.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you've got a bad batch.</v>

4525
01:59:43.271 --> 01:59:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Just some people have a good trip and every once in a while somebody is a bad</v>

4526
01:59:45.501 --> 01:59:45.700
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>

4527
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it is going,</v>

4528
01:59:46.841 --> 01:59:47.830
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in your head?</v>

4529
01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Because there's with people in times in my life where I was teetering on a bad</v>

4530
01:59:53.111 --> 01:59:53.944
<v Speaker 2>state of mind,</v>

4531
01:59:55.130 --> 01:59:56.440
<v Speaker 2>but if you listen to the thing,</v>

4532
01:59:56.470 --> 02:00:00.940
<v Speaker 2>if there was a reason I was forced into this bad situation because I went from</v>

4533
02:00:00.941 --> 02:00:04.900
<v Speaker 2>being like all right this like we might get shot at this hotel,</v>

4534
02:00:04.901 --> 02:00:08.980
<v Speaker 2>this hotel is actually a place that you'd go to do drugs and get hookers.</v>

4535
02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people living there and we explain this whole thing in detail.</v>

4536
02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:15.520
<v Speaker 2>So I ate it and then immediately started realizing like,</v>

4537
02:00:15.521 --> 02:00:16.354
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

4538
02:00:16.810 --> 02:00:19.390
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to be here for six hours trapped in this room.</v>

4539
02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I need to be a babysitter because this might be really bad at something like</v>

4540
02:00:23.230 --> 02:00:25.570
<v Speaker 2>fear and loathing in the middle of the desert type shit.</v>

4541
02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:28.060
<v Speaker 2>That's funny dude.</v>

4542
02:00:28.130 --> 02:00:31.780
<v Speaker 2>You should to write about that and that should be part of your act on stage.</v>

4543
02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I need to figure it out.</v>

4544
02:00:33.461 --> 02:00:35.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a funny idea for a bit,</v>

4545
02:00:35.150 --> 02:00:35.800
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

4546
02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Getting fucked up on mushrooms in the wrong hotel.</v>

4547
02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:40.870
<v Speaker 2>It was bad cause like every time I wanted it to go have a cigarette,</v>

4548
02:00:40.871 --> 02:00:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I had to go outside.</v>

4549
02:00:41.711 --> 02:00:44.140
<v Speaker 2>And one time there was like this black dude that right there was like running</v>

4550
02:00:44.141 --> 02:00:44.740
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>

4551
02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Then he hid behind a wall and you look out and he looked right at me.</v>

4552
02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4553
02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:47.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

4554
02:00:47.921 --> 02:00:48.461
<v Speaker 2>I saw him.</v>

4555
02:00:48.461 --> 02:00:50.260
<v Speaker 2>And then he started running as fast as he can.</v>

4556
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Like he was absolutely hiding from something neighborhood was uh,</v>

4557
02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:55.210
<v Speaker 2>it was in this weird place in Ventura.</v>

4558
02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:56.800
<v Speaker 2>It was really bad.</v>

4559
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he was on mushrooms maybe,</v>

4560
02:00:58.750 --> 02:00:59.021
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4561
02:00:59.021 --> 02:00:59.830
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

4562
02:00:59.830 --> 02:01:02.980
<v Speaker 2>but I would go out and have a cigarette and I started like I had this a cell</v>

4563
02:01:02.981 --> 02:01:03.431
<v Speaker 2>phone case.</v>

4564
02:01:03.431 --> 02:01:04.750
<v Speaker 2>It had all these little diamonds on it,</v>

4565
02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:07.630
<v Speaker 2>kind of like these little gems self yet be dazzled.</v>

4566
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>And so I started like leaving them everywhere.</v>

4567
02:01:10.001 --> 02:01:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I would walk just so I would have a place if they have to find me.</v>

4568
02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:18.010
<v Speaker 2>There was like I was doing read their mind can definitely want her to on a bad</v>

4569
02:01:18.011 --> 02:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>situation where it makes it seem way worse while you're mushroom.</v>

4570
02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.950
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a fire alarm outside of our door and I'm like,</v>

4571
02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:25.570
<v Speaker 2>that's the emergency thing.</v>

4572
02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:26.800
<v Speaker 2>If anything happens,</v>

4573
02:01:26.801 --> 02:01:28.140
<v Speaker 2>if we get robbed or stuff,</v>

4574
02:01:28.190 --> 02:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>it's something I'm pulling that that's how scary this hotel was,</v>

4575
02:01:31.901 --> 02:01:34.090
<v Speaker 2>but I made myself puke but it was too late.</v>

4576
02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:37.510
<v Speaker 2>I would think it'd be so fun if you grab that and pull it and it's silence.</v>

4577
02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:38.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4578
02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:39.100
<v Speaker 2>it just falls off.</v>

4579
02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:40.320
<v Speaker 2>There's drugs and the claim</v>

4580
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>cooking happens on us,</v>

4581
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but you got to do that within the first 30 minutes.</v>

4582
02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I tried to and it was the only time I've never heard a tripping out 30 minutes</v>

4583
02:01:46.491 --> 02:01:47.324
<v Speaker 1>in that heart.</v>

4584
02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't eaten the whole day or the night before.</v>

4585
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I actually had my finger down my throat and never have done that successfully in</v>

4586
02:01:54.411 --> 02:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>my whole entire life and made myself puke it up.</v>

4587
02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I got to pee and I start tripping.</v>

4588
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>How long into this was,</v>

4589
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>it was about 30 minutes.</v>

4590
02:02:02.190 --> 02:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>If you've just started shipping afterwards,</v>

4591
02:02:03.401 --> 02:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>why did you make yourself throw up?</v>

4592
02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:05.391
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4593
02:02:05.391 --> 02:02:06.770
<v Speaker 1>it was happening while I was puking.</v>

4594
02:02:06.771 --> 02:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>I saw that stuff where you started feeling like terrible and stuff was happening</v>

4595
02:02:10.101 --> 02:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

4596
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Like as you sort of just was a different,</v>

4597
02:02:11.690 --> 02:02:12.560
<v Speaker 1>this is my latest trip.</v>

4598
02:02:12.561 --> 02:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>We went,</v>

4599
02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I turned to my hotel room,</v>

4600
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I just win after I ate,</v>

4601
02:02:16.521 --> 02:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I started noticing like how bad his hotel was.</v>

4602
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Like we opened up the sheets and there was like a fucking mess shit in there and</v>

4603
02:02:23.181 --> 02:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>there was like a stain that was on each side of the sheets and and yeah.</v>

4604
02:02:27.381 --> 02:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>And then just people offside that were like,</v>

4605
02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:30.980
<v Speaker 1>it was scary.</v>

4606
02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Like the cops came at one point in the busted up.</v>

4607
02:02:33.171 --> 02:02:36.140
<v Speaker 1>This huge cops are good to see when you're on mushrooms even though they can't</v>

4608
02:02:36.141 --> 02:02:36.351
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

4609
02:02:36.351 --> 02:02:36.881
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anything.</v>

4610
02:02:36.881 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>They just still like good cops.</v>

4611
02:02:38.190 --> 02:02:38.901
<v Speaker 1>This is weird.</v>

4612
02:02:38.901 --> 02:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>This makes a bad thing.</v>

4613
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>When Pam was checking into the hotel,</v>

4614
02:02:41.811 --> 02:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>somebody crashed through the office in their car.</v>

4615
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you go to there?</v>

4616
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4617
02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go there.</v>

4618
02:02:47.211 --> 02:02:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I met them there and then I ran up to the room thinking oh this is cool.</v>

4619
02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:53.960
<v Speaker 1>And then right after I eat cause I was trying to catch up cause they were</v>

4620
02:02:53.961 --> 02:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

4621
02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>somebody crashed through the window with their car when they checked in to</v>

4622
02:02:56.991 --> 02:02:58.880
<v Speaker 1>somebody crashed the car into the office.</v>

4623
02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:00.930
<v Speaker 1>So like the wall was broken open and like,</v>

4624
02:03:00.931 --> 02:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah and you'll look dumb.</v>

4625
02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:02.901
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4626
02:03:02.901 --> 02:03:04.140
<v Speaker 1>here's my credit card information.</v>

4627
02:03:04.170 --> 02:03:05.003
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

4628
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.841
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it.</v>

4629
02:03:05.841 --> 02:03:06.950
<v Speaker 1>But yeah it was,</v>

4630
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>it was uh,</v>

4631
02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:12.050
<v Speaker 1>it was a showroom of hell April while she was having the same exact opposite.</v>

4632
02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:12.884
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting.</v>

4633
02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>We just talked for like two hours about you can let yourself get in a bad place.</v>

4634
02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:19.290
<v Speaker 1>My friend took it once with a girl with a god he's barely knew and a girl he</v>

4635
02:03:19.291 --> 02:03:22.550
<v Speaker 1>sort of liked and it was just one of the worst trips for him because he said it</v>

4636
02:03:22.551 --> 02:03:25.700
<v Speaker 1>was like he was worried about his behavior in front of certain people and not</v>

4637
02:03:25.701 --> 02:03:27.500
<v Speaker 1>worrying puts you in a bad position.</v>

4638
02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4639
02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:29.570
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things about ecstasy.</v>

4640
02:03:29.571 --> 02:03:30.261
<v Speaker 1>That's so cool.</v>

4641
02:03:30.261 --> 02:03:32.900
<v Speaker 1>You can do it with anybody or you just feel like you'd like everybody.</v>

4642
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:33.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4643
02:03:33.111 --> 02:03:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Released everything.</v>

4644
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I still think that's the best drag in the whole entire ride.</v>

4645
02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I had to choose one drug other than weed.</v>

4646
02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:40.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4647
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:41.001
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

4648
02:03:41.001 --> 02:03:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I love the experience with the comedown was fucking brutal.</v>

4649
02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:45.501
<v Speaker 1>It was brutal.</v>

4650
02:03:45.501 --> 02:03:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I took two pills.</v>

4651
02:03:46.401 --> 02:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the milligrams,</v>

4652
02:03:47.331 --> 02:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>where I am today.</v>

4653
02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:51.560
<v Speaker 1>The next day I was wrecked.</v>

4654
02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>All sort of the same milligrams.</v>

4655
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4656
02:03:53.690 --> 02:03:54.523
<v Speaker 1>They're just different.</v>

4657
02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I seen the guy once,</v>

4658
02:03:55.650 --> 02:03:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take nine.</v>

4659
02:03:56.930 --> 02:03:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4660
02:03:57.891 --> 02:03:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4661
02:03:59.080 --> 02:03:59.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4662
02:03:59.241 --> 02:04:02.240

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:12.511
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4702
02:05:12.511 --> 02:05:13.344
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

4703
02:05:13.590 --> 02:05:14.490
<v Speaker 3>that's so brutal.</v>

4704
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Ari was like right over my right shoulder.</v>

4705
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:17.701
<v Speaker 3>Like where I'm sitting,</v>

4706
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting like right at the cage and Ari's right behind me.</v>

4707
02:05:20.101 --> 02:05:22.570
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at like the animated gifs are online,</v>

4708
02:05:22.670 --> 02:05:26.010
<v Speaker 3>you can see are we pop up as a super slow motion.</v>

4709
02:05:26.011 --> 02:05:28.960
<v Speaker 3>When I thought it was like really cool to see it happening super slowly,</v>

4710
02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:31.770
<v Speaker 3>slowly up before he hits the ground.</v>

4711
02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:33.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what anybody says.</v>

4712
02:05:33.241 --> 02:05:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Dad is the greatest job I have ever figured out how to,</v>

4713
02:05:37.081 --> 02:05:39.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how the fuck I ever got a job working for the UFC.</v>

4714
02:05:39.930 --> 02:05:41.430
<v Speaker 3>But that is the greatest job ever.</v>

4715
02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:43.380
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>

4716
02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Nuts.</v>

4717
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Brazil was insane to be able to be there right there.</v>

4718
02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:49.013
<v Speaker 3>Ringside.</v>

4719
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:49.883
<v Speaker 3>I've seen like,</v>

4720
02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:51.540
<v Speaker 3>like more than a thousand.</v>

4721
02:05:51.541 --> 02:05:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Great fights like that.</v>

4722
02:05:52.830 --> 02:05:53.940
<v Speaker 3>It's really incredible.</v>

4723
02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:54.571
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4724
02:05:54.571 --> 02:05:55.890
<v Speaker 3>And then for you in Brazil,</v>

4725
02:05:55.891 --> 02:05:59.230
<v Speaker 3>you were right there with me and the stage 18,000 people fucking screen.</v>

4726
02:05:59.231 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 3>And you've never seen a crowd like a Brazilian crowd,</v>

4727
02:06:01.261 --> 02:06:01.950
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4728
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who thinks that American crowds are loyal or no,</v>

4729
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:07.760
<v Speaker 3>just screaming.</v>

4730
02:06:07.770 --> 02:06:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Usa Boxing Guy Trains in England.</v>

4731
02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Who's cream?</v>

4732
02:06:11.150 --> 02:06:12.120
<v Speaker 3>USA to the other one.</v>

4733
02:06:12.210 --> 02:06:12.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4734
02:06:12.451 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 3>we scream USA.</v>

4735
02:06:13.530 --> 02:06:14.440
<v Speaker 3>But that's about it.</v>

4736
02:06:14.441 --> 02:06:16.050
<v Speaker 3>And in Brazil they scream,</v>

4737
02:06:16.051 --> 02:06:17.010
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die.</v>

4738
02:06:17.070 --> 02:06:17.903
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna die.</v>

4739
02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:19.403
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna die.</v>

4740
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:20.610
<v Speaker 3>And then when Mike Pyle,</v>

4741
02:06:20.611 --> 02:06:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Mike Pyle won his fight against this Brazilian dude,</v>

4742
02:06:23.670 --> 02:06:25.800
<v Speaker 3>only numbers Brazilian or one against Funche.</v>

4743
02:06:26.010 --> 02:06:27.360
<v Speaker 3>And when he won,</v>

4744
02:06:27.361 --> 02:06:32.361
<v Speaker 3>the fucking whole crown is calling him a fag crowd Portuguese there to the,</v>

4745
02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:34.050
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

4746
02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:34.860
<v Speaker 3>to the translator.</v>

4747
02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Like what are they saying?</v>

4748
02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:36.450
<v Speaker 3>What are they selling right now?</v>

4749
02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:38.580
<v Speaker 3>But she thought they were saying a different word.</v>

4750
02:06:38.581 --> 02:06:39.330
<v Speaker 3>It turns out there were,</v>

4751
02:06:39.330 --> 02:06:42.180
<v Speaker 3>she thought they were saying she gone know which is junior dos Santos,</v>

4752
02:06:42.181 --> 02:06:43.014
<v Speaker 3>his nickname.</v>

4753
02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:47.190
<v Speaker 3>They were saying it's like fig I know or something along those lines which just</v>

4754
02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:48.073
<v Speaker 3>faggot.</v>

4755
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:51.660
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate that Anderson Silva and Chael Sonnen and aren't going to be</v>

4756
02:06:51.661 --> 02:06:52.500
<v Speaker 3>fighting in Brazil.</v>

4757
02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:56.520
<v Speaker 3>There was apparently we're going to do it at the giant soccer stadium,</v>

4758
02:06:56.521 --> 02:06:58.230
<v Speaker 3>which is going to be 80,000 people.</v>

4759
02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:03.300
<v Speaker 3>But there was a UN meeting that was going on there the two days before.</v>

4760
02:07:03.301 --> 02:07:05.010
<v Speaker 3>So there would've been no hotel rooms.</v>

4761
02:07:05.011 --> 02:07:08.700
<v Speaker 3>It would have been a nightmare because you'd have to bring in 80,000 people from</v>

4762
02:07:08.701 --> 02:07:12.870
<v Speaker 3>other parts of Brazil in the world want to come in and fly in to see that fight.</v>

4763
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:14.580
<v Speaker 3>So it was way too nutty.</v>

4764
02:07:14.581 --> 02:07:17.110
<v Speaker 3>So they had decided to move it to another place.</v>

4765
02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:17.530
<v Speaker 3>I would have been.</v>

4766
02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's the biggest fight available.</v>

4767
02:07:19.590 --> 02:07:22.590
<v Speaker 3>So just the biggest fight and it would be in the biggest city.</v>

4768
02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:23.610
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be like,</v>

4769
02:07:23.610 --> 02:07:23.880
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4770
02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:27.390
<v Speaker 3>I think as far as what I've read is that they're still going to do a fight in</v>

4771
02:07:27.391 --> 02:07:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Brazil that week,</v>

4772
02:07:28.590 --> 02:07:28.951
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>

4773
02:07:28.951 --> 02:07:32.040
<v Speaker 3>they're locking down where that's going to be and who's going to be on that</v>

4774
02:07:32.041 --> 02:07:32.331
<v Speaker 3>card,</v>

4775
02:07:32.331 --> 02:07:32.670
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4776
02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:34.400
<v Speaker 3>But the sheriffs are really great.</v>

4777
02:07:34.401 --> 02:07:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva and Max is going to be in Vegas,</v>

4778
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:40.930
<v Speaker 3>which probably for Chell son in his fucking way better,</v>

4779
02:07:40.931 --> 02:07:41.490
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4780
02:07:41.490 --> 02:07:42.071
<v Speaker 3>That guy was,</v>

4781
02:07:42.071 --> 02:07:43.930
<v Speaker 3>he was in danger and danger.</v>

4782
02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4783
02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:46.900
<v Speaker 3>That place was so goddamn beautiful.</v>

4784
02:07:46.901 --> 02:07:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Brazil.</v>

4785
02:07:47.710 --> 02:07:48.543
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

4786
02:07:48.730 --> 02:07:51.090
<v Speaker 3>What Ari and I were saying is we were up at seven o'clock in the morning and</v>

4787
02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:52.780
<v Speaker 3>watching these kids playing and we're like,</v>

4788
02:07:52.781 --> 02:07:54.250
<v Speaker 3>look how great this life is.</v>

4789
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.461
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4790
02:07:54.461 --> 02:07:56.230
<v Speaker 3>why don't kids in America do this?</v>

4791
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't everybody running around and playing like this?</v>

4792
02:07:58.511 --> 02:08:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Like this is like they were so,</v>

4793
02:08:00.670 --> 02:08:01.900
<v Speaker 3>it looks so joyful.</v>

4794
02:08:01.901 --> 02:08:02.950
<v Speaker 3>There was so much fun too.</v>

4795
02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:06.190
<v Speaker 3>And you knew that they probably were pulling like America used to be,</v>

4796
02:08:06.191 --> 02:08:09.850
<v Speaker 3>or at least is it still looking in the Midwest and stuff or just small towns</v>

4797
02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:11.560
<v Speaker 3>where you just get up and go play with people?</v>

4798
02:08:11.590 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I mean,</v>

4799
02:08:13.241 --> 02:08:14.980
<v Speaker 3>what makes a place like Brazil?</v>

4800
02:08:14.981 --> 02:08:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Is it just the environment,</v>

4801
02:08:16.391 --> 02:08:16.931
<v Speaker 3>the environment,</v>

4802
02:08:16.931 --> 02:08:17.561
<v Speaker 3>so beautiful.</v>

4803
02:08:17.561 --> 02:08:19.930
<v Speaker 3>The weather's so beautiful there on the ocean.</v>

4804
02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Ocean peep dwelling.</v>

4805
02:08:21.641 --> 02:08:26.530
<v Speaker 3>People almost always have like a certain appreciation and respect for the ocean.</v>

4806
02:08:26.710 --> 02:08:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Almost like a pre,</v>

4807
02:08:27.891 --> 02:08:28.301
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>

4808
02:08:28.301 --> 02:08:29.950
<v Speaker 3>a little appreciation for nature.</v>

4809
02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:32.200
<v Speaker 3>That's why beach towns are always so calm.</v>

4810
02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:32.801
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4811
02:08:32.801 --> 02:08:34.120
<v Speaker 3>There's like almost like a chilled,</v>

4812
02:08:34.121 --> 02:08:34.901
<v Speaker 3>relaxed thing.</v>

4813
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:35.171
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4814
02:08:35.171 --> 02:08:35.710
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4815
02:08:35.710 --> 02:08:38.650
<v Speaker 3>you're just faced with something so impossible.</v>

4816
02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:42.280
<v Speaker 3>You're looking out at fucking a hundred trillion gallons of water or whatever</v>

4817
02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:44.620
<v Speaker 3>the fuck the ocean is where it's never ending.</v>

4818
02:08:44.621 --> 02:08:45.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't see the end of the water.</v>

4819
02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:50.670
<v Speaker 3>It goes bigger than the entire continent that you're living on and just it's,</v>

4820
02:08:50.710 --> 02:08:51.820
<v Speaker 3>it's so humbling.</v>

4821
02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:53.280
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those things that you look at it.</v>

4822
02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:53.800
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

4823
02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:55.900
<v Speaker 3>it makes you chill out a lot of a people,</v>

4824
02:08:55.901 --> 02:08:58.640
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have a higher power that would make you have a higher power.</v>

4825
02:08:58.641 --> 02:08:59.800
<v Speaker 3>But some people don't want to say God,</v>

4826
02:08:59.830 --> 02:09:00.481
<v Speaker 3>so they can tell you.</v>

4827
02:09:00.481 --> 02:09:01.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like the ocean,</v>

4828
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.841
<v Speaker 3>just me.</v>

4829
02:09:01.841 --> 02:09:02.800
<v Speaker 3>More powerful than you are.</v>

4830
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:03.161
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

4831
02:09:03.161 --> 02:09:03.870
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

4832
02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:04.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4833
02:09:04.091 --> 02:09:05.950
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like led Zeppelin song too.</v>

4834
02:09:06.250 --> 02:09:06.581
<v Speaker 3>Damp,</v>

4835
02:09:06.581 --> 02:09:07.300
<v Speaker 3>damp towel.</v>

4836
02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:08.133
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

4837
02:09:09.930 --> 02:09:11.950
<v Speaker 3>digital is still number one.</v>

4838
02:09:11.951 --> 02:09:16.670
<v Speaker 3>And then we want to get Doug Benson dethrone him for a little bit and then back</v>

4839
02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:17.520
<v Speaker 3>just back and forth.</v>

4840
02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:17.620

<v Speaker 3>It's so you can,</v>

4874
02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:01.421
<v Speaker 3>at any point,</v>

4875
02:10:01.421 --> 02:10:02.254

4876
02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:04.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do it anymore and it'll just be done.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4879
02:10:05.921 --> 02:10:07.420
<v Speaker 3>It would be a problem with getting fired.</v>

4880
02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:09.490
<v Speaker 3>I think at this point in time we have a commitment.</v>

4884
02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:13.990
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

4885
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:16.900
<v Speaker 3>There's too many people because I like nothing's really pushing you on.</v>

4886
02:10:16.930 --> 02:10:17.860
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing real there.</v>

4887
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4889
02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:20.530
<v Speaker 3>We owe people,</v>

4890

4895
02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Did I think it's in general?</v>

4896
02:10:30.071 --> 02:10:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Not just with this podcast,</v>

02:12:29.581 --> 02:12:30.230
<v Speaker 3>didn't do anything.</v>

4984
02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:31.063
<v Speaker 3>I stayed the same way.</v>

4985
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:32.083
<v Speaker 3>I kept training.</v>

4986
02:12:32.180 --> 02:12:33.650
<v Speaker 3>I made sure I kept working out.</v>

4987
02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:34.903
<v Speaker 3>I stayed in shape.</v>

4988
02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:35.841
<v Speaker 3>I stayed in,</v>

4989
02:12:35.841 --> 02:12:36.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4990
02:12:36.190 --> 02:12:39.460
<v Speaker 3>like kettle bell shape and weight lifting shape and workout shape.</v>

4991
02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:40.850
<v Speaker 3>But that's less than just the shape.</v>

4992
02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:42.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not good as Jujitsu's shape.</v>

4993
02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:43.460
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] harder.</v>

4994
02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4995
02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:47.870
<v Speaker 3>I found myself struggling for the first couple of classes,</v>

4996
02:12:47.871 --> 02:12:51.020
<v Speaker 3>but not nearly as much as I'd be if I didn't do anything.</v>

4997
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:51.831
<v Speaker 3>If I didn't do anything,</v>

4998
02:12:51.831 --> 02:12:52.700
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be able to do it.</v>

4999
02:12:52.890 --> 02:12:55.640
<v Speaker 3>We're literally wouldn't cause one of the things that I thought about while I</v>

5000
02:12:55.641 --> 02:12:57.950
<v Speaker 3>was working out why take took the time off.</v>

5001
02:12:58.140 --> 02:12:59.210
<v Speaker 3>That was when I was training.</v>

5002
02:12:59.240 --> 02:12:59.691
<v Speaker 3>I was working,</v>

5003
02:12:59.691 --> 02:13:01.510
<v Speaker 3>I was training to go back and roll.</v>

5004
02:13:01.590 --> 02:13:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Like I knew I did not want to get tired.</v>

5005
02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5006
02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I did not want to get tired.</v>

5007
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:06.380
<v Speaker 3>I was doing a lot of sprints.</v>

5008
02:13:06.710 --> 02:13:07.670
<v Speaker 3>It was doing a lot of,</v>

5009
02:13:07.671 --> 02:13:08.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5010
02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:09.440
<v Speaker 3>especially on the elliptical.</v>

5011
02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:09.831
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

5012
02:13:09.831 --> 02:13:12.650
<v Speaker 3>These things were just purely for cardio purposes.</v>

5013
02:13:12.651 --> 02:13:17.651
<v Speaker 3>I would do maybe 10 to 15 minutes as a warmup at a reasonable pace.</v>

5014
02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:21.410
<v Speaker 3>And then I would set it fairly stiff,</v>

5015
02:13:21.411 --> 02:13:23.540
<v Speaker 3>like level 13 or 14 maybe 15 minutes.</v>

5016
02:13:23.690 --> 02:13:26.930
<v Speaker 3>And then I would know I would blitzkrieg for 30 seconds,</v>

5017
02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:31.960
<v Speaker 3>just as hard as I can do it for 30 seconds and then kick it back and recover for</v>

5018
02:13:32.221 --> 02:13:33.720
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds and then do it again.</v>

5019
02:13:33.870 --> 02:13:35.280
<v Speaker 3>And I did it for 20 minutes.</v>

5020
02:13:35.281 --> 02:13:37.920
<v Speaker 3>So essentially 10 20 sprints,</v>

5021
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:40.970
<v Speaker 3>20 mad crazy sprints when I lost all that way.</v>

5022
02:13:40.971 --> 02:13:41.850
<v Speaker 3>That's what I used to do.</v>

5023
02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:43.051
<v Speaker 3>The elliptical.</v>

5024
02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:46.980
<v Speaker 3>I would go as hard as I could for a minute and then do three minutes of just,</v>

5025
02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:50.910
<v Speaker 3>just kind of sitting there with my heart rate really high up and then it's so</v>

5026
02:13:50.911 --> 02:13:51.511
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

5027
02:13:51.511 --> 02:13:51.811
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5028
02:13:51.811 --> 02:13:53.040
<v Speaker 3>It's such a great workout.</v>

5029
02:13:53.041 --> 02:13:55.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean like when someone tells you you can't get a good workout on an elliptical</v>

5030
02:13:55.831 --> 02:13:56.221
<v Speaker 3>machine,</v>

5031
02:13:56.221 --> 02:13:56.371
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5032
02:13:56.371 --> 02:13:56.611
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

5033
02:13:56.611 --> 02:13:57.421
<v Speaker 3>you're crazy.</v>

5034
02:13:57.421 --> 02:13:58.890
<v Speaker 3>I go when I'm in hotel rooms,</v>

5035
02:13:59.070 --> 02:14:00.690
<v Speaker 3>if I'm staying in a hotel and they say,</v>

5036
02:14:00.691 --> 02:14:00.931
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5037
02:14:00.931 --> 02:14:02.130
<v Speaker 3>all they have is an elliptical machine,</v>

5038
02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.360
<v Speaker 3>I can get a fucking ferocious cardio workout in on an elliptical machine.</v>

5039
02:14:06.370 --> 02:14:06.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5040
02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:08.040
<v Speaker 3>you just got to use it the right way.</v>

5041
02:14:08.490 --> 02:14:10.530
<v Speaker 3>And the beautiful thing is you don't get injured on those.</v>

5042
02:14:10.531 --> 02:14:10.801
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

5043
02:14:10.801 --> 02:14:12.560
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to hurt your knees or yeah,</v>

5044
02:14:13.050 --> 02:14:14.010
<v Speaker 3>no impact.</v>

5045
02:14:14.011 --> 02:14:15.520
<v Speaker 3>It's all circular motions.</v>

5046
02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:18.023
<v Speaker 3>You did too.</v>

5047
02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:19.020
<v Speaker 3>So did Eddie Bravo,</v>

5048
02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:23.190
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a meniscus thing have happened to you?</v>

5049
02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:26.160
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a cartilage cartilage.</v>

5050
02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:27.470
<v Speaker 3>My other name,</v>

5051
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:29.550
<v Speaker 3>the other name you play in basketball still?</v>

5052
02:14:30.330 --> 02:14:30.571
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5053
02:14:30.571 --> 02:14:30.751
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5054
02:14:30.751 --> 02:14:30.941
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5055
02:14:30.941 --> 02:14:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

5056
02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.390
<v Speaker 3>I can't do those bodywork.</v>

5057
02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Bodyweight squats that I,</v>

5058
02:14:35.130 --> 02:14:36.000
<v Speaker 3>I know I showed those.</v>

5059
02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Those are like literally miracle workers for strengthening and tightening your</v>

5060
02:14:41.281 --> 02:14:42.114
<v Speaker 3>knees.</v>

5061
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:47.270
<v Speaker 3>One of the best exercises I've ever had for a leg endurance and for a building</v>

5062
02:14:48.541 --> 02:14:51.180
<v Speaker 3>up the muscles in the years I just standing up,</v>

5063
02:14:51.181 --> 02:14:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I took my shoes off after basketball.</v>

5064
02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:54.720
<v Speaker 3>I stood up and I just felt the pop fluid.</v>

5065
02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5066
02:14:55.590 --> 02:14:56.423
<v Speaker 3>can they fix it?</v>

5067
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:58.890
<v Speaker 3>When they say he's got to say exactly what it is first,</v>

5068
02:14:58.950 --> 02:15:00.600
<v Speaker 3>that's like a doctor to the other one that really,</v>

5069
02:15:00.601 --> 02:15:01.434
<v Speaker 3>he's really,</v>

5070
02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:02.353
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5071
02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:02.731
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5072
02:15:02.731 --> 02:15:03.570
<v Speaker 3>that's the pot doctor.</v>

5073
02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:03.901
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5074
02:15:03.901 --> 02:15:04.710
<v Speaker 3>whoops.</v>

5075
02:15:04.710 --> 02:15:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5076
02:15:05.250 --> 02:15:06.083
<v Speaker 3>get a little bit.</v>

5077
02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I know my doctors or my doctor.</v>

5078
02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:12.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5079
02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:13.530
<v Speaker 3>he's a real doctor.</v>

5080
02:15:14.150 --> 02:15:15.810
<v Speaker 3>He worked on my knee two times.</v>

5081
02:15:15.811 --> 02:15:19.020
<v Speaker 3>He fixed my right knee and he fixed the meniscus in my left knee.</v>

5082
02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:22.980
<v Speaker 3>He fixed my left knee when everybody else had fucked it up or the other guy had</v>

5083
02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:23.520
<v Speaker 3>fucked it up.</v>

5084
02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:24.240
<v Speaker 3>The other guy,</v>

5085
02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:28.410
<v Speaker 3>he did want to scope it and he tried to stitch it up and it just never really</v>

5086
02:15:28.411 --> 02:15:28.771
<v Speaker 3>healed.</v>

5087
02:15:28.771 --> 02:15:30.580
<v Speaker 3>It was always amazing how when you think about it,</v>

5088
02:15:30.581 --> 02:15:30.931
<v Speaker 3>you'd think like,</v>

5089
02:15:30.931 --> 02:15:31.770
<v Speaker 3>doctors know what they're doing,</v>

5090
02:15:31.771 --> 02:15:33.390
<v Speaker 3>but like some doctors are bad.</v>

5091
02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:35.220
<v Speaker 3>You need doctors that work with athletes.</v>

5092
02:15:35.250 --> 02:15:38.310
<v Speaker 3>That's what you need because one of the things that happened after I got an MRI</v>

5093
02:15:38.311 --> 02:15:39.360
<v Speaker 3>when I tore my meniscus,</v>

5094
02:15:39.361 --> 02:15:40.980
<v Speaker 3>which is a really simple thing,</v>

5095
02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:44.270
<v Speaker 3>the meniscus is not that big of a deal out of the scope,</v>

5096
02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:44.910
<v Speaker 3>the rest over.</v>

5097
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:48.360
<v Speaker 3>But the doctor is sitting there telling me I need to stop doing martial arts.</v>

5098
02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:48.691
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

5099
02:15:48.691 --> 02:15:49.171
<v Speaker 3>this is the only,</v>

5100
02:15:49.171 --> 02:15:50.550
<v Speaker 3>I was only 30 at the time,</v>

5101
02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:51.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5102
02:15:51.210 --> 02:15:53.370
<v Speaker 3>and the doctor's telling me you need to stop doing martial arts and I'm</v>

5103
02:15:53.371 --> 02:15:55.890
<v Speaker 3>listening to her and I'm going,</v>

5104
02:15:56.070 --> 02:15:56.581
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

5105
02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:57.031
<v Speaker 3>why am I,</v>

5106
02:15:57.031 --> 02:15:58.890
<v Speaker 3>why are you telling me I'm not asking you for this,</v>

5107
02:15:58.920 --> 02:15:59.221
<v Speaker 3>let me go,</v>

5108
02:15:59.221 --> 02:16:01.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't see where this is like that big of an issue.</v>

5109
02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:02.461
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

5110
02:16:02.461 --> 02:16:05.610
<v Speaker 3>you're going to continue to injure this knee or you're telling me that it's</v>

5111
02:16:05.611 --> 02:16:09.540
<v Speaker 3>impossible to rehabilitate a meniscus tear and get my body to a condition where</v>

5112
02:16:09.541 --> 02:16:10.374
<v Speaker 3>I can train again.</v>

5113
02:16:10.710 --> 02:16:11.670
<v Speaker 3>I call shenanigans.</v>

5114
02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:12.793
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5115
02:16:12.930 --> 02:16:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Just because you,</v>

5116
02:16:13.821 --> 02:16:14.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5117
02:16:14.041 --> 02:16:15.540
<v Speaker 3>you say you'd rather not have that,</v>

5118
02:16:15.541 --> 02:16:16.680
<v Speaker 3>but like what bitch,</v>

5119
02:16:16.681 --> 02:16:17.550
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

5120
02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I've been stitched up together like 15 fucking times.</v>

5121
02:16:20.101 --> 02:16:20.890
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm doing.</v>

5122
02:16:20.890 --> 02:16:22.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get stolen to deal with.</v>

5123
02:16:22.050 --> 02:16:22.883
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

5124
02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:24.780
<v Speaker 3>oh no it was with some of weird,</v>

5125
02:16:24.781 --> 02:16:25.890
<v Speaker 3>she was being my mom.</v>

5126
02:16:25.891 --> 02:16:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you think,</v>

5127
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:28.860
<v Speaker 3>do you think it's going to catch up like say 30 years from now?</v>

5128
02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:29.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5129
02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:29.861
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5130
02:16:29.861 --> 02:16:30.340
<v Speaker 3>I have no,</v>

5131
02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:31.490
<v Speaker 3>no pain man suit.</v>

5132
02:16:31.491 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 3>First of all I make sure I stretch out like crazy.</v>

5133
02:16:34.630 --> 02:16:34.931
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5134
02:16:34.931 --> 02:16:35.501
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>

5135
02:16:35.501 --> 02:16:37.060
<v Speaker 3>I eat a lot of fish oil.</v>

5136
02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I take like 10,000 milligrams official a day.</v>

5137
02:16:39.551 --> 02:16:44.150
<v Speaker 3>I think that alone promotes like healthy strong joints and second of all I</v>

5138
02:16:44.530 --> 02:16:47.380
<v Speaker 3>stretching and doing all these body weight exercises.</v>

5139
02:16:47.590 --> 02:16:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Really important for strengthening up the joints and tightening those bodyweight</v>

5140
02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:53.141
<v Speaker 3>squats.</v>

5141
02:16:53.141 --> 02:16:56.890
<v Speaker 3>You go all the way down your ass touches your heel and your heel comes off the</v>

5142
02:16:56.891 --> 02:17:00.670
<v Speaker 3>ground and you push up from there and when you do like hundreds of those right</v>

5143
02:17:00.671 --> 02:17:02.710
<v Speaker 3>at the knee is where you build all your muscle.</v>

5144
02:17:02.711 --> 02:17:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Like all up in here,</v>

5145
02:17:03.791 --> 02:17:07.330
<v Speaker 3>like the flip cap of the quads and all around your knee.</v>

5146
02:17:07.330 --> 02:17:10.660
<v Speaker 3>All that builds up cause it's like a really high volume.</v>

5147
02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:11.111
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5148
02:17:11.111 --> 02:17:15.340
<v Speaker 3>you're doing like 200 of them and it really tightens and strengthens everything.</v>

5149
02:17:15.341 --> 02:17:16.450
<v Speaker 3>It gives you more endurance in it.</v>

5150
02:17:16.451 --> 02:17:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Also because of the fact that your legs have done so much more work and they're</v>

5151
02:17:19.961 --> 02:17:20.740
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

5152
02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:23.140
<v Speaker 3>you're less likely to have them buckle on you.</v>

5153
02:17:23.141 --> 02:17:26.810
<v Speaker 3>They're less likely to give out all car literally though muscle control.</v>

5154
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

5155
02:17:27.450 --> 02:17:30.640
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of the reasons why people get injured is because they don't have</v>

5156
02:17:30.641 --> 02:17:34.240
<v Speaker 3>enough physical strength to stop the injury from taking place.</v>

5157
02:17:34.241 --> 02:17:34.691
<v Speaker 3>Their body,</v>

5158
02:17:34.691 --> 02:17:34.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5159
02:17:34.930 --> 02:17:35.380
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

5160
02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:38.380
<v Speaker 3>they're the coordination or they're exhausted or old people fall and break their</v>

5161
02:17:38.381 --> 02:17:39.160
<v Speaker 3>muscles cause there's nothing.</v>

5162
02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:39.993
<v Speaker 3>No fucking</v>

5163
02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:41.591
<v Speaker 3>broke.</v>

5164
02:17:41.591 --> 02:17:42.640
<v Speaker 3>The bones cause no muscles.</v>

5165
02:17:42.641 --> 02:17:43.930
<v Speaker 3>The guard gives that too.</v>

5166
02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Well also their bones get really fragile.</v>

5167
02:17:45.731 --> 02:17:47.620
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that osteoporosis,</v>

5168
02:17:47.621 --> 02:17:48.160
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5169
02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:48.551
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>

5170
02:17:48.551 --> 02:17:50.600
<v Speaker 3>if you're not lifting weights are taking care of,</v>

5171
02:17:50.601 --> 02:17:50.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5172
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:51.021
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

5173
02:17:51.021 --> 02:17:52.480
<v Speaker 3>your body in that way where you're adding,</v>

5174
02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:52.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5175
02:17:52.751 --> 02:17:53.830
<v Speaker 3>it's really important,</v>

5176
02:17:53.890 --> 02:17:56.680
<v Speaker 3>especially as you get older to actually physically lift weights.</v>

5177
02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:58.510
<v Speaker 3>If you want to keep your bone density bone,</v>

5178
02:17:58.960 --> 02:17:59.890
<v Speaker 3>your bone density.</v>

5179
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5180
02:18:00.370 --> 02:18:01.340
<v Speaker 3>it's very important there.</v>

5181
02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.080
<v Speaker 3>There's old dudes like you can go to the gym and there was a guy named Albert</v>

5182
02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Beckels and I believe he was in his late fifties or sixties Bryant,</v>

5183
02:18:09.490 --> 02:18:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Google that guy for me,</v>

5184
02:18:10.751 --> 02:18:11.021
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>

5185
02:18:11.021 --> 02:18:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Albert Beckels and Albert Beckels bodybuilder.</v>

5186
02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:18.760
<v Speaker 3>And he was really old man.</v>

5187
02:18:18.761 --> 02:18:19.990
<v Speaker 3>And I went to the gym.</v>

5188
02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:23.620
<v Speaker 3>There was a gold's gym in north Hollywood when I lived in north Hollywood.</v>

5189
02:18:23.621 --> 02:18:25.210
<v Speaker 3>And I used to see him training.</v>

5190
02:18:25.211 --> 02:18:25.660
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

5191
02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Charles Atlas,</v>

5192
02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:26.820
<v Speaker 3>just be a man.</v>

5193
02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:28.480
<v Speaker 3>He was all as fuck dude.</v>

5194
02:18:28.481 --> 02:18:29.500
<v Speaker 3>And he was so,</v>

02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:29.981
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like a motherfucker.</v>

5197
02:18:31.570 --> 02:18:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Look out the photos of that guy.</v>

5198
02:18:32.890 --> 02:18:33.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5199
02:18:33.041 --> 02:18:34.420
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of really nice asshole.</v>

5200
02:18:35.290 --> 02:18:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5201
02:18:36.010 --> 02:18:36.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5202
02:18:36.370 --> 02:18:37.300
<v Speaker 3>what was the other guy's name?</v>

5203
02:18:37.301 --> 02:18:37.430
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

5204
02:18:37.430 --> 02:18:38.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5205
02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:39.490
<v Speaker 3>look at this photo of this guy.</v>

5206
02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:41.020
<v Speaker 3>See if you can get a nice big one.</v>

5207
02:18:41.350 --> 02:18:42.100
<v Speaker 3>That's him.</v>

5208
02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:42.933
<v Speaker 3>He's black.</v>

5209
02:18:43.350 --> 02:18:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

5210
02:18:43.550 --> 02:18:43.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5211
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:44.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah dude.</v>

5212
02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:46.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean right there.</v>

5213
02:18:46.661 --> 02:18:48.700
<v Speaker 3>And he's probably like fucking 60 years old or something.</v>

5214
02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:50.590
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not kidding.</v>

5215
02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:53.770
<v Speaker 3>The guy was fucking enormous.</v>

5216
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Just don't that a picture of his bicep.</v>

5217
02:18:57.010 --> 02:18:57.843
<v Speaker 3>That's his bicep.</v>

5218
02:18:58.440 --> 02:18:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Just pick,</v>

5219
02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:00.310
<v Speaker 3>just click on one picture.</v>

5220
02:19:00.311 --> 02:19:01.390
<v Speaker 3>So Ra can get us,</v>

5221
02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:02.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a good picture of him.</v>

5222
02:19:02.351 --> 02:19:04.750
<v Speaker 3>He's bald and old shit,</v>

5223
02:19:04.751 --> 02:19:05.584
<v Speaker 3>and just</v>

5224
02:19:06.890 --> 02:19:09.610
<v Speaker 3>look at the body on that guy's ridiculous.</v>

5225
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Fuck there's this would be,</v>

5226
02:19:11.321 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way you can do that.</v>

5227
02:19:12.940 --> 02:19:13.773
<v Speaker 3>We'll start Roy.</v>

5228
02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:15.810
<v Speaker 3>But the other way is you,</v>

5229
02:19:15.811 --> 02:19:20.260
<v Speaker 3>you have to lift weights in order to keep that density up at that age.</v>

5230
02:19:20.290 --> 02:19:21.250
<v Speaker 3>That keeps your bones,</v>

5231
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.780
<v Speaker 3>your muscles,</v>

5232
02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:23.613
<v Speaker 3>your bones,</v>

5233
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.820
<v Speaker 3>weightlifting,</v>

5234
02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:29.570
<v Speaker 3>especially like real heavy weight exercises like dead lifts and squats.</v>

5235
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:32.090
<v Speaker 3>They contribute to thicker bone density.</v>

5236
02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5237
02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:32.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5238
02:19:32.931 --> 02:19:34.370
<v Speaker 3>It's really important as you get older,</v>

5239
02:19:34.371 --> 02:19:37.550
<v Speaker 3>especially because that's when your bones start to get brittle and fragile.</v>

5240
02:19:37.550 --> 02:19:39.260
<v Speaker 3>So guys like Albert Beckels.</v>

5241
02:19:39.261 --> 02:19:40.100
<v Speaker 3>I bet that guy's like,</v>

5242
02:19:40.101 --> 02:19:41.490
<v Speaker 3>look at that guy's body and that's an,</v>

5243
02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:42.590
<v Speaker 3>he's in his fifties there,</v>

5244
02:19:42.591 --> 02:19:43.280
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

5245
02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:43.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5246
02:19:43.731 --> 02:19:45.110
<v Speaker 3>he was just the animal.</v>

5247
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.501
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

5248
02:19:45.501 --> 02:19:46.910
<v Speaker 3>there's certainly dudes like that.</v>

5249
02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:47.773
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5250
02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:48.613
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

5251
02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:49.503
<v Speaker 3>orange but,</v>

5252
02:19:49.570 --> 02:19:54.550
<v Speaker 3>but also intense workouts and intense training and focus you,</v>

5253
02:19:54.551 --> 02:19:57.710
<v Speaker 3>you can't just give it all the steroids there because the guy still had to do</v>

5254
02:19:57.711 --> 02:19:58.131
<v Speaker 3>the work.</v>

5255
02:19:58.131 --> 02:19:59.090
<v Speaker 3>The steroids if he took,</v>

5256
02:19:59.091 --> 02:19:59.301
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5257
02:19:59.301 --> 02:20:00.830
<v Speaker 3>if he just took steroids only,</v>

5258
02:20:00.831 --> 02:20:01.970
<v Speaker 3>he would still never get that big.</v>

5259
02:20:01.971 --> 02:20:02.804
<v Speaker 3>Those guys have,</v>

5260
02:20:03.650 --> 02:20:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I'll never be that lean,</v>

5261
02:20:05.091 --> 02:20:05.351
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5262
02:20:05.351 --> 02:20:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to be incredibly dedicated to get down to that level.</v>

5263
02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:10.370
<v Speaker 3>And he's like championship bodybuilder level.</v>

5264
02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:14.060
<v Speaker 3>But the difference between a guy like them or a guy like say Steve Maxwell,</v>

5265
02:20:14.061 --> 02:20:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Steve Maxwell is a guy who was 100% natural and he's a fitness fanatic and he</v>

5266
02:20:18.981 --> 02:20:19.161
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

5267
02:20:19.161 --> 02:20:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I believe he's about 60.</v>

5268
02:20:20.610 --> 02:20:21.450
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Steve.</v>

5269
02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:22.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5270
02:20:22.370 --> 02:20:22.771
<v Speaker 3>no that's,</v>

5271
02:20:22.771 --> 02:20:23.750
<v Speaker 3>that's Steve Graham.</v>

5272
02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Steve Maxwell is the guy who teaches me kettle bells and comes over like a</v>

5273
02:20:27.411 --> 02:20:28.970
<v Speaker 3>couple of times a year and we,</v>

5274
02:20:28.971 --> 02:20:29.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5275
02:20:29.530 --> 02:20:31.040
<v Speaker 3>he will go out size,</v>

5276
02:20:31.041 --> 02:20:31.670
<v Speaker 3>body issues.</v>

5277
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:34.670
<v Speaker 3>He comes and trains me for like three days and shows me all sorts of new shit</v>

5278
02:20:34.671 --> 02:20:35.720
<v Speaker 3>and I film it on my uh,</v>

5279
02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:36.613
<v Speaker 3>my iPhone.</v>

5280
02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:38.000
<v Speaker 3>He's a master dude.</v>

5281
02:20:38.001 --> 02:20:39.380
<v Speaker 3>He's Steve Maxwell.</v>

5282
02:20:39.381 --> 02:20:40.340
<v Speaker 3>You can follow him on Twitter.</v>

5283
02:20:40.341 --> 02:20:40.821
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5284
02:20:40.821 --> 02:20:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I think its maximal strength and conditioning.</v>

5285
02:20:42.951 --> 02:20:43.401
<v Speaker 3>Maxwell,</v>

5286
02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:44.234
<v Speaker 3>SNC,</v>

5287
02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:45.561
<v Speaker 3>Matt Maxwell,</v>

5288
02:20:45.561 --> 02:20:46.394
<v Speaker 3>SC maybe.</v>

5289
02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5290
02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:47.890
<v Speaker 3>but he's a,</v>

5291
02:20:47.891 --> 02:20:52.891
<v Speaker 3>a real master when it comes to training and different things that you can do to,</v>

5292
02:20:53.481 --> 02:20:53.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5293
02:20:53.870 --> 02:20:55.790
<v Speaker 3>to keep your body healthy as you get young.</v>

5294
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Like he has a whole series,</v>

5295
02:20:57.381 --> 02:21:02.300
<v Speaker 3>a DVD series all on joint mobility and how important it is to stretch as you get</v>

5296
02:21:02.301 --> 02:21:02.870
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>

5297
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:03.890
<v Speaker 3>Your range of motion,</v>

5298
02:21:03.891 --> 02:21:04.790
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're not,</v>

5299
02:21:04.791 --> 02:21:06.260
<v Speaker 3>like if you're just sitting in an office,</v>

5300
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:09.350
<v Speaker 3>your range of motion is going to get more and more limited because you're not</v>

5301
02:21:09.351 --> 02:21:10.010
<v Speaker 3>doing shit.</v>

5302
02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Your body's not going anywhere.</v>

5303
02:21:11.421 --> 02:21:12.254
<v Speaker 3>You're just sitting there.</v>

5304
02:21:12.370 --> 02:21:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I was able to use those,</v>

5305
02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:15.290
<v Speaker 3>those yoga guys that can stretch like crazy.</v>

5306
02:21:15.291 --> 02:21:16.790
<v Speaker 3>They always like shocked me.</v>

5307
02:21:16.850 --> 02:21:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5308
02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:17.760
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

5309
02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:18.593
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

5310
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:20.240
<v Speaker 3>it's because they keep doing it.</v>

5311
02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:21.081
<v Speaker 3>It's because,</v>

5312
02:21:21.081 --> 02:21:21.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5313
02:21:21.381 --> 02:21:25.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean most of the reasons why I'm still flexible at this age is because when I</v>

5314
02:21:25.881 --> 02:21:27.860
<v Speaker 3>was 15 to the time I was 44,</v>

5315
02:21:27.861 --> 02:21:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I never stopped stretching.</v>

5316
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:30.140
<v Speaker 3>You just keep doing it.</v>

5317
02:21:30.141 --> 02:21:31.250
<v Speaker 3>If you keep doing it,</v>

5318
02:21:31.251 --> 02:21:32.084
<v Speaker 3>you can keep it up.</v>

5319
02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:32.840
<v Speaker 3>But if,</v>

5320
02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:34.700
<v Speaker 3>if you take off just like a few months,</v>

5321
02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:37.580
<v Speaker 3>you'd take off just a few months of training and don't work out and don't do</v>

5322
02:21:37.581 --> 02:21:38.271
<v Speaker 3>shit for a few months,</v>

5323
02:21:38.271 --> 02:21:41.030
<v Speaker 3>your body will turn to a sack of shit like that.</v>

5324
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:42.461
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel that when you've,</v>

5325
02:21:42.461 --> 02:21:42.840
<v Speaker 3>when he stopped,</v>

5326
02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:44.180
<v Speaker 3>but he just kept trying and kept working out.</v>

5327
02:21:44.181 --> 02:21:44.421
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

5328
02:21:44.421 --> 02:21:45.254
<v Speaker 3>I've never stopped.</v>

5329
02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:47.130
<v Speaker 3>Even when I get injured I'll,</v>

5330
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:48.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll stop doing certain things.</v>

5331
02:21:48.860 --> 02:21:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Like I've been places where they say you can't do any working out.</v>

5332
02:21:51.711 --> 02:21:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Like after I got my nose fixed,</v>

5333
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:54.890
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do anything for a full month.</v>

5334
02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:55.690
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

5335
02:21:55.690 --> 02:21:55.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5336
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:56.460
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to,</v>

5337
02:21:56.460 --> 02:21:59.380
<v Speaker 3>you're elevating your temperature or your,</v>

5338
02:21:59.390 --> 02:21:59.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5339
02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:00.530
<v Speaker 3>blood pressure rather.</v>

5340
02:22:00.531 --> 02:22:01.460
<v Speaker 3>And possibly,</v>

5341
02:22:01.461 --> 02:22:01.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5342
02:22:01.851 --> 02:22:02.684
<v Speaker 3>opening up,</v>

5343
02:22:02.690 --> 02:22:03.830
<v Speaker 3>some of the sutures are in,</v>

5344
02:22:03.890 --> 02:22:05.570
<v Speaker 3>so no exercise at all for four weeks.</v>

5345
02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:07.100
<v Speaker 3>So for four weeks I was like,</v>

5346
02:22:07.101 --> 02:22:07.690
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

5347
02:22:07.690 --> 02:22:09.140
<v Speaker 3>there's just eat pizza and commit to it.</v>

5348
02:22:09.141 --> 02:22:09.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5349
02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:09.881
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

5350
02:22:09.881 --> 02:22:10.910
<v Speaker 3>I just try to eat healthy,</v>

5351
02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:12.410
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't do shit.</v>

5352
02:22:12.430 --> 02:22:12.590
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

5353
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:13.760
<v Speaker 3>and in hopes that a,</v>

5354
02:22:13.761 --> 02:22:14.051
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

5355
02:22:14.051 --> 02:22:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want this operation to be fucked up cause I was without a nose to</v>

5356
02:22:17.361 --> 02:22:18.710
<v Speaker 3>breathe out of for most of my life.</v>

5357
02:22:18.711 --> 02:22:19.790
<v Speaker 3>And I knew how terrible it was.</v>

5358
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:21.470
<v Speaker 3>But then once I did it,</v>

5359
02:22:21.471 --> 02:22:21.801
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5360
02:22:21.801 --> 02:22:23.660
<v Speaker 3>that was a race to get back in shape.</v>

5361
02:22:23.810 --> 02:22:24.643
<v Speaker 3>Terrified.</v>

5362
02:22:24.700 --> 02:22:25.531
<v Speaker 3>Because as you get older,</v>

5363
02:22:25.531 --> 02:22:25.920
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

5364
02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:26.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5365
02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:26.390
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5366
02:22:26.390 --> 02:22:28.030
<v Speaker 5>the morning show is lethal.</v>

5367
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.903
<v Speaker 5>You just stay there.</v>

5368
02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:29.401
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:30.780

5370
02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:32.850

02:23:13.290 --> 02:23:13.591
<v Speaker 5>Austin,</v>

5410
02:23:13.591 --> 02:23:15.540
<v Speaker 5>Texas might not be a bad idea somewhere where it's warm.</v>

5411
02:23:15.541 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 5>That's all that's in Texas is in the middle too,</v>

5412
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:21.380
<v Speaker 5>so a lot of people can fucking drive there or fly there are a lot easier and</v>

5413
02:23:21.410 --> 02:23:21.580
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

5414
02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:22.500
<v Speaker 5>well if we were going to have it,</v>

5415
02:23:22.501 --> 02:23:25.890
<v Speaker 5>we would want to have it at a place where there would be enough hotel rooms.</v>

5416
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:27.270
<v Speaker 5>It was how many people are going to come?</v>

5417
02:23:27.271 --> 02:23:27.570
<v Speaker 5>You see?</v>

5418
02:23:27.570 --> 02:23:30.150
<v Speaker 5>Let's say if we have like putting New York do a comedy show,</v>

5419
02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:31.193
<v Speaker 5>they're</v>

5420
02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:34.080
<v Speaker 5>so expensive.</v>

5421
02:23:34.470 --> 02:23:35.880
<v Speaker 5>Looked at southwest by southwest,</v>

5422
02:23:35.881 --> 02:23:36.960
<v Speaker 5>we do it in the same area.</v>

5423
02:23:36.961 --> 02:23:39.840
<v Speaker 5>All those hotels had Austin right that south by southwest.</v>

5424
02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:40.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5425
02:23:40.261 --> 02:23:43.110
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we could do it six months after when south by southwest was there.</v>

5426
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:44.340
<v Speaker 5>So we don't compete with them at all.</v>

5427
02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.070
<v Speaker 5>And I'm Boston desk squad festival.</v>

5428
02:23:47.250 --> 02:23:49.500
<v Speaker 5>When is south by southwest or a month ago.</v>

5429
02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:50.510
<v Speaker 5>A month ago.</v>

5430
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:51.420
<v Speaker 5>So it's a what?</v>

5431
02:23:51.421 --> 02:23:52.080
<v Speaker 5>April.</v>

5432
02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:55.500
<v Speaker 5>What do you worry about competing with south by Southwest Damien?</v>

5433
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:56.131
<v Speaker 5>The first of all,</v>

5434
02:23:56.131 --> 02:23:57.990
<v Speaker 5>you can't do it anywhere near them because first of all,</v>

5435
02:23:58.140 --> 02:23:59.370
<v Speaker 5>they're way more established.</v>

5436
02:23:59.371 --> 02:24:01.020
<v Speaker 5>They're going to eat up all the hotel rooms.</v>

5437
02:24:01.430 --> 02:24:02.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you really wanted to do,</v>

5438
02:24:03.210 --> 02:24:05.160
<v Speaker 5>but then you would have to like organize it man,</v>

5439
02:24:05.161 --> 02:24:06.570
<v Speaker 5>and then you'd have to pay the bands.</v>

5440
02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have bands performing that,</v>

5441
02:24:10.730 --> 02:24:10.920
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5442
02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:11.940
<v Speaker 5>you get to hire a tour manager.</v>

5443
02:24:11.941 --> 02:24:13.140
<v Speaker 5>We'd have to figure out who would be,</v>

5444
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:13.291
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5445
02:24:13.291 --> 02:24:15.030
<v Speaker 5>if we're going to have a desk squad comedy festival,</v>

5446
02:24:15.031 --> 02:24:17.660
<v Speaker 5>we'd have to be really picky about who we let go on stage too.</v>

5447
02:24:17.930 --> 02:24:19.000
<v Speaker 5>You know they're going to die.</v>

5448
02:24:20.100 --> 02:24:21.270
<v Speaker 5>They're going to represent us.</v>

5449
02:24:21.470 --> 02:24:22.171
<v Speaker 5>If it's three days,</v>

5450
02:24:22.171 --> 02:24:23.850
<v Speaker 5>we just use all the same guys who always use,</v>

5451
02:24:23.851 --> 02:24:24.360
<v Speaker 5>but there's like,</v>

5452
02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 5>we have like 30 people that we use all the time and you just in different</v>

5453
02:24:27.691 --> 02:24:28.680
<v Speaker 5>rotations and stuff,</v>

5454
02:24:28.681 --> 02:24:31.440
<v Speaker 5>we made it a big festival and people got to plan for it.</v>

5455
02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:32.580
<v Speaker 5>They would want to do this,</v>

5456
02:24:32.581 --> 02:24:32.731
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5457
02:24:32.731 --> 02:24:34.050
<v Speaker 5>it'd be about 30 people.</v>

5458
02:24:34.051 --> 02:24:36.270
<v Speaker 5>We don't have 30 people that are good enough to represent us.</v>

5459
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:37.470
<v Speaker 5>You start grabbing neck,</v>

5460
02:24:37.470 --> 02:24:37.861
<v Speaker 5>telling him like,</v>

5461
02:24:37.861 --> 02:24:38.251
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5462
02:24:38.251 --> 02:24:41.490
<v Speaker 5>like could they be Stephen is easy's and all the Freddy Lockharts and he'd be</v>

5463
02:24:41.491 --> 02:24:41.611
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

5464
02:24:41.611 --> 02:24:41.731
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

5465
02:24:41.731 --> 02:24:43.350
<v Speaker 5>do you want to calm 30 though?</v>

5466
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:45.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's 30 I'm sorry.</v>

5467
02:24:46.050 --> 02:24:47.040
<v Speaker 5>What do you think per,</v>

5468
02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:47.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5469
02:24:47.430 --> 02:24:48.180
<v Speaker 5>who are you talking about?</v>

5470
02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:49.650
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about little Esther,</v>

5471
02:24:49.651 --> 02:24:51.150
<v Speaker 5>you know we're talking about like the all,</v>

5472
02:24:51.210 --> 02:24:55.560
<v Speaker 5>all the guys and then you might even find that if it's a big enough thing that</v>

5473
02:24:55.561 --> 02:24:58.260
<v Speaker 5>like there's just people that want to hang out for a weekend,</v>

5474
02:24:58.261 --> 02:24:59.250
<v Speaker 5>like a party style.</v>

5475
02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:01.620
<v Speaker 5>And so you might get like maybe like Greg Fitzsimmons would be like,</v>

5476
02:25:01.630 --> 02:25:01.831
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5477
02:25:01.831 --> 02:25:02.641
<v Speaker 5>I want to come to this,</v>

5478
02:25:02.641 --> 02:25:02.851
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5479
02:25:02.851 --> 02:25:03.480
<v Speaker 5>and shit like that.</v>

5480
02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:04.470
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he would,</v>

5481
02:25:04.471 --> 02:25:06.030
<v Speaker 5>he would want to get paid and as he should.</v>

5482
02:25:06.060 --> 02:25:06.571
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

5483
02:25:06.571 --> 02:25:07.280
<v Speaker 5>We'll make it fun.</v>

5484
02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:08.400
<v Speaker 5>Make it like a festival.</v>

5485
02:25:08.401 --> 02:25:08.771
<v Speaker 5>But then what?</v>

5486
02:25:08.771 --> 02:25:11.550
<v Speaker 5>You had different shots so they could see different people twice.</v>

5487
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:12.151
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5488
02:25:12.151 --> 02:25:13.140
<v Speaker 5>I guess they would have to,</v>

5489
02:25:13.141 --> 02:25:14.780
<v Speaker 5>if they went to different shows it would.</v>

5490
02:25:14.781 --> 02:25:17.420
<v Speaker 5>It would have to be some people on certain shows and the god,</v>

5491
02:25:17.430 --> 02:25:18.360
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like a lot of work,</v>

5492
02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:19.560
<v Speaker 5>but it'd be kind of fun.</v>

5493
02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:20.970
<v Speaker 5>Maybe something we could think of,</v>

5494
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:21.210
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

5495
02:25:21.210 --> 02:25:21.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5496
02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:21.841
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5497
02:25:21.841 --> 02:25:24.020
<v Speaker 5>if the fucking insane clown posse can pull up my</v>

5498
02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:24.853
<v Speaker 3>daughter off,</v>

5499
02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:25.600
<v Speaker 3>we could pull it up.</v>

5500
02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Death squads shows at a comedy festival,</v>

5501
02:25:27.431 --> 02:25:27.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5502
02:25:27.581 --> 02:25:27.971
<v Speaker 3>the really,</v>

5503
02:25:27.971 --> 02:25:31.990
<v Speaker 3>the best way to do it really would be to make it super simple and started off</v>

5504
02:25:31.991 --> 02:25:33.820
<v Speaker 3>simple and as easy as possible.</v>

5505
02:25:33.850 --> 02:25:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Try it out one year and then let it build,</v>

5506
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:37.181
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5507
02:25:37.181 --> 02:25:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Then the next year moving to Vegas,</v>

5508
02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:40.390
<v Speaker 3>we try and and Pasadena one year,</v>

5509
02:25:40.510 --> 02:25:42.100
<v Speaker 3>maybe we try it this year in passing away.</v>

5510
02:25:42.101 --> 02:25:44.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do here when another car,</v>

5511
02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:46.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to pay for hotels for almost any comic.</v>

5512
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:48.040
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

5513
02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:50.050
<v Speaker 3>How about we do it ice house,</v>

5514
02:25:50.051 --> 02:25:54.600
<v Speaker 3>continual ice house shows and we'll have like bands go up and perform at the ice</v>

5515
02:25:54.601 --> 02:25:55.090
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

5516
02:25:55.090 --> 02:25:58.180
<v Speaker 3>We'll have two shows going on at the same time with the ice house and just take</v>

5517
02:25:58.181 --> 02:26:02.110
<v Speaker 3>over the club for like a whole week and have all of our friends come in and</v>

5518
02:26:02.111 --> 02:26:02.260
<v Speaker 3>vote.</v>

5519
02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:03.030
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard.</v>

5520
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:04.220
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] the fuck out of it.</v>

5521
02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Have all of our friends come in that we,</v>

5522
02:26:05.861 --> 02:26:06.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5523
02:26:06.131 --> 02:26:09.430
<v Speaker 3>all of our friends like from out of town that we know that our great comics that</v>

5524
02:26:09.431 --> 02:26:10.760
<v Speaker 3>maybe live in be here.</v>

5525
02:26:11.470 --> 02:26:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5526
02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:12.511
<v Speaker 3>Planning to be here.</v>

5527
02:26:12.511 --> 02:26:15.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm bringing Stan hope and pay for him and you know,</v>

5528
02:26:15.341 --> 02:26:15.501
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

5529
02:26:15.501 --> 02:26:19.410
<v Speaker 3>and it put them up in a hotel and give them the door 100% of the door and just</v>

5530
02:26:19.411 --> 02:26:20.850
<v Speaker 3>and pumped the show up and,</v>

5531
02:26:20.851 --> 02:26:21.461
<v Speaker 3>and set it up.</v>

5532
02:26:21.461 --> 02:26:25.180
<v Speaker 3>So it's both profitable for guys to be and it looks like it's fun.</v>

5533
02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:27.430
<v Speaker 3>And the whole time we'd broadcast,</v>

5534
02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:27.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5535
02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:31.420
<v Speaker 3>whatever the type of door we want to have two things set at one we're going to,</v>

5536
02:26:31.450 --> 02:26:32.920
<v Speaker 3>we want to have set up something.</v>

5537
02:26:32.921 --> 02:26:34.240
<v Speaker 3>So in the podcast room,</v>

5538
02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:35.560
<v Speaker 3>at the Ice House,</v>

5539
02:26:35.561 --> 02:26:36.610
<v Speaker 3>we can see the stage.</v>

5540
02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:37.720
<v Speaker 3>That's step one.</v>

5541
02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:40.620
<v Speaker 3>Step two is we're going to broadcast to podcast.</v>

5542
02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:41.980
<v Speaker 3>All the people waiting in line.</v>

5543
02:26:42.130 --> 02:26:45.550
<v Speaker 3>So while the people were waiting in line as they're going and we'll be doing the</v>

5544
02:26:45.551 --> 02:26:48.490
<v Speaker 3>podcast with speakers outside of that little courtyard area.</v>

5545
02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:51.790
<v Speaker 3>So that will be going on and then we'll have shows,</v>

5546
02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:53.680
<v Speaker 3>we'll have bands that can go up.</v>

5547
02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:54.580
<v Speaker 3>I love it that they made,</v>

5548
02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:58.420
<v Speaker 3>they made the bar room of Lovitz it should pull down a screen and they show</v>

5549
02:26:58.450 --> 02:27:00.340
<v Speaker 3>what's going on on that big screen on stage.</v>

5550
02:27:00.610 --> 02:27:01.421
<v Speaker 3>That's not a bad show.</v>

5551
02:27:01.421 --> 02:27:03.920
<v Speaker 3>The podcast or you can drink and just the bar area where we,</v>

5552
02:27:03.921 --> 02:27:06.250
<v Speaker 3>where would you do that outside there?</v>

5553
02:27:07.570 --> 02:27:08.403
<v Speaker 3>I mean the uh,</v>

5554
02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:09.130
<v Speaker 3>ice house again,</v>

5555
02:27:09.130 --> 02:27:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you can do it outside and that little bit of new area.</v>

5556
02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5557
02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:12.460
<v Speaker 3>To everybody would go to smoke anywhere.</v>

5558
02:27:12.490 --> 02:27:12.970
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

5559
02:27:12.970 --> 02:27:14.290
<v Speaker 3>Why not put a big screen up there,</v>

5560
02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:15.153
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5561
02:27:16.530 --> 02:27:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Like you could talk to like that one,</v>

5562
02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:22.960
<v Speaker 3>that whole property because that whole building that is owned by the same person</v>

5563
02:27:22.961 --> 02:27:24.700
<v Speaker 3>that owns like that parking lot that's right.</v>

5564
02:27:24.730 --> 02:27:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Connected to it.</v>

5565
02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:28.540
<v Speaker 3>And if we were to like close that off and then make it like,</v>

5566
02:27:28.660 --> 02:27:28.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5567
02:27:28.871 --> 02:27:30.250
<v Speaker 3>different states upsides,</v>

5568
02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:32.760
<v Speaker 3>summer podcast,</v>

5569
02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.840
<v Speaker 3>broadcast the podcast to the parking lot and just have pulled up your own</v>

5570
02:27:35.841 --> 02:27:36.251
<v Speaker 3>chairs.</v>

5571
02:27:36.251 --> 02:27:39.060
<v Speaker 3>You need certain permits to do that though cause you could disturb other</v>

5572
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:40.980
<v Speaker 3>businesses and you'll disturb the neighborhood.</v>

5573
02:27:40.981 --> 02:27:42.640
<v Speaker 3>Had that permission with all those businesses.</v>

5574
02:27:42.641 --> 02:27:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could do that.</v>

5575
02:27:43.810 --> 02:27:44.261
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

5576
02:27:44.261 --> 02:27:46.840
<v Speaker 3>I think you know that first of all that's always in the park.</v>

5577
02:27:47.090 --> 02:27:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Tentative license.</v>

5578
02:27:48.090 --> 02:27:48.191
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5579
02:27:48.191 --> 02:27:49.990
<v Speaker 3>But that's a movie and it's in a park.</v>

5580
02:27:50.110 --> 02:27:50.980
<v Speaker 3>This isn't a part,</v>

5581
02:27:50.981 --> 02:27:54.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a parking lot and it's right next to people's businesses.</v>

5582
02:27:54.430 --> 02:27:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Either would hear it for sure if honey honey is out there jamming carry like a</v>

5583
02:27:58.481 --> 02:27:59.300
<v Speaker 3>live band.</v>

5584
02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:01.090
<v Speaker 3>There's a festival that's in Columbus,</v>

5585
02:28:01.091 --> 02:28:01.924
<v Speaker 3>Ohio.</v>

5586
02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:05.320
<v Speaker 3>It's the whole weekend called calm fast co what it is,</v>

5587
02:28:05.321 --> 02:28:08.380
<v Speaker 3>it's community festival where everybody in the community gets together and</v>

5588
02:28:08.381 --> 02:28:11.280
<v Speaker 3>volunteers time work and making a festival.</v>

5589
02:28:11.281 --> 02:28:13.080
<v Speaker 3>So like a lot of my friends would like sit there and be,</v>

5590
02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:16.870
<v Speaker 3>you know the people that sell beer all day and they just do it for free.</v>

5591
02:28:17.050 --> 02:28:17.883
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>

5592
02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:21.620
<v Speaker 3>there's three different stages for different stages and it's just music and,</v>

5593
02:28:21.621 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 3>and in</v>

5594
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:25.230
<v Speaker 2>poetry and there's girls walking around naked and uh,</v>

5595
02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:25.670
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

5596
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:28.730
<v Speaker 2>and it's just people go there with tents and like pretty much just hang out at</v>

5597
02:28:28.731 --> 02:28:30.050
<v Speaker 2>this park the whole weekend.</v>

5598
02:28:30.490 --> 02:28:30.911
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5599
02:28:30.911 --> 02:28:31.551
<v Speaker 2>and it was just like,</v>

5600
02:28:31.551 --> 02:28:33.230
<v Speaker 2>imagine if it was something like that where,</v>

5601
02:28:33.231 --> 02:28:35.570
<v Speaker 2>cause like your fan base is so like,</v>

5602
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:36.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5603
02:28:36.530 --> 02:28:39.320
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of like outdoorsy mushrooms,</v>

5604
02:28:39.321 --> 02:28:40.550
<v Speaker 2>nature kind of,</v>

5605
02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5606
02:28:40.970 --> 02:28:43.550
<v Speaker 2>they like music and Jimmy Hendrickson,</v>

5607
02:28:44.130 --> 02:28:47.280
<v Speaker 3>we could eventually do it someplace like that someplace cool.</v>

5608
02:28:47.281 --> 02:28:49.890
<v Speaker 3>But we would have to make sure that there's enough combinations for all the</v>

5609
02:28:49.891 --> 02:28:51.300
<v Speaker 3>people that were invited to come down.</v>

5610
02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:51.811
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5611
02:28:51.811 --> 02:28:52.201
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5612
02:28:52.201 --> 02:28:55.890
<v Speaker 3>it would be tricky and we would also have to make sure that we could safely get</v>

5613
02:28:55.891 --> 02:28:57.480
<v Speaker 3>all the artists there and put up,</v>

5614
02:28:57.481 --> 02:28:58.890
<v Speaker 3>put them up and places.</v>

5615
02:28:59.070 --> 02:29:00.820
<v Speaker 3>That's why starting an off in Pasadena,</v>

5616
02:29:00.821 --> 02:29:03.390
<v Speaker 3>it would be super easy because everyone's local.</v>

5617
02:29:03.570 --> 02:29:06.870
<v Speaker 3>We could have all the local guys go off and people that want to come here,</v>

5618
02:29:06.871 --> 02:29:07.441
<v Speaker 3>they can come here.</v>

5619
02:29:07.441 --> 02:29:08.700
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to get to Pasadena.</v>

5620
02:29:08.730 --> 02:29:10.050
<v Speaker 3>You can come here from all over the country.</v>

5621
02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:12.480
<v Speaker 3>We can set up a 10 at comm fest this year.</v>

5622
02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:13.820
<v Speaker 3>What's confessed?</v>

5623
02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:14.401
<v Speaker 3>That festival.</v>

5624
02:29:14.401 --> 02:29:15.234
<v Speaker 3>I was just telling him that.</v>

5625
02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5626
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:16.583
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a comedy team.</v>

5627
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we need to bring in people like that.</v>

5628
02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

5629
02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I think we advertise to our own people.</v>

5630
02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:26.040
<v Speaker 3>We advertise to everybody who follows me on Twitter and everybody who follows me</v>

5631
02:29:26.041 --> 02:29:29.350
<v Speaker 3>on Facebook pod lead up time.</v>

5632
02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5633
02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:32.560
<v Speaker 3>this is the week you're gonna want to make your hotel reservations.</v>

5634
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Before I do that,</v>

5635
02:29:34.081 --> 02:29:36.510
<v Speaker 3>we could do that now and get thousands of people to come from all over the</v>

5636
02:29:36.511 --> 02:29:36.901
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

5637
02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:37.390
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

5638
02:29:37.390 --> 02:29:40.800
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of shows throughout the week leaving that two shows a night.</v>

5639
02:29:40.801 --> 02:29:41.634
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much to say the,</v>

5640
02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:44.370
<v Speaker 3>if you do doing a couple of locations lighthouse on somewhere else,</v>

5641
02:29:44.371 --> 02:29:46.270
<v Speaker 3>the ice house is a great place because it's,</v>

5642
02:29:46.271 --> 02:29:46.560
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5643
02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:48.780
<v Speaker 3>it's close to lax and people can get there.</v>

5644
02:29:48.781 --> 02:29:49.890
<v Speaker 3>They can get rental cars,</v>

5645
02:29:49.891 --> 02:29:50.611
<v Speaker 3>they can stay.</v>

5646
02:29:50.611 --> 02:29:51.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not a far drive.</v>

5647
02:29:51.661 --> 02:29:52.710
<v Speaker 3>You've got an navigation system.</v>

5648
02:29:52.711 --> 02:29:53.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard to swing,</v>

5649
02:29:54.090 --> 02:29:54.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5650
02:29:54.420 --> 02:29:54.661
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5651
02:29:54.661 --> 02:29:55.920
<v Speaker 3>it's totally feasible.</v>

5652
02:29:55.921 --> 02:29:57.780
<v Speaker 3>And we have the best relationship with that club,</v>

5653
02:29:57.960 --> 02:29:58.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5654
02:29:58.440 --> 02:29:58.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5655
02:29:58.741 --> 02:30:00.090
<v Speaker 3>as far as clubs around,</v>

5656
02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:01.230
<v Speaker 3>and there's two rooms there,</v>

5657
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:05.220
<v Speaker 3>so we could have two rooms running simultaneously and just keep doing shows.</v>

5658
02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:07.020
<v Speaker 3>We could do like two and three shows at night.</v>

5659
02:30:07.021 --> 02:30:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Like we could have an early show,</v>

5660
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:12.000
<v Speaker 3>we can have a bunch of different shit going on or having music side stage.</v>

5661
02:30:12.370 --> 02:30:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Just how many times mad security for nutty people.</v>

5662
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:17.730
<v Speaker 3>So many nutty people that been showing up at the icehouse Layla.</v>

5663
02:30:18.690 --> 02:30:18.901

02:30:49.530 --> 02:30:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Good sign of crazy.</v>

5689
02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Not always.</v>

5690
02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:53.640
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people come by themselves that are very nice,</v>

5691
02:30:53.641 --> 02:30:56.130
<v Speaker 3>but occasionally it's a sign of crazy.</v>

5692
02:30:56.820 --> 02:30:58.500
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you going anywhere by herself.</v>

5693
02:30:58.501 --> 02:30:58.771
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5694
02:30:58.771 --> 02:30:59.100
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

5695
02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:00.300
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to be up to right now?</v>

5696
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Not always.</v>

5697
02:31:01.380 --> 02:31:01.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5698
02:31:01.850 --> 02:31:03.180
<v Speaker 3>it could could mean you're cool.</v>

5699
02:31:03.181 --> 02:31:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I met some really cool people that came to shows by themselves.</v>

5700
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Nothing wrong with it.</v>

5701
02:31:06.690 --> 02:31:09.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a hard fast rule rogue fest.</v>

5702
02:31:10.170 --> 02:31:13.800
<v Speaker 3>But if you meet a girl though and she comes to a show by herself that girls are</v>

5703
02:31:13.801 --> 02:31:14.670
<v Speaker 3>freak almost.</v>

5704
02:31:15.150 --> 02:31:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm by myself just hanging out</v>

5705
02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:19.793
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>

5706
02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:24.030
<v Speaker 3>So we would have to call this a the desk squad festival or something like that</v>

5707
02:31:24.270 --> 02:31:27.690
<v Speaker 3>to first we'd have to figure out what to call it.</v>

5708
02:31:28.350 --> 02:31:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Like the insane clown posse.</v>

5709
02:31:29.671 --> 02:31:30.301
<v Speaker 3>They call their shit.</v>

5710
02:31:30.301 --> 02:31:31.740
<v Speaker 3>The gathering of the Juggalos.</v>

5711
02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:34.440
<v Speaker 3>We would not call it the gathering of the Juggalos.</v>

5712
02:31:34.470 --> 02:31:34.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5713
02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:35.521
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't call it that.</v>

5714
02:31:35.521 --> 02:31:37.190
<v Speaker 3>They already have that damn it.</v>

5715
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:39.210
<v Speaker 3>That would be so good for in order to get people to come out.</v>

5716
02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:41.370
<v Speaker 3>But death squad is going to give people the wrong impression.</v>

5717
02:31:41.610 --> 02:31:42.443
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5718
02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we need to come up with a name for the festival,</v>

5719
02:31:44.791 --> 02:31:45.900
<v Speaker 3>like a yearly name.</v>

5720
02:31:46.290 --> 02:31:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Just call it all of garden.</v>

5721
02:31:47.340 --> 02:31:49.140
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the happy primate festival.</v>

5722
02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Most of all happy primary comedy,</v>

5723
02:31:52.690 --> 02:31:53.100
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

5724
02:31:53.100 --> 02:31:55.730
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite a comedy festival bands too.</v>

5725
02:31:56.130 --> 02:31:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5726
02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:57.800
<v Speaker 3>and we would just get,</v>

5727
02:31:58.010 --> 02:32:00.880
<v Speaker 3>just like primates do,</v>

5728
02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:03.780
<v Speaker 3>you'll get like some music club and Pasadena to show those shows.</v>

5729
02:32:04.250 --> 02:32:04.531
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

5730
02:32:04.531 --> 02:32:06.710
<v Speaker 3>We would do those at the ice house to put it put us.</v>

5731
02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:08.130
<v Speaker 3>There'll be easy to put up.</v>

5732
02:32:08.131 --> 02:32:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Like if a honey honey,</v>

5733
02:32:09.031 --> 02:32:10.020
<v Speaker 3>they could play at the,</v>

5734
02:32:10.021 --> 02:32:10.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5735
02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:11.520
<v Speaker 3>at the icehouse easy.</v>

5736
02:32:11.550 --> 02:32:13.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they've had bands playing that place.</v>

5737
02:32:13.031 --> 02:32:14.400
<v Speaker 3>I have a jumped off the stage.</v>

5738
02:32:14.740 --> 02:32:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5739
02:32:15.330 --> 02:32:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5740
02:32:15.850 --> 02:32:16.770
<v Speaker 3>There's not much room.</v>

5741
02:32:17.370 --> 02:32:18.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5742
02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they would do that.</v>

5743
02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:20.611
<v Speaker 3>How much room is there?</v>

5744
02:32:20.611 --> 02:32:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's room for a drum set?</v>

5745
02:32:22.050 --> 02:32:22.261
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5746
02:32:22.261 --> 02:32:23.010
<v Speaker 3>not on the stage.</v>

5747
02:32:23.010 --> 02:32:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not.</v>

5748
02:32:23.610 --> 02:32:24.480
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

5749
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:24.900
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5750
02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:25.260
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5751
02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not.</v>

5752
02:32:26.750 --> 02:32:29.860
<v Speaker 3>There would be take up the entire state drums though.</v>

5753
02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:32.760
<v Speaker 3>There's some of their best things they do is just him and her,</v>

5754
02:32:32.761 --> 02:32:37.110
<v Speaker 3>him playing guitar and her playing Banjo Acoustic set.</v>

5755
02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:37.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5756
02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:38.341
<v Speaker 3>That's better.</v>

5757
02:32:38.341 --> 02:32:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Anyway man,</v>

5758
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:41.280
<v Speaker 3>the Acoustic Shit they did on my podcast was brilliant.</v>

5759
02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:43.860
<v Speaker 3>They don't do like 15 to 20 minutes at the end of 30 minutes or 40.</v>

5760
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:45.550
<v Speaker 3>She's not like she,</v>

5761
02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:47.250
<v Speaker 3>she has a real voice man.</v>

5762
02:32:47.251 --> 02:32:48.810
<v Speaker 3>That chick has a real voice.</v>

5763
02:32:48.811 --> 02:32:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Like that's,</v>

5764
02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:50.830
<v Speaker 3>that's a legitimate voice.</v>

5765
02:32:50.831 --> 02:32:55.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like she doesn't need any effects or any fakery she really can sing.</v>

5766
02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:56.820
<v Speaker 3>I would do a storyteller show,</v>

5767
02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:58.490
<v Speaker 3>get crushed on dos to deal with.</v>

5768
02:32:59.310 --> 02:32:59.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5769
02:32:59.551 --> 02:33:00.384
<v Speaker 3>we can do that too.</v>

5770
02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:02.100
<v Speaker 3>That could be a part of it.</v>

5771
02:33:02.130 --> 02:33:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

5772
02:33:02.850 --> 02:33:03.683
<v Speaker 3>It's a good idea.</v>

5773
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5774
02:33:04.390 --> 02:33:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Just different themes or different shortage situations for like that.</v>

5775
02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:08.521
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>

5776
02:33:08.521 --> 02:33:09.354
<v Speaker 3>we should also</v>

5777
02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:12.330
<v Speaker 3>ask topics.</v>

5778
02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:13.590
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what I was going to say.</v>

5779
02:33:13.591 --> 02:33:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Question in that answer.</v>

5780
02:33:14.850 --> 02:33:15.840
<v Speaker 3>We should do a,</v>

5781
02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:15.951
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5782
02:33:15.951 --> 02:33:16.771
<v Speaker 3>an entire show.</v>

5783
02:33:16.771 --> 02:33:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Like we did a little bit of it at the end of the show in Atlanta,</v>

5784
02:33:19.710 --> 02:33:22.200
<v Speaker 3>but it was more like mocking people for the stupid questions.</v>

5785
02:33:22.201 --> 02:33:23.700
<v Speaker 3>And more moon landing hoax,</v>

5786
02:33:23.701 --> 02:33:24.540
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy talk.</v>

5787
02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:26.370
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear it from his own mouth.</v>

5788
02:33:26.371 --> 02:33:27.091
<v Speaker 3>This guy goes,</v>

5789
02:33:27.091 --> 02:33:27.481
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5790
02:33:27.481 --> 02:33:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I do know that we went to the moon.</v>

5791
02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:31.680
<v Speaker 3>I love just saying that.</v>

5792
02:33:31.681 --> 02:33:31.861
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5793
02:33:31.861 --> 02:33:32.700
<v Speaker 3>I do know.</v>

5794
02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying it louder.</v>

5795
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:36.451
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

5796
02:33:36.451 --> 02:33:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Silly 1969 you know what happened?</v>

5797
02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:40.020
<v Speaker 3>No matter what the argument?</v>

5798
02:33:40.050 --> 02:33:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5799
02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I just know.</v>

5800
02:33:41.290 --> 02:33:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5801
02:33:41.610 --> 02:33:42.320
<v Speaker 3>so you're just hanging out.</v>

5802
02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:43.081
<v Speaker 3>Just on talking about.</v>

5803
02:33:43.081 --> 02:33:43.741
<v Speaker 3>No one knows.</v>

5804
02:33:43.741 --> 02:33:46.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean we can kind of assume most likely that happened.</v>

5805
02:33:46.321 --> 02:33:47.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure Kennedy got shot in the head.</v>

5806
02:33:47.821 --> 02:33:47.941
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

5807
02:33:47.941 --> 02:33:49.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm 99% positive,</v>

5808
02:33:49.351 --> 02:33:51.400
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't even say I'm 100% positive with that.</v>

5809
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Fuck knows.</v>

5810
02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:55.260
<v Speaker 3>There's God damn dark world.</v>

5811
02:33:55.261 --> 02:33:55.551
<v Speaker 3>We live.</v>

5812
02:33:55.551 --> 02:33:56.520
<v Speaker 3>We'll take that argument too far.</v>

5813
02:33:56.521 --> 02:33:57.031
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they're like,</v>

5814
02:33:57.031 --> 02:33:57.151
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5815
02:33:57.151 --> 02:34:00.750
<v Speaker 3>how did you even know there was a Kennedy world's real?</v>

5816
02:34:00.930 --> 02:34:03.770
<v Speaker 3>How do we not know that you are not living in a commune or something?</v>

5817
02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:05.221
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

5818
02:34:05.221 --> 02:34:06.240
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was really hilarious.</v>

5819
02:34:06.241 --> 02:34:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I saw a video of you explaining to people how to download the bone zone and you</v>

5820
02:34:10.921 --> 02:34:11.311
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>

5821
02:34:11.311 --> 02:34:16.311
<v Speaker 3>I sent a handicapped person as a person because I don't know how to do it.</v>

5822
02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:19.660
<v Speaker 3>One Brendan Walsh was complaining that people,</v>

5823
02:34:19.700 --> 02:34:21.520
<v Speaker 2>we're having a hard time finding his podcast.</v>

5824
02:34:21.530 --> 02:34:22.221
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much,</v>

5825
02:34:22.221 --> 02:34:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I showed Brennan how to do it and he made a big deal about it on another podcast</v>

5826
02:34:26.700 --> 02:34:27.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

5827
02:34:27.140 --> 02:34:27.973
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

5828
02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.100
<v Speaker 2>come on here.</v>

5829
02:34:29.101 --> 02:34:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Let me do it real slow again for you</v>

5830
02:34:31.330 --> 02:34:32.020
<v Speaker 3>to show people how to,</v>

5831
02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:32.420
<v Speaker 3>how to,</v>

5832
02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:33.610
<v Speaker 3>how to download?</v>

5833
02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5834
02:34:34.810 --> 02:34:35.530
<v Speaker 3>or just,</v>

5835
02:34:35.530 --> 02:34:35.711
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5836
02:34:35.711 --> 02:34:37.630
<v Speaker 3>I think he wants it to be under his name.</v>

5837
02:34:37.631 --> 02:34:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is now?</v>

5838
02:34:38.741 --> 02:34:39.061
<v Speaker 3>He's just,</v>

5839
02:34:39.061 --> 02:34:39.400
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5840
02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:43.270
<v Speaker 3>people see that the kids search bone zone and it comes up on iTunes and so I was</v>

5841
02:34:43.271 --> 02:34:43.421
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5842
02:34:43.421 --> 02:34:43.541
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5843
02:34:43.541 --> 02:34:44.830
<v Speaker 3>let me show you how to do it,</v>

5844
02:34:45.310 --> 02:34:46.390
<v Speaker 3>but you can't show the people.</v>

5845
02:34:46.391 --> 02:34:47.260
<v Speaker 3>It's the people searching.</v>

5846
02:34:47.290 --> 02:34:47.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what you have to commit.</v>

5847
02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:48.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not pregnant.</v>

5848
02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:52.660
<v Speaker 3>How many people that are in your little network get upset that you have the</v>

5849
02:34:52.661 --> 02:34:56.500
<v Speaker 3>network as the name of their show and then they're shown next instead of the way</v>

5850
02:34:56.501 --> 02:34:58.180
<v Speaker 3>everybody else has to think out of.</v>

5851
02:34:58.240 --> 02:34:59.073
<v Speaker 3>Let's say</v>

5852
02:34:59.870 --> 02:35:01.760
<v Speaker 2>if there was a 100,000 people,</v>

5853
02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I think I hear it maybe two times on Twitter.</v>

5854
02:35:05.380 --> 02:35:05.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5855
02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:05.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5856
02:35:05.710 --> 02:35:05.801
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5857
02:35:05.801 --> 02:35:05.870
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5858
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.931
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5859
02:35:05.931 --> 02:35:06.120
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5860
02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:07.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the people,</v>

5861
02:35:07.220 --> 02:35:09.240
<v Speaker 3>the people that host their shows.</v>

5862
02:35:09.770 --> 02:35:11.400
<v Speaker 3>How many of them want to change it to their own name?</v>

5863
02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:13.410
<v Speaker 3>It must all of them.</v>

5864
02:35:13.411 --> 02:35:13.711
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5865
02:35:13.711 --> 02:35:14.544
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

5866
02:35:14.770 --> 02:35:15.480
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5867
02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:15.900
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5868
02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:16.870
<v Speaker 3>I would say none of them now.</v>

5869
02:35:17.250 --> 02:35:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Right now.</v>

5870
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:18.001
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

5871
02:35:18.001 --> 02:35:18.461
<v Speaker 3>Brennan was,</v>

5872
02:35:18.461 --> 02:35:21.560
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want it to be in his name and then have you as the network second.</v>

5873
02:35:21.561 --> 02:35:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5874
02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:22.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5875
02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean they look what happened with Freddie Lockhart and Freddy Lockhart did it.</v>

5876
02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:25.920
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5877
02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:26.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5878
02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:28.380
<v Speaker 2>he got lost and so he came back.</v>

5879
02:35:28.570 --> 02:35:28.931
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5880
02:35:28.931 --> 02:35:29.110
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5881
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.261
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5882
02:35:29.261 --> 02:35:29.381
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5883
02:35:29.381 --> 02:35:29.531
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5884
02:35:29.531 --> 02:35:29.651
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5885
02:35:29.651 --> 02:35:29.801
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5886
02:35:29.801 --> 02:35:29.981
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5887
02:35:29.981 --> 02:35:30.280
<v Speaker 3>First,</v>

5888
02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:30.731
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

5889
02:35:30.731 --> 02:35:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Freddy didn't.</v>

5890
02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:32.313
<v Speaker 3>He left you.</v>

5891
02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:35.770
<v Speaker 3>He stopped doing it and when he left it wasn't that he was,</v>

5892
02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:39.550
<v Speaker 3>you know that he went under his name and that's why people couldn't find him.</v>

5893
02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:40.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like he really,</v>

5894
02:35:41.350 --> 02:35:42.350
<v Speaker 3>nobody gave a shit about it.</v>

5895
02:35:42.351 --> 02:35:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

5896
02:35:42.530 --> 02:35:45.160
<v Speaker 3>you said you were going to find a way how people,</v>

5897
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:45.481
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5898
02:35:45.481 --> 02:35:45.640
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5899
02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:49.120
<v Speaker 3>It has a color to all podcasts now that know Freddie left because he wanted to</v>

5900
02:35:49.121 --> 02:35:50.050
<v Speaker 3>do it on his own.</v>

5901
02:35:50.051 --> 02:35:52.750
<v Speaker 3>And then when I'm saying is that when he did that and then we could find his</v>

5902
02:35:52.751 --> 02:35:56.530
<v Speaker 3>podcast anymore because no one was listening to anymore because that's the only</v>

5903
02:35:56.531 --> 02:35:58.360
<v Speaker 3>because Freddie had not and he said,</v>

5904
02:35:58.361 --> 02:35:58.820
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

5905
02:35:58.820 --> 02:35:59.591
<v Speaker 3>not publicized it.</v>

5906
02:35:59.591 --> 02:36:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Well he didn't do a good job.</v>

5907
02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:03.250
<v Speaker 3>We talked about it on this part going on podcasts,</v>

5908
02:36:03.251 --> 02:36:03.910
<v Speaker 3>we tweeted it,</v>

5909
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:05.830
<v Speaker 3>I even retweeted him tons of times.</v>

5910
02:36:05.870 --> 02:36:06.270
<v Speaker 3>No it is,</v>

5911
02:36:06.270 --> 02:36:08.650
<v Speaker 3>it is an extra step if people,</v>

5912
02:36:08.651 --> 02:36:11.500
<v Speaker 3>you consider the numbers of people that are listening to yours but in order for</v>

5913
02:36:11.501 --> 02:36:13.810
<v Speaker 3>him to have it go off on his own,</v>

5914
02:36:13.811 --> 02:36:14.620
<v Speaker 3>think about that.</v>

5915
02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:18.580
<v Speaker 3>He was doing yours for so long and it's still hadn't developed a name where he</v>

5916
02:36:18.581 --> 02:36:19.900
<v Speaker 3>could have his phone number one</v>

5917
02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:20.701
<v Speaker 2>podcasts on desk.</v>

5918
02:36:20.701 --> 02:36:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Why when it left and it went to 170</v>

5919
02:36:23.450 --> 02:36:24.070
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

5920
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:26.030
<v Speaker 3>so you understand what I'm saying?</v>

5921
02:36:26.060 --> 02:36:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Know what I'm saying?</v>

5922
02:36:27.351 --> 02:36:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Is he in the all the time he's doing it with you still hadn't gotten</v>

5923
02:36:31.101 --> 02:36:31.934
<v Speaker 3>independent.</v>

5924
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.260
<v Speaker 3>He was still attached to your name.</v>

5925
02:36:33.410 --> 02:36:37.310
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like he wasted time doing a good podcast under your name and</v>

5926
02:36:37.311 --> 02:36:38.780
<v Speaker 3>never got his name out there.</v>

5927
02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:40.700
<v Speaker 3>So when his name got out there on its own,</v>

5928
02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:42.410
<v Speaker 3>it flopped because no one knew about it.</v>

5929
02:36:42.890 --> 02:36:44.450
<v Speaker 3>He had been doing all this,</v>

5930
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:47.120
<v Speaker 3>all this podcasting and spending all this time developing this,</v>

5931
02:36:47.390 --> 02:36:51.440
<v Speaker 3>this sort of a a bunch of fans to follow him and he couldn't take it with them.</v>

5932
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if he just did it on his own,</v>

5933
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:55.280
<v Speaker 3>whatever he built up would have been his own.</v>

5934
02:36:55.281 --> 02:36:56.114
<v Speaker 3>It would have stuck with them.</v>

5935
02:36:56.150 --> 02:37:00.230
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] do you not make sense?</v>

5936
02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5937
02:37:00.690 --> 02:37:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how many podcasts that there's comics out there that you've never</v>

5938
02:37:03.601 --> 02:37:04.411
<v Speaker 2>heard of in your life?</v>

5939
02:37:04.411 --> 02:37:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Did you know Mark Ellis had two podcasts?</v>

5940
02:37:06.290 --> 02:37:06.431
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5941
02:37:06.431 --> 02:37:06.591
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5942
02:37:06.591 --> 02:37:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Well Mark Ellis is not a famous comedian.</v>

5943
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.991
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5944
02:37:08.991 --> 02:37:09.681
<v Speaker 3>Freddy Lockhart,</v>

5945
02:37:09.681 --> 02:37:12.680
<v Speaker 3>first of all was on a television show and he's been on our podcast many,</v>

5946
02:37:12.681 --> 02:37:13.341
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>

5947
02:37:13.341 --> 02:37:16.640
<v Speaker 3>And you know Mark Ellis the most would be nice if people could search for his</v>

5948
02:37:16.641 --> 02:37:17.060
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>

5949
02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5950
02:37:17.890 --> 02:37:18.440
<v Speaker 3>well they can,</v>

5951
02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:19.310
<v Speaker 3>they can search for his name.</v>

5952
02:37:19.490 --> 02:37:21.800
<v Speaker 3>The real thing is like the question is,</v>

5953
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:23.810
<v Speaker 3>do you do it the way Adam Carolla does it,</v>

5954
02:37:23.811 --> 02:37:24.591
<v Speaker 3>where he has,</v>

5955
02:37:24.591 --> 02:37:25.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5956
02:37:25.041 --> 02:37:26.630
<v Speaker 3>like someone's whatever,</v>

5957
02:37:26.631 --> 02:37:30.460
<v Speaker 3>the like Penn Sunday school and then underneath that it says ace broadcasting.</v>

5958
02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5959
02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:34.220
<v Speaker 3>so he has it in a secondary position and he's allows the,</v>

5960
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:38.120
<v Speaker 3>the person's name of their podcast that's first and he's just the production arm</v>

5961
02:37:38.121 --> 02:37:38.370
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

5962
02:37:38.370 --> 02:37:39.230
<v Speaker 3>You can build up on it.</v>

5963
02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Brian,</v>

5964
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:43.640
<v Speaker 3>the way Brian does it is he has a channel and you know,</v>

5965
02:37:43.641 --> 02:37:47.150
<v Speaker 3>it's the desk squad channel and then everybody else's podcast is sort of</v>

5966
02:37:47.151 --> 02:37:48.080
<v Speaker 3>secondary to that.</v>

5967
02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:49.700
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the exact opposite.</v>

5968
02:37:49.701 --> 02:37:50.301
<v Speaker 3>It's collecting.</v>

5969
02:37:50.301 --> 02:37:51.680
<v Speaker 3>It all builds up the network.</v>

5970
02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:56.740
<v Speaker 3>It builds up the network as a whole instead of building up each individual as an</v>

5971
02:37:56.901 --> 02:37:57.734
<v Speaker 3>entity on their own.</v>

5972
02:37:58.270 --> 02:37:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Everyone helps each other.</v>

5973
02:37:59.201 --> 02:38:00.580
<v Speaker 2>If you're a big Sam Aaa fan,</v>

5974
02:38:00.581 --> 02:38:01.640
<v Speaker 2>you start listening to Sam triple,</v>

5975
02:38:01.641 --> 02:38:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you're going to start listening to Brendon Walsh,</v>

5976
02:38:03.090 --> 02:38:03.761
<v Speaker 2>vice versa.</v>

5977
02:38:03.761 --> 02:38:08.020
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people that never knew who Brennan Walsh was until they just</v>

5978
02:38:08.021 --> 02:38:08.351
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

5979
02:38:08.351 --> 02:38:08.621
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5980
02:38:08.621 --> 02:38:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I like Freddy Lockhart.</v>

5981
02:38:09.851 --> 02:38:12.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start listening to Brendon Walsh now because they're on the same</v>

5982
02:38:12.461 --> 02:38:13.490
<v Speaker 2>network and vice</v>

5983
02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:13.750
<v Speaker 3>verse.</v>

5984
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:17.590
<v Speaker 3>So that's also the case of what people came onto this podcast.</v>

5985
02:38:17.730 --> 02:38:17.851
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5986
02:38:17.851 --> 02:38:19.890
<v Speaker 5>but that's not the same reason that there would be people who were like,</v>

5987
02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:20.041
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5988
02:38:20.041 --> 02:38:20.874
<v Speaker 5>I don't like,</v>

5989
02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:21.740
<v Speaker 5>let's just say,</v>

5990
02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:21.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5991
02:38:21.900 --> 02:38:22.660
<v Speaker 5>here's an example.</v>

5992
02:38:22.660 --> 02:38:23.010
<v Speaker 5>Pockets,</v>

5993
02:38:23.010 --> 02:38:24.750
<v Speaker 5>they get annoyed and don't listen to the same AAA.</v>

5994
02:38:24.751 --> 02:38:26.070
<v Speaker 5>Pacos here's an example.</v>

5995
02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:29.160
<v Speaker 5>It turned off by this stuff they're not into and they're like,</v>

5996
02:38:29.161 --> 02:38:30.700
<v Speaker 5>how much of this do I have to sit through it before?</v>

5997
02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:31.360
<v Speaker 5>Don't do it.</v>

5998
02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:32.220
<v Speaker 5>Don't listen to it.</v>

5999
02:38:32.470 --> 02:38:33.990
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to listen to every single wine?</v>

6000
02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:34.280
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

6001
02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:35.490
<v Speaker 5>It'd be just less lucky to see it.</v>

6002
02:38:36.090 --> 02:38:36.923
<v Speaker 5>Why you?</v>

6003
02:38:36.930 --> 02:38:37.361
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at the,</v>

6004
02:38:37.361 --> 02:38:38.194
<v Speaker 5>see it,</v>

6005
02:38:38.830 --> 02:38:40.710
<v Speaker 5>the six things that are there and you only need to one of them.</v>

6006
02:38:40.711 --> 02:38:43.140
<v Speaker 5>It's just like you're less likely to check in and see when there's updates.</v>

6007
02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:43.621
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6008
02:38:43.621 --> 02:38:43.921
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

6009
02:38:43.921 --> 02:38:48.420
<v Speaker 3>my only thought is that someone is going to make sense of their own shit on</v>

6010
02:38:48.421 --> 02:38:48.990
<v Speaker 3>their own.</v>

6011
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:52.270
<v Speaker 3>If they're doing their own show on their own and they they brand,</v>

6012
02:38:52.330 --> 02:38:54.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean they start like Doug loves movies,</v>

6013
02:38:54.030 --> 02:38:57.220
<v Speaker 3>started out on his own captain on zone and at this point in time we a lot of</v>

6014
02:38:57.230 --> 02:39:02.230
<v Speaker 3>shows that equity that he's built up in that name and doing on on his own.</v>

6015
02:39:02.820 --> 02:39:04.230
<v Speaker 3>And for a lot of these other guys,</v>

6016
02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:07.040
<v Speaker 3>they're building equity into the desk squad name and it's not,</v>

6017
02:39:07.090 --> 02:39:08.390
<v Speaker 3>it's not transplant to</v>

6018
02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:09.761
<v Speaker 2>look at Ari superior,</v>

6019
02:39:09.761 --> 02:39:10.620
<v Speaker 2>look at Thompson Sigora.</v>

6020
02:39:10.621 --> 02:39:12.210
<v Speaker 2>There's ways that you can do it right?</v>

6021
02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:12.550
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

6022
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:15.210
<v Speaker 2>they were lucky people like their show and they're listening to it.</v>

6023
02:39:15.211 --> 02:39:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Aria is doing good on his podcast and so is Tom Segura.</v>

6024
02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:19.343
<v Speaker 2>So what are you trying to say?</v>

6025
02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying right at the end I left.</v>

6026
02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:21.841
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

6027
02:39:21.841 --> 02:39:22.321
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

6028
02:39:22.321 --> 02:39:23.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that,</v>

6029
02:39:23.011 --> 02:39:26.850
<v Speaker 2>that I don't think that like it works for everyone.</v>

6030
02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:27.773
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

6031
02:39:27.810 --> 02:39:28.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think that like,</v>

6032
02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:32.730
<v Speaker 2>like I think of Sam Aaa wanted to like move off a death squad.</v>

6033
02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:35.250
<v Speaker 2>He can totally do it and he would probably survive.</v>

6034
02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:35.941
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

6035
02:39:35.941 --> 02:39:38.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that it's,</v>

6036
02:39:38.310 --> 02:39:39.940
<v Speaker 5>it'd be nice if there's a way to stay on dust squad,</v>

6037
02:39:39.941 --> 02:39:42.340
<v Speaker 5>but also have their own picture for their podcast or something.</v>

6038
02:39:42.910 --> 02:39:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6039
02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:43.970
<v Speaker 3>they are pictures.</v>

6040
02:39:43.970 --> 02:39:44.471
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

6041
02:39:44.471 --> 02:39:45.500
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what we're talking.</v>

6042
02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:46.550
<v Speaker 3>What reason why?</v>

6043
02:39:46.551 --> 02:39:47.061
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

6044
02:39:47.061 --> 02:39:51.020
<v Speaker 3>you actually made a bad example because the reason why Ari and Dunkin,</v>

6045
02:39:51.110 --> 02:39:54.350
<v Speaker 3>well Dunkin especially did it completely independently on his own,</v>

6046
02:39:54.530 --> 02:39:56.210
<v Speaker 3>but what got them,</v>

6047
02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:59.600
<v Speaker 3>what got them famous was being on a podcast that was famous.</v>

6048
02:39:59.601 --> 02:40:00.140
<v Speaker 3>This one.</v>

6049
02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:00.973
<v Speaker 3>That's what got him,</v>

6050
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:04.460
<v Speaker 3>that's 100% with not being on the desk while they were like,</v>

6051
02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:07.880
<v Speaker 3>how many of your listeners already do you think are not a,</v>

6052
02:40:07.970 --> 02:40:08.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6053
02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:09.110
<v Speaker 3>of Joe Rogan?</v>

6054
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.640
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

6055
02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:09.920
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6056
02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:12.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe like 1% maybe 2%.</v>

6057
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6058
02:40:13.460 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people</v>

6059
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:14.491
<v Speaker 2>found me.</v>

6060
02:40:14.491 --> 02:40:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind it,</v>

6061
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.781
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>

6062
02:40:15.781 --> 02:40:16.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6063
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.501
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

6064
02:40:16.501 --> 02:40:18.090
<v Speaker 2>we're all sort of different,</v>

6065
02:40:18.091 --> 02:40:20.100
<v Speaker 2>but likeminded folks will apologize it.</v>

6066
02:40:20.101 --> 02:40:20.491
<v Speaker 2>Like they're like,</v>

6067
02:40:20.491 --> 02:40:20.880
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean,</v>

6068
02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:21.241
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

6069
02:40:21.241 --> 02:40:22.580
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know you do to stand up.</v>

6070
02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:23.391
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to even see you.</v>

6071
02:40:23.391 --> 02:40:24.690
<v Speaker 2>But before I hear it in the podcast,</v>

6072
02:40:24.691 --> 02:40:24.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6073
02:40:24.841 --> 02:40:25.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

6074
02:40:25.270 --> 02:40:26.460
<v Speaker 2>That means you're here because of that.</v>

6075
02:40:26.461 --> 02:40:27.030
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

6076
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6077
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:30.660
<v Speaker 2>The biggest thing I wanted to stress though is the reason why it's done as a</v>

6078
02:40:30.661 --> 02:40:34.310
<v Speaker 2>group is is is also looking past what podcasts like.</v>

6079
02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think that power through numbers that in 20 years podcasts are</v>

6080
02:40:39.751 --> 02:40:42.240
<v Speaker 2>going to be fucking kicking ass or anything,</v>

6081
02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:46.860
<v Speaker 2>but one thing I do know that's coming up is the the the basic future of cable</v>

6082
02:40:46.861 --> 02:40:50.520
<v Speaker 2>television and networks and stuff or go into more of a streaming base,</v>

6083
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:55.080
<v Speaker 2>a download based system like Netflix or iTunes that that is true.</v>

6084
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Like there's not going to be an NBC and tenure independently of whether or not</v>

6085
02:40:59.311 --> 02:41:01.680
<v Speaker 2>you made your show the first name or their show.</v>

6086
02:41:01.681 --> 02:41:04.140
<v Speaker 2>The first name when he was,</v>

6087
02:41:04.141 --> 02:41:05.340
<v Speaker 2>what I was saying is death squad.</v>

6088
02:41:05.341 --> 02:41:05.521
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

6089
02:41:05.521 --> 02:41:06.900
<v Speaker 2>TV to me is like,</v>

6090
02:41:06.901 --> 02:41:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of considering it more like a,</v>

6091
02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

6092
02:41:09.270 --> 02:41:10.290
<v Speaker 2>this is a channel.</v>

6093
02:41:10.291 --> 02:41:13.530
<v Speaker 2>This is more than just just you're listening to a podcast that your house,</v>

6094
02:41:13.531 --> 02:41:17.400
<v Speaker 2>this is like a TV show network where each one of these shows are like a,</v>

6095
02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:20.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like being on death squad is like dot.</v>

6096
02:41:20.521 --> 02:41:21.001
<v Speaker 2>TV,</v>

6097
02:41:21.001 --> 02:41:25.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's like being on like MTV and each one of these things underneath it as a</v>

6098
02:41:25.591 --> 02:41:26.160
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

6099
02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:28.620
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the biggest things with like all the people saying,</v>

6100
02:41:28.621 --> 02:41:28.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6101
02:41:28.861 --> 02:41:32.370
<v Speaker 2>like I want it to be separated into all the different things on iTunes and all</v>

6102
02:41:32.371 --> 02:41:32.760
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

6103
02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:33.540
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

6104
02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:36.060
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to just go to [inaudible] dot TV and download what you want to</v>

6105
02:41:36.061 --> 02:41:36.894
<v Speaker 2>listen to.</v>

6106
02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:40.800
<v Speaker 2>We're making the show pages right now where like as an example,</v>

6107
02:41:40.801 --> 02:41:42.340
<v Speaker 2>if you like the uh,</v>

6108
02:41:42.390 --> 02:41:43.223
<v Speaker 2>naughty show,</v>

6109
02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:44.610
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have all the,</v>

6110
02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:45.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6111
02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:45.993
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6112
02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:47.033
<v Speaker 2>the naughty shows.</v>

6113
02:41:47.110 --> 02:41:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I was going to have an RSS feed,</v>

6114
02:41:48.721 --> 02:41:49.650
<v Speaker 2>which you can do right now.</v>

6115
02:41:49.651 --> 02:41:50.610
<v Speaker 2>And in any browser,</v>

6116
02:41:50.611 --> 02:41:51.800
<v Speaker 2>if you open up your browser,</v>

6117
02:41:51.810 --> 02:41:53.820
<v Speaker 2>pick a search string of any kind,</v>

6118
02:41:54.020 --> 02:41:55.290
<v Speaker 2>you can make an RSS feed.</v>

6119
02:41:55.291 --> 02:41:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

6120
02:41:55.650 --> 02:41:56.483
<v Speaker 2>No one's doing that.</v>

6121
02:41:56.720 --> 02:41:57.720
<v Speaker 2>No one's making RSL anyways.</v>

6122
02:41:57.721 --> 02:41:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that you can't,</v>

6123
02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:59.511
<v Speaker 2>you can do it if you're,</v>

6124
02:41:59.511 --> 02:42:00.900
<v Speaker 2>if you're freaking out about RSS feeds,</v>

6125
02:42:00.910 --> 02:42:03.780
<v Speaker 2>you probably know can easily cut and paste an RSS string.</v>

6126
02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6127
02:42:04.510 --> 02:42:05.181
<v Speaker 2>when people don't know,</v>

6128
02:42:05.181 --> 02:42:07.010
<v Speaker 2>no one's food is freaking out about RSS feeds.</v>

6129
02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the 1%.</v>

6130
02:42:08.310 --> 02:42:08.701
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

6131
02:42:08.701 --> 02:42:09.534
<v Speaker 2>but each one of these,</v>

6132
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:11.220
<v Speaker 2>each one of these pages,</v>

6133
02:42:11.270 --> 02:42:11.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6134
02:42:11.570 --> 02:42:11.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

6135
02:42:11.790 --> 02:42:13.530
<v Speaker 2>like the naughty show page and stuff like that,</v>

6136
02:42:13.531 --> 02:42:15.270
<v Speaker 2>we'll have all the individual,</v>

6137
02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:15.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6138
02:42:15.630 --> 02:42:17.940
<v Speaker 2>shows for each person and it's going to have,</v>

6139
02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:20.930
<v Speaker 2>each host is going to have a paypal,</v>

6140
02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:21.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6141
02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:22.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6142
02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:23.730
<v Speaker 2>show donation.</v>

6143
02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:27.750
<v Speaker 2>How many of your network shows or you actually in every single one and every one</v>

6144
02:42:27.751 --> 02:42:27.901
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

6145
02:42:27.901 --> 02:42:29.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's another thing that's,</v>

6146
02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:30.570
<v Speaker 2>that's I produced them all.</v>

6147
02:42:30.820 --> 02:42:32.350
<v Speaker 2>The only ones I don't do is when like,</v>

6148
02:42:32.430 --> 02:42:32.851
<v Speaker 2>like I say,</v>

6149
02:42:32.851 --> 02:42:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Brian Count or somebody is doing one in their hotel room.</v>

6150
02:42:35.610 --> 02:42:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that drive you crazy to be in all those different podcasts?</v>

6151
02:42:38.041 --> 02:42:38.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6152
02:42:38.371 --> 02:42:40.070
<v Speaker 2>your brain must be scattered now because it's,</v>

6153
02:42:40.270 --> 02:42:41.790
<v Speaker 2>it's quality control for everything.</v>

6154
02:42:41.970 --> 02:42:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's like,</v>

6155
02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:43.170
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

6156
02:42:43.170 --> 02:42:45.090
<v Speaker 2>there's like shows like I love Esther to death,</v>

6157
02:42:45.091 --> 02:42:45.871
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

6158
02:42:45.871 --> 02:42:46.350
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

6159
02:42:46.350 --> 02:42:46.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6160
02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:47.730
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't,</v>

6161
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:49.830
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't there and just put it up,</v>

6162
02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I would be mad at myself for fucking letting you listen to it.</v>

6163
02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:54.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6164
02:42:54.740 --> 02:42:55.800
<v Speaker 2>and vice versa.</v>

6165
02:42:55.801 --> 02:42:56.311
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes,</v>

6166
02:42:56.311 --> 02:42:56.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6167
02:42:56.611 --> 02:42:56.941
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

6168
02:42:56.941 --> 02:42:57.300
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

6169
02:42:57.300 --> 02:43:00.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a quality that all these people get where like,</v>

6170
02:43:00.721 --> 02:43:00.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6171
02:43:00.931 --> 02:43:01.291
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

6172
02:43:01.291 --> 02:43:02.310
<v Speaker 2>when Ari was on,</v>

6173
02:43:02.370 --> 02:43:03.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6174
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.781
<v Speaker 2>on death squad,</v>

6175
02:43:03.781 --> 02:43:04.001
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

6176
02:43:04.001 --> 02:43:07.860
<v Speaker 2>you sent me one file once and it was like one person was really loud,</v>

6177
02:43:07.861 --> 02:43:08.790
<v Speaker 2>one person was super,</v>

6178
02:43:08.791 --> 02:43:09.451
<v Speaker 2>super quiet.</v>

6179
02:43:09.451 --> 02:43:10.284
<v Speaker 2>You can hear it.</v>

6180
02:43:10.390 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 2>And I know Ari was angry</v>

6181
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:14.830
<v Speaker 5>at me for not wanting to put that up exactly what you were saying.</v>

6182
02:43:14.831 --> 02:43:16.630
<v Speaker 5>We're not putting it up before you let me listen to it.</v>

6183
02:43:17.050 --> 02:43:17.820
<v Speaker 5>That's all it was.</v>

6184
02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:18.101
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

6185
02:43:18.101 --> 02:43:18.770
<v Speaker 5>let me hear it.</v>

6186
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:19.603
<v Speaker 5>I'll make my decision.</v>

6187
02:43:19.630 --> 02:43:20.230
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6188
02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:21.160
<v Speaker 5>But it kept saying no,</v>

6189
02:43:21.161 --> 02:43:23.350
<v Speaker 5>and I told him I couldn't put it up because honestly,</v>

6190
02:43:23.351 --> 02:43:25.780
<v Speaker 5>I sat there for two hours trying to fix it,</v>

6191
02:43:25.781 --> 02:43:28.660
<v Speaker 5>to make it so it would be acceptable and it wasn't.</v>

6192
02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:31.370
<v Speaker 5>And that totally makes sense because a lot of people don't know that,</v>

6193
02:43:31.371 --> 02:43:31.540
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

6194
02:43:31.540 --> 02:43:31.751
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

6195
02:43:31.751 --> 02:43:33.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm on these pockets cause I'm fucking producing them.</v>

6196
02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:34.480
<v Speaker 5>I told,</v>

6197
02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:35.171
<v Speaker 5>I told uh,</v>

6198
02:43:35.171 --> 02:43:38.590
<v Speaker 5>um column cause after you told him I like his stuff was the same way.</v>

6199
02:43:38.591 --> 02:43:39.250
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't coming through.</v>

6200
02:43:39.250 --> 02:43:39.611
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

6201
02:43:39.611 --> 02:43:41.530
<v Speaker 5>do you know you have to get microphones in courts without right?</v>

6202
02:43:41.531 --> 02:43:41.771
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

6203
02:43:41.771 --> 02:43:41.921
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6204
02:43:41.921 --> 02:43:42.340
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>

6205
02:43:42.340 --> 02:43:42.581
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

6206
02:43:42.581 --> 02:43:42.671
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

6207
02:43:42.671 --> 02:43:43.830
<v Speaker 5>you got to get my coupons in chords.</v>

6208
02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:45.030
<v Speaker 5>So he got told them where to get it.</v>

6209
02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:45.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6210
02:43:45.210 --> 02:43:46.450
<v Speaker 5>I like those way better from now on.</v>

6211
02:43:46.510 --> 02:43:47.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6212
02:43:47.130 --> 02:43:52.130
<v Speaker 5>The only problem that I have is that we use the name death squad for all of us.</v>

6213
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:56.770
<v Speaker 5>And if you got a network that's death squad and then anyone who is on there</v>

6214
02:43:56.771 --> 02:44:01.771
<v Speaker 5>because it's one of those people and not necessarily the real death squad way to</v>

6215
02:44:02.261 --> 02:44:07.261
<v Speaker 5>do it is to do Joey's podcasts podcast,</v>

6216
02:44:07.300 --> 02:44:08.410
<v Speaker 5>to put it on a page somewhere.</v>

6217
02:44:09.550 --> 02:44:10.540
<v Speaker 5>We could put that if you,</v>

6218
02:44:10.541 --> 02:44:10.921
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

6219
02:44:10.921 --> 02:44:12.760
<v Speaker 5>if Brian one too offensive right now,</v>

6220
02:44:12.970 --> 02:44:14.830
<v Speaker 5>no one's saying anything bad because that makes no sense.</v>

6221
02:44:16.410 --> 02:44:16.930
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6222
02:44:16.930 --> 02:44:17.860
<v Speaker 5>it makes a lot of sense.</v>

6223
02:44:17.861 --> 02:44:18.670
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying?</v>

6224
02:44:18.670 --> 02:44:19.261
<v Speaker 5>I do a display.</v>

6225
02:44:19.261 --> 02:44:20.810
<v Speaker 5>It's a 100% clear on what you're doing,</v>

6226
02:44:20.811 --> 02:44:23.080
<v Speaker 5>like it's being attacked and people on,</v>

6227
02:44:23.170 --> 02:44:24.850
<v Speaker 5>and I think you're doing the same thing because,</v>

6228
02:44:24.851 --> 02:44:26.620
<v Speaker 5>because what it is is I'm doing the same thing.</v>

6229
02:44:26.620 --> 02:44:26.921
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

6230
02:44:26.921 --> 02:44:28.090
<v Speaker 5>Because what I'm doing is you're,</v>

6231
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:31.860
<v Speaker 5>you're pretty much saying the real reason to do a podcast network like,</v>

6232
02:44:31.861 --> 02:44:33.490
<v Speaker 5>like I'm not doing a real reason,</v>

6233
02:44:33.491 --> 02:44:36.760
<v Speaker 5>a way to do it just because I'm using the words I'm saying.</v>

6234
02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:39.630
<v Speaker 5>The right way to call it desk won.</v>

6235
02:44:39.790 --> 02:44:41.830
<v Speaker 5>It should not just be the shows that you're in.</v>

6236
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:43.060
<v Speaker 5>It should be all of us.</v>

6237
02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:44.650
<v Speaker 5>It desk squad is a bunch of friends,</v>

6238
02:44:44.651 --> 02:44:45.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6239
02:44:45.130 --> 02:44:46.240
<v Speaker 5>All these people that we have,</v>

6240
02:44:46.250 --> 02:44:47.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing all these shows.</v>

6241
02:44:47.201 --> 02:44:48.100
<v Speaker 5>I've been on the road with you,</v>

6242
02:44:48.101 --> 02:44:48.371
<v Speaker 5>Sam.</v>

6243
02:44:48.371 --> 02:44:49.540
<v Speaker 5>Aaa has been on the road with you.</v>

6244
02:44:49.541 --> 02:44:50.374
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

6245
02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:51.610
<v Speaker 5>Stop it.</v>

6246
02:44:51.610 --> 02:44:53.700
<v Speaker 5>You're not killing people that have been on the road with Pamela loss.</v>

6247
02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:54.553
<v Speaker 5>Not what you're doing.</v>

6248
02:44:54.570 --> 02:44:54.810
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

6249
02:44:54.810 --> 02:44:55.840
<v Speaker 5>you've got a bunch of pillows.</v>

6250
02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:57.970
<v Speaker 5>Even know who these people are talking about.</v>

6251
02:44:57.971 --> 02:44:58.960
<v Speaker 5>The host of the show up right in a while.</v>

6252
02:44:58.970 --> 02:45:00.130
<v Speaker 5>She used to take some else on the right,</v>

6253
02:45:00.131 --> 02:45:00.420
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

6254
02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:02.590
<v Speaker 5>Some of them bring you want to consider and being in the death squad,</v>

6255
02:45:02.650 --> 02:45:03.021
<v Speaker 5>Brian?</v>

6256
02:45:03.021 --> 02:45:03.760
<v Speaker 5>Some of them,</v>

6257
02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:04.301
<v Speaker 5>some of them,</v>

6258
02:45:04.301 --> 02:45:05.051
<v Speaker 5>some of them not.</v>

6259
02:45:05.051 --> 02:45:05.884
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6260
02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:07.960
<v Speaker 5>come on all that shit.</v>

6261
02:45:08.170 --> 02:45:09.130
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of them.</v>

6262
02:45:09.131 --> 02:45:09.851
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to name names.</v>

6263
02:45:09.851 --> 02:45:11.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to criticize anybody I know,</v>

6264
02:45:11.321 --> 02:45:12.760
<v Speaker 5>but every person is a guest on the show.</v>

6265
02:45:12.761 --> 02:45:14.690
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't consider it beyond a desk squad would you</v>

6266
02:45:16.210 --> 02:45:18.610
<v Speaker 5>like if you have a person that's on your show as a guest,</v>

6267
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:19.481
<v Speaker 5>there's a big difference.</v>

6268
02:45:19.481 --> 02:45:21.910
<v Speaker 5>She didn't happen to someone on its guest is how it's someone who you're doing a</v>

6269
02:45:21.911 --> 02:45:24.490
<v Speaker 5>show with them and then you're calling it desk squat and you're putting it on a</v>

6270
02:45:24.491 --> 02:45:25.324
<v Speaker 5>network.</v>

6271
02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:29.380
<v Speaker 5>You essentially have taken over that name and use it for your own stuff.</v>

6272
02:45:29.650 --> 02:45:30.600
<v Speaker 5>It's just squad.</v>

6273
02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:31.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm not desk squad.</v>

6274
02:45:32.410 --> 02:45:33.520
<v Speaker 5>You're on everyone that does squad.</v>

6275
02:45:33.580 --> 02:45:36.700
<v Speaker 5>All of us are a desk while you were on every one of them because I produce every</v>

6276
02:45:36.701 --> 02:45:37.330
<v Speaker 5>single show on that.</v>

6277
02:45:37.330 --> 02:45:37.631
<v Speaker 5>That's why.</v>

6278
02:45:37.631 --> 02:45:38.440
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

6279
02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:43.440
<v Speaker 5>but do you not see that that is like that is like you are sort of 90% of the</v>

6280
02:45:43.901 --> 02:45:46.960
<v Speaker 5>shows like I probably talk about 10% of the time.</v>

6281
02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.610
<v Speaker 5>It's usually,</v>

6282
02:45:48.610 --> 02:45:50.590
<v Speaker 5>it's more of a same thing.</v>

6283
02:45:50.591 --> 02:45:51.850
<v Speaker 5>If he listened to Howard Stern,</v>

6284
02:45:51.851 --> 02:45:54.370
<v Speaker 5>if he listened to any of the shows that have producers like Iraq or anything</v>

6285
02:45:54.371 --> 02:45:54.820
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

6286
02:45:54.820 --> 02:45:55.511
<v Speaker 5>that's a normal thing,</v>

6287
02:45:55.511 --> 02:45:55.900
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

6288
02:45:55.900 --> 02:45:56.141
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

6289
02:45:56.141 --> 02:45:57.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with what you're doing.</v>

6290
02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:58.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that at all.</v>

6291
02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:00.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm not criticizing you.</v>

6292
02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:04.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that to call it to death squad is kind of weird because the</v>

6293
02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:04.721
<v Speaker 5>desk,</v>

6294
02:46:04.721 --> 02:46:05.411
<v Speaker 5>what it's supposed to be,</v>

6295
02:46:05.411 --> 02:46:05.951
<v Speaker 5>all of us,</v>

6296
02:46:05.951 --> 02:46:09.010
<v Speaker 5>and most of the people that are in the dusk squad aren't on the desk.</v>

6297
02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:09.321
<v Speaker 5>Squad.</v>

6298
02:46:09.321 --> 02:46:09.561
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

6299
02:46:09.561 --> 02:46:10.670
<v Speaker 5>T so</v>

6300
02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:13.950
<v Speaker 1>if one of you other guys did something with a desktop game,</v>

6301
02:46:14.540 --> 02:46:15.320
<v Speaker 1>then go for it.</v>

6302
02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:16.131
<v Speaker 1>I was the first one.</v>

6303
02:46:16.131 --> 02:46:16.371
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6304
02:46:16.371 --> 02:46:16.611
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

6305
02:46:16.611 --> 02:46:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to make a collection of shows and call it death squad cars.</v>

6306
02:46:19.251 --> 02:46:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Obese said at one time,</v>

6307
02:46:20.241 --> 02:46:20.960
<v Speaker 1>and it was funny.</v>

6308
02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6309
02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:23.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the that you don't do,</v>

6310
02:46:23.001 --> 02:46:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

6311
02:46:23.450 --> 02:46:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Well you be death squads a little different to you,</v>

6312
02:46:25.730 --> 02:46:28.470
<v Speaker 1>like you feel it's like the four people that was in the room.</v>

6313
02:46:28.471 --> 02:46:29.304
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>

6314
02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I feel it's family.</v>

6315
02:46:30.411 --> 02:46:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It's all the people that were family and I think it's a lot of people that you</v>

6316
02:46:33.651 --> 02:46:34.120
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

6317
02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:34.361
<v Speaker 1>whether you,</v>

6318
02:46:34.361 --> 02:46:35.060
<v Speaker 1>they asked me,</v>

6319
02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:35.893
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do this.</v>

6320
02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Hold on girls.</v>

6321
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:38.361
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

6322
02:46:38.361 --> 02:46:39.081
<v Speaker 1>And Brian Keeley,</v>

6323
02:46:39.081 --> 02:46:39.920

6324
02:46:40.130 --> 02:46:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Dan Dumas and very nice girl.</v>

6325
02:46:41.541 --> 02:46:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Those people aren't your family.</v>

6326
02:46:43.050 --> 02:46:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6327
02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:44.880
<v Speaker 1>we were shown up.</v>

6328
02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:46.970
<v Speaker 1>They're friends of mine that can meet their friends with you.</v>

6329
02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:50.293
<v Speaker 1>She's a nice girl.</v>

6330
02:46:50.390 --> 02:46:52.550
<v Speaker 1>She's not my federal on this podcast I have,</v>

6331
02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:53.593
<v Speaker 1>what does the question,</v>

6332
02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:53.871
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

6333
02:46:53.871 --> 02:46:55.580
<v Speaker 1>just to put a lot of people we've had on this podcast,</v>

6334
02:46:55.730 --> 02:46:58.550
<v Speaker 1>but you're acting like a tree house and you're like,</v>

6335
02:46:58.551 --> 02:47:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed in this tree house.</v>

6336
02:47:00.140 --> 02:47:00.741
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

6337
02:47:00.741 --> 02:47:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying you're calling it desk.</v>

6338
02:47:02.091 --> 02:47:02.241
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

6339
02:47:02.241 --> 02:47:04.630
<v Speaker 1>When death squad is us desk was us as friends,</v>

6340
02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6341
02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:07.100
<v Speaker 1>tagging all the people that were hanging out together.</v>

6342
02:47:07.101 --> 02:47:07.934
<v Speaker 1>And that group,</v>

6343
02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:08.420
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>

6344
02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:09.340
<v Speaker 1>there was not the whole desk.</v>

6345
02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:12.830
<v Speaker 1>It'll be called us desk squad.</v>

6346
02:47:13.250 --> 02:47:16.700
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying Joe d is this because this is,</v>

6347
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:17.421
<v Speaker 1>Joey does not.</v>

6348
02:47:17.421 --> 02:47:18.820
<v Speaker 1>One of my best friends is Joey Diaz.</v>

6349
02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Not Constantly on the road with us when we w is Joey d is not the one who uses</v>

6350
02:47:22.281 --> 02:47:23.150
<v Speaker 1>it more than anybody.</v>

6351
02:47:23.270 --> 02:47:24.770
<v Speaker 1>He was the one who actually started calling.</v>

6352
02:47:24.771 --> 02:47:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does squad.</v>

6353
02:47:25.610 --> 02:47:26.720
<v Speaker 1>He's the one who ran with it.</v>

6354
02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:28.130
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was hilarious.</v>

6355
02:47:28.131 --> 02:47:30.890
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously some heat here then because you were really having a problem</v>

6356
02:47:30.891 --> 02:47:31.660
<v Speaker 1>with me using the name.</v>

6357
02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Not even a problem at all.</v>

6358
02:47:33.270 --> 02:47:38.270
<v Speaker 1>All had a radio station at night and we were all talking about and I just</v>

6359
02:47:38.391 --> 02:47:40.220
<v Speaker 1>happened to start calling something desk squad.</v>

6360
02:47:40.221 --> 02:47:41.120
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that I'm like,</v>

6361
02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:41.391
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6362
02:47:41.391 --> 02:47:44.060
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about me and it's all me and I'm deaf squad and that's what I</v>

6363
02:47:44.061 --> 02:47:44.450
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

6364
02:47:44.450 --> 02:47:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that I used a term that we all use and I bought a domain and</v>

6365
02:47:47.961 --> 02:47:49.670
<v Speaker 1>started doing a podcast for you.</v>

6366
02:47:49.671 --> 02:47:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Started doing a podcast and started calling the show's death squad car gas</v>

6367
02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:54.250
<v Speaker 1>networks.</v>

6368
02:47:54.250 --> 02:47:55.910
<v Speaker 1>So you have essentially hijack the name,</v>

6369
02:47:56.850 --> 02:47:57.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6370
02:47:57.390 --> 02:47:59.080
<v Speaker 1>taking the name for your own lightweight,</v>

6371
02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:01.580
<v Speaker 1>that name desk while you're taking it for your own network.</v>

6372
02:48:01.730 --> 02:48:02.563
<v Speaker 1>The net with a name.</v>

6373
02:48:02.750 --> 02:48:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Why not saying you aren't?</v>

6374
02:48:05.211 --> 02:48:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying if it really was desk won,</v>

6375
02:48:07.100 --> 02:48:08.720
<v Speaker 1>you would have so sorry on that.</v>

6376
02:48:08.930 --> 02:48:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I have big links to all the people that you're not profiting from as well.</v>

6377
02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:13.641
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>

6378
02:48:13.641 --> 02:48:17.300
<v Speaker 1>if I created a podcast network and called it powerful,</v>

6379
02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:20.120
<v Speaker 1>are you saying that that wasn't what would then be allowed to do that?</v>

6380
02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:23.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a big difference between a whole group of people that call themselves death</v>

6381
02:48:23.131 --> 02:48:23.690
<v Speaker 1>squad.</v>

6382
02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:26.030
<v Speaker 1>We've been calling ourselves death squad for like almost a decade,</v>

6383
02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:29.470
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden a podcast comes along and you call this podcast that</v>

6384
02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:33.220
<v Speaker 1>domain 2007 does mean Brian,</v>

6385
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.810
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

6386
02:48:33.810 --> 02:48:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Just because you bought the domain,</v>

6387
02:48:34.941 --> 02:48:37.130
<v Speaker 1>didn't we call ourselves that before you bought the domain?</v>

6388
02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6389
02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.140
<v Speaker 1>So we call ourselves a lot of things,</v>

6390
02:48:39.141 --> 02:48:39.480
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

6391
02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.850
<v Speaker 1>does that mean I'm not allowed to say,</v>

6392
02:48:40.851 --> 02:48:41.061
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

6393
02:48:41.061 --> 02:48:43.010
<v Speaker 1>I might use that as a name for a podcast,</v>

6394
02:48:43.011 --> 02:48:44.330
<v Speaker 1>that workout all you guys,</v>

6395
02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't even believe that you don't see another side of this.</v>

6396
02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I see what you're saying,</v>

6397
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:53.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of funny that I've been doing it since 2007 and now you're just</v>

6398
02:48:53.181 --> 02:48:58.181
<v Speaker 1>making it so [inaudible] is that it just be all of us included,</v>

6399
02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:01.353
<v Speaker 1>the guys,</v>

6400
02:49:01.370 --> 02:49:06.320
<v Speaker 1>the guys that aren't in a podcast network don't profit from it,</v>

6401
02:49:06.321 --> 02:49:07.890
<v Speaker 1>and he's not saying you've done something specific.</v>

6402
02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

6403
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:08.911
<v Speaker 1>Listen for a second.</v>

6404
02:49:08.911 --> 02:49:09.631
<v Speaker 1>Is that something you'd done?</v>

6405
02:49:09.631 --> 02:49:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Anything specifically wrong?</v>

6406
02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I know you knew I was gonna say that.</v>

6407
02:49:12.660 --> 02:49:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say that</v>

6408
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.983
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

6409
02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I know he's not saying you'd done anything specifically wrong.</v>

6410
02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:21.413
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>

6411
02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:26.370
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be nice to have built a page or in the future to build a page to</v>

6412
02:49:26.371 --> 02:49:27.204
<v Speaker 1>include the people</v>

6413
02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:30.030
<v Speaker 1>in that group to begin with?</v>

6414
02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:30.893
<v Speaker 1>It should.</v>

6415
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:34.050
<v Speaker 1>It should be all of us.</v>

6416
02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:35.100
<v Speaker 1>It should be Joey Diaz.</v>

6417
02:49:35.130 --> 02:49:35.941
<v Speaker 1>It should be Duncan.</v>

6418
02:49:35.941 --> 02:49:37.560
<v Speaker 1>It should be people that have never been in the pocket.</v>

6419
02:49:37.570 --> 02:49:38.341
<v Speaker 1>There we go right there.</v>

6420
02:49:38.341 --> 02:49:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

6421
02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:41.160
<v Speaker 1>because that who does this?</v>

6422
02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Who does that gets to choose to design it?</v>

6423
02:49:43.591 --> 02:49:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Because like you said some you might,</v>

6424
02:49:46.050 --> 02:49:46.883
<v Speaker 1>how about I'll choose.</v>

6425
02:49:46.980 --> 02:49:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6426
02:49:47.380 --> 02:49:48.080
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>

6427
02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

6428
02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Why shouldn't death squad?</v>

6429
02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:51.413
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you this</v>

6430
02:49:53.490 --> 02:49:54.810
<v Speaker 1>because I'm going to treat it fairly.</v>

6431
02:49:54.910 --> 02:49:55.350
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>

6432
02:49:55.350 --> 02:49:56.183
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm gonna</v>

6433
02:49:57.470 --> 02:49:58.490
<v Speaker 1>tell me how I'm not.</v>

6434
02:49:58.530 --> 02:50:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Because there's somebody that you might want on there that I might not want on</v>

6435
02:50:01.711 --> 02:50:04.800
<v Speaker 1>there and there might be something on you don't think Dunkin deserves to be in</v>

6436
02:50:04.801 --> 02:50:06.360
<v Speaker 1>because you and him and having an argument,</v>

6437
02:50:06.690 --> 02:50:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't think the Dunkin deserves to be part of desk squad.</v>

6438
02:50:08.700 --> 02:50:10.440
<v Speaker 1>He's told me before.</v>

6439
02:50:10.441 --> 02:50:11.020
<v Speaker 1>But you were,</v>

6440
02:50:11.020 --> 02:50:15.480
<v Speaker 1>there were arguments at the bar when you were the argument cames from Dunkin</v>

6441
02:50:15.481 --> 02:50:19.290
<v Speaker 1>getting upset at Brian when we were in Atlanta was saying the Brian doesn't pay</v>

6442
02:50:19.291 --> 02:50:22.740
<v Speaker 1>the comedians when he charges money for the shows at the ice house and then it</v>

6443
02:50:22.741 --> 02:50:23.230
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>

6444
02:50:23.230 --> 02:50:24.063
<v Speaker 1>you should put it up.</v>

6445
02:50:24.090 --> 02:50:24.510
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

6446
02:50:24.510 --> 02:50:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

6447
02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And he just didn't know.</v>

6448
02:50:25.981 --> 02:50:27.300
<v Speaker 1>You only paid the MCS.</v>

6449
02:50:27.390 --> 02:50:28.160
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

6450
02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:28.993
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6451
02:50:29.310 --> 02:50:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6452
02:50:29.730 --> 02:50:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I can draw it.</v>

6453
02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You should pay now or you're going to throw me under the bus too because you</v>

6454
02:50:32.701 --> 02:50:33.370
<v Speaker 1>have no idea anyway.</v>

6455
02:50:33.370 --> 02:50:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6456
02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:35.670
<v Speaker 1>If you started paying people recently,</v>

6457
02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:36.570
<v Speaker 1>this is a different thing.</v>

6458
02:50:37.050 --> 02:50:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Don't turn off Bro.</v>

6459
02:50:37.891 --> 02:50:41.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't recapture this again because when you don't raise your voice and don't</v>

6460
02:50:41.761 --> 02:50:42.594
<v Speaker 1>get crazy,</v>

6461
02:50:44.170 --> 02:50:44.671
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

6462
02:50:44.671 --> 02:50:47.160
<v Speaker 1>let me explain that John can shouldn't have done what he did.</v>

6463
02:50:48.470 --> 02:50:50.090
<v Speaker 1>He threw me under a bus.</v>

6464
02:50:50.470 --> 02:50:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Brian me drunk.</v>

6465
02:50:51.451 --> 02:50:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Even though I had a beer and a red bull is not an insult.</v>

6466
02:50:53.791 --> 02:50:54.900
<v Speaker 1>So he's also just fucking,</v>

6467
02:50:54.901 --> 02:50:55.681
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't correct.</v>

6468
02:50:55.681 --> 02:50:56.580
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to diminish,</v>

6469
02:50:56.840 --> 02:50:58.450
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to attack me on,</v>

6470
02:50:58.490 --> 02:50:59.323
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

6471
02:50:59.510 --> 02:51:00.001
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

6472
02:51:00.001 --> 02:51:01.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's a hard thing was discussed.</v>

6473
02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:02.371
<v Speaker 1>The problem,</v>

6474
02:51:02.371 --> 02:51:05.370
<v Speaker 1>what I happened and what he was getting at is we were talking about southwest by</v>

6475
02:51:05.371 --> 02:51:06.091
<v Speaker 1>southwest,</v>

6476
02:51:06.091 --> 02:51:07.160
<v Speaker 1>right south by southwest.</v>

6477
02:51:07.380 --> 02:51:10.770
<v Speaker 1>He does this video that where it says that southwest by southwest makes a</v>

6478
02:51:10.771 --> 02:51:11.521
<v Speaker 1>shitload of money,</v>

6479
02:51:11.521 --> 02:51:12.241
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's called.</v>

6480
02:51:12.241 --> 02:51:16.020
<v Speaker 1>And they don't pay people to come out there cause he was offered to come out</v>

6481
02:51:16.021 --> 02:51:17.040
<v Speaker 1>there and he didn't get paid.</v>

6482
02:51:17.430 --> 02:51:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And so what I had brought up is that I had been hearing that really it's all</v>

6483
02:51:23.401 --> 02:51:25.440
<v Speaker 1>about the venues like southwest by southwest.</v>

6484
02:51:25.441 --> 02:51:26.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like a blanket name,</v>

6485
02:51:26.401 --> 02:51:27.450
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a death squad.</v>

6486
02:51:27.600 --> 02:51:31.210
<v Speaker 1>And it's into each of the venues that,</v>

6487
02:51:31.270 --> 02:51:31.581
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

6488
02:51:31.581 --> 02:51:34.110
<v Speaker 1>that if they want you to come out and play their bar,</v>

6489
02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:35.340
<v Speaker 1>that they might pay you,</v>

6490
02:51:35.450 --> 02:51:35.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

6491
02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:39.780
<v Speaker 1>But southwest doesn't do anything to promote it as a big party,</v>

6492
02:51:39.930 --> 02:51:40.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6493
02:51:40.171 --> 02:51:40.550
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

6494
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:43.410
<v Speaker 1>they do advertising and promotions and stuff like that.</v>

6495
02:51:43.411 --> 02:51:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And then when I'm talking to Duncan made a video saying that they don't pay</v>

6496
02:51:46.351 --> 02:51:47.820
<v Speaker 1>anyone in and they steal from comics.</v>

6497
02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.360
<v Speaker 1>So what happened is I was talking to,</v>

6498
02:51:49.361 --> 02:51:50.101
<v Speaker 1>and I was explaining like,</v>

6499
02:51:50.101 --> 02:51:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

6500
02:51:50.251 --> 02:51:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I heard this and he goes,</v>

6501
02:51:51.151 --> 02:51:51.984
<v Speaker 1>you're drunk.</v>

6502
02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:52.531
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

6503
02:51:52.531 --> 02:51:52.891
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

6504
02:51:52.891 --> 02:51:53.131
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

6505
02:51:53.131 --> 02:51:57.600
<v Speaker 1>this is not your a really paraphrasing obviously obviously so,</v>

6506
02:51:57.690 --> 02:51:58.320
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

6507
02:51:58.320 --> 02:51:58.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6508
02:51:58.531 --> 02:52:00.370
<v Speaker 1>what then it turned into it that he's,</v>

6509
02:52:00.430 --> 02:52:03.000
<v Speaker 1>he said on a podcast you steal from comics.</v>

6510
02:52:03.270 --> 02:52:03.661
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

6511
02:52:03.661 --> 02:52:05.010
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

6514
02:52:06.871 --> 02:52:07.300
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

6519
02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:11.590

6532
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:34.511
<v Speaker 2>I and I,</v>

6533
02:52:34.511 --> 02:52:34.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6534
02:52:34.751 --> 02:52:35.584
<v Speaker 2>I spread it out.</v>

6535
02:52:36.220 --> 02:52:36.551
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

6536
02:52:36.551 --> 02:52:37.990
<v Speaker 2>those people have been grow more.</v>

6537
02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:39.190
<v Speaker 2>You've got to show that cash for people.</v>

6538
02:52:39.270 --> 02:52:39.511
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

6539
02:52:39.511 --> 02:52:40.344
<v Speaker 2>What do people,</v>

6540
02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving out there,</v>

6541
02:52:41.571 --> 02:52:42.520
<v Speaker 2>there's a cover charge home.</v>

6542
02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to put it.</v>

6543
02:52:43.180 --> 02:52:43.361
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

6544
02:52:43.361 --> 02:52:44.194
<v Speaker 2>Well here's an example.</v>

6545
02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:46.000
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to say names.</v>

6546
02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:47.490
<v Speaker 2>People are pissed.</v>

6547
02:52:47.490 --> 02:52:47.741
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

6548
02:52:47.741 --> 02:52:48.190
<v Speaker 2>well here's,</v>

6549
02:52:48.190 --> 02:52:48.481
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>

6550
02:52:48.481 --> 02:52:48.790
<v Speaker 2>here's what,</v>

6551
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:49.660
<v Speaker 2>a couple of reasons why.</v>

6552
02:52:49.720 --> 02:52:50.080
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

6553
02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:51.640
<v Speaker 2>because I don't get paid till the following week.</v>

6554
02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:55.090
<v Speaker 2>So anything I pay for that night is I have to go to an ATM,</v>

6555
02:52:55.091 --> 02:52:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I have to take out money and have to fucking go,</v>

6556
02:52:57.041 --> 02:52:57.400
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

6557
02:52:57.400 --> 02:52:59.770
<v Speaker 2>how much money did I make this sell out?</v>

6558
02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Then the following week usually,</v>

6559
02:53:02.370 --> 02:53:03.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6560
02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:03.670
<v Speaker 2>and so then,</v>

6561
02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:06.070
<v Speaker 2>so then I have to figure out how much money did I kind of make?</v>

6562
02:53:06.071 --> 02:53:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Did it sell out somewhere there?</v>

6563
02:53:07.180 --> 02:53:07.541
<v Speaker 2>The door,</v>

6564
02:53:07.541 --> 02:53:11.470
<v Speaker 2>look how much I could do that if I wasn't doing a live podcast at the same time.</v>

6565
02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:12.813
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

6566
02:53:12.930 --> 02:53:13.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6567
02:53:13.670 --> 02:53:14.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6568
02:53:14.270 --> 02:53:15.850
<v Speaker 2>and then I get tax and all of that.</v>

6569
02:53:15.851 --> 02:53:17.320
<v Speaker 2>So everything I make there,</v>

6570
02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:18.220
<v Speaker 2>which is not even the,</v>

6571
02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:18.401
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6572
02:53:18.401 --> 02:53:18.551
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6573
02:53:18.551 --> 02:53:19.181
<v Speaker 2>the door,</v>

6574
02:53:19.181 --> 02:53:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't get the full door.</v>

6575
02:53:20.020 --> 02:53:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I get like 60% of the door or something like that.</v>

6576
02:53:22.090 --> 02:53:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Then I get taxed on it so that,</v>

6577
02:53:23.931 --> 02:53:25.030
<v Speaker 2>that pretty much cuts in half.</v>

6578
02:53:25.180 --> 02:53:25.810
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm,</v>

6579
02:53:25.810 --> 02:53:30.670
<v Speaker 2>what my average is usually is it's about $200 to $300 I make on a show.</v>

6580
02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I usually spend about a hundred dollars,</v>

6581
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6582
02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:37.270
<v Speaker 2>giving it to the miscellaneous comics to $150,</v>

6583
02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:39.580
<v Speaker 2>and the other hundred $50 to me is like,</v>

6584
02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:39.911
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6585
02:53:39.911 --> 02:53:44.911
<v Speaker 2>now I could either not do the show or make $150 for booking a show,</v>

6586
02:53:45.881 --> 02:53:49.100
<v Speaker 2>advertising his show and producing the two bucks a ticket times.</v>

6587
02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:51.910
<v Speaker 2>And it's usually 15 when Joe does it and 10 when I do it.</v>

6588
02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:55.500
<v Speaker 2>But I give out so many free tickets and it's usually not one,</v>

6589
02:53:55.740 --> 02:53:56.110
<v Speaker 2>not one.</v>

6590
02:53:56.110 --> 02:53:56.441
<v Speaker 2>Joe Goes,</v>

6591
02:53:56.441 --> 02:53:58.050
<v Speaker 2>where do I give it out when Joe does it too?</v>

6592
02:53:58.810 --> 02:53:59.620
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to.</v>

6593
02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to usually,</v>

6594
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:01.543
<v Speaker 2>but usually,</v>

6595
02:54:02.470 --> 02:54:03.191
<v Speaker 2>but usually,</v>

6596
02:54:03.191 --> 02:54:03.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6597
02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:05.170
<v Speaker 2>but usually it's also give it away.</v>

6598
02:54:05.170 --> 02:54:06.003
<v Speaker 2>Free tickets.</v>

6599
02:54:06.690 --> 02:54:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Those are the common disorders.</v>

6600
02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I like the,</v>

6601
02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:09.640
<v Speaker 2>they split the main room,</v>

6602
02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:10.691
<v Speaker 2>just the one show,</v>

6603
02:54:10.691 --> 02:54:11.524
<v Speaker 2>but it's nice.</v>

6604
02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:12.281
<v Speaker 2>The main room,</v>

6605
02:54:12.281 --> 02:54:14.500
<v Speaker 2>half goes to the comedy store and half goes to the community.</v>

6606
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Let me say something.</v>

6607
02:54:16.390 --> 02:54:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Here's how you avoid all this.</v>

6608
02:54:17.930 --> 02:54:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Don't actually do this.</v>

6609
02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:20.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to do.</v>

6610
02:54:21.060 --> 02:54:22.570
<v Speaker 2>This is how you avoid all this forever.</v>

6611
02:54:22.870 --> 02:54:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Be infallibly generous,</v>

6612
02:54:26.590 --> 02:54:31.180
<v Speaker 2>be generous to the point where they can't infallibly do it to the point where</v>

6613
02:54:31.181 --> 02:54:32.200
<v Speaker 2>they can't argue against it.</v>

6614
02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:34.720
<v Speaker 2>The be generous to the point where you're not saying,</v>

6615
02:54:34.930 --> 02:54:35.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6616
02:54:35.321 --> 02:54:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6617
02:54:35.590 --> 02:54:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna make 150 bucks because I feel like I deserve it because what I do want</v>

6618
02:54:39.971 --> 02:54:40.290
<v Speaker 2>to do it,</v>

6619
02:54:40.290 --> 02:54:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

6620
02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:42.760
<v Speaker 2>You know what that makes me want to do not do it at all.</v>

6621
02:54:42.761 --> 02:54:44.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck cause that to me,</v>

6622
02:54:44.531 --> 02:54:45.360
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

6623
02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:46.690
<v Speaker 2>very defensive stance.</v>

6624
02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:48.070
<v Speaker 2>And especially when you're talking to me,</v>

6625
02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:51.790
<v Speaker 2>and then the reason that people are going to the show is because I'm headlining</v>

6626
02:54:51.791 --> 02:54:52.990
<v Speaker 2>and I'm promoting it on my Twitter.</v>

6627
02:54:53.050 --> 02:54:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Obviously not a bad thing,</v>

6628
02:54:55.691 --> 02:54:56.380
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6629
02:54:56.380 --> 02:54:57.400
<v Speaker 2>You should make some money.</v>

6630
02:54:57.430 --> 02:54:58.250
<v Speaker 2>You should make,</v>

6631
02:54:58.250 --> 02:54:58.600
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

6632
02:54:58.600 --> 02:54:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

6633
02:54:58.900 --> 02:54:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it for money.</v>

6634
02:54:59.741 --> 02:55:01.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anything to do with the money.</v>

6635
02:55:01.061 --> 02:55:03.620
<v Speaker 2>But I also don't want to do anything like that for free because consider that</v>

6636
02:55:03.621 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 2>work because</v>

6637
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:04.970
<v Speaker 3>then you're doing it for money.</v>

6638
02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:05.900
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to do it for free,</v>

6639
02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:06.720
<v Speaker 3>then you doing it right.</v>

6640
02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:08.270
<v Speaker 3>You should not change then.</v>

6641
02:55:08.300 --> 02:55:08.751
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

6642
02:55:08.751 --> 02:55:09.021
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

6643
02:55:09.021 --> 02:55:09.660
<v Speaker 3>listen you,</v>

6644
02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:09.940
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

6645
02:55:09.940 --> 02:55:11.310
<v Speaker 3>you're sounding like a little kid.</v>

6646
02:55:11.330 --> 02:55:13.550
<v Speaker 3>This is craziness because I'm not being mad at you at all.</v>

6647
02:55:13.900 --> 02:55:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Tagging on podcast,</v>

6648
02:55:15.171 --> 02:55:15.890
<v Speaker 3>we can,</v>

6649
02:55:15.890 --> 02:55:17.180
<v Speaker 3>no one hears attacking you,</v>

6650
02:55:17.181 --> 02:55:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

6651
02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:18.110
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

6652
02:55:18.110 --> 02:55:19.370
<v Speaker 3>you and I are friends.</v>

6653
02:55:19.371 --> 02:55:20.181
<v Speaker 3>We're like brothers.</v>

6654
02:55:20.181 --> 02:55:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

6655
02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:21.351
<v Speaker 3>Always like a brother.</v>

6656
02:55:21.351 --> 02:55:22.131
<v Speaker 3>We're all here together.</v>

6657
02:55:22.131 --> 02:55:22.964
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to talk,</v>

6658
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:25.910
<v Speaker 3>but you were like really triggers strung in.</v>

6659
02:55:25.911 --> 02:55:29.600
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons is because you feel like they're attacking you for his choice</v>

6660
02:55:29.601 --> 02:55:30.830
<v Speaker 3>and you're trying to defend this choice.</v>

6661
02:55:31.310 --> 02:55:35.840
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is the only reason why they even can attack you is because there</v>

6662
02:55:35.841 --> 02:55:39.340
<v Speaker 3>is a point of view that they're expressing that may be seven south by southwest,</v>

6663
02:55:39.370 --> 02:55:41.270
<v Speaker 3>but their version is this like,</v>

6664
02:55:41.271 --> 02:55:41.421
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6665
02:55:41.421 --> 02:55:41.451
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

6666
02:55:41.451 --> 02:55:42.171
<v Speaker 3>you should want to be here.</v>

6667
02:55:42.171 --> 02:55:43.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a really fun time and you're like,</v>

6668
02:55:43.431 --> 02:55:43.601
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

6669
02:55:43.601 --> 02:55:44.331
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to be there,</v>

6670
02:55:44.331 --> 02:55:47.810
<v Speaker 3>but it would also be nice to have the money you're collecting for the shows and</v>

6671
02:55:47.811 --> 02:55:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Austin would come to some of us who were going to shows.</v>

6672
02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.340
<v Speaker 3>I think there's good in having those shows there.</v>

6673
02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:53.990
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good for the comedy club.</v>

6674
02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good for that.</v>

6675
02:55:55.071 --> 02:55:55.461
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

6676
02:55:55.461 --> 02:55:58.160
<v Speaker 3>the comedians should be getting paid directly to the comedy clubs.</v>

6677
02:55:58.161 --> 02:55:58.994
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have,</v>

6678
02:55:59.550 --> 02:56:00.680
<v Speaker 2>you could easily do that.</v>

6679
02:56:01.010 --> 02:56:01.690
<v Speaker 2>We should that.</v>

6680
02:56:01.690 --> 02:56:04.200
<v Speaker 2>That's honestly to me.</v>

6681
02:56:04.201 --> 02:56:04.521
<v Speaker 2>And that's good,</v>

6682
02:56:04.521 --> 02:56:04.880
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

6683
02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Have them take each of their trucks to me.</v>

6684
02:56:06.541 --> 02:56:07.170
<v Speaker 2>In the past,</v>

6685
02:56:07.170 --> 02:56:07.711
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

6686
02:56:07.711 --> 02:56:08.550
<v Speaker 2>it was more like,</v>

6687
02:56:08.551 --> 02:56:09.150
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

6688
02:56:09.150 --> 02:56:10.680
<v Speaker 2>This isn't how it should be,</v>

6689
02:56:10.681 --> 02:56:13.030
<v Speaker 2>but right now I'm too busy to fucking sit down,</v>

6690
02:56:13.070 --> 02:56:14.730
<v Speaker 2>renegotiate this thing that we started.</v>

6691
02:56:14.731 --> 02:56:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6692
02:56:14.930 --> 02:56:15.721
<v Speaker 2>well that's honest.</v>

6693
02:56:15.721 --> 02:56:16.620
<v Speaker 2>That's very honest of it.</v>

6694
02:56:16.710 --> 02:56:18.390
<v Speaker 2>And I never did not.</v>

6695
02:56:18.450 --> 02:56:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I've never not paid anyone on a show.</v>

6696
02:56:21.541 --> 02:56:23.340
<v Speaker 2>It meaning there was never a show where I didn't pay anybody.</v>

6697
02:56:24.170 --> 02:56:24.471
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

6698
02:56:24.471 --> 02:56:25.850
<v Speaker 3>when you get really mad at something,</v>

6699
02:56:25.851 --> 02:56:26.870
<v Speaker 3>that's because people are right,</v>

6700
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:28.760
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't mean that you're a bad person.</v>

6701
02:56:28.761 --> 02:56:30.140
<v Speaker 3>It means they might have a point.</v>

6702
02:56:31.420 --> 02:56:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Not all of our actions.</v>

6703
02:56:32.501 --> 02:56:36.070
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I pissed off at this or were originally pissed off of me because</v>

6704
02:56:36.071 --> 02:56:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I first heard of that,</v>

6705
02:56:38.370 --> 02:56:42.340
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things I did was Dunkin did this and it did it on a live</v>

6706
02:56:42.341 --> 02:56:43.174
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

6707
02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:44.770
<v Speaker 2>He blind side of me.</v>

6708
02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:46.750
<v Speaker 2>And while if you went to death squad.</v>

6709
02:56:46.751 --> 02:56:46.931
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

6710
02:56:46.931 --> 02:56:47.500
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>

6711
02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:50.680
<v Speaker 2>There was a huge fucking linkedin I did out of the own kindness of my heart.</v>

6712
02:56:50.681 --> 02:56:53.110
<v Speaker 2>He didn't ask me to talk to bias poster.</v>

6713
02:56:53.410 --> 02:56:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6714
02:56:53.810 --> 02:56:54.111
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

6715
02:56:54.111 --> 02:56:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you have this argument to bring up something else?</v>

6716
02:56:56.561 --> 02:56:57.730
<v Speaker 2>You've done a nice for a person.</v>

6717
02:56:58.050 --> 02:56:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Well then somehow,</v>

6718
02:56:59.700 --> 02:57:01.720
<v Speaker 2>so how dare you bring up this a argument.</v>

6719
02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:04.530
<v Speaker 2>I might say a separate org,</v>

6720
02:57:04.531 --> 02:57:04.991
<v Speaker 2>three minutes,</v>

6721
02:57:04.991 --> 02:57:06.760
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a very good point.</v>

6722
02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:07.181
<v Speaker 2>The only thing,</v>

6723
02:57:07.181 --> 02:57:09.700
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I would say that is because in the past I've done a lot for this</v>

6724
02:57:09.701 --> 02:57:10.451
<v Speaker 2>guy and he,</v>

6725
02:57:10.451 --> 02:57:11.890
<v Speaker 2>and instead of just like talking to me and going,</v>

6726
02:57:11.891 --> 02:57:12.041
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

6727
02:57:12.041 --> 02:57:13.060
<v Speaker 2>why don't you do this or die?</v>

6728
02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:14.980
<v Speaker 2>And I could explained this whole thing I just did to you.</v>

6729
02:57:14.981 --> 02:57:15.371
<v Speaker 2>And He'd be like,</v>

6730
02:57:15.371 --> 02:57:15.461
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6731
02:57:15.461 --> 02:57:16.250
<v Speaker 2>that kind of makes sense.</v>

6732
02:57:16.250 --> 02:57:16.791
<v Speaker 2>So let's just do it.</v>

6733
02:57:16.791 --> 02:57:17.471
<v Speaker 2>I'll slow down slow.</v>

6734
02:57:17.471 --> 02:57:18.101
<v Speaker 2>We have three minutes.</v>

6735
02:57:18.101 --> 02:57:18.661
<v Speaker 2>We have to end this.</v>

6736
02:57:18.661 --> 02:57:19.290
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

6737
02:57:19.290 --> 02:57:19.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6738
02:57:19.350 --> 02:57:19.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6739
02:57:19.470 --> 02:57:19.680
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

6740
02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

6741
02:57:20.070 --> 02:57:21.060
<v Speaker 3>we're going to end this part.</v>

6742
02:57:21.061 --> 02:57:23.850
<v Speaker 3>We're going to come back and wrap this up because this is too ridiculous.</v>

6743
02:57:24.030 --> 02:57:25.750
<v Speaker 3>We'll have a little part one and a part two.</v>

6744
02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:30.570
<v Speaker 3>So let's stop this portion of it and we'll come back with a very informal five</v>

6745
02:57:30.571 --> 02:57:31.404
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

6746
02:57:31.620 --> 02:57:32.453
<v Speaker 3>We'll take a little break,</v>

6747
02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:33.931
<v Speaker 3>but we need to,</v>

6748
02:57:33.931 --> 02:57:35.850
<v Speaker 3>we need to relax and calm us down cause this is,</v>

6749
02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:37.240
<v Speaker 3>this is really getting great.</v>

6750
02:57:38.130 --> 02:57:40.110
<v Speaker 3>That'll help elect to anything.</v>

6751
02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:41.490
<v Speaker 3>So let's pause it right now.</v>
