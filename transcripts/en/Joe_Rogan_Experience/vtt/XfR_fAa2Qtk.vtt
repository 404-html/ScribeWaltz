00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.380

<v Speaker 4>And then you would get like a guest spot on a real show and then you would start</v>

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 4>25 to $50 Mc spots where you were driving the headline or somewhere and you jump</v>

118
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 4>past all that shit because they would send you out to feature and the headliners</v>

119
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 4>couldn't follow you because you were out of your fucking mind.</v>

120
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

121
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you were nuts.</v>

122
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.851
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

123
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 4>and so they had to headline you.</v>

124
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 4>So you started working like the d rooms but headlining.</v>

125
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:26.501
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

126
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 4>so you started to get an hour together super fast.</v>

127
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

128
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 3>I had to sink or swim.</v>

129
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Those times when the regular would make agreements to steal each other's shit.</v>

130
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.503
<v Speaker 5>We were bombing.</v>

131
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.081
<v Speaker 5>Say,</v>

132
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:41.411
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 5>you got my whole act pick up there.</v>

134
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.260
<v Speaker 5>Feel free to just had.</v>

135
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 5>He would come back to that blow job jokes killed.</v>

136
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 5>If you go back to people that you might want to wait another three humble,</v>

137
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.800
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

138
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

139
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.780
<v Speaker 3>let the heat die out of that joke.</v>

140
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 3>It was fun for us because we knew we.</v>

141
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Neither one of us should.</v>

142
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.650
<v Speaker 3>There was a point in time where both of us were doing like middling gigs and we</v>

143
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 3>really didn't have the time.</v>

144
00:04:05.031 --> 00:04:07.340
<v Speaker 3>We really didn't have a real solid half hour.</v>

145
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's sometimes you just,</v>

146
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

147
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.700
<v Speaker 3>when you're a young comic and you slip in the beginning of your set,</v>

148
00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 3>like the odds of you pulling yourself out of the firearm.</v>

149
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.093
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

150
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 3>I remember one time I was having a good set and I knocked over a drink and I</v>

151
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.290
<v Speaker 3>didn't address it.</v>

152
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.491
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

153
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:24.230
<v Speaker 3>it was turned on me.</v>

154
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.630
<v Speaker 3>They smell blood.</v>

155
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.980
<v Speaker 3>They knew I was scared.</v>

156
00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 3>They knew I was.</v>

157
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 3>I was killing it.</v>

158
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

159
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.220
<v Speaker 4>there it's all about their uncomfort and you denied.</v>

160
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.400
<v Speaker 4>I remember being on this was probably the cruelest thing anybody ever did to me.</v>

161
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.263
<v Speaker 4>What else on stage?</v>

162
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.200
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

163
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

164
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.820
<v Speaker 4>half filled room back.</v>

165
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:43.550
<v Speaker 4>It was always like the back of a Chinese restaurant where they had a banquet</v>

166
00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:48.551
<v Speaker 4>room that they just put a microphone up and call it a comedy night and I'm up</v>

167
00:04:48.561 --> 00:04:51.440
<v Speaker 4>there tanking it and I'm not acknowledging that I'm tanking it.</v>

168
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.350
<v Speaker 4>And during one of the silences that should've had laughed,</v>

169
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:55.670
<v Speaker 4>rented after one of my jokes,</v>

170
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 4>I heard this middle aged woman whispered to her husband,</v>

171
00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:00.290
<v Speaker 4>I could hear a whisper and she just goes,</v>

172
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.070
<v Speaker 4>they'll pull best.</v>

173
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

174
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.190
<v Speaker 3>worse than any heckle.</v>

175
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.353
<v Speaker 3>Oh</v>

176
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.333
<v Speaker 3>Geez.</v>

177
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.220
<v Speaker 3>It would be real hard when we'd watch each other.</v>

178
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.521
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

179
00:05:19.521 --> 00:05:22.250
<v Speaker 3>your watch a friend eat dick in the beginning too,</v>

180
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 3>because you know how devastating you know,</v>

181
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.690
<v Speaker 3>there's some times where you know,</v>

182
00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:29.960
<v Speaker 3>this guy is not going to pull himself out of this and he has 15 more minutes to</v>

183
00:05:29.961 --> 00:05:30.794
<v Speaker 3>go</v>

184
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.901
<v Speaker 3>watch them,</v>

185
00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:34.340
<v Speaker 3>slosh through it up there.</v>

186
00:05:34.341 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Is there a way out of it?</v>

187
00:05:35.271 --> 00:05:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you.</v>

188
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.320
<v Speaker 3>What do you have to do?</v>

189
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.531
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

190
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:38.180
<v Speaker 3>do you just have to stop?</v>

191
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Or did he just materials?</v>

192
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.280
<v Speaker 3>That's where we come in.</v>

193
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 3>That's where we'd steal a great job.</v>

194
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 4>I knew that they were grenades that I had in my waistband that were jealous that</v>

195
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.550
<v Speaker 4>they would just take the fucking top off and lob it.</v>

196
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 4>And you're back in the game.</v>

197
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.031
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

198
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like we would help each other.</v>

199
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 3>There was a time where I was headlining where I no fucking business headline and</v>

200
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 3>there was no way.</v>

201
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I barely had 40 minutes and they were letting me headline these rooms and I</v>

202
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 3>would have to stretch it all out and if something went wrong it went wrong.</v>

203
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Hard.</v>

204
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 3>That's there's no better motivation to creating new material than when you just.</v>

205
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Those shows happen and you just fucking have to get to a work.</v>

206
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Like you need more weapons.</v>

207
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:18.111
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

208
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 3>You went on a weapons too quick,</v>

209
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 3>you're up there dying.</v>

210
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

211
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.700
<v Speaker 4>especially like you can do the hour when it's going well,</v>

212
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.490
<v Speaker 4>you can take that one bit and you can stretch it out,</v>

213
00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:27.390
<v Speaker 4>add shit to it.</v>

214
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:27.561
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

215
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:27.801
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

216
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:31.590
<v Speaker 4>you're doing improvisational jazz and that our fills out when they're not</v>

217
00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:32.070
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>

218
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.930
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden it's like concentrate.</v>

219
00:06:33.931 --> 00:06:38.400
<v Speaker 4>Everything shrinks down and now what you had as 35 minutes,</v>

220
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.760
<v Speaker 4>he just ripped through and 17 and now you're scared.</v>

221
00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:45.550
<v Speaker 4>So you're tense and then you got nowhere to go except the crowd.</v>

222
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:46.860
<v Speaker 4>So you start fucking with a craft.</v>

223
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.791
<v Speaker 4>They don't like you.</v>

224
00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:48.481
<v Speaker 4>Now did that.</v>

225
00:06:48.481 --> 00:06:48.691
<v Speaker 4>They ended.</v>

226
00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:49.524
<v Speaker 4>They don't like you.</v>

227
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.330
<v Speaker 4>You're not making them comfortable,</v>

228
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.470
<v Speaker 4>so there's not like a nice flow of energy and so yeah,</v>

229
00:06:55.471 --> 00:06:57.240
<v Speaker 4>the early can feel it.</v>

230
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.620
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about Boston is,</v>

231
00:06:58.621 --> 00:07:00.280
<v Speaker 4>and I think it was kind of unique to a lot of,</v>

232
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

233
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.491
<v Speaker 4>common other companies,</v>

234
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.580
<v Speaker 4>cities is it,</v>

235
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.680
<v Speaker 4>it is a punchline town.</v>

236
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.970
<v Speaker 4>It's Bam,</v>

237
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.540
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

238
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.021
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

239
00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:07.440
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

240
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.711
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

241
00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:09.690
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to see something esoteric.</v>

242
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:11.220
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to see a storyteller.</v>

243
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.970
<v Speaker 4>They want you to grab them and just smack them around and then walk off stage</v>

244
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:15.840
<v Speaker 4>with your hands in the air.</v>

245
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

246
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:16.330
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

247
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 3>there were guys that were doing it that we're so good at the best.</v>

248
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 3>We came up with an error where,</v>

249
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

250
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this 100 times on the podcast and people always go,</v>

251
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:25.511
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

252
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:25.721
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

253
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

254
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.331
<v Speaker 3>We know.</v>

255
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 3>They were really good comedians back then.</v>

256
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people even understand what a,</v>

257
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 3>what a.</v>

258
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 3>It was like a utopia.</v>

259
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Boston was like this standup comedy utopia.</v>

260
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 3>There was one point in time,</v>

261
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 3>there was five clubs in a tiny little area,</v>

262
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.720
<v Speaker 4>seven nights a week club.</v>

263
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.860
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

264
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.640
<v Speaker 4>there was just that one block of warranty warranty.</v>

265
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.340
<v Speaker 4>It was nick's comedy stop and then there was duck soup and there was a common</v>

266
00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 4>connection and then Mike,</v>

267
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Mike Clark had the comedy club and the Charles playhouse above the company.</v>

268
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.990
<v Speaker 4>And then on the weekends you cut over to Dick dirties,</v>

269
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.843
<v Speaker 4>comedy vault,</v>

270
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.000
<v Speaker 4>50 yards away,</v>

271
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.963
<v Speaker 4>craziness.</v>

272
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.340
<v Speaker 4>And then you get in your car.</v>

273
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 4>He drove down the stitches on common APP.</v>

274
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:03.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like Holy Shit.</v>

275
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.840
<v Speaker 4>And the best part really was,</v>

276
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

277
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.400
<v Speaker 4>and those were for short sets.</v>

278
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:07.170

279

<v Speaker 4>seven minutes with a big clubs.</v>

280
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.521
<v Speaker 4>Those were the big ones.</v>

281
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:10.750
<v Speaker 4>But then you and I would get,</v>

282
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.640
<v Speaker 4>and this is the thing people don't get today,</v>

283
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.590
<v Speaker 4>is that we would get it for a year.</v>

284
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.480
<v Speaker 4>We get either you get my car,</v>

285
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:17.051

287
00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:21.790
<v Speaker 4>20 minute set for free all the time.</v>

288
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Then we go to Hartford one night,</v>

289
00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:24.370
<v Speaker 4>then we'd go to worcester one night,</v>

290
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:27.370
<v Speaker 4>then we go to Maine one night we would go anywhere.</v>

291
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:29.170
<v Speaker 4>They'd give especially a longer set.</v>

292
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.131
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

293
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:30.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

294
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:34.360
<v Speaker 4>we were lucky enough to come up in a time where the word comedy in front of a</v>

295
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:35.890
<v Speaker 4>place drew a crowd.</v>

296
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.140
<v Speaker 4>You didn't need to have a big name.</v>

297
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.880
<v Speaker 4>They just were comedy crazy and we just happened to be dropped in the middle of</v>

298
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:45.880
<v Speaker 4>it in a city that was a closed system.</v>

299
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.130
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have headliners come in from out of town.</v>

300
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.300
<v Speaker 4>So the local,</v>

301
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:54.170
<v Speaker 4>there were four or five big local headliners that drew and the and the and the</v>

302
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 4>club's otherwise only booked based on.</v>

303
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Do you crush?</v>

304
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.471
<v Speaker 4>Are you funny?</v>

305
00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Are you original?</v>

306
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 4>So it was a meritocracy.</v>

307
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

308
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.730
<v Speaker 3>And no one ever thought they were going to get famous.</v>

309
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.230
<v Speaker 4>What career?</v>

310
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.820
<v Speaker 4>If someone used the word career,</v>

311
00:09:06.821 --> 00:09:08.200
<v Speaker 4>people would have looked at them confused.</v>

312
00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:08.351
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

313
00:09:08.351 --> 00:09:09.184
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

314
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.820
<v Speaker 3>All anyone wanted to do was become a big Boston comic.</v>

315
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like the fame that you wanted was just the being accepted amongst your</v>

316
00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:18.770
<v Speaker 3>peers and having crowds coming to see you.</v>

317
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.720
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

318
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.170
<v Speaker 4>That's what everybody expect to see you,</v>

319
00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:22.580
<v Speaker 4>I think wasn't until later.</v>

320
00:09:22.581 --> 00:09:23.960
<v Speaker 4>I think for us it was just,</v>

321
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.303
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

322
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.761
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

323
00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:29.720
<v Speaker 4>you know when your first fucking a girl and you can't believe she's letting you</v>

324
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:32.270
<v Speaker 4>fuck her after jerking off for three straight years.</v>

325
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.910
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was like when I was doing standup in Boston.</v>

326
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:40.150
<v Speaker 4>They're allowing me these stages that I've watched since I was a teenager in all</v>

327
00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:40.670
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

328
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm on it and they're letting me talk.</v>

329
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.633
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

330
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.623
<v Speaker 4>That's all I needed.</v>

331
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.271
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

332
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 3>one of the first guys I ever saw do a live set was tom cotter.</v>

333
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cod is one of the first guys.</v>

334
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 3>He's a buddy from Boston is a great guy and he was in like some sort of a.</v>

335
00:09:56.821 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 3>The first time I ever went on some sort of an open mic night and he was like the</v>

336
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 3>first guy that ever went on stage.</v>

337
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

338
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>

339
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:05.551
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>

340
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 4>He was like a not,</v>

341
00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 4>he had started maybe two years ahead of us.</v>

342
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.893
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>

343
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 3>he always used to bum me out and the reason we used to bum me out because he was</v>

344
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 3>so fucking funny to hang out with,</v>

345
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 3>but he wanted to take it down a notch and he wanted to like,</v>

346
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

347
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.220
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

348
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe I shouldn't go so dirty.</v>

349
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should.</v>

350
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 3>And you wanted to go do.</v>

351
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:24.781
<v Speaker 3>That's you.</v>

352
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:25.710
<v Speaker 3>When you're at your best,</v>

353
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 3>you're a pervert.</v>

354
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.760
<v Speaker 4>They twist the crazy twisted.</v>

355
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:33.140
<v Speaker 4>He is one of the most twisted dudes and I don't want to.</v>

356
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.550
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather have him on.</v>

357
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.550
<v Speaker 4>We should have him on and do it together because his stories,</v>

358
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.410
<v Speaker 4>the shit that he would do,</v>

359
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.190
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

360
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.023
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

361
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I can't say it on the air,</v>

362
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.030
<v Speaker 4>what I can say anything on the air,</v>

363
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.100
<v Speaker 4>but the Shit Tom cotter did,</v>

364
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 3>it was what the first guys I know that would walk around with his balls hanging</v>

365
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:50.484
<v Speaker 3>out of his pants.</v>

366
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 3>One of the first guys like no one was doing that back when we were 20.</v>

367
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 3>We were like 21 or whatever the hell we were.</v>

368
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 3>And Tom Clark was walking around with his balls hanging out with his parents</v>

369
00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.321
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

370
00:10:58.321 --> 00:10:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christmas</v>

371
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.410
<v Speaker 4>party and all the comics are there and he and he would have the hands on his</v>

372
00:11:03.411 --> 00:11:04.190
<v Speaker 4>hips still.</v>

373
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.030
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like he was hiding.</v>

374
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

375
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.280
<v Speaker 4>And I remember at one point we were at somebody's house and there was a dog.</v>

376
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.320
<v Speaker 4>It was a oliver's dog and it was a,</v>

377
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:14.750
<v Speaker 4>he had rescued one of those grey hounds.</v>

378
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.340
<v Speaker 4>I think Tom was putting a dill pickle up its ass in the middle of the party.</v>

379
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Like we were both beyond children.</v>

380
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.090
<v Speaker 4>We were like fucking really good collection of bad kid.</v>

381
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.520
<v Speaker 3>It was the part of the fun of having a guy like Tom cotter too,</v>

382
00:11:30.521 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 3>is because you knew that he would do something like that.</v>

383
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 3>You knew he would want up things.</v>

384
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.830
<v Speaker 3>You knew if there was a bunch of comics hanging around,</v>

385
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Carter would find a way to make something fucked up.</v>

386
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 3>But I always felt like he kind of pulled back on stage though,</v>

387
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.000
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

388
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

389
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:43.361
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

390
00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:43.601
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

391
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:44.260
<v Speaker 4>he um,</v>

392
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.160
<v Speaker 4>in terms of practical jokes and like guys like Kevin Knox May,</v>

393
00:11:48.161 --> 00:11:53.161
<v Speaker 4>he rest in peace was one of those guys just so fucking funny offstage and so me</v>

394
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 4>cotter and Nazi or working at a place in Maine called the laughing lobster which</v>

395
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.280
<v Speaker 4>started to slow business and suddenly burnt down in the middle of a wet summer.</v>

396
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 4>And so we're up there and we're staying.</v>

397
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 4>There's a condo complex that we're staying in which was pretty upscale and they</v>

398
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 4>got a pool and I was always hot fucking chicks from Montreal to come down to</v>

399
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:14.220
<v Speaker 4>that part of Maine.</v>

400
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 4>So we go,</v>

401
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go down to the pool and I don't have my bathing suit.</v>

402
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:17.831
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

403
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:18.221
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

404
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 4>you've got boxer shorts.</v>

405
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 4>She was wearing boxer shorts down.</v>

406
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 4>So they head down and I walked down to the pool.</v>

407
00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 4>I opened the gate and I walk in and it's packed and there on the far end of the</v>

408
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 4>pool and I make it about halfway down the pool and they both stand up and start</v>

409
00:12:29.501 --> 00:12:30.010
<v Speaker 4>screaming.</v>

410
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 4>Greg,</v>

411
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing in your underwear?</v>

412
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.893
<v Speaker 4>The whole fuck</v>

413
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 4>red faced the</v>

414
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.820
<v Speaker 4>set me up the whole,</v>

415
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

416
00:12:48.171 --> 00:12:49.160
<v Speaker 1>what's the pot laws?</v>

417
00:12:49.161 --> 00:12:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowed to smoke pot street?</v>

418
00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Can you spoke here in your studio?</v>

419
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.620
<v Speaker 6>Allegedly,</v>

420
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.910
<v Speaker 6>this is what's going on with pot.</v>

421
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.950
<v Speaker 6>Pot is decriminalized and with decriminalized does not mean legal.</v>

422
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:03.020
<v Speaker 6>So in California it's decriminalized in Colorado.</v>

423
00:13:03.021 --> 00:13:03.854
<v Speaker 6>It's legal.</v>

424
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.900
<v Speaker 6>In Colorado you can just smoke weed,</v>

425
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.280
<v Speaker 6>but they were trying to institute a law in Colorado where they would.</v>

426
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.600
<v Speaker 6>They would bring out these sensors and they would have these things.</v>

427
00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:15.650
<v Speaker 6>They attach their nose,</v>

428
00:13:15.651 --> 00:13:16.670
<v Speaker 6>they look preposterous.</v>

429
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.530
<v Speaker 6>It looked like something from a Dr Seuss book come to life and it's this thing</v>

430
00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:25.760
<v Speaker 6>that literally goes over your nose and looks like a bullhorn and they would</v>

431
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:30.800
<v Speaker 6>sniff through it and if they could detect x parts per million of marijuana</v>

432
00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:32.240
<v Speaker 6>outside of your residence,</v>

433
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.253
<v Speaker 6>they could go and arrest.</v>

434
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.150
<v Speaker 1>You were fine.</v>

435
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.451
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

436
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:35.284
<v Speaker 1>I heard about that.</v>

437
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.660
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

438
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.440
<v Speaker 6>everybody was.</v>

439
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.590
<v Speaker 6>Everybody was so negative against it that I'm pretty sure that they dropped it</v>

440
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.420
<v Speaker 6>because people are so angry.</v>

441
00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:42.290
<v Speaker 6>Like how stupid.</v>

442
00:13:42.291 --> 00:13:42.710
<v Speaker 6>That was.</v>

443
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:43.491
<v Speaker 1>Very 19,</v>

444
00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:44.324
<v Speaker 1>84.</v>

445
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Not only that</v>

446
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.590
<v Speaker 6>gives people the ability to stand outside.</v>

447
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.640
<v Speaker 6>You know what it is,</v>

448
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.640
<v Speaker 6>it's people that were for the longest time enforcing a policy that's not,</v>

449
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.510
<v Speaker 6>it's not valid anymore.</v>

450
00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:56.940
<v Speaker 6>There's the things that guys knows that Shit's real.</v>

451
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.953
<v Speaker 1>A</v>

452
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:01.680
<v Speaker 1>type asshole.</v>

453
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.670
<v Speaker 1>He's already frowning mean well,</v>

454
00:14:04.671 --> 00:14:05.181
<v Speaker 1>that guy needs,</v>

455
00:14:05.181 --> 00:14:08.300
<v Speaker 1>we'd more than anybody put a smile on his face.</v>

456
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Which silly bitch.</v>

457
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.661
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

458
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:10.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

459
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.480
<v Speaker 1>I was just in Colorado and I didn't get a chance to read a couple of the comics</v>

460
00:14:14.481 --> 00:14:15.021
<v Speaker 1>I talked to.</v>

461
00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:18.050
<v Speaker 1>One of them isn't even doing comedy much because he's doing pot tours.</v>

462
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.780
<v Speaker 1>So in everybody's doing now for money in Colorado,</v>

463
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.490
<v Speaker 1>they just do comedy of pop shops.</v>

464
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:22.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

465
00:14:22.761 --> 00:14:23.001
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

466
00:14:23.001 --> 00:14:23.960
<v Speaker 1>The Pot tour tours.</v>

467
00:14:23.961 --> 00:14:28.100
<v Speaker 1>People come into Colorado today when you drive around.</v>

468
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that they can technically buy it.</v>

469
00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I think you need a Colorado license to buy it in the shops,</v>

470
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.560
<v Speaker 1>but you can walk through the shop and smell it and then buy it for you.</v>

471
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And then they go out and smoke it and it's like a whole tour and they make.</v>

472
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.540
<v Speaker 1>They're making fucking tons of money.</v>

473
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.451
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>

474
00:14:42.451 --> 00:14:43.320
<v Speaker 6>that's interesting.</v>

475
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:43.611
<v Speaker 6>So they,</v>

476
00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:46.590
<v Speaker 6>they probably have material that they do just for the pot tours.</v>

477
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:46.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

478
00:14:46.941 --> 00:14:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there.</v>

479
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

480
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

481
00:14:48.801 --> 00:14:50.780
<v Speaker 1>They probably have a bunch of corny jokes,</v>

482
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 1>but they said it's great for the economy.</v>

483
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Pay everybody's making money.</v>

484
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:53.831
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

485
00:14:53.831 --> 00:14:57.910
<v Speaker 6>it's unbelievable for the economy and that's what that fat fuck from New Jersey.</v>

486
00:14:57.911 --> 00:14:58.744
<v Speaker 6>That dummy,</v>

487
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.010
<v Speaker 6>that governor Chris Christie,</v>

488
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.330
<v Speaker 6>that fucking silly cunt.</v>

489
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.081
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

490
00:15:02.081 --> 00:15:04.120
<v Speaker 6>it'll never be there on my watch.</v>

491
00:15:04.121 --> 00:15:04.461
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

492
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:04.661
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

493
00:15:04.661 --> 00:15:09.661
<v Speaker 6>And he cites some unbelievably unscientific study that came out of some major</v>

494
00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:11.111
<v Speaker 6>university,</v>

495
00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:12.940
<v Speaker 6>which is foundation.</v>

496
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the study was,</v>

497
00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:17.320
<v Speaker 6>but it was about abnormalities and marijuana.</v>

498
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.150
<v Speaker 6>The abnormalities in the brain.</v>

499
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.740
<v Speaker 6>What does that mean?</v>

500
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.010
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

501
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:21.850
<v Speaker 6>here's what it means.</v>

502
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.110
<v Speaker 6>What's normal?</v>

503
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.203
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

504
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.930
<v Speaker 6>It just because something has a certain content in it or your mind reacts a</v>

505
00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:31.600
<v Speaker 6>certain way without a drug,</v>

506
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 6>with the idea that the,</v>

507
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.960
<v Speaker 6>that it changing,</v>

508
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.950
<v Speaker 6>being bad,</v>

509
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.580
<v Speaker 6>you would have to demonstrate that there's something wrong with the people that</v>

510
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:40.414
<v Speaker 6>it's changing.</v>

511
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.111
<v Speaker 6>Like what do you.</v>

512
00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:44.560
<v Speaker 6>What are you demonstrating that shows that this abnormality is in any way</v>

513
00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:45.394
<v Speaker 6>detrimental?</v>

514
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.363
<v Speaker 6>What are you showing?</v>

515
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.610
<v Speaker 6>Like where are all these people are smoking pot.</v>

516
00:15:48.611 --> 00:15:52.030
<v Speaker 6>That of becoming shaking messes were all these people that are smoking pot.</v>

517
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.300
<v Speaker 6>Millions upon millions upon millions of people are smoking pot on a daily basis.</v>

518
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.620
<v Speaker 6>Why is everybody,</v>

519
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.850
<v Speaker 6>are they falling apart?</v>

520
00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:02.160
<v Speaker 6>Is everyone losing their job?</v>

521
00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:03.400
<v Speaker 6>But they forgetting how to drive?</v>

522
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.750
<v Speaker 6>Are they looking at their phone going,</v>

523
00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:05.740
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is this?</v>

524
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.161
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

525
00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:07.150
<v Speaker 6>this is not happening.</v>

526
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.580
<v Speaker 6>Like you're not demonstrating any negative effects.</v>

527
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.790
<v Speaker 6>You're saying the studies shows a negative effect.</v>

528
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:13.091
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

529
00:16:13.091 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't.</v>

530
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.760
<v Speaker 6>Study shows a chain.</v>

531
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.460
<v Speaker 1>She can commission a study to say anything you want.</v>

532
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:17.661
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

533
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:18.510
<v Speaker 6>when you look at the word,</v>

534
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 6>the language in that study,</v>

535
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 6>it's not scientific at all.</v>

536
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 6>The language is creepy because the language says in one of the quotes,</v>

537
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:27.530
<v Speaker 6>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

538
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:31.460
<v Speaker 6>it was something along the lines of people that think that smoking pot even on a</v>

539
00:16:31.461 --> 00:16:33.010
<v Speaker 6>casual basis is,</v>

540
00:16:33.011 --> 00:16:33.844
<v Speaker 6>is fine.</v>

541
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.350
<v Speaker 6>This study is showing that it's not good at all.</v>

542
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.020
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't say not good at all because you're not.</v>

543
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.090
<v Speaker 6>You're not demonstrating not good.</v>

544
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.860
<v Speaker 6>What you're demonstrating is a change.</v>

545
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 6>Guess what else changes your personality,</v>

546
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 6>your creativity,</v>

547
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 6>your compassion sex,</v>

548
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 6>your sensitivity to sexual intercourse,</v>

549
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 6>you the way food tastes in your mouth,</v>

550
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.831
<v Speaker 6>your way,</v>

551
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:55.980
<v Speaker 6>you view other people,</v>

552
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.370
<v Speaker 1>bull,</v>

553
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.200
<v Speaker 1>you're going down.</v>

554
00:16:58.201 --> 00:16:59.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things going on.</v>

555
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.380
<v Speaker 1>These and these are the same people that will disagree with 98 percent of the</v>

556
00:17:04.381 --> 00:17:08.760
<v Speaker 1>scientists around the world who say there's climate change that are hard studies</v>

557
00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.100
<v Speaker 1>with real numbers that are scientific.</v>

558
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:11.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

559
00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:12.390
<v Speaker 1>this Chris Christie guys,</v>

560
00:17:12.391 --> 00:17:13.171
<v Speaker 1>fat as fuck,</v>

561
00:17:13.171 --> 00:17:15.600
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the worst things you could be as a person if you want to be</v>

562
00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:16.080
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

563
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.400
<v Speaker 1>shows a lack of character.</v>

564
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:17.910
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

565
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.200
<v Speaker 1>It shows a lack of willpower.</v>

566
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.300
<v Speaker 1>It shows a lack of focus,</v>

567
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:20.650
<v Speaker 6>goodson,</v>

568
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.440
<v Speaker 6>determination.</v>

569
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 6>You look what do you,</v>

570
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.060
<v Speaker 6>how do you view life and you're going around in a sloppy meat wagon.</v>

571
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.321
<v Speaker 6>That's what you are.</v>

572
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:27.541
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

573
00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 6>you're not an athlete.</v>

574
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:29.444
<v Speaker 6>You're not someone who,</v>

575
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 6>if you had a choice between being a person who respects their body and treats it</v>

576
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

577
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 6>or being a person that treats their body like a fucking big Mac dumpster,</v>

583
00:17:44.401 --> 00:17:47.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to decide what's healthy when you're walking around.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's pulled tight.</v>

659
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.390
<v Speaker 6>It makes me look young and vibrant.</v>

660
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.430
<v Speaker 6>Look at my Chin's fight.</v>

661
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.720
<v Speaker 6>All of them died.</v>

662
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.570
<v Speaker 6>I had a dude who told me that that was William Shatner's.</v>

663
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 6>Williamson has said this to him.</v>

664
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.210
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

665
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:21.511
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>

666
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:21.721
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

667
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 6>He was interviewing them and we're shocked apparently is like 80 years old.</v>

668
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.871
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>

669
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:25.704
<v Speaker 6>you look great.</v>

670
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.281
<v Speaker 6>And he said,</v>

671
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:26.401
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

672
00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 6>I realize that a certain year that if I just put on five pounds a year,</v>

673
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.900
<v Speaker 6>I never get really wrinkly because my face is like pushing fat out.</v>

674
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.131
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>

675
00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:35.964
<v Speaker 6>I'm serious.</v>

676
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.120
<v Speaker 6>Like apparently like he was a strategy to like to stay young looking but keeping</v>

677
00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:42.174
<v Speaker 6>your fake,</v>

678
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.000
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think you're supposed to be that fat when you're 80.</v>

679
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.710
<v Speaker 6>I think that's like super bad for you.</v>

680
00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:47.050
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

681
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 6>That's just bullshit.</v>

682
00:20:47.951 --> 00:20:48.090
<v Speaker 6>It</v>

683
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.060
<v Speaker 1>like because he's fat,</v>

684
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.923
<v Speaker 1>he's just made that shit.</v>

685
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

686
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 1>He's working backwards.</v>

687
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.930
<v Speaker 1>But that is true.</v>

688
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 1>If you will get older fat people,</v>

689
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:57.400
<v Speaker 1>they look way better than fat joggers or the older joggers.</v>

690
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.581
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

691
00:20:57.581 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I started running two years ago and I lost weight in my face and now I look like</v>

692
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:02.710
<v Speaker 1>a fucking skull.</v>

693

<v Speaker 1>I take my hat.</v>

694
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I looked like a look at this.</v>

695
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:05.411
<v Speaker 1>When I take my hat off,</v>

696
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I looked like a light bulb.</v>

697
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

698
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.720
<v Speaker 1>The light hits it and they just look at it.</v>

701
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:22.300

702
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:22.580
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

703

<v Speaker 1>It's this letting go into this energy.</v>

720
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.483
<v Speaker 1>Is it a.</v>

721
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 1>is it a show that requires drugs?</v>

722
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.971
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

723
00:21:57.971 --> 00:21:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

724
00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:58.900

00:21:59.400 --> 00:21:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

727
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And is it a show that you don't understand until you do it with drugs and then</v>

728
00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:07.430
<v Speaker 1>you understand it 100 percent like you ever the worst feeling in the world?</v>

729
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever go to a concert like pipe?</v>

730
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 1>My wife me go to fucking Dave Matthews band.</v>

731
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

732
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 1>that's ugly.</v>

733
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 1>And the wife made me go to is always bad.</v>

734
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.381
<v Speaker 1>But then when you say,</v>

735
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say the only thing worse than Dave Matthews is John Meyer,</v>

736
00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 1>John Mica and John Mayer Meyer and she was just like,</v>

737
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.320
<v Speaker 1>just enthralled by him.</v>

738
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.903
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

739
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:33.341
<v Speaker 1>I could do.</v>

740
00:22:33.341 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 1>John Mayer will know I can do to.</v>

741
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:34.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

742
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I think he's great.</v>

743
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I think he's very talented.</v>

744
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 1>But if your wife is really into going,</v>

745
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.041
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying,</v>

746
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 1>like she dragged you there and just stares at him</v>

747
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.470
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

748
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:45.303
<v Speaker 1>I paid for this.</v>

749
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Paid to have your wife.</v>

750
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Close her eyes later.</v>

751
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.593
<v Speaker 1>Think about him.</v>

752
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.300
<v Speaker 1>You notice she's not clapping because one of her hand slipped down or james</v>

753
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.740
<v Speaker 1>knuckle deep.</v>

754
00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.200
<v Speaker 1>She's clapping with one hand.</v>

755
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.680
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like something stabbing a seal.</v>

756
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.040
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like one of those martial arts movies where they rip the guy's heart</v>

757
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:12.874
<v Speaker 1>out after</v>

758
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.980
<v Speaker 1>she's just fist of herself.</v>

759
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 1>She's all the way to your elbow.</v>

760
00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Just gritting their teeth and pounded it in there.</v>

761
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Get the wedding ring off.</v>

762
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>She's just fucking strafing the.</v>

763
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.520
<v Speaker 1>You can see her rib cage expand as a goes up there.</v>

764
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.713

767
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Then you realize it's in her asshole.</v>

768
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 1>You thought it was bad?</v>

769
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.870
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucking shit up to her elbow.</v>

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 1>What is this the fuck are you doing?</v>

771
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought we're going to see a concert.</v>

772
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Just says licking her arm.</v>

773
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.633

00:24:05.891 --> 00:24:07.840
<v Speaker 4>that's not the craziest person that ever lived.</v>

778
00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:08.580
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

779
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.413
<v Speaker 4>That's not even close.</v>

780
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

781
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.121
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

782
00:24:10.121 --> 00:24:12.250
<v Speaker 4>what's amazing is every podcast,</v>

783
00:24:12.251 --> 00:24:15.580
<v Speaker 4>no matter how long I ended up hanging out with the guests for another 45 minutes</v>

784
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.840
<v Speaker 4>afterwards and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but I want to leave.</v>

787
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:19.870
<v Speaker 4>And it could have just kept going.</v>

788
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:20.621
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

789
00:24:20.621 --> 00:24:21.191
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>

790
00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:22.420
<v Speaker 4>I do to a point.</v>

791
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.960
<v Speaker 4>I always feel like a lot of times because I do the serious show first,</v>

792
00:24:25.961 --> 00:24:26.980
<v Speaker 4>I've already given me an hour.</v>

793
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.480
<v Speaker 4>And then I usually shoot a video with them.</v>

794
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I do this thing called talk your way out of it,</v>

797
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.130
<v Speaker 4>And then in a split second,</v>

798
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.250
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to talk your way out of it as if you're talking to the</v>

799
00:24:39.251 --> 00:24:39.790
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

809
00:24:54.401 --> 00:24:55.234
<v Speaker 4>He walks out.</v>

810
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.160

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.900
<v Speaker 4>He puts his finger in.</v>

820
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.690
<v Speaker 4>He pulls out the bottle of Igon and talk your way out of it.</v>
