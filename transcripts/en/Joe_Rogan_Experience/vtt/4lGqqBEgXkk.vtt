00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.700
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.660
<v Speaker 1>David Seaman who was on the podcast last week had a really interesting take on</v>

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.880
<v Speaker 1>coin that I thought it was kinda funny.</v>

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that if,</v>

6
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.330
<v Speaker 1>if bank,</v>

7
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>like Bank of America for site,</v>

8
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>if they were smart,</v>

9
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>they would get involved in bitcoin.</v>

10
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

11
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you already have this established name brand.</v>

12
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Like cryptocurrencies are going to be here.</v>

13
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

14
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.550
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

15
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

16
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>they're here to stay.</v>

17
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.733
<v Speaker 1>This is his take.</v>

18
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

19
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you capitalize on the name brand that you've already built in on</v>

20
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 1>and get on the mark and quick get in on it now in the early days and establish</v>

21
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>like that Bank of America like still has uh,</v>

22
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>like a footing in,</v>

23
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>in this as well as in regular money.</v>

24
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

25
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 1>it would be a really wise investment.</v>

26
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to see that happening.</v>

27
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

28
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 2>in short time really,</v>

29
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.361
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

30
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 2>we saw this with the Internet,</v>

31
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 2>which was at first the telecommunications companies fought tooth and nail.</v>

32
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 2>They could not believe that a decentralized packet switch network like the</v>

33
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Internet would deliver quality,</v>

34
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 2>voice and quality video.</v>

35
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to build highly controlled and structured networks.</v>

36
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

37
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 2>and they tried to fight it because it,</v>

38
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 2>it threatens and long distance market,</v>

39
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 2>which was very lucrative.</v>

40
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 2>It threatened many other markets.</v>

41
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.324
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>

42
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 2>three quarters of all international calls happen on Skype.</v>

43
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Three quarters,</v>

44
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 2>three quarters.</v>

45
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

46
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 2>that's a market that a few,</v>

47
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 2>two decades ago was,</v>

49
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.101
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

51
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 2>$20 billion market and disappeared.</v>

52
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

53
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 2>and essentially they had to restructure operations.</v>

54
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Now they made up for it.</v>

55
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 2>The smart ones became very good as Internet service providers and created whole</v>

56
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:39.331
<v Speaker 2>new businesses.</v>

57
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 2>The replace those lost revenues.</v>

58
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

59
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 2>so what happened there is you have these telecom companies trying to fight it</v>

60
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 2>until some of the smaller ones,</v>

61
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 2>some of the ones that don't have solid,</v>

62
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 2>entrenched positions and can't take advantage of size.</v>

63
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.471
<v Speaker 2>Thank,</v>

64
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you know what we've,</v>

65
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to cut off from this herd and go play with that bit bitcoin a bit.</v>

66
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as that starts happening,</v>

67
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 2>there's almost a stampede because everybody tries to rush into it.</v>

68
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens with telecommunications.</v>

69
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 2>The smaller providers started peeling off from the herd and instead of fighting</v>

70
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:09.751
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

71
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 2>they started trying to build service providers.</v>

72
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's really just a matter of who runs first,</v>

73
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

74
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to start running and then right.</v>

75
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And then the first breaks apart because until the first one breaks,</v>

76
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:23.011
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>

77
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:23.301
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

78
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>we were too serious for this bitcoin stuff.</v>

79
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 2>And they're looking over their shoulder trying to make sure that everybody else</v>

80
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>is also staying away from it.</v>

81
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 2>But eventually the market dynamic changes.</v>

82
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's just essentially,</v>

83
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:36.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just human nature,</v>

84
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.430
<v Speaker 1>like with human nature this to certain rules that are just always going to be</v>

85
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:41.264
<v Speaker 1>into place,</v>

86
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 1>play hard to get and follow the leader.</v>

87
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Those are two big ones.</v>

88
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 2>And bitcoin threatens some business structures within the banking industry.</v>

90
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:51.341
<v Speaker 2>It May,</v>

91
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:54.460
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna make it difficult for them to charge exorbitant fees to do</v>

92
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 2>international wire transfers when you can do it cheaper.</v>

93
00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Just like if you have Skype,</v>

94
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't $3 a minute long distance calls and,</v>

95
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

96
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 2>the smart bankers are looking at this and their thing.</v>

97
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>But if we have a cheap,</v>

99
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.071
<v Speaker 2>efficient,</v>

100
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 2>secure payment system,</v>

101
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 2>we can build some really interesting things on top of that and create whole new</v>

102
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>businesses that are very competitive that can actually give us a lead.</v>

103
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

104
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 2>our alge run the heard the,</v>

105
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 2>disruption in a competitive market is actually very,</v>

107
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 2>very enticing to the,</v>

108
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 2>to the second and third tier players because they don't have an advantage.</v>

109
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 2>They're too small to compete against the big guys.</v>

110
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>But if they see this disruptive technology,</v>

111
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:39.791
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

112
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 2>well maybe if I hit your ride on that I'm going to overtake everybody.</v>

113
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

114
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

115
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I can be the blockbuster or I can be the Netflix,</v>

116
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I can be the tower records or I can be the iTunes.</v>

117
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 2>And we've seen this happen in technology races before.</v>

118
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

119
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>

120
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.901
<v Speaker 1>How people,</v>

121
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>some people just don't want to buck the trends they did.</v>

122
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to go along with the flow of things or they want to buck the</v>

123
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:05.681
<v Speaker 1>trends.</v>

124
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They want to somehow or another figure out a way where they can prove everybody</v>

125
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:10.751
<v Speaker 1>else wrong.</v>

126
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.410
<v Speaker 1>And VHS is making a comeback.</v>

127
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:13.031
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

128
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>renting movies is still valid.</v>

129
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

130
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

131
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of those fuckers out there that just won't let it go.</v>

132
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Radio companies change is scary.</v>

133
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.773
<v Speaker 1>It is scary.</v>

135
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

136
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.891
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

137
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>that's the nature of the beast.</v>

138
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Especially today when we're involved in the craziest time for change the world</v>

139
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:30.664
<v Speaker 1>has ever known.</v>

140
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

141
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.900
<v Speaker 2>there at the moment,</v>

143
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:35.670
<v Speaker 2>being on the top of an industry,</v>

144
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:39.060
<v Speaker 2>especially an industry that's involved in technology is a very precarious</v>

145
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:39.894
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

146
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

147
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.580
<v Speaker 2>if you talked to,</v>

148
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

149
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Kodak a decade ago,</v>

150
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.400
<v Speaker 2>do you think they would,</v>

151
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.490
<v Speaker 2>they would realize that suddenly it's the largest vendor or manufacturer of</v>

152
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:56.400
<v Speaker 2>cameras in the world would be a telephone company.</v>

153
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Nokia,</v>

154
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:57.991
<v Speaker 2>Nokia,</v>

155
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:02.991
<v Speaker 2>within three years became the world's largest maker of cameras and suddenly the</v>

156
00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 2>entire industry changed.</v>

157
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

158
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.260
<v Speaker 2>And how do you compete against that?</v>

159
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:08.610
<v Speaker 2>They're not even in your industry.</v>

160
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 2>They just came out of left field.</v>

161
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:13.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're suddenly the horse buggy manufacturer and forward is taking</v>

162
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 2>your business and you never expected that was going to happen.</v>

163
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

164
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Nokia has a camera phone now,</v>

165
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>a windows phone.</v>

166
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>That is some insane amount of pixels.</v>

167
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like 40 fucking megapixels or something.</v>

168
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.623
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy.</v>

169
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>41 41 megapixel says Jamie,</v>

170
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's on top of that shit.</v>

171
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>41 fucking megapixels on a phone.</v>

172
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean this thing I think has have the note three,</v>

173
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it has 12 or something.</v>

174
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

175
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>it's better than that.</v>

176
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with Moore's law?</v>

177
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

178
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

179
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.981
<v Speaker 2>so for,</v>

180
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 2>for your listeners to Moore's law,</v>

181
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 2>it was created by Gordon Moore processors,</v>

182
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

183
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Processing speed and yeah.</v>

184
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 2>And what he said was that he estimated that because of the way silicon works</v>

185
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 2>every 18 months,</v>

186
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 2>the speed of a computer with double or the price would drop by half.</v>

187
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 2>And that has been true now for more than 25 years.</v>

188
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

189
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

190
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 2>and that thing then plays out in camera megapixels,</v>

191
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>in storage on SD cards in the size of the,</v>

192
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 2>of your smartphone,</v>

193
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.651
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

194
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.490
<v Speaker 2>a number of sensors you can put into the smartphone.</v>

195
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.450
<v Speaker 2>And it's battery.</v>

196
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Battery life is the one that's lagging behind.</v>

197
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 2>And it's the main thing that's holding back this technology.</v>

198
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Moore's law also applies to things like bitcoin.</v>

199
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 2>It also applies to networks like the Internet and what it means is that if</v>

200
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 2>you're in an industry that's established and suddenly you have a competitor</v>

201
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 2>that's coming at you with the power of Moore's law,</v>

202
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.580
<v Speaker 2>you better watch out because you're in,</v>

203
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not a matter of whether you will be able to compete in a decade.</v>

204
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of whether your industry will still exist in a decade.</v>

205
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

206
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.713
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

207
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

209
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>That whole industries can just vanish</v>

210
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.010
<v Speaker 2>150 years of Kodak and then suddenly film doesn't exist.</v>

211
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Gone in the decade.</v>

212
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when you used to have to pay money for long distance?</v>

213
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

214
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 1>long distance calls don't exist.</v>

215
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Like you can call New York right now and your home phone and it's regular call</v>

216
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.051
<v Speaker 1>on your cell phone.</v>

217
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>It's totally normal.</v>

218
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if you used to call long distance on a cell phone,</v>

219
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>it was an exorbitant amount of money.</v>

220
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Saturday afternoons,</v>

221
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.090
<v Speaker 2>London payphone.</v>

222
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 2>When I was a student,</v>

223
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I would go there with a stack of coins that was probably about $10 worth in</v>

224
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:25.364
<v Speaker 2>today's money.</v>

225
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I would sit in a payphone and my family would know what time I was going to call</v>

226
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.773
<v Speaker 2>coordinated.</v>

227
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I'd call in,</v>

228
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 2>they'd be a line of 15 relatives sitting,</v>

229
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 2>standing behind the phone on the Athens side and would be,</v>

230
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:37.941
<v Speaker 2>hi mom,</v>

231
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:38.721
<v Speaker 2>I love you very much.</v>

232
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:39.201
<v Speaker 2>Hi Dad.</v>

233
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:39.951
<v Speaker 2>I love you very much,</v>

234
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Hasis.</v>

235
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It's all awesome.</v>

236
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.871
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

237
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:43.270
<v Speaker 2>next aunt,</v>

238
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.393
<v Speaker 2>aunt Maria.</v>

239
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Julie Ann's what?</v>

240
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 2>London is awesome.</v>

241
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 2>And I'm stuffing coins as fast as I can into this pay phone.</v>

242
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:51.104
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

243
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 2>four or five minutes later,</v>

244
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 2>$10 down the drain,</v>

245
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 2>and I've said hello to the entire family and that's all I could afford.</v>

246
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

247
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 2>That was my experience.</v>

248
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.160
<v Speaker 2>And now you could Skype for hours for free and not crazy.</v>

249
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

250
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Look at a video of each other,</v>

251
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 1>talking to each other through your laptop for free.</v>

252
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.051
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

253
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:09.861
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating,</v>

254
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>fascinating times.</v>

255
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>When you put it in that kind of a perspective,</v>

256
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 1>you really sort of understand the change.</v>

257
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.733
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

258
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>the ability that we have to reach out to each other is just unprecedented in</v>

259
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:21.261
<v Speaker 1>human history.</v>

260
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>It's never been even remotely close to what it is now.</v>

261
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I saw somebody walking down the street the other day skyping with someone while</v>

262
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>they were walking on the street and they were talking while they're walking down</v>

263
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:30.561
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>

264
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:30.801
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

265
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:31.041
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

266
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to blah,</v>

267
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>and then the other person's on the other end.</v>

268
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at their phone.</v>

269
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:35.511
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

270
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:36.171
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

271
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it through a cell phone connection.</v>

272
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing that all the time now.</v>

273
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

274
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Walking down the street through a cell phone connection,</v>

275
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.270
<v Speaker 1>streaming video back and forth to each other.</v>

276
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.133
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

277
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:45.973
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

278
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
