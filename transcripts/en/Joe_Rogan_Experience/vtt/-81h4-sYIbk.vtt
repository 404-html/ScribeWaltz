<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just back from Brooklyn.</v>

11
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.193
<v Speaker 1>So we would recap this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before I want to congratulate Eddie </v>

12
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Bravo and becoming five foot nine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's huge.</v>

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>The modern medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Difference between five,</v>

14
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>eight and tell me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll kill you.</v>

15
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Can Tower over people who are compressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>discs.</v>

16
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.673
<v Speaker 1>You literally get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you look at old people and </v>

17
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>they're all fucked up like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what's going on.</v>

18
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>They're shrinking because their disc </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue,</v>

19
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.923
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese say you're as old as your </v>

20
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

21
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>electronics people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

22
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say cool shit.</v>

23
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I like fortune cookies.</v>

24
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Just attributed a billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I got a billion people say it's.</v>

25
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>It came from somewhere and try to from </v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy I ordered a laptop and a.</v>

26
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I got the package and it came straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>from China and it just sinks.</v>

27
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>It sinks in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>especially when you get something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a country like China,</v>

29
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>like there's only one reason why they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making something in China.</v>

30
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>There's one reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's two reasons.</v>

31
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:18.414
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'd make a lot of things </v>

32
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the manufacturing tolerances are very</v>

33
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make when iphones,</v>

34
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because you know,</v>

35
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>people are going to work for cheap and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived there.</v>

36
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Like when you get a laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a real thing you do,</v>

37
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>will you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to live the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who made this live.</v>

39
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get it anyway.</v>

40
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.563
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get it anyway in any way </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can go one click on the </v>

41
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>apple store and sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird.</v>

42
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Works though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven cents to make your last name.</v>

43
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's actually,</v>

44
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>because they've made so much money now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're workers are demanding way more,</v>

45
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of higher salaries also like better</v>

46
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural bed.</v>

47
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what's going on now for the day,</v>

48
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>but they're losing jobs now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Chinese manufacturers are gone.</v>

49
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>You're now got to go to South America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Malaysia and we got to Vietnam.</v>

50
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys would work for even less.</v>

51
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.653
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese workers are losing jobs to </v>

52
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>fucking Malaysians and the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's led apple.</v>

53
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>They run such a tight ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had put nets down.</v>

54
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>So many of the workers were committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide nets.</v>

55
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To company called Foxconn.</v>

56
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.373
<v Speaker 1>Foxconn is the company that makes all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laptops and they make a gang of </v>

57
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>apple products.</v>

58
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I think they make phones to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to to make a bunch of shit,</v>

59
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but they literally have nets are on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>roof and here's the best part.</v>

60
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>So many people committed suicide that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to address it and they their,</v>

61
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their argument was,</v>

62
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand these people live</v>

63
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:43.284
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the number of people </v>

64
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>in consider it like a population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The suicide rate is very similar.</v>

65
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can play with stats.</v>

66
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>They live in the factory basically just </v>
<v Speaker 1>slave slaves.</v>

67
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Slaves were slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever noticed later,</v>

68
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>but they're getting an</v>

69
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>iphone stick getting money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting money.</v>

70
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.400
<v Speaker 2>They can leave when they want money in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concentration camp.</v>

71
00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>

72
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.240
<v Speaker 2>They definitely didn't get money in </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrated.</v>

73
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be there.</v>

74
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:11.854
<v Speaker 2>You can leave whenever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is all they're going to give </v>

75
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.314
<v Speaker 2>you and you're going to work 16 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day or whatever the fuck did you ever </v>

76
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 2>know that's legit slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what.</v>

77
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Would you want pennies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

78
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:29.161
<v Speaker 2>Slavery and I phones come from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure that you got here?</v>

79
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 2>How do we allow that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the question,</v>

80
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.704
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you want your mom to be working </v>

81
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you want your wife to be working?</v>

82
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>But what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all she could do.</v>

83
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 2>She could just put together and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what she's going to.</v>

84
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 2>A dollar a dollar an hour is better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>no money in our Joe Rogan is.</v>

85
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

86
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.390
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely right.</v>

87
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

88
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.893
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting about China is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do have a huge middle class as a </v>

89
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.274
<v Speaker 2>result of their industrialization and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the suffering they went through in </v>

90
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 2>the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>

91
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got what?</v>

92
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 2>$400,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million middle class workers now who are</v>

93
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:10.441
<v Speaker 2>buying things like cell phones and flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen tvs and all kinds of stuff.</v>

94
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 2>You know what's fascinating to me though</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when was,</v>

95
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.793
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll wait for when you can tell me </v>

96
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 2>when was the last time you bought </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything made in Russia,</v>

97
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 2>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

98
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 2>But just if you could please just vodka </v>
<v Speaker 2>vodka socks and we don't.</v>

99
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it sucks,</v>

100
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have,</v>

101
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:32.974
<v Speaker 2>we use the American Swedish Baka being </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid off by Bella tour before this fate </v>

102
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:38.420
<v Speaker 2>or event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhat.</v>

103
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Some anti marketing strategy fate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia of doom.</v>

104
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 2>They're basically a one crop economy </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

105
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:48.440
<v Speaker 2>They make great box oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 2>isn't that nice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

107
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:52.920
<v Speaker 2>they were held back for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like communism doesn't fucking work.</v>

108
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>

109
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 2>And here's the little dust that either </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a monarchy,</v>

110
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>which it is now with bizarre like Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

111
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:00.274
<v Speaker 2>your private property means nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the government can come along </v>

112
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

113
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 2>did you say something about me will take</v>
<v Speaker 2>that over?</v>

114
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Let's take them over and throw him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail,</v>

115
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:07.924
<v Speaker 2>and so he was going to open a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about first don't let make and God </v>

116
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 2>makes first bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's supposed to stay on the animal.</v>

117
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

152
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.920

<v Speaker 1>More importantly,</v>

153
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 1>don't forget that the Ukraine and Russia</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper,</v>

154
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>it was annexed by the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Union of,</v>

155
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was essentially Ukraine has </v>
<v Speaker 1>always considered themselves sort of not</v>

156
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>part of the Kremlin.</v>

157
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>They've always considered those own </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and I would remind people that a</v>

158
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice guy named Joseph Stalin,</v>

159
00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.433
<v Speaker 1>a starved the Ukraine and about eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half million people died of </v>

160
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>starvation because he essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>collected forcefully,</v>

161
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:08.894
<v Speaker 1>collected all of their crops and for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand reasons and they all about </v>

162
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 1>eight and a half million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario,</v>

163
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.223
<v Speaker 1>but the size of the Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States is like a Goddamn history </v>

<v Speaker 1>this is fucking fascinating and all </v>

178
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 1>proven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

179
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you could watch the videos of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people saying what they're saying.</v>

180
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 1>You could see what happened after World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War Two,</v>

<v Speaker 1>People out just just horrific fucking </v>

183
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:06.584
<v Speaker 1>history that we have in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just going into other countries </v>

184
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>with their armies and killing groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and just the amount of times that</v>

185
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:16.274
<v Speaker 1>it's happened over the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States when Oliver Stone is like </v>

186
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.550
<v Speaker 1>laying it all out with the footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damon told history,</v>

187
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:23.384
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking fat Americans taken over </v>

188
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.370
<v Speaker 1>everybody taking over everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Hitler.</v>

189
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>When Hitler was pushed into Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Hitler was in Africa,</v>

190
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.220
<v Speaker 1>like all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing,</v>

191
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:35.054
<v Speaker 1>it's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of people is the history of </v>

192
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:41.360
<v Speaker 1>people taking over giant chunks of land </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fucking things out.</v>

193
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>We just haven't experienced that over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

194
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 1>We were so young.</v>

195
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.413
<v Speaker 1>This country is souls fucking young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy when you watch this </v>

196
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you realize like,</v>

197
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.663
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this calm is like a very rare moment </v>

198
00:08:56.101 --> 00:09:00.380
<v Speaker 1>where the ocean is still before tidal </v>
<v Speaker 1>waves come smash.</v>

199
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Those tidal waves are going on all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world right now.</v>

200
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.583
<v Speaker 1>If you're in Syria right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are watching missiles flying into </v>

201
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 1>apartment buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're watching suicide bombers,</v>

202
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:11.484
<v Speaker 1>if you're in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching all kinds of chaos all </v>

203
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 1>out of the throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not happening here,</v>

204
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.813
<v Speaker 1>so we're being loled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're being called to this false sense </v>

205
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 1>of what a human being is.</v>

206
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.693
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also is that you to in order to </v>

207
00:09:24.071 --> 00:09:24.904
<v Speaker 2>galvanize armies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to go see a peak in the fear though </v>

208
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.930
<v Speaker 2>on us into that room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you galvanize young arms,</v>

209
00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:41.140
<v Speaker 2>you galvanize armies around what around </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

210
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.110
<v Speaker 2>around things like communism is the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to go.</v>

211
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Fascism in is best way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity is the best way to go.</v>

212
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.363
<v Speaker 2>Islam is the best way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those armies have to have something </v>

213
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.440
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's fascinating about.</v>

214
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.500
<v Speaker 2>If you read the Old Testament man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's literally about.</v>

215
00:09:56.501 --> 00:09:59.350
<v Speaker 2>It's guys like you guys are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>worshiping false idols.</v>

216
00:09:59.351 --> 00:10:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I got to send the Babylonians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously the rockies,</v>

217
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed the Solomon's Temple in 586 </v>

218
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.650
<v Speaker 2>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the Jews built their temple.</v>

219
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:10.690
<v Speaker 2>That was their most sacred thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Babylonians,</v>

220
00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:13.450
<v Speaker 2>you know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the Iraqis that they.</v>

221

222
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.750
<v Speaker 2>A historical footprint that's so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

223
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

224
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 1>The original civilization as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern historians.</v>

225
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Which uniform first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mathematics?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what an old nail looks like.</v>

229

<v Speaker 1>You ever do construction?</v>

230
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

231
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.340
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid we did a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction in Boston.</v>

232
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:39.220
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those buildings are really old </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the really old buildings,</v>

233
00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.570
<v Speaker 1>they have a different kind of nailing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

234
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a handmade nail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of looking like a circle with</v>

235
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.930
<v Speaker 1>like a straight line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they look like is like a wedge.</v>

236
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like flat.</v>

237
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.343
<v Speaker 1>It's not round at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would say that's what the </v>

238
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.300
<v Speaker 1>cuneiform looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull up an old nail though.</v>

239
00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Pull up an old old construction nail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looked like a wedge.</v>

240
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.943
<v Speaker 1>Four sides.</v>

241
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's what a cuneiform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

242
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.810
<v Speaker 1>See those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those nails?</v>

243
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a rotten out one.</v>

244
00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:12.124
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how they looked like it looked like </v>

245
00:11:13.211 --> 00:11:14.840
<v Speaker 1>a wedge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See they're,</v>

246
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:15.674
<v Speaker 1>they're like a little sword more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are like around rounded cylinder </v>

247
00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:21.680
<v Speaker 1>type thing with appointment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

248
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.880
<v Speaker 1>those are all handmade to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

249
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Well they used to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mold to it,</v>

250
00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 1>but you would go to a blacksmith or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever the.</v>

251
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are ironman.</v>

252
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine they're stealing.</v>

253
00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's copper.</v>

254
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

<v Speaker 1>those are rusted.</v>

256
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.020
<v Speaker 1>They're old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's iron.</v>

257
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.570
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 percent iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see all that rust on it.</v>

258
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Copper doesn't rust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>

259
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Those are all they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they would make those.</v>

260
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was um,</v>

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.093
<v Speaker 1>You've got to wear a mask because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing it in because as you're </v>

275
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:20.554
<v Speaker 1>putting that stuff up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's flying in the air like you would </v>

276
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:22.954
<v Speaker 1>see the light would come in from one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the windows and you would see like all </v>

277
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 1>these particles in the air.</v>

278
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:26.520
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

280
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.043
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst job I ever had with tearing a </v>

281
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:30.694
<v Speaker 1>house down in Washington dc in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer and then we take it and bring it </v>

282
00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:33.594
<v Speaker 1>out to Lawton landfill and you'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cart it off and then we poured the base </v>

283
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 1>for a bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big apartment or a building,</v>

284
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.060
<v Speaker 1>actually a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The base with cement and stuff.</v>

285
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>You have to dig that kind of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember going there,</v>

286
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:50.370
<v Speaker 1>there is no fucking way I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in college.</v>

287
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to figure out a way to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever have to do this.</v>

288
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It was the worst shit in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up early for some reason.</v>

289
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:56.960
<v Speaker 1>When you work construction you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

290
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.950
<v Speaker 1>You're up super early and you're driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a truck.</v>

291
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:00.784
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now stop and think about someone in </v>

292
00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 1>China making your iphone exactly 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times worse,</v>

293
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 1>10 times worse.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're just doing the same everyday.</v>

296
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.630
<v Speaker 1>The monotony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Working with these machines,</v>

297
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.520
<v Speaker 1>they demand productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of food are you getting there?</v>

298
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.413
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're forced to live there and </v>

299
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.093
<v Speaker 1>you're getting terrible food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all packed together like </v>

<v Speaker 1>sardines within what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The loop for when this country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>farms and things like that.</v>

302
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a routine to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With all those people working there,</v>

303
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I'd go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>suicide nets.</v>

309
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.413

<v Speaker 1>together and these little tiny </v>

310
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 1>dormitories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>housing,</v>

311
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:50.523
<v Speaker 1>dorm rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think guys get really good at like </v>

312
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 1>missing the net.</v>

313
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.733
<v Speaker 1>Just you gotta just jump further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just run like a Jackie Chan off the top </v>

314
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 1>of the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stoked.</v>

315
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I bet they're trying to get a look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan who've seen the subway.</v>

316
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 1>They push you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Push people.</v>

317
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:05.584
<v Speaker 1>I've been there where they did that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us like we're in rush hour and I wanted </v>

318
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>to go down there to see what it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get shoved to bring that up.</v>

319
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:18.181
<v Speaker 1>You'll see the film in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They paid dudes in uniforms to shove you</v>

320
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.270
<v Speaker 1>in like a for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is happening right now.</v>

321
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just.</v>

322
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

323
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.823
<v Speaker 1>you know what's amazing is how uniform </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's behavior is in Japan and how </v>

324
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:37.471
<v Speaker 1>like people are so polite and calm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get along well in Japan they had to</v>

325
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:41.920
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people in a very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

326
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>We feel the next trade was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys trying to push people.</v>

327
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Is there a similar train come and run </v>
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

328
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.570
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't have any more trends.</v>

329
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 1>This is every day one push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Push that fucker get in there.</v>

330
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:58.301
<v Speaker 1>You start dating your motherfucking so </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous right now in Japan.</v>

331
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you are preparing of so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not in their pants.</v>

332
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:05.864
<v Speaker 1>Every time they ride on that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't wait to get published in Japan </v>

333
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.243
<v Speaker 1>where you get a lot of guys who rubbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big difference is that China or </v>

334
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

335
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Japan is like incredibly populated but </v>
<v Speaker 1>really small,</v>

336
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.083
<v Speaker 1>but I think Japan did we decide to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We measure that is the most $5 million </v>

337
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.053
<v Speaker 1>and it's very small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camp people die on the side of New York </v>

338
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.610
<v Speaker 1>City and skip on Japan like I dunno how </v>
<v Speaker 1>big Japan is.</v>

339
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:33.170
<v Speaker 1>How I might've made that up.</v>

340
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not the size of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo is the size of New York City.</v>

341
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Japan itself in California,</v>

342
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.150
<v Speaker 1>how big is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense,</v>

343
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.013
<v Speaker 1>but it's an hour or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of their different </v>

344
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty 5 million people though.</v>

345
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 1>He swept that stacked into this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot and they're super orderly.</v>

346
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 1>8 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Curtis Lemay was firebombing Tokyo,</v>

347
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I believe about 8 million people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>about eight days died from fire.</v>

348
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 8 million or maybe it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million,</v>

349
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:03.370
<v Speaker 1>but I don't get shit in the Oliver Stone</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

350
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 1>What happened in Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dark.</v>

351
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.313
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 7 million people died in World </v>

352
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 1>War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 7 million people,</v>

353
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very rarely discussed.</v>

354
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 1>And then how many Russians died?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two and then they had stolen the next 10</v>

355
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:17.560
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They last.</v>

356
00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:18.394
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had more people died in World War </v>

357
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 1>II than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

358
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:23.810
<v Speaker 1>No one talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One as well.</v>

359
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very flatland.</v>

360
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Speaker 1>This flat area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Oliver Stone thing,</v>

361
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 1>it's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to watch it like three</v>

362
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:33.030
<v Speaker 1>or four times and wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was world war two,</v>

363
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.193
<v Speaker 1>but wasn't there only a 2 million deaths</v>
<v Speaker 1>total from like that must most of them </v>

364
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 1>from soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty dollars million.</v>

365
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.003
<v Speaker 1>Most of them were civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That deaths there are about 50 million </v>

366
00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:52.390
<v Speaker 1>altogether or maybe more from a total in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and World War Two.</v>

367
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just soldiers though.</v>

368
00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>I think 2 million soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

369
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a lot of civilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

370
00:16:58.131 --> 00:16:58.964
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were firebombing killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the deaths by far were civilian </v>

371
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.190
<v Speaker 1>according to what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must have caught.</v>

372
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.293
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of civilian deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent because there was a lot of </v>

373
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:12.030
<v Speaker 1>fire bombing cities like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>indiscriminate firebombing,</v>

374
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:12.883
<v Speaker 1>especially in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we did some horrible shit to them </v>

375
00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:15.464
<v Speaker 1>before we dropped the atomic bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even before we dropped the atomic </v>

376
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 1>bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were fire bombing cities.</v>

377
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

378
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:21.843
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed everybody that was down </v>

379
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the nuclear bomb itself,</v>

380
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 1>like if you mean that is so crazy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were willing to drop.</v>

381
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is where a war gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to drop a bomb on a city,</v>

382
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>not a military base now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because we're weird because Nagasaki</v>

383
00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and Hiroshima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember where I'm the industrial cities</v>

384
00:17:41.211 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>that we're churning out a lot of the war</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes and there was.</v>

385
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 1>That was where the center of their war </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine was to remember.</v>

386
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:50.050
<v Speaker 1>We drop pamphlets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we dropped my uncle,</v>

387
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.860
<v Speaker 2>my great uncle dropped the pamphlets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the warning pamphlets saying we're going</v>

388
00:17:53.861 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fucking drive.</v>

389
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Is better surrender that here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

390
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.710
<v Speaker 2>They gave them warning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which that's how crazy nuclear power was</v>

391
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.880
<v Speaker 2>and meanwhile they had only blown up </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit in the desert and you know,</v>

392
00:18:04.881 --> 00:18:05.714
<v Speaker 2>and stuff in the ocean before they </v>
<v Speaker 2>really weren't sure what was gonna </v>

393
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.100
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know.</v>

394
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:08.934
<v Speaker 2>A lot of scientists didn't know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was energy trapped in an Adam and </v>

395
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.163
<v Speaker 2>and when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they actually detonated the </v>

396
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were like,</v>

397
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:16.554
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the theorizing about energy and </v>

398
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 2>anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

399
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:23.230
<v Speaker 2>that is actually true because we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

400
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.183
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of proof positive when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see a mushroom cloud with that </v>

401
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:28.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of power and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

402
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 2>We just unleashed the horrors of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy because we've been in war</v>

403
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 2>ever since we've had those things ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>

404
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.080
<v Speaker 2>No one's gotten to the point where that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out.</v>

405
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep it on the edges.</v>

406
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:39.654
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

407
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a term for it.</v>

408
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Mutually assured destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

409
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Matt can be broken down into an acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

410
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.333
<v Speaker 2>your boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson had a </v>

411
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:51.594
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating discussion about they</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't really get out of the gates </v>

412
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:55.050
<v Speaker 2>because they couldn't agree on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth was,</v>

413
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.300
<v Speaker 2>but that was a frustrating discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very much so.</v>

414
00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:57.970
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at,</v>

415
00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:58.803
<v Speaker 2>they had a fascinating idea of there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things that you could know </v>

416
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 2>scientifically that none of us should </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

417
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.023
<v Speaker 2>And for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are scientific truths that if we </v>

418
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 2>knew would actually result in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete extinction.</v>

419
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.121
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

420
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:15.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

421
00:19:15.751 --> 00:19:16.584
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so an example of when we found out if </v>

422
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.074
<v Speaker 2>you split an atom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it creates a chain reaction and a </v>

423
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:24.840
<v Speaker 2>powerful force that can vaporize 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even a million people,</v>

424
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:25.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

425
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:30.630
<v Speaker 2>There is potentially scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge like that that could have,</v>

426
00:19:30.631 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced everything that you know to dust</v>

427
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.800
<v Speaker 2>and if that's something that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you could know,</v>

428
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.810
<v Speaker 2>is it worth knowing and would it be </v>
<v Speaker 2>immoral to know you know,</v>

429
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.653
<v Speaker 2>that that's Kinda the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where morality and science kind </v>

430
00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 2>of converge and where you have an actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about certain things are so</v>

431
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:50.664
<v Speaker 2>devastating and it would be the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would mean the end of your entire </v>

432
00:19:53.851 --> 00:19:57.450
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe that's a scientific truth,</v>

433
00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote that isn't worth having </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though scary.</v>

434
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

435
00:20:02.511 --> 00:20:05.300
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is the universe doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck about that.</v>

436
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.143
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is if someone does invent a </v>

437
00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:10.470
<v Speaker 2>time machine and they hit that button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all fucked.</v>

438
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really could happen.</v>

439
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:13.920
<v Speaker 2>It really is something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

440
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.600
<v Speaker 2>within a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

441
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.453
<v Speaker 2>you have the exponential increase in </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology and power and with what's </v>

442
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.400
<v Speaker 2>available and what they can do.</v>

443
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.673
<v Speaker 2>It could happen percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so important to have </v>

444
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:24.260
<v Speaker 2>those discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

445
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.590
<v Speaker 2>that's why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the atomic bomb,</v>

446
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:28.470
<v Speaker 2>there was a real concern that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to evaporate the entire atmosphere</v>

447
00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:29.400
<v Speaker 2>of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

448
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.263
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a small group of </v>

449
00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 2>scientists to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

450
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else could happen?</v>

451
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.340
<v Speaker 2>This could kill everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were still like,</v>

452
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.290
<v Speaker 2>we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't think so.</v>

453
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about like,</v>

454
00:20:41.131 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 2>think about responsibility for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist like that.</v>

455
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Think about that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how about the,</v>

456
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.120
<v Speaker 2>when they had the first nuclear reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was it?</v>

457
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.003
<v Speaker 2>Who was the Italian guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The father of the nuclear reactor </v>

458
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:52.181
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

459
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 2>and they were at the University of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>

460
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 2>what was the university?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where were the,</v>

461
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.850
<v Speaker 2>I guess the reactor started overheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

462
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had a,</v>

463
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.413
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy with a bucket there who </v>

464
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 2>was just going to throw a bunch of water</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

465
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

466
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm Frederick Frederico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enrico Enrico Fermi.</v>

467
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:13.570
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a name.</v>

468
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.890
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you buddy.</v>

469
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.330
<v Speaker 2>And she named was in Rico University </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago.</v>

470
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.170
<v Speaker 2>It started to trip out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would wear only handmade suits.</v>

471
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.750
<v Speaker 2>My name is Enrico Fermi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enrico handmade shoes.</v>

472
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It was loafers with no socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a genius.</v>

473
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he died of radiation poisoning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't he?</v>

474
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Because he might have ingested it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

475
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Poor bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From the time they started the Manhattan</v>

476
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:36.724
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long did it take to actually figure </v>

477
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 2>out the atom bomb?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also in the documentary that's in</v>

478
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 2>the documentary because we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure it out,</v>

479
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.733
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was if we could split the atom and </v>

480
00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:50.824
<v Speaker 2>hit critical mass shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine what kind of a weapon </v>

481
00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:56.540
<v Speaker 2>this would be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a.</v>

482
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.100
<v Speaker 2>They hired a couple thousand scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started the Manhattan project,</v>

483
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 2>started throwing all this money at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

484
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 2>And then the final proof was Nagasaki </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hiroshima.</v>

485
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.150
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did we pull this off?</v>

486
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:11.403
<v Speaker 2>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew already that it works because </v>

487
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 2>they had a bunch of tests before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

488
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 2>before they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most horrific thing about the</v>

489
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:19.084
<v Speaker 2>test was they would have soldiers run </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the blast because they didn't </v>

490
00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 2>understand radiation back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so incredible.</v>

491
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Like they didn't understand the damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation,</v>

492
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.900
<v Speaker 2>those videos you could watch online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie [inaudible] up,</v>

493
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.730
<v Speaker 2>or they would blow this atomic bomb up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They add up.</v>

494
00:22:31.731 --> 00:22:32.564
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mock town in the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would create these mocks cities to </v>

495
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:35.524
<v Speaker 2>see what kind of damage it would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd put up houses and Shit and they </v>

496
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 2>blow them the fuck up and they'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these soldiers run towards the blast.</v>

497
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And the idea would be that after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blast went off,</v>

498
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 2>it killed whatever.</v>

499
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.873
<v Speaker 2>People are killed and everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be stunned and that's when the </v>

500
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:50.450
<v Speaker 2>soldiers move in so they would fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy towards the bottom.</v>

501
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 2>It's the funniest video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all dead.</v>

502
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:54.783
<v Speaker 2>They all showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that that's what killed John </v>

503
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Wayne soldiers running to nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion.</v>

504
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punch that.</v>

505
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:05.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

506
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:06.993
<v Speaker 2>it's like a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Days after we dropped that bomb does </v>

507
00:23:09.771 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 2>bombs on Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Hirohito,</v>

508
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:15.910
<v Speaker 2>the emperor got on the radio and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called for the surrender.</v>

509
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:16.803
<v Speaker 2>One man said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time for us to surrender every </v>

510
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:21.370
<v Speaker 2>single soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the Japanese.</v>

511
00:23:21.371 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Everyone I'm willing to die for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they.</v>

512
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.670
<v Speaker 2>They dropped their weapons and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrendered it.</v>

513
00:23:27.671 --> 00:23:28.504
<v Speaker 2>We took what they were so fanatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>devoted to authority and still in many </v>

514
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 2>ways are so check this shit out man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These fucking are sitting there watching</v>

515
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:38.074
<v Speaker 2>that in the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean did that close and what's crazy </v>

516
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:43.510
<v Speaker 2>is like the wind from the blast comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hits them.</v>

517
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different videos of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

518
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.150
<v Speaker 2>A lot</v>

519
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:46.983
<v Speaker 1>of these were the US army would document</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of their training episodes and so </v>

520
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:52.340
<v Speaker 1>this is what they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd get see that?</v>

521
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the blast from the nuclear bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

522
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.773
<v Speaker 1>Fucking people are standing there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these trenches and there's a bomb going </v>

523
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.104
<v Speaker 1>off in the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so scary that they knew so little </v>

524
00:24:03.021 --> 00:24:03.854
<v Speaker 1>about what effects it would have on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they let these people run </v>

525
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:08.234
<v Speaker 1>towards their death and these people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>all running towards radiation sickness </v>

526
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:12.104
<v Speaker 1>running towards cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're running towards this fucking </v>

527
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 1>mushroom cloud in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the repercussions?</v>

528
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Like when they got home that night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would feel like there's a bunch.</v>

529
00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:21.644
<v Speaker 1>If she'd been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never get the full fucking story </v>

530
00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 1>as to what happened and what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>health problems,</v>

531
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:26.264
<v Speaker 1>but John Wayne died because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming these Spaghetti Westerns in the </v>

532
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.263
<v Speaker 1>fucking in the desert in Nevada near </v>
<v Speaker 1>these test sites and a lot of people </v>

533
00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 1>that were on the crew with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be bullshit.</v>

534
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people in the crew with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>got cancer.</v>

535
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got lung cancer.</v>

536
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:41.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

537
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:42.361
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

538
00:24:42.361 --> 00:24:46.050
<v Speaker 1>It was the government who got lung </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer from smoking.</v>

539
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

540
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.893
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something about everybody on </v>

541
00:24:52.271 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Speaker 1>the film that worked on that film with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them also smoked and also to cancer.</v>

542
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

543
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long does nuclear bomb goes off?</v>

544
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Like just a nuclear bomb just went off </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you get sick.</v>

545
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 1>How long have you have to wait until you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could populate that area again?</v>

546
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:10.983
<v Speaker 1>Dozens of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily going to take your </v>

547
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Sheila knocking SOC report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as bad as like nuclear waste.</v>

548
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear was the atomic bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so waste.</v>

549
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing than the thousand</v>

550
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.720
<v Speaker 1>years it would take for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

551
00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:30.810
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To take that long.</v>

552
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.663
<v Speaker 1>People live in Nagasaki now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in Hiroshima in their </v>

553
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 1>factories with the nuclear waste.</v>

554
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:38.883
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear power plants that have nuclear </v>

555
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:42.254
<v Speaker 1>waste it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff gets to like what's going on </v>

556
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 1>right now in Fukushima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

557
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:46.274
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous because they can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it yet and it's getting </v>

558
00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the radiation levels are higher and</v>

559
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Fukushima now than when they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>battling this disaster since what?</v>

560
00:25:53.721 --> 00:25:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Two Thousand and 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

561
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.323
<v Speaker 1>Turnover turnover is a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of a major nuclear meltdown and </v>

562
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:02.960
<v Speaker 1>it's thriving with wildlife thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear Wolves.</v>

563
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:03.794
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane Smith from vice films show out </v>

564
00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:05.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

565
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were fucking hunting wolves with Ak</v>

566
00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:12.761
<v Speaker 1>47 commute and mute and wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And read your mind Bro.</v>

567
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever play rock paper scissors with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

568
00:26:15.441 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 1>These fuckers know what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

569
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 1>there's people that think that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never figured it out.</v>

570
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.643
<v Speaker 1>They never figured out how to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atom bomb and they just basically </v>

571
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.040
<v Speaker 1>firebombed just like they did all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

572
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Those people are retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's peer reviewed papers,</v>

573
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.460
<v Speaker 1>but we were in a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were in a race with the,</v>

574
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.880
<v Speaker 1>with the Nazi's to create a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew the Nazis,</v>

575
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:35.714
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are a lot of German </v>

576
00:26:36.291 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 1>scientists came over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember as as for example,</v>

577
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I getting confused here?</v>

578
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Are you suggesting that nuclear aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>real?</v>

579
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:44.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying there's people that </v>

580
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 1>think no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they never figured it out.</v>

581
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.773
<v Speaker 1>Those people retarda 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ever targeted Dude Oppenheimer </v>

582
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Oppenheimer's papers that he wrote on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the work that he did on it,</v>

583
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 1>like that's all anybody could read that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can go into that.</v>

584
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.740
<v Speaker 1>It's all documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they did,</v>

585
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:03.050
<v Speaker 1>the tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they.</v>

586
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.890
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of the explosions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's videos of them blowing a fucking</v>

587
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.733
<v Speaker 1>hole in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so insane that they had these </v>

588
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:11.124
<v Speaker 1>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these destroyers placed around the </v>

589
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

590
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.403
<v Speaker 1>They didn't pull that up because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget what the test was with the </v>

591
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 1>nuclear testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ocean.</v>

592
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of bombs going off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it.</v>

593
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:24.390
<v Speaker 1>It's real destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Undeniable.</v>

594
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.550
<v Speaker 1>How do you know their nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just regular bumps.</v>

595
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.530
<v Speaker 1>The difference in the destruction is </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane to me.</v>

596
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Eddie fucking God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

597
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.440
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a mile high wall of</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

598
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.580
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea it was so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fish,</v>

599
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 1>know they lost his fucking boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

600
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:44.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just have this boat.</v>

601
00:27:44.381 --> 00:27:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Sit around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

602
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting a new monitor.</v>

603
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:51.460
<v Speaker 1>This monitor keeps cutting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on.</v>

604
00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It destroys this fucking boat.</v>

605
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.873
<v Speaker 1>They thought they could park their </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyer a certain distance away from </v>

606
00:27:59.551 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 1>this nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>

607
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if we drop a bomb on them,</v>

608
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.230
<v Speaker 1>how close can we be?</v>

609
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Turns out you can't even be remotely </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking close.</v>

610
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Check this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you see it from the sky.</v>

611
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

612
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 1>They set up this fucking boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

613
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 1>when see Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

614
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.013
<v Speaker 1>You're fast forwarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if there's got to be a part where </v>

615
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:24.591
<v Speaker 1>you can see it from distance because </v>
<v Speaker 1>from distance it's so fucking insane.</v>

616
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking like,</v>

617
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.070
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000,</v>

618
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:35.070
<v Speaker 1>40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus feet in the air and water,</v>

619
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:35.761
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

620
00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 1>that's insane gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the water evaporates.</v>

621
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Irregular bomb can be the way that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of regular bombs.</v>

622
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 1>What they can do with these things is </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

623
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.793
<v Speaker 1>Crazy at Nagasaki and Hiroshima or </v>
<v Speaker 1>little firecrackers compared to what </v>

624
00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:56.610
<v Speaker 1>they have now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fire fighter aircraft,</v>

625
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:57.444
<v Speaker 1>so it's just not a question whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not nuclear power nuclear bombs are </v>

626
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:01.260
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nuclear power.</v>

627
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the reason why we're.</v>

628
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Our lights are on or that we use nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>power as as we speak,</v>

629
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but what it does make steam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

630
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very clean.</v>

631
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.663
<v Speaker 1>It's very fucking hot as fuck and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes steam as long as it doesn't get </v>

632
00:29:14.401 --> 00:29:15.234
<v Speaker 1>out of your little holding pen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've harnessed a demon and </v>

633
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:20.720
<v Speaker 1>you use that demon to make tea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

634
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power.</v>

635
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:25.944
<v Speaker 1>That's so unbelievably hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The constantly keep water in contact </v>

636
00:29:28.921 --> 00:29:30.030
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes steam.</v>

637
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:35.210
<v Speaker 1>The steam powered the turbines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The turbines make electricity gets out.</v>

638
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a piece of uranium,</v>

639
00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I think the size of a pencil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look this up,</v>

640
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:43.350
<v Speaker 1>can run a nuclear for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

641
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.530
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane form of energy.</v>

642
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.643
<v Speaker 1>It's a demon and we're harnessing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cement box and we're putting it right </v>

643
00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:54.940
<v Speaker 1>next to the ocean drive to San Diego.</v>

644
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.773
<v Speaker 1>You have a drive to San Diego and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear power plant there and all </v>

645
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.380
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear bombs and that Russia had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still have to have.</v>

646
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.690
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the great things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>where lost shit though.</v>

647
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.130
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of lost material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear Bomb,</v>

648
00:30:08.131 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Rosa parks and the rosenbergs soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else figured it out.</v>

649
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:14.550
<v Speaker 1>The American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever hear that American story?</v>

650
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.870
<v Speaker 1>So the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>

651
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.713
<v Speaker 1>The rosenbergs a husband and a wife sold</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear secrets to the Soviet because </v>

652
00:30:21.881 --> 00:30:24.040
<v Speaker 1>they were communists in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country,</v>

653
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and when they sold them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was it truman?</v>

654
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I think Truman put them to death in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric chair.</v>

655
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.233
<v Speaker 1>They both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were both killed for bait for high </v>

656
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:35.701
<v Speaker 1>treason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now those motherfuckers sold it to a</v>

657
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:40.420
<v Speaker 1>lot of people in India just pull my </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount each other.</v>

658
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Remember this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they're the rise math Semitism in the</v>

659
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:45.574
<v Speaker 1>thirties in Germany and certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists and Jews were getting </v>

660
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.083
<v Speaker 1>assassinated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat up a lot of the German scientists </v>

661
00:30:52.091 --> 00:30:55.150
<v Speaker 1>because there was a real renaissance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany and Austria,</v>

662
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.770
<v Speaker 1>physics renaissance at with along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Albert Einstein.</v>

663
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 1>They emigrated to the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were like,</v>

664
00:31:02.411 --> 00:31:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they liked the Jews over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

665
00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 1>and in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We benefited from that mass immigration.</v>

666
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this guy on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast before,</v>

667
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:16.291
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest crazy scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ironic scenario was Fritz Haber,</v>

668
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.413
<v Speaker 1>the guy who simultaneously was winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nobel prize for being able to </v>

669
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:27.040
<v Speaker 1>extract nitrogen out of the air at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

670
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.143
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to try him for crimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>against humanity being the first one to </v>

671
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:31.564
<v Speaker 1>gas people and he created Zyklon a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was this really fucking horrible </v>

672
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 1>smelling pesticide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a terrible poisoned,</v>

673
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:41.554
<v Speaker 1>but it had a horrible smell to it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that smell let you know that it was </v>

674
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:44.944
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis took it and turned to design </v>

675
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.710
<v Speaker 1>con be they took the smell out of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use it to gas.</v>

676
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:54.820
<v Speaker 1>The Jews and this guy was a Jew himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a scientist dude,</v>

677
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:56.410
<v Speaker 1>but he was a painter in the country.</v>

678
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.000
<v Speaker 1>He's a patriot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to help his.</v>

679
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.280
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to help Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his beloved country,</v>

680
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.473
<v Speaker 1>when World War One and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can help you guys with a gas </v>

681
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:05.584
<v Speaker 1>that will kill everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people and we'll just wait for </v>

682
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:10.390
<v Speaker 1>the wind to shift and he was a patriot </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his mind.</v>

683
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:12.910
<v Speaker 1>He was killing the enemy who are trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take over his country.</v>

684
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:18.090
<v Speaker 1>He was a Jew and then of course in 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>while starting my God and probably 39,</v>

685
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.370
<v Speaker 1>they started using this gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to him in the final sweep?</v>

686
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Wound up dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleeing Germany,</v>

687
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:27.700
<v Speaker 1>and he had a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a heart condition.</v>

688
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.673
<v Speaker 1>His life was hell man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wife committed suicide in front of </v>

689
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:33.310
<v Speaker 1>him because of what he was doing like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

690
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.283
<v Speaker 1>It was off and he left his son with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife's body while he went off to war to </v>

691
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:39.230
<v Speaker 1>go do more of it because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

692
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>The whole</v>

693
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.000
<v Speaker 2>thing is it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the.</v>

694
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>It was a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world.</v>

695
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.953
<v Speaker 2>It's not Santa Monica where you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fucking starbucks and you get some </v>

696
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:51.820
<v Speaker 2>sugar free latte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will always starved.</v>

697
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:55.850
<v Speaker 2>We had to worry about the winter and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to worry about Guano.</v>

698
00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 2>We relied on Guano on bat shit and bird </v>
<v Speaker 2>droppings close to Chile.</v>

699
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 2>People will go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get bat shit.</v>

700
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the term crazy.</v>

701
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 2>That's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In Africa.</v>

702
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:07.993
<v Speaker 2>People would go to these places in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa to take Guano and other people </v>

703
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:11.444
<v Speaker 2>will come from other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would go to war over this stuff </v>

704
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 2>because it's the best fertilizer you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could use.</v>

705
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 2>You just have to get nitrogen into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soil.</v>

706
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:18.463
<v Speaker 2>But Fritz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fritz Haber and his buddy and the guy </v>

707
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:20.834
<v Speaker 2>who had perfect this came up with a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get nitrogen out of the air which </v>

708
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:29.030
<v Speaker 2>becomes ammonia and that's how you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>drips into a liquid form.</v>

709
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.540
<v Speaker 2>This can right out of the air dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't die of starvation anymore.</v>

710
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Modern Day farming and the reason you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>never met anybody who died of starvation</v>

711
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:37.693
<v Speaker 2>is because of Mr Fritz hopper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better start getting more grateful </v>

712
00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:42.800
<v Speaker 2>for real high because you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>

713
00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:43.634
<v Speaker 2>In general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that 50 percent of the </v>

714
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of the nitrogen and the human</v>

715
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:50.930
<v Speaker 2>beings today might have come from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopper method to estimate.</v>

716
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:51.764
<v Speaker 2>Shout out to harbor to hopper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The air that you breathe in is like 80 </v>

717
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:55.754
<v Speaker 2>percent nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think of it as oxygen and carbon </v>

718
00:33:57.651 --> 00:33:59.080
<v Speaker 2>dioxide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly nitrogen.</v>

719
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just really weird.</v>

720
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.560
<v Speaker 2>That's why pure oxygen fucks you up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets you high and it's dangerous.</v>

721
00:34:04.561 --> 00:34:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and super good.</v>

722
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Super flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're.</v>

723
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 2>When you're looking in bars in vegas.</v>

724
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one Jack Shit for me.</v>

725
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They so stupid.</v>

726
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Have you been scared?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

727
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

728
00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:24.820
<v Speaker 2>You got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll never leave.</v>

729
00:34:24.821 --> 00:34:26.380
<v Speaker 2>You almost died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to.</v>

730
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:27.873
<v Speaker 2>I went to fucking look at the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear explosion ever equals to 57 </v>

731
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:37.810
<v Speaker 2>million megatons of TNT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell him he just wants to bomb.</v>

732
00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:39.544
<v Speaker 2>It's like way bigger than its source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in the atmosphere member who </v>

733
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 2>signed the antibody testing training and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air atmosphere at that.</v>

734
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.103
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy and the Soviet signed a pact to </v>

735
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:55.670
<v Speaker 2>not do this in the atmosphere and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>James is trying to toss it in the Arctic</v>

736
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.503
<v Speaker 2>Ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they did this in 1961 bomb ever </v>

737
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 2>tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

738
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 2>That's like the final scene in a video </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

739
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:06.230
<v Speaker 2>When you win for them where they made </v>
<v Speaker 2>these movies,</v>

740
00:35:06.231 --> 00:35:11.231
<v Speaker 2>they made them in Hollywood at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lookout mountain studios.</v>

741
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 2>You could look that this is not not made</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Hollywood.</v>

742
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a video of an actual bus.</v>

743
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy and the Soviet real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying they edit it and had the</v>

744
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:25.100
<v Speaker 2>biggest studio lookout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mountain studios.</v>

745
00:35:25.101 --> 00:35:25.934
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a top secret air force </v>

746
00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:28.274
<v Speaker 2>intelligence as the one we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about up in some dude who works at the </v>

747
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:34.244
<v Speaker 2>video store edit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would have edited that would go to </v>

748
00:35:36.261 --> 00:35:37.094
<v Speaker 2>someone who is the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most advanced movie studio saying that </v>

749
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:43.150
<v Speaker 2>that's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

750
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:43.501
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

751
00:35:43.501 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that they admitted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

752
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 2>That's where they put on it and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>edit it together,</v>

753
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.240
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just filmed.</v>

754
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I almost died when he dropped that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything,</v>

755
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

756
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In any anti treat,</v>

757
00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Speaker 2>anti testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treated the atmospheric testing,</v>

758
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember how to word it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he looked out the window and said,</v>

759
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:06.084
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're weren't detonating these bombs in </v>

760
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere.</v>

761
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Where's that waste co?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

762
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just rains down on people.</v>

763
00:36:12.061 --> 00:36:13.050
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

764
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:14.710
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any fucking sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're all.</v>

765
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.860
<v Speaker 2>When we were doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviets are doing it,</v>

766
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:17.723
<v Speaker 2>can we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when they signed the treaty </v>

767
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:19.920
<v Speaker 2>not to do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

768
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.200
<v Speaker 2>they don't test nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows anymore.</v>

769
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.223
<v Speaker 2>Nobody does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Russia did launch some sort of a </v>

770
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:27.414
<v Speaker 2>missile test recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two Treaty apparently saw getting very </v>

771
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:33.790
<v Speaker 2>scary mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very gangster gangster.</v>

772
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Well he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watch house of cards,</v>

773
00:36:36.181 --> 00:36:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much get it.</v>

774
00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Putin's created an atmosphere again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.440
<v Speaker 2>he's just a product of symptom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian mindset maybe.</v>

776
00:36:43.441 --> 00:36:45.630
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a hard man.</v>

777
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard man who makes his country weaker.</v>

778
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.110
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you bought </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything Russian?</v>

779
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.760
<v Speaker 2>So what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

780
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not be a soft time for Russia,</v>

781
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:57.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's a soft time for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>

782
00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Obama said something interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

783
00:36:59.161 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 2>let's just just just we can ignore </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>

784
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.590
<v Speaker 2>They make guns and some oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their guns aren't even that good.</v>

785
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Nobody needs him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

786
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:07.363
<v Speaker 2>Obama said that he didn't really say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like stabbing yourself in the finger on </v>

787
00:37:14.431 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 2>the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brother.</v>

<v Speaker 2>not the edge.</v>

789
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.523
<v Speaker 2>He's quoting.</v>

790
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.373
<v Speaker 2>Knife came from the Congo and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably got all sorts of diseases like </v>

<v Speaker 2>It feels to me like your fingers would </v>

795

798
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:46.890

00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Conan and just hold it in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's phenomenal exercise and you realize</v>

923
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.163
<v Speaker 1>our biggest weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that are always going bad on </v>

924
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the connections.</v>

925
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.050
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily your biceps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

926
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's usually like the connection between</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bicep and your shoulder,</v>

927
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:33.680
<v Speaker 1>your shoulder to your back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attended our connections.</v>

928
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.513
<v Speaker 1>And when you're doing things like yoga </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're doing things like these </v>

929
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:37.724
<v Speaker 1>club bells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we holding these big steel clubs in </v>

930
00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:41.960
<v Speaker 1>front of you and you're swinging them </v>
<v Speaker 1>over your head.</v>

931
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:42.943
<v Speaker 1>You're developing like very strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue and all your shoulder joints in </v>

932
00:43:46.881 --> 00:43:47.714
<v Speaker 1>your elbow joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your wrist joints because it's </v>

933
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.300
<v Speaker 1>constantly manipulating the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

934
00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:53.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different and it's kinetic,</v>

935
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.720
<v Speaker 1>the different weight of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

936
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.613
<v Speaker 1>the gravity is pulling it this way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way and you have to stabilize it </v>

937
00:43:58.850 --> 00:43:59.683
<v Speaker 1>and you're using all these weird muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't use if you're pushing a </v>

938
00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:05.170
<v Speaker 1>nautilus machine and we're just doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something simple like a ranch.</v>

939
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got these isolation things where </v>

940
00:44:07.761 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>like you're holding one thing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving it in a certain way by itself.</v>

941
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Like whether it's Kettlebell flows or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's.</v>

942
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:16.514
<v Speaker 1>I'm using steel clubs like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling like all of your different </v>

943
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:23.150
<v Speaker 1>stabilizing muscles in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very unique way.</v>

944
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.183
<v Speaker 1>Holding static positions to do that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a yoga exercise where you're </v>

945
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>on one knee and he had one leg straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and</v>

946
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.410
<v Speaker 3>your arm straight ahead and just hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

947
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 3>I just started doing yoga and that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a whole new respect for yoga.</v>

948
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been doing it now three </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks and man it kicks my ass.</v>

949
00:44:44.561 --> 00:44:47.740
<v Speaker 3>It's an hour and at the 30 minute mark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Don.</v>

950
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I got to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk out.</v>

951
00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever been to yoga class that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't walked out.</v>

952
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.230
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

953
00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:00.140
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to bring ice water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do break down after 30 minutes.</v>

954
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 3>I get crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crushed in 30 minutes.</v>

955
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.200
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how your body and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>laid there and it's so God damn hot.</v>

956
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like 110 degrees in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous to stick it out.</v>

957
00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 3>I have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no trust.</v>

958
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.720
<v Speaker 3>Every day I'm looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you're getting it done.</v>

959
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I actually am proud of myself for going </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the hardest yoga class.</v>

960
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 3>They got a core yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got all different kinds of levels.</v>

961
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.470
<v Speaker 3>No heat at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little bit of heat.</v>

962
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know it was an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just perfect.</v>

963
00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Ten 30 in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up.</v>

964
00:45:29.251 --> 00:45:32.250
<v Speaker 3>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go right down the street and it was just</v>

965
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:37.251
<v Speaker 3>kicking my ass from day one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just crushing our early hang.</v>

966
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I leave there and I got to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too tired to get in the shower.</v>

967
00:45:40.261 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you good with the Cold Eddie?</v>

968
00:45:42.211 --> 00:45:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Can you handle the cold better than you </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit cancel the heat?</v>

969
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to kill two birds with one </v>

970
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:47.154
<v Speaker 3>stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to stick it out and I want to be </v>

971
00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:48.720
<v Speaker 3>able to.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And they're fine and just holding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding your arms up and all these </v>

974
00:45:54.661 --> 00:45:58.200
<v Speaker 3>poses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wonder yoga chicks have big shoulders</v>

975
00:45:58.201 --> 00:45:59.034
<v Speaker 3>and triceps.</v>

976

<v Speaker 3>You're sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

977
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:01.943
<v Speaker 3>All those poses that look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look so easy in a picture that </v>

978
00:46:04.911 --> 00:46:05.461
<v Speaker 3>looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>minute class.</v>

983
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I've done it three times in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

984
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.590
<v Speaker 3>but I'm doing it at least once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

986
00:46:21.271 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's really good because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't talk at all.</v>

987
00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:24.570
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

988
00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:27.190
<v Speaker 3>it's for people that already know the </v>

994
00:46:35.311 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 3>while it's going on and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little.</v>

997
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:43.570
<v Speaker 3>talking about like the mystical </v>
<v Speaker 3>properties in this position.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1003
00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.250
<v Speaker 3>There's one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't remember his name.</v>

1004
00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:02.084
<v Speaker 3>He's the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would teach and the girls all loved </v>

1005
00:47:03.931 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 3>him and he would adjust you and I swear </v>
<v Speaker 3>to God he would.</v>

1006
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:10.020
<v Speaker 3>You'd get into a position and he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1007
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:10.883
<v Speaker 3>and let's not fight this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just have our own relationship </v>

1008
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:16.450
<v Speaker 3>with our own God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there it is.</v>

1009
00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.353
<v Speaker 3>Love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel how much energy it does take to </v>

1010
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:23.661
<v Speaker 3>reach to the back of the room and had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great voice.</v>

1011
00:47:26.961 --> 00:47:28.510
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1012

<v Speaker 2>well two yogis with relapsed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>my hamstrings.</v>

1027
00:48:02.521 --> 00:48:04.420
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was unwarranted.</v>

1028
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent.</v>

1029
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 2>And it was super embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1030
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call blocking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1032
00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:12.364
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll punch in his face because I was </v>

1033
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 2>switching legs and I didn't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else was doing.</v>

1034
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I was so into it.</v>

1035

1180
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.740
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have any muscle to </v>

<v Speaker 1>you can have psychedelic experiences on </v>

1274
00:59:09.701 --> 00:59:14.230
<v Speaker 1>it that if you do it and you get into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain state where you do the yoga over</v>

1275
00:59:14.231 --> 00:59:15.064
<v Speaker 1>and over again to enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually stimulate that part in </v>

1276
00:59:17.261 --> 00:59:20.020
<v Speaker 1>your brain that produces dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get a stretch,</v>

1277
00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:20.601
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

1278
00:59:20.601 --> 00:59:21.530
<v Speaker 1>your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lady,</v>

1279
00:59:21.531 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 1>the lady that</v>

1280
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.910
<v Speaker 2>you went to Egypt with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't she wasn't she?</v>

1281
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.240
<v Speaker 2>She knew that she was able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1282
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:29.500
<v Speaker 2>She would tell you she'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experiences pay out.</v>

1283
00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:31.990
<v Speaker 2>So that's people that we had bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:34.760
<v Speaker 2>She had bang at four in the morning to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shake up the,</v>

1285
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.713
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1286
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that maybe the dmt out </v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

1287
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.200
<v Speaker 2>but she wanted to check in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1288
00:59:46.431 --> 00:59:47.264
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1289
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:48.300
<v Speaker 2>He was into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1290
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.213
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is like your brain does </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce that shit and so these people </v>

1291
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:53.084
<v Speaker 2>that say they know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not outside the realm of </v>

1292
00:59:54.501 --> 00:59:55.334
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it might be possible for you to </v>

1293
00:59:57.351 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it,</v>

1294
00:59:58.821 --> 01:00:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I've only done it through the drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

1295
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 2>but there's got to be a way to get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain to do it.</v>

1296
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it sounds.</v>

1297
01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.933
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even have to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I swear to God like there was a </v>

1298
01:00:09.021 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 2>period of time when I was practicing </v>
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo so much and I was like,</v>

1299
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to a point where you practiced </v>

1300
01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:14.504
<v Speaker 2>enough where you can think you're kicked</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and they're going gonna laugh at </v>

1301
01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:16.874
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1302
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you started releasing dmt is so crazy.</v>

1303
01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:24.243
<v Speaker 2>You say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna tell you whatever you're </v>

1304
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:28.270
<v Speaker 2>saying I'm going to have a problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going,</v>

1305
01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.123
<v Speaker 2>I'm going and I'm committed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know whether it was going to </v>

1306
01:00:30.511 --> 01:00:34.550
<v Speaker 2>say you left off at when I used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice taekwondo,</v>

1307
01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.320
<v Speaker 2>but I think the way I was stretching my </v>
<v Speaker 2>body opened up something where I.</v>

1308
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.750
<v Speaker 2>where I went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kicked and I,</v>

1309
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna sound weird,</v>

1310
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:44.324
<v Speaker 2>but from that point on I got way neater </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the way I kept my room and the way </v>

1311
01:00:48.021 --> 01:00:48.854
<v Speaker 2>I kept my car and it made sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something aligned and there was such a </v>

1312
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.133
<v Speaker 2>drug induced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something happened there and then I </v>

1313
01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:01.460
<v Speaker 2>thought you're going to say that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

1314
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:02.303
<v Speaker 2>When many kicks that your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just punch and way harder like that </v>

1315
01:01:04.311 --> 01:01:05.144
<v Speaker 2>movie rookie.</v>

1316
01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I fell the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt a tree.</v>

1317
01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 2>A tree was in the way and I side kick </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trio.</v>

1318
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any giant oak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1356
01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>When you knocked out Luke rockhold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he fucked up Michael Bisping Dude,</v>

1357
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>when he knocked out Dan Henderson the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

1358
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>he was a goddamn force of science and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he was.</v>

1359
01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>He was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Training,</v>

1360
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>a lifetime of skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff is important.</v>

1367
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.580

<v Speaker 1>that has ever fought in the sport.</v>

1368
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I think TRT RTV tour is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking scariest guys that ever did,</v>

1369
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:25.493
<v Speaker 1>but definitely the best one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 five on planet earth at the time he </v>

1370
01:03:27.481 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 1>was for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1371
01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:31.320
<v Speaker 1>He was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fearless,</v>

1372
01:03:31.321 --> 01:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>destroyed rockhold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll take both of them.</v>

1373
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.833
<v Speaker 1>He thought to through to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll kicks in his whole career and one </v>

1374
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 1>of them was he missed with Luke </v>
<v Speaker 1>rockhold.</v>

1375
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:42.150
<v Speaker 1>The other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit him in the face.</v>

1376
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>We never saw that from him before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He threw some kicks.</v>

1377
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:46.314
<v Speaker 1>He threw nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was more of a boxing style </v>

1378
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 1>fighter and then fucked up bisping's eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a kick.</v>

1379
01:03:50.521 --> 01:03:51.354
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>headcase.</v>

1380
01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bisbing Simon.</v>

1381
01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Some issues before that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that definitely didn't.</v>

1382
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't help.</v>

1383
01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Like Vito was a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henderson.</v>

1384
01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.390
<v Speaker 1>We get them now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

1385
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.323
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1386
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 1>even with a Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same animal fight.</v>

1387
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Kelvin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelvin Gaslin in,</v>

1388
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:12.650
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1390
01:04:12.651 --> 01:04:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think being in Brazil is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big deal?</v>

1391
01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get some help to regulate his body</v>

1392
01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:19.200
<v Speaker 1>back to where are you saying what do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1393
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:22.590
<v Speaker 1>when you started your body starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing estrogen and all that.</v>

1394
01:04:22.591 --> 01:04:24.900
<v Speaker 1>You can't get it back if it goes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

1395
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:26.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go to Brazil for short.</v>

1396
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Did you go to Brazilian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just won't go a lot.</v>

1397
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be the other time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like with Josie Outta,</v>

1398
01:04:31.541 --> 01:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>when they tried testing him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1399
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>they made the guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1400
01:04:34.211 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>he had to stay at customs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't let him leave.</v>

1401
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Like it was super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will tell the whole story.</v>

1402
01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>The whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got this the first time they came,</v>

1403
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.983
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't take the test because he </v>

1404
01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:47.690
<v Speaker 1>said he didn't know the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the way it happens,</v>

1405
01:04:47.691 --> 01:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1406
01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested that like it's super shady.</v>

1407
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.433
<v Speaker 1>They come up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take you into a room that test </v>

1408
01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not sterile.</v>

1409
01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.910
<v Speaker 1>They just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to test you right now though.</v>

1410
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Watch you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to the bathroom.</v>

1411
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy said they had watched him </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a shower.</v>

1412
01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:03.380
<v Speaker 1>They'd look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1413
01:05:03.381 --> 01:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>you get home from training and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1414
01:05:04.561 --> 01:05:06.300
<v Speaker 1>we want to test you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a shower.</v>

1415
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I can't take my eyes off you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

1416
01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it that way for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we were cheating.</v>

1417
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

1418
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:15.180
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the all the guy,</v>

1419
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to deport him to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick him out of Brazil,</v>

1420
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>like the literally trying to get him out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1421
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>It was time to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any authority to test us.</v>

1422
01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:24.484
<v Speaker 1>You're not even from this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're throwing the kitchen sink </v>

1423
01:05:26.741 --> 01:05:27.574
<v Speaker 1>at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then finally the next day they get them </v>

1424
01:05:28.601 --> 01:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>to test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1425
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>He gives them tests and he trips and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spills it.</v>

1426
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Who does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's fantastic.</v>

1427
01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>So like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go and then.</v>

1428
01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:40.264
<v Speaker 1>So he has to give him another one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't mean anything he didn't </v>

1429
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:44.854
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't fail.</v>

1430
01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.073
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all like these guys like </v>

1431
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.990
<v Speaker 1>vandelay runs away from the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come to his gym,</v>

1432
01:05:50.991 --> 01:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>but go google takes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1433
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the.</v>

1434
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.280
<v Speaker 1>He got fucked more than anybody ever and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of that.</v>

1435
01:05:57.281 --> 01:05:58.900
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they banned him for life,</v>

1436
01:05:58.901 --> 01:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent reversed that.</v>

1437
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they did.</v>

1438
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:05.680
<v Speaker 1>They made it unconstitutional or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they did.</v>

1439
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:08.340
<v Speaker 1>They said it was illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't reinstated them.</v>

1440
01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:09.770
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did you see the.</v>

1441
01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:13.660
<v Speaker 1>They're about to give cyborg exemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1442
01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.020
<v Speaker 1>they see that they figured out whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that she has,</v>

1443
01:06:17.021 --> 01:06:17.854
<v Speaker 1>whatever personal medical issue that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>has and that this drug does help that </v>

1444
01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:23.044
<v Speaker 1>personal medical issue and since it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily a performance enhancing </v>

1445
01:06:26.591 --> 01:06:27.790
<v Speaker 1>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it,</v>

1446
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:29.680
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's a diuretic.</v>

1447
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:30.903
<v Speaker 1>It also is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps when women start experiencing </v>

1448
01:06:35.311 --> 01:06:36.144
<v Speaker 1>effects from a androgens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it mitigates some of the negative </v>

1449
01:06:39.491 --> 01:06:40.324
<v Speaker 1>effects of Androgens is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different properties that </v>

1450
01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:43.594
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1451
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.200
<v Speaker 1>different diuretics have and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>her condition is,</v>

1452
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:48.034
<v Speaker 1>apparently they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're examining at testosterone a </v>

1453
01:06:49.711 --> 01:06:54.711
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic use exemption and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's exonerates her and you know,</v>

1454
01:06:55.151 --> 01:06:55.984
<v Speaker 1>and all of us who said that she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something she shouldn't have been </v>

1455
01:06:58.031 --> 01:06:58.631
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1456
01:06:58.631 --> 01:07:02.110
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what the reasons why she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing it in the first place are.</v>

1457
01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 1>But we know that in her background </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1458
01:07:03.881 --> 01:07:04.714
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like crazy to assume other </v>

1459
01:07:06.611 --> 01:07:09.150
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that Duran to me as soon as she won.</v>

1460
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's all good.</v>

1461
01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you a Cyborg?</v>

1462

<v Speaker 1>hurts down a little while.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in Moitai 10 time world champion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>brother and then I'm going to fix it.</v>

1472
01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And she could go into 47 and cyborg </v>
<v Speaker 1>would knock her face off.</v>

1473
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sure I'm 100 percent yet Brennan Shaw,</v>

1490

<v Speaker 3>kiss her death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The champion could do holly brown ear </v>

1491
01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 3>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Alvarez a pig problem for conor.</v>

<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is the fuck?</v>

1495
01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Can you guys see the fucking conor </v>
<v Speaker 3>mayweather thing?</v>

1496
01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:51.643
<v Speaker 3>It's getting close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying that it's like literally </v>

1497
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:54.310
<v Speaker 3>agreed upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

1498
01:08:54.311 --> 01:08:55.144
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he's going to run into an </v>

1499
01:08:56.901 --> 01:08:57.734
<v Speaker 3>issue with the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do you think he's right about the </v>

1500
01:08:59.181 --> 01:09:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Ali Act?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1501
01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:03.680
<v Speaker 3>but I think we looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have looked at what I think's going to</v>

1502
01:09:03.681 --> 01:09:07.250
<v Speaker 3>happen is I think Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way Dan would let this happen</v>

1503
01:09:07.251 --> 01:09:07.970
<v Speaker 3>without being part of.</v>

1504
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:08.803
<v Speaker 3>I think they come to agreement with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC and Dana's part of it and it </v>

1505
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:13.490
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a question for you,</v>

1506
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to commentate it?</v>

1507
01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 3>Boxing and UFC and boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be a boxing in boxing.</v>

1508
01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need someone who's knowledgeable</v>

1509
01:09:21.551 --> 01:09:24.750
<v Speaker 3>on conor mcgregor dedicate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have so many boxes.</v>

1510
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be way,</v>

1511
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.720
<v Speaker 3>way better if they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then if the UFC concept.</v>

1512
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Both you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to have one balls,</v>

1513
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 3>deep boxing expert and one mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why though?</v>

1514
01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Because I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but kind of come from that background.</v>

1515
01:09:39.321 --> 01:09:41.640
<v Speaker 3>They can give you the history of cotton </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff,</v>

1516
01:09:41.641 --> 01:09:42.474
<v Speaker 3>but the sport is the sport is boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I feel like you could have somebody </v>

1517
01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:46.390
<v Speaker 3>who just brush up on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1518
01:09:46.391 --> 01:09:48.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who represents us,</v>

1519
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.150
<v Speaker 3>would you not do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>

1520
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.800
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that.</v>

1521
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:52.783
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to watch what you guys want to </v>

1522
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:54.890
<v Speaker 3>get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fair.</v>

1523
01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:56.720
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1524
01:09:56.721 --> 01:09:57.554
<v Speaker 3>if that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting hammered and we're going </v>

1525
01:09:58.591 --> 01:09:59.424
<v Speaker 3>to fuck with a companion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd rather do that than be there </v>

1526
01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:03.200
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God I would.</v>

1527
01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:07.430
<v Speaker 3>I tell everybody I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love compensated for the UFC,</v>

1528
01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:08.264
<v Speaker 3>but I fucked up when I started doing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight companion because the fight </v>

1529
01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:14.060
<v Speaker 3>companions epic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so much more fun when we get fucked</v>

1530
01:10:14.061 --> 01:10:14.894
<v Speaker 3>up and we're laughing and how I chose </v>
<v Speaker 3>the knockout and we're watching the </v>

1531
01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

1532
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's better.</v>

1533
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 3>It is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like being there live is fucking insane.</v>

1534
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:27.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed this past weekend,</v>

1535
01:10:27.771 --> 01:10:30.140
<v Speaker 3>but I would have definitely enjoyed it </v>
<v Speaker 3>more if you guys were there.</v>

1536
01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>

1537
01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.293
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should do.</v>

1538
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 3>We should make some sort of a deal where</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do it like this.</v>

1539
01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:38.993
<v Speaker 3>Do Colic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let those other guys take over the </v>

1540
01:10:41.211 --> 01:10:42.044
<v Speaker 3>commentary and we'll just have this like</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have like to sound things you can </v>

1541
01:10:45.471 --> 01:10:49.310
<v Speaker 3>choose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can choose to be companion.</v>

1542
01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.300
<v Speaker 3>He just go from having an interpreter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>

1543
01:10:53.301 --> 01:10:54.134
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to see people who don't even </v>

1544
01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:56.564
<v Speaker 3>need a component and have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your companion button you just think is </v>

1545
01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:03.850
<v Speaker 3>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sinkings annoying.</v>

1546
01:11:03.851 --> 01:11:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should do that.</v>

1547
01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Should be like the Spanish channel or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the span.</v>

1548
01:11:07.901 --> 01:11:09.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be like a little button.</v>

1549
01:11:09.051 --> 01:11:11.720
<v Speaker 3>You press and option like you get closed</v>
<v Speaker 3>captions.</v>

1550
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.560
<v Speaker 3>You know how you get closed captions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight.</v>

1551
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.013
<v Speaker 1>Watch the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just put it on mute and like what </v>

1552
01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>everyone else does on mute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear the slap of the kicks.</v>

1553
01:11:21.661 --> 01:11:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear dudes move around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear it.</v>

1554
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what we're missing.</v>

1555
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:32.400
<v Speaker 1>What we're missing is not that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong with the commentary,</v>

1556
01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:33.234
<v Speaker 1>the commentary is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't really broadcast that </v>

1557
01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Kombucha because it's not our product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1558
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:38.603
<v Speaker 1>But if we were sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were watching it and we had a raw </v>

1559
01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:45.591
<v Speaker 1>feed where there was no commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just slaps and punches and kicks and you</v>

1560
01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:48.660
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we would also like have our own take</v>

1561
01:11:48.661 --> 01:11:51.960
<v Speaker 1>on what the fuck is happening rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the commentators take and you know,</v>

1562
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.823
<v Speaker 1>if we're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be even more hilarious because for </v>

1563
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.273
<v Speaker 1>drunk stoned dudes talking shit while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making each other like mystery </v>

1564
01:11:59.401 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 1>science theater that they offered you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

1565
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:03.750
<v Speaker 1>But they said no weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can smoke weed.</v>

1566
01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:04.980
<v Speaker 1>He would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1567
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.650
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's legal.</v>

1568
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Like marijuana is legal in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're adults.</v>

1569
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:14.370
<v Speaker 1>We pay taxes for just for weed itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to stand up for weed.</v>

1570
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:15.503
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like if somebody said you could </v>

1571
01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.430
<v Speaker 1>do your stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't swear,</v>

1572
01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of who?</v>

1573
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not hurting anybody if I swear</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not hurting anybody.</v>

1574
01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:22.651
<v Speaker 1>If I smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1575
01:12:22.651 --> 01:12:23.484
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna agree to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid because I'm in a position </v>

1576
01:12:25.051 --> 01:12:26.370
<v Speaker 1>where I don't have to agree to stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1577
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid thing to agree to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're working with someone.</v>

1578
01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.830
<v Speaker 1>You're working with someone that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like you,</v>

1579
01:12:31.831 --> 01:12:32.521
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want.</v>

1580
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:34.380
<v Speaker 1>You only were in yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1581
01:12:34.381 --> 01:12:36.030
<v Speaker 1>you can work with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only wear yellow.</v>

1582
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yellow is our color.</v>

1583
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.753
<v Speaker 1>It's how we want to be represented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we're giving you the ones and </v>

1584
01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:41.814
<v Speaker 1>Zeros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want you to dress with appropriate </v>

1585
01:12:43.471 --> 01:12:45.660
<v Speaker 1>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so stupid.</v>

1586
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1587
01:12:47.311 --> 01:12:48.480
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shitty show.</v>

1588
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to have less?</v>

1589
01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Real sponsor gets companies sponsored by</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain wines.</v>

1590
01:12:55.061 --> 01:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Chateaus bypass on that call for Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>

1591
01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1592
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:03.120
<v Speaker 1>We don't necessarily need alcohol all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

1593
01:13:03.121 --> 01:13:03.954
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then we go off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rails and the bad for the main event </v>

1594
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.120

<v Speaker 1>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have a button where we have</v>

1597
01:13:12.981 --> 01:13:14.760
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking over each other button,</v>

1598
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:17.370
<v Speaker 1>so like a button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could press were enough to say it,</v>

1599
01:13:17.371 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 1>but we'll see like flames all around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:21.320
<v Speaker 1>None,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

1717
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.470
<v Speaker 1>The whole writing crew was just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the best line out there.</v>

1718
01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 1>So like Dave Foley was constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewriting shit constantly.</v>

1719
01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.293
<v Speaker 1>We would write jokes for each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we would see something and you </v>

1720
01:18:31.221 --> 01:18:33.080
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Vicky Lewis would say to Andy,</v>

1721
01:18:33.081 --> 01:18:34.550
<v Speaker 1>how about you try this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was amazing.</v>

1722
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.280
<v Speaker 1>It was great to candy Alexander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1723
01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a crazy cast,</v>

1724

<v Speaker 1>like super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1728
01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.310
<v Speaker 1>But I had to do many scenes with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you did an episode with them?</v>

1729
01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1730
01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 1>like it's hard to like keep a straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

1731
01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was supposed to be pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'd be like,</v>

1732
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

1733
01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:54.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1734
01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:54.973
<v Speaker 1>and he would say something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go and you'd be like biting </v>

1735
01:18:58.011 --> 01:19:00.560
<v Speaker 1>your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their face to keep from.</v>

1736
01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I would slap myself in the face in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>

1737
01:19:02.931 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Takes to try to get like I didn't laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so funny and unpredictable.</v>

1738
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Like he's so talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I did less than perfect within too.</v>

1739
01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would just come out and do shit.</v>

1740
01:19:11.661 --> 01:19:12.890
<v Speaker 1>And you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's he gonna do now?</v>

1741
01:19:12.891 --> 01:19:16.430
<v Speaker 1>And he was always fucking hilarious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was Stephen Root,</v>

1742
01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:19.810
<v Speaker 1>who's like one of the best actors I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever met him.</v>

1743
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:21.820
<v Speaker 1>This other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like this.</v>

1744
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.930
<v Speaker 1>He would do a scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would just become someone else.</v>

1745
01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:26.750
<v Speaker 1>He just wasn't there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he would be Jimmy James,</v>

1746
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:28.580
<v Speaker 1>like he would get out of the realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be Stephen Root,</v>

1747
01:19:28.581 --> 01:19:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you'd be hanging out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like this normal guy.</v>

1748
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:31.243
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd come on the set with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suit on as Jimmy James and he's Jimmy </v>

1749
01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.240
<v Speaker 1>James was raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was weird.</v>

1750
01:19:35.241 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 1>He was a real actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's been acting forever,</v>

1751
01:19:38.031 --> 01:19:40.910
<v Speaker 1>like highly trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled.</v>

1752
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Like he was the only one in the cast </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had like a real character.</v>

1753
01:19:43.551 --> 01:19:44.384
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Phil was just an exaggerated </v>

1754
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.493
<v Speaker 1>fill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his character like had a different </v>

1755
01:19:48.981 --> 01:19:52.640
<v Speaker 1>way of talking or different mannerism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he had all planned that out.</v>

1756
01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:54.620
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing,</v>

1757
01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:57.560
<v Speaker 1>amazing show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemistry like that is very rare.</v>

1758
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:58.423
<v Speaker 1>It's just creates gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really don't know how we got to </v>

1759
01:19:59.871 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1760
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:03.230
<v Speaker 1>But that dude didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like all about the best line,</v>

1761
01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:05.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever the best line is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever's coming up with the best line.</v>

1762
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you work in an like that,</v>

1763
01:20:07.831 --> 01:20:08.664
<v Speaker 1>then it makes it fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you work with like someone's just </v>

1764
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>super restrictive and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1765
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:14.550
<v Speaker 1>like they don't let you just express </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1766
01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Then you know those sitcoms or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>stores.</v>

1767
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 1>You've been in those environments too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hard to do.</v>

1768
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so easy to do.</v>

1769
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>A podcast is the easiest form of show </v>
<v Speaker 1>business of all time.</v>

1770
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.240
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1771
01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.270
<v Speaker 1>And like for doing shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best form trays.</v>

1772
01:20:30.271 --> 01:20:32.220
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the least managed.</v>

1773
01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It's still the least prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like if you're listening,</v>

1774
01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.173
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm doing something like around my </v>

1775
01:20:37.321 --> 01:20:38.154
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm cleaning my office or </v>

1776
01:20:38.971 --> 01:20:39.804
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to listen to a podcast I listen </v>

1777
01:20:41.831 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>to when I work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you stolen listening to music that I</v>

1778
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:44.953
<v Speaker 1>listened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pug Jesus that we might be balls deep </v>

1779
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:50.970
<v Speaker 1>too deep in the world to do so much to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn game.</v>

1780
01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It's all at your fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have enough time in the day to</v>

1781
01:20:54.661 --> 01:20:55.494
<v Speaker 1>learn shit on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk like you can go to Sam Harris and </v>

1782
01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:01.940
<v Speaker 1>listed the smartest motherfuckers on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

1783
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.133
<v Speaker 1>have listened to people super stupid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make yourself feel better and I'll </v>

1784
01:21:06.151 --> 01:21:08.760
<v Speaker 1>listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think this is doing something to the</v>

1785
01:21:08.761 --> 01:21:09.690
<v Speaker 1>way people communicate.</v>

1786
01:21:13.290 --> 01:21:14.123
<v Speaker 1>I do think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that the world is becoming </v>

1787
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:20.430
<v Speaker 1>less a brutal and ignorant in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1788
01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:24.240
<v Speaker 1>you'd find in we went back even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years,</v>

1789
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:25.163
<v Speaker 1>but let's say a hundred and 30 years you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would find a large portion of the globe </v>

1790
01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:34.400
<v Speaker 1>that could have a conversation with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>on why slavery is necessary and can be a</v>

1791
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:41.900
<v Speaker 1>virtuous in certain circumstances for </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain people and you'd have no problem</v>

1792
01:21:42.211 --> 01:21:43.044
<v Speaker 1>finding maybe half the globe who would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a serious conversation with you </v>

1793
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:50.430
<v Speaker 1>justifying a form of slavery in today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2017,</v>

1794
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:51.264
<v Speaker 1>you would be hard pressed to find anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who could morally or ethically justify </v>

1795
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:57.623
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you should own a slave and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a North America now in the world also </v>

1796
01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.210
<v Speaker 1>economically not viable anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1797
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.053
<v Speaker 1>like if you could do something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Foxconn and have a bunch of people </v>

1798
01:22:07.871 --> 01:22:08.704
<v Speaker 1>stocked up inside some place and feed </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and house them and they work 16 </v>

1799
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:13.560
<v Speaker 1>hours a day and jump off the building so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

1800
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.660
<v Speaker 1>You have to put nets around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1801
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:17.790
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only difference is they can leave.</v>

1802
01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:19.163
<v Speaker 1>They can leave if they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at some weird kind of form of of </v>

1803
01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:25.560
<v Speaker 1>slaves and indentured servitude or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1804
01:22:25.561 --> 01:22:27.920
<v Speaker 1>depending on the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that you.</v>

1805
01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.490
<v Speaker 1>You would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1806
01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:30.840
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minute you said,</v>

1807
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you're saying.</v>

1808
01:22:32.671 --> 01:22:35.500
<v Speaker 1>That's progress to an extent where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>con was to accept.</v>

1809
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it bizarre?</v>

1810
01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:37.794
<v Speaker 1>I mean like what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like you get something from Japan </v>

1811
01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:42.503
<v Speaker 1>or China rather and you know that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>came from one of those kinds of </v>

1812
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:47.160
<v Speaker 1>factories and you're okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're all okay with it.</v>

1813
01:22:47.161 --> 01:22:48.540
<v Speaker 1>We have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want a new iphone,</v>

1814
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:50.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you want any phone android,</v>

1815
01:22:50.671 --> 01:22:52.990
<v Speaker 1>the android Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>

1816
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay when I don't know.</v>

1817
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with it for the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

1818
01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.880
<v Speaker 1>We went through our own industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and the fact of the matter is</v>

1819
01:23:02.881 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 1>that when economies are growing and can </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw a lot of examples</v>

1820
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Korea 30 years ago,</v>

1821
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:11.980
<v Speaker 3>look at China 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at all these countries who have,</v>

1822
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:13.323
<v Speaker 3>who have gained great prosperity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher standards of living for massive </v>

1823
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.860
<v Speaker 3>sections of their population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all started that way.</v>

1824
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:22.270
<v Speaker 3>They all started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1825
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:27.070
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to grow your country</v>
<v Speaker 3>to become an industrial powerhouse.</v>

1826
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:28.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand that Brian.</v>

1827
01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:31.390
<v Speaker 3>But it's just weird that we allow people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay people,</v>

1828
01:23:31.391 --> 01:23:34.610
<v Speaker 3>like essentially it's not a company in </v>
<v Speaker 3>China or you know,</v>

1829
01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.360
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of an American company and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways of slavery.</v>

1830
01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1831
01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.430
<v Speaker 3>Way Cheaper to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1832
01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.413
<v Speaker 3>to have like an involuntary slavery </v>
<v Speaker 3>network than it is a va because if you </v>

1833
01:23:48.521 --> 01:23:49.990
<v Speaker 3>make it involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1834
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of forced slavery,</v>

1835
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:52.743
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're paying them so little that they </v>

1836
01:23:54.731 --> 01:23:56.890
<v Speaker 3>can never leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just basically,</v>

1837
01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:58.023
<v Speaker 3>instead of providing food for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just basically giving them the </v>

1838
01:24:01.271 --> 01:24:02.170
<v Speaker 3>money that you would spend.</v>

1839
01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.380
<v Speaker 3>If it was real slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1840
01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.413
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to buy their food and Shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd have to have guards and </v>

1841
01:24:06.491 --> 01:24:09.370
<v Speaker 3>you have to pay guards and now the </v>
<v Speaker 3>security will feed them there too.</v>

1842
01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:10.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real creepy.</v>

1843
01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.500
<v Speaker 3>It's you got to realize that like even </v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever owns the company,</v>

1844
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:16.960
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Chinese people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American people,</v>

1845
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:17.794
<v Speaker 3>the American companies have these big </v>
<v Speaker 3>deals with them for a reason because </v>

1846
01:24:20.111 --> 01:24:23.720
<v Speaker 3>they can take advantage of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>loopholes because they.</v>

1847
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Their manufacturing tolerances are super</v>
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

1848
01:24:26.981 --> 01:24:29.190
<v Speaker 3>They really know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>

1849
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 3>there is a lot of pressure from </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible corporate American companies</v>

1850
01:24:33.131 --> 01:24:33.964
<v Speaker 3>and they go into those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those they go in there because they're </v>

1851
01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:37.324
<v Speaker 3>shareholders find out about this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they go in there and by the way </v>

1852
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:40.983
<v Speaker 3>there I would imagine that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that work at apple is going to </v>

1853
01:24:42.751 --> 01:24:43.584
<v Speaker 3>sound really surprising and these other </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies are pretty ethical and moral </v>

1854
01:24:45.721 --> 01:24:46.554
<v Speaker 3>and don't and I've very familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 3>not feeling good about the fact that </v>

1855
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:50.584
<v Speaker 3>their company might have a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a Chinese affiliate who doesn't </v>

1856
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:54.214
<v Speaker 3>treat their workers well and in fact a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of these corporations like apple </v>

1857
01:24:57.971 --> 01:24:58.960
<v Speaker 3>were very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

1858
01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.793
<v Speaker 3>An Ibm for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were instrumental in going in there and </v>

1859
01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:03.790
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold it.</v>

1860
01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.850
<v Speaker 3>We're not doing business this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're environmental practices.</v>

1861
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:08.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a whole article about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how ibm,</v>

1862
01:25:08.851 --> 01:25:11.950
<v Speaker 3>if you do business with ibm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck because your vendors,</v>

1863
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:15.520
<v Speaker 3>your vendors better be environmentally </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible.</v>

1864
01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Ibm has these environmental standards </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are just draconian almost for a lot</v>

1865
01:25:19.541 --> 01:25:20.374
<v Speaker 3>of companies where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may be environmentally responsible </v>

1866
01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:25.300
<v Speaker 3>and you work for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're a big client for you,</v>

1867
01:25:25.301 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 3>but how about the people that work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

1868
01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.500
<v Speaker 3>How's that draconian though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1869
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:29.343
<v Speaker 3>it's not draconian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that that a lot of these </v>

1870
01:25:30.851 --> 01:25:32.970
<v Speaker 3>corporations have to be responsible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>share.</v>

1871
01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart,</v>

1872
01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.711
<v Speaker 3>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they go,</v>

1873
01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:37.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do business where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are indentured.</v>

1874
01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Definitely right to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also 100 percent,</v>

1875
01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.070
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still,</v>

1876
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:46.870
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you just said that made </v>
<v Speaker 3>it look cute.</v>

1877
01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:47.704
<v Speaker 3>There's still 100 percent fact those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people make almost nothing and that's </v>

1878
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:50.853
<v Speaker 3>how you get your laptop made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you want to break it down to </v>

1879
01:25:52.461 --> 01:25:53.294
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way you can say whatever you </v>

1880
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:55.984
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the only widget that is is is </v>

1881
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:01.610
<v Speaker 3>it possible that this can turn back </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and they can start meeting.</v>

1882
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:04.230
<v Speaker 3>The idea of American manufacturing is</v>

1883
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:06.950
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that have been kicked around back</v>

1884
01:26:06.951 --> 01:26:11.540
<v Speaker 1>and forth since this whole campaign got </v>
<v Speaker 1>started essentially,</v>

1885
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:12.374
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was a big part of what trump getting </v>

1886
01:26:13.851 --> 01:26:16.000
<v Speaker 1>into office was bringing back American </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacture.</v>

1887
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1888
01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.420
<v Speaker 1>we all know the story of Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have all seen like how they're.</v>

1889
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another fucking documentary that</v>

1890
01:26:21.981 --> 01:26:25.910
<v Speaker 1>they're doing about this guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>building a farm in Detroit,</v>

1891
01:26:25.911 --> 01:26:29.000
<v Speaker 1>the largest farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making a huge farm in the middle</v>

1892
01:26:29.001 --> 01:26:29.834
<v Speaker 1>of Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like knocking down all these </v>

1893
01:26:30.741 --> 01:26:32.420
<v Speaker 1>buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying up all this land,</v>

1894
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:33.583
<v Speaker 1>and they're just going to build an urban</v>
<v Speaker 1>farm or what were you going to ask </v>

1895
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:36.374
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the question about the realist </v>

1896
01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.910
<v Speaker 1>out to bring manufacturing jobs back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.753
<v Speaker 1>I mean doing the idea of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of like reigniting the </v>

1898
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:45.423
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing base of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having everything being American </v>

1899
01:26:48.651 --> 01:26:49.484
<v Speaker 1>made being a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's some stuff like electronics </v>

1900
01:26:51.501 --> 01:26:52.130
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>

1901
01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Is it even past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the problem is first of all,</v>

1902
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:58.280
<v Speaker 1>the reason that we don't pay crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of reason that the consumers get</v>

1903
01:26:58.281 --> 01:27:01.340
<v Speaker 1>to pay not a lot of money for a flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen tv or whatever it might be.</v>

1904
01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:02.174
<v Speaker 1>The reason crisis seemed to come down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to Walmart and buy a lot of </v>

1905
01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:07.030
<v Speaker 1>shit for not as much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's efficiency,</v>

1906
01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a price for efficiency of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

1907
01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:11.810
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to the.</v>

1908
01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:16.130
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the infrastructure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>over 20 years China has built with those</v>

1909
01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:16.964
<v Speaker 1>factories that are so incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient and clean and and have just </v>

1910
01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:21.913
<v Speaker 1>locked into exactly how to churn out as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much product and your company and your </v>

1911
01:27:25.671 --> 01:27:27.920
<v Speaker 1>bottom line is you're responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1912
01:27:27.921 --> 01:27:28.754
<v Speaker 1>if you're a public court mandate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible to your shareholders </v>

1913
01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:33.620
<v Speaker 1>to make them as much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many dividends as you can,</v>

1914
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:37.190
<v Speaker 1>and on top of that turn of profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make your product for as</v>

1915
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:38.420
<v Speaker 1>little money as possible.</v>

1916
01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:39.253
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also gonna allow you to bring the </v>

1917
01:27:40.371 --> 01:27:43.240
<v Speaker 1>price down to your consumers can buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying,</v>

1918
01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.030
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is that we all know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure without infrastructure.</v>

1919
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:48.223
<v Speaker 1>I have good luck with the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing sector trying to compete </v>

1920
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:55.280
<v Speaker 1>with the Chinese who have a 20 year head</v>
<v Speaker 1>start and I and I,</v>

1921
01:27:55.281 --> 01:27:56.114
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is bringing manufacturing jobs </v>

1922
01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:01.970
<v Speaker 1>back to the US as a fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

1923
01:28:01.971 --> 01:28:02.804
<v Speaker 1>we're not even using human beings with </v>
<v Speaker 1>real enemy to unemployment is our </v>

1924
01:28:06.161 --> 01:28:06.994
<v Speaker 1>automation is not just a 100 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese workers that showed up over the </v>

1925
01:28:10.581 --> 01:28:12.320
<v Speaker 1>past 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox automation,</v>

1926
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Foxconn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO says investment for display plant in</v>

1927
01:28:16.281 --> 01:28:19.610
<v Speaker 1>us would exceed $7,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money,</v>

1928
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:23.810
<v Speaker 1>so they have these plants that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>already set up in China.</v>

1929
01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Very high standards for tolerances for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their manufacturing,</v>

1930
01:28:28.131 --> 01:28:30.480
<v Speaker 1>for not just this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for clothes.</v>

1931
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:32.510
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made.</v>

1932
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.373
<v Speaker 1>We just had a meeting with this company </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were saying how they went to </v>

1933
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:37.540
<v Speaker 1>American factory because they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>out source,</v>

1934
01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>choose tee shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff,</v>

1935
01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:44.240
<v Speaker 1>and then went to American factory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they went to the in China and goes,</v>

1936
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:45.143
<v Speaker 1>it's China's like the Bentley or royals </v>
<v Speaker 1>Royce have factories in the one that </v>

1937
01:28:48.951 --> 01:28:51.350
<v Speaker 1>went to America that produces a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our American shit.</v>

1938
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:53.990
<v Speaker 1>He said it was awful like there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't put up with it.</v>

1939
01:28:53.991 --> 01:28:54.824
<v Speaker 1>The standards are even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't do the people that are </v>

1940
01:28:57.111 --> 01:29:00.340
<v Speaker 1>jumping out of buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a clean place or dirty places?</v>

1941
01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1942
01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.220
<v Speaker 2>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean belting,</v>

1943
01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1944
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I know it seems like a fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't it sound like we should.</v>

1945
01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.770
<v Speaker 2>We should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should try.</v>

1946
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.040
<v Speaker 2>We ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll never happen to.</v>

1947
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:16.440
<v Speaker 2>We are trying to fuck China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's bring the jobs back here.</v>

1948
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:19.440
<v Speaker 2>We got to at least try at least give </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump a shot.</v>

1949
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are trying,</v>

1950
01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:21.354
<v Speaker 2>but even trump realizes and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizes that there are some companies </v>

1951
01:29:23.641 --> 01:29:25.920
<v Speaker 2>that countries that do things more </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiently.</v>

1952
01:29:25.921 --> 01:29:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1953
01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:28.333
<v Speaker 2>just as a bad example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bananas are easier to grow in the </v>

1954
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Dominican Republic than they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the climate and all that.</v>

1955
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Then they would be in Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1956
01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.093
<v Speaker 2>Just because of the weather and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of the idea behind the </v>

1957
01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:41.474
<v Speaker 2>global economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that certain companies do it </v>

1958
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:46.350
<v Speaker 2>eat certain countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the infrastructure,</v>

1959
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:50.490
<v Speaker 2>have the cheaper labor and it's easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>to churn out more product,</v>

1960
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.400
<v Speaker 2>thereby keep.</v>

1961
01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 2>But You keep saying cheaper labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's no big deal.</v>

1962
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:57.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just talk about slave labor,</v>

1963
01:29:57.061 --> 01:30:00.650
<v Speaker 2>this whole country's wealth here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you defend?</v>

1964
01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:02.850
<v Speaker 2>It?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raises the standard of living sorta.</v>

1965
01:30:02.851 --> 01:30:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but starts it.</v>

1966
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Not sort of Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>settle the fuck down.</v>

1967
01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:06.953
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does in a way where you're doing </v>

1968
01:30:08.011 --> 01:30:10.650
<v Speaker 2>it off the back of the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>making $5 a week course.</v>

1969
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:11.543
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what we keep saying and you </v>

1970
01:30:12.481 --> 01:30:13.314
<v Speaker 2>keep glossing over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It went up when I'm trying to explain </v>

1971
01:30:15.991 --> 01:30:19.410
<v Speaker 2>like why it's a problem to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that listen to this.</v>

1972
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.750
<v Speaker 2>You want to gloss over it and Fox News </v>
<v Speaker 2>it up,</v>

1973
01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.490
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't listen to Fox News by the way.</v>

1974
01:30:23.491 --> 01:30:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Let's get a couple things straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuckers get them.</v>

1975
01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't get my news off a CNN or Fox </v>
<v Speaker 2>News gets.</v>

1976
01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Who doesn't read news?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>

1977
01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Who's your fuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you get your news?</v>

1978
01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.693
<v Speaker 2>I read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read publications and I do a lot of </v>

1979
01:30:37.471 --> 01:30:39.720
<v Speaker 2>blow shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of bluff.</v>

1980
01:30:40.110 --> 01:30:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not glossing over anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to say,</v>

1981
01:30:41.851 --> 01:30:43.530
<v Speaker 2>is this really something that you keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying it?</v>

1982
01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:46.950
<v Speaker 2>We know what I'm saying is definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>less than a standard.</v>

1983
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:52.400
<v Speaker 2>If you go over one more time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to freak Brian.</v>

1984
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:53.243
<v Speaker 2>You're being very repetitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standard of living in those countries </v>

1985
01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:01.160
<v Speaker 2>has raised exponentially said that of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that are making things,</v>

1986
01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.480
<v Speaker 2>not of buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

1987
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:08.940
<v Speaker 2>we got to Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

1988
01:31:08.941 --> 01:31:09.774
<v Speaker 2>it's illegal to make those people work </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that in the United States for a </v>

1989
01:31:11.941 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 2>fucking reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're human beings,</v>

1990
01:31:13.741 --> 01:31:14.574
<v Speaker 2>so if they're human beings and China and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working in this horrendous </v>

1991
01:31:16.441 --> 01:31:20.080
<v Speaker 2>conditions are not insane hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are Brian and some aren't.</v>

1992
01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:22.500
<v Speaker 2>They're living these factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some factories.</v>

1993
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.020
<v Speaker 2>You're 100 percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would know there was some factories.</v>

1994
01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:26.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just a disco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go in,</v>

1995
01:31:26.251 --> 01:31:27.084
<v Speaker 2>they give them a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets a foot massage work </v>

1996
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:32.443
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I got to not saying that </v>

1997
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Fox News Dad is coming out of your mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I have nothing against slavery.</v>

1998
01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:44.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

1999
01:31:44.071 --> 01:31:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I believe in slave labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard work.</v>

2000
01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that every country has </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrialized the same way.</v>

2001
01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:52.650
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were a bunch of.</v>

2002
01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.513
<v Speaker 2>The factory was filled with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot women from Norway that were sweaty </v>

2003
01:31:56.311 --> 01:31:57.420
<v Speaker 2>all the time of the breasts are hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2004
01:31:57.421 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 2>We've been fucking trying to save them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't make them work these hours.</v>

2005
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I just can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because it's Chinese people,</v>

2006
01:32:02.681 --> 01:32:07.681
<v Speaker 1>Brian's legacy economies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese,</v>

2007
01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:11.973
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese demanding higher wages to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>an export in their jobs to other </v>

2008
01:32:14.801 --> 01:32:17.980
<v Speaker 1>countries of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can buy a subway sandwich.</v>

2009
01:32:17.981 --> 01:32:18.814
<v Speaker 1>Footlong maybe off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I am not saying you end of the </v>

2010
01:32:21.771 --> 01:32:23.340
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those characteristics.</v>

2011
01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.560
<v Speaker 1>You're mischaracterizing little plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>cup and get some water.</v>

2012
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:30.600
<v Speaker 1>How much would an iphone costs if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>built it in the thousand dollars?</v>

2013
01:32:30.601 --> 01:32:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Million Dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$1,000,000.</v>

2014
01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.540
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like 700 bucks an hour.</v>

2015
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:35.673
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we literally don't have the kind of </v>

2016
01:32:37.421 --> 01:32:39.190
<v Speaker 1>factory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd have to build the factory.</v>

2017
01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:42.310
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to build this month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it costs billions of dollars to build</v>

2018
01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:44.250
<v Speaker 1>one of those super high tech factories </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much more.</v>

2019
01:32:44.410 --> 01:32:45.243
<v Speaker 1>Then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to hire people as he </v>

2020
01:32:47.321 --> 01:32:50.290
<v Speaker 1>falls asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's substantial wage,</v>

2021
01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but it could be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an impossible thing.</v>

2022
01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It was done in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be done over here.</v>

2023
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:55.023
<v Speaker 1>They can make it will cost more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would definitely cause you would go </v>

2024
01:32:58.090 --> 01:32:58.923
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that the country </v>

2025
01:32:59.921 --> 01:33:02.230
<v Speaker 1>should subsidize fucking iphones instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of corn?</v>

2026
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:03.303
<v Speaker 1>Because all these cuts are putting corn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything and Corn Syrup and this </v>

2027
01:33:05.321 --> 01:33:06.154
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's getting fat as fuck and </v>

2028
01:33:07.091 --> 01:33:09.460
<v Speaker 1>people are dying of heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got goddamn corn port.</v>

2029
01:33:09.461 --> 01:33:10.271
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>

2030
01:33:10.271 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey by the corn powder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I just talk for a second?</v>

2031
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 1>That'd be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this corn and everything.</v>

2032
01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:16.323
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we subsidized cell phone talking </v>

2033
01:33:18.371 --> 01:33:20.080
<v Speaker 1>to a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need fucking corn.</v>

2034
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Talk to Archer Daniels Midland lobbying </v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts strong about slaves and how good</v>

2035
01:33:25.271 --> 01:33:28.610
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Slavery Motherfucker,</v>

2036
01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:29.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a free country.</v>

2037
01:33:29.381 --> 01:33:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I can say what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know those,</v>

2038
01:33:30.961 --> 01:33:33.130
<v Speaker 1>the guys that own these factories in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

2039
01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:34.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're down to like,</v>

2040
01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:36.370
<v Speaker 1>they want to assassinate trump.</v>

2041
01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

2042
01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.910
<v Speaker 1>So he's really gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull those,</v>

2043
01:33:40.090 --> 01:33:40.830
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2044
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them not threatened at all.</v>

2045
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It took so long to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A loop.</v>

2046
01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:47.500
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna know Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to do it.</v>

2047
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look.</v>

2048
01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.960
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear what he was talking about,</v>

2049
01:33:49.961 --> 01:33:53.560
<v Speaker 1>like putting the taxes on Mexico to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build the wall and stuff like that.</v>

2050
01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 1>All those proposals have to get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>congress.</v>

2051
01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good luck.</v>

2052
01:33:57.970 --> 01:34:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with all that and especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't see.</v>

2053
01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:01.653
<v Speaker 1>The thing about running a country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very different than running a </v>

2054
01:34:03.401 --> 01:34:05.080
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of checks and balances.</v>

2055
01:34:05.081 --> 01:34:06.580
<v Speaker 1>If he's running a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the king.</v>

2056
01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Like there was this thing that John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oliver had on a show,</v>

2057
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.293
<v Speaker 1>but we were talking about how like he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would exaggerate about the amount of </v>

2058
01:34:11.951 --> 01:34:13.780
<v Speaker 1>floors in this building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2059
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:14.614
<v Speaker 1>you think you're on the 14th floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really on the eighth floor because </v>

2060
01:34:16.721 --> 01:34:18.640
<v Speaker 1>he would like say there's like 68 </v>
<v Speaker 1>floors,</v>

2061
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:20.540
<v Speaker 1>58.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just does whatever he wants,</v>

2062
01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but it makes it look more exciting.</v>

2063
01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:26.770
<v Speaker 1>But you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with Congress,</v>

2064
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:29.380
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to work because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you run,</v>

2065
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.273
<v Speaker 1>if you run it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the reason why it's good that </v>

2066
01:34:32.591 --> 01:34:34.660
<v Speaker 1>there's this brock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your seat in place,</v>

2067
01:34:34.661 --> 01:34:35.494
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy in place is that if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't with the right or the left or on </v>

2068
01:34:39.131 --> 01:34:40.600
<v Speaker 1>their own and they want to run this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2069
01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:41.800
<v Speaker 1>like I'm gonna bring my own security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

2070
01:34:41.801 --> 01:34:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Run out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's gonna be on your side like.</v>

2071
01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.210
<v Speaker 1>And those people have to be on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

2072
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:47.133
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna work with these people to </v>

2073
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:50.620
<v Speaker 1>get things on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have to do it legally and you're</v>

2074
01:34:50.621 --> 01:34:51.454
<v Speaker 1>being watched for the microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's looking at everything you </v>

2075
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:54.730
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why this guy,</v>

2076
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:56.560
<v Speaker 1>what is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

2077
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Flint that got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got removed today.</v>

2078
01:34:58.830 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I stepped down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to step down in a business.</v>

2079
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.530
<v Speaker 1>What he did would have been mum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mum under the table.</v>

2080
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing deals.</v>

2081
01:35:05.541 --> 01:35:07.650
<v Speaker 1>So talking to people to try the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>

2082
01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Mischaracterize what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he do?</v>

2083
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:11.323
<v Speaker 1>We should look it up very specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from what I understand is he had an </v>

2084
01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.600
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate conversation with Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>emissaries about sanctions.</v>

2085
01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not those sanctions would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wet,</v>

2086
01:35:22.941 --> 01:35:23.774
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eased up under the because we have </v>

2087
01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:30.461
<v Speaker 1>sanctions on Russia because he's a poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit for national security advisor.</v>

2088
01:35:31.401 --> 01:35:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Michael Flynn resigned and then scroll </v>
<v Speaker 1>down a little bit there.</v>

2089
01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>National Security Advisor,</v>

2090
01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:37.274
<v Speaker 1>Michael Flynn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has resigned after reports that he </v>

2091
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:41.990
<v Speaker 1>misled senior White House officials </v>
<v Speaker 1>about his conversations with Russia.</v>

2092
01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.890
<v Speaker 1>The liberals are freaking out right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming into their lockers.</v>

2093
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know president trump has named,</v>

2094
01:35:48.621 --> 01:35:51.590
<v Speaker 1>but the liberals are fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're ready to ride like shit on fire.</v>

2095
01:35:51.591 --> 01:35:55.070
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go down to starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked the door in retired army,</v>

2096
01:35:55.071 --> 01:35:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Acting National Security Advisor.</v>

2097
01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Kellogg previously served as Flynn's </v>
<v Speaker 1>chief of staff,</v>

2098
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:02.270
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah,</v>

2099
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.990
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2100
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:06.980
<v Speaker 1>The embattled Flynn blamed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>resignation late Monday on the fast pace</v>

2101
01:36:06.981 --> 01:36:07.814
<v Speaker 1>of events that led him to inadvertently </v>
<v Speaker 1>give vice president pence and others </v>

2102
01:36:11.241 --> 01:36:12.074
<v Speaker 1>incomplete information in quote about </v>
<v Speaker 1>his phone conversations with Russia's </v>

2103
01:36:16.041 --> 01:36:20.140
<v Speaker 1>ambassador to the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S Sergei Kissy Celiac.</v>

2104
01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:21.773
<v Speaker 1>They probably recorded those </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations and if he said anything </v>

2105
01:36:24.021 --> 01:36:28.220
<v Speaker 1>about sanctions being eased up when </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump comes into power,</v>

2106
01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:31.670
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be very unapplied guy.</v>

2107
01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I have sincerely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sincerely apologize To the president,</v>

2108
01:36:36.981 --> 01:36:37.814
<v Speaker 1>the vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have accepted my apology for </v>

2109
01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.800
<v Speaker 1>flynn wrote in his resignation letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2110
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:44.750
<v Speaker 1>This is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really weird.</v>

2111
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:45.643
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pencil defended flynn's contact with </v>

2112
01:36:47.361 --> 01:36:48.194
<v Speaker 1>Russia and when it became clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national security advisor had not </v>

2113
01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:51.524
<v Speaker 1>been forthcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Series questions raised about his </v>

2114
01:36:52.851 --> 01:36:55.220
<v Speaker 1>ability to keep the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking house of cards,</v>

2115
01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:58.220
<v Speaker 1>like house of cards is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially since Russia,</v>

2116
01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:02.600
<v Speaker 1>according to both sides of the aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was probably involved in hacking.</v>

2117
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:03.643
<v Speaker 1>Don't say that you keep saying hacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't do anything that </v>

2118
01:37:06.801 --> 01:37:07.634
<v Speaker 1>actually affected the election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have done something in </v>

2119
01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:11.053
<v Speaker 1>affected people's perceptions and let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>affected the way they votes but the </v>

2120
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:17.090
<v Speaker 1>thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what they did was never disputed.</v>

2121
01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Like when the information they pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2122
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:21.740
<v Speaker 1>no one's ever saying it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying it's true.</v>

2123
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:22.663
<v Speaker 1>So what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they showed that hillary was </v>

2124
01:37:23.901 --> 01:37:25.640
<v Speaker 1>rigging the primaries against bernie </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanders,</v>

2125
01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:27.920
<v Speaker 1>the say that that influenced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>

2126
01:37:27.930 --> 01:37:28.763
<v Speaker 1>Yes it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it influenced it because what they </v>

2127
01:37:30.591 --> 01:37:31.424
<v Speaker 1>did was dirty as fuck and business as </v>
<v Speaker 1>usual and then people got a chance to </v>

2128
01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:35.181
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2129
01:37:35.181 --> 01:37:37.790
<v Speaker 1>they also know that that russian agents </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

2130
01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It's alleged russian agents hacked into </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain dnc computers.</v>

2131
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:46.930
<v Speaker 1>So just high level high level democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all well think there is proof,</v>

2132
01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:50.090
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is even if they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

2133
01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 1>what they released is something that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should know about because we should know</v>

2134
01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:54.734
<v Speaker 1>the democratic party is against one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most popular people of the </v>

2135
01:37:57.571 --> 01:37:58.350
<v Speaker 1>democratic party.</v>

2136
01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 1>There just wasn't playIng ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bernie sanders,</v>

2137
01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 1>bernie sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's legitimately altruistic like</v>

2138
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:07.440
<v Speaker 1>seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a guy was legitimately not</v>

2139
01:38:07.441 --> 01:38:08.274
<v Speaker 1>controlled by money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a guy who is legitimately </v>

2140
01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:13.100
<v Speaker 1>looking maybe even misguided by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics though.</v>

2141
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 1>economist standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even misguided,</v>

2142
01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:20.520
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that he's trying to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>the income inequality in this country in</v>

2143
01:38:20.521 --> 01:38:21.510
<v Speaker 1>some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form,</v>

2144
01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:22.613
<v Speaker 1>at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's opening up the dialogue about it </v>

2145
01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.553
<v Speaker 1>and the Helen Hayes and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are hitting the brakes on that </v>

2146
01:38:27.871 --> 01:38:28.704
<v Speaker 1>shit and we found out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we found out about the crazy </v>

2147
01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:33.840
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found out about hillary talking about</v>

2148
01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:37.800
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and saying that she's against </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in every sense of the word.</v>

2149
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:38.783
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's helping people who are spending </v>

2150
01:38:41.941 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 1>money because they're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money if pod is illegal,</v>

2151
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:47.370
<v Speaker 1>so she's essentially making it okay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>cops,</v>

2152
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:51.250
<v Speaker 1>for jackbooted thugs to lock people up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a fucking cage over pi.</v>

2153
01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:54.870
<v Speaker 1>You're saying she's not just corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a monster.</v>

2154
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:55.743
<v Speaker 1>A person who would say that she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>against marijuana legalization in every </v>

2155
01:38:59.101 --> 01:39:02.340
<v Speaker 1>sense of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person is an enemy of history.</v>

2156
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:03.623
<v Speaker 1>Like you're a selfish monster who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to do something completely </v>

2157
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 1>irrational just for personal gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2158
01:39:12.130 --> 01:39:14.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a knock on hillary from day one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are.</v>

2159
01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:15.713
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole paper trail though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so scare of hair corruption and </v>

2160
01:39:18.721 --> 01:39:21.330
<v Speaker 1>people don't think it's scary because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pot and pot sounds silly,</v>

2161
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:23.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's not about pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about freedom.</v>

2162
01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:24.803
<v Speaker 1>It's about you doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hurt anybody else in somewhat </v>

2163
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.900
<v Speaker 1>deciding that they can lock you in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage because they write some things down</v>

2164
01:39:30.901 --> 01:39:33.930
<v Speaker 1>on paper and it's no different if she </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to do that,</v>

2165
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:36.030
<v Speaker 1>then if someone in this room wants a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

2166
01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:40.320
<v Speaker 1>one of us up for the five of us got </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and one of us wanted to lock us</v>

2167
01:39:40.321 --> 01:39:42.120
<v Speaker 1>up because one of us is smoking pot.</v>

2168
01:39:42.170 --> 01:39:45.390
<v Speaker 1>It's that fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really that stupid.</v>

2169
01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:46.793
<v Speaker 1>It's an insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane law and the fact that she was </v>

2170
01:39:49.231 --> 01:39:52.770
<v Speaker 1>totally down to keep that log going in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every sense of the word.</v>

2171
01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.080
<v Speaker 1>That's an insane person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:55.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that her clinton </v>

2173
01:39:56.131 --> 01:39:58.440
<v Speaker 1>foundation was a pay per flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up what's gone now,</v>

2174
01:39:58.441 --> 01:39:59.274
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

2175
01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:00.253
<v Speaker 1>What a surprise that it folded up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How [inaudible] amazing that she no </v>

2176
01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:03.384
<v Speaker 1>longer has any influence in government </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden the all those </v>

2177
01:40:06.691 --> 01:40:07.524
<v Speaker 1>donations of folded up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a surprise that that was an </v>

2178
01:40:09.241 --> 01:40:10.074
<v Speaker 1>altruistic organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now that they can't grant anybody </v>

2179
01:40:12.121 --> 01:40:13.710
<v Speaker 1>favors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do,</v>

2180
01:40:13.711 --> 01:40:16.170
<v Speaker 1>don't look this up now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're listening uranium one,</v>

2181
01:40:16.171 --> 01:40:21.171
<v Speaker 1>deal a whitewater and travelgate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just those ones and look up how corrupt,</v>

2182
01:40:22.681 --> 01:40:27.560
<v Speaker 1>and this is why a lot of people have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with the ideologues on the left,</v>

2183
01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:31.320
<v Speaker 1>could they won't acknowledge that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everybody that sees that and sees the</v>

2184
01:40:31.321 --> 01:40:32.400
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

2185
01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.593
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just integrated corruption that it's </v>

2186
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:38.690
<v Speaker 1>just almost inoperable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corruptions,</v>

2187
01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:39.533
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see that and they don't want to </v>

2188
01:40:40.861 --> 01:40:43.200
<v Speaker 1>admit it because they say trump is bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you had,</v>

2189
01:40:43.230 --> 01:40:44.063
<v Speaker 1>if you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said trump is bad and they have </v>

2190
01:40:45.661 --> 01:40:48.600
<v Speaker 1>valid concerns about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't negate all the problems</v>

2191
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:49.434
<v Speaker 1>with her place tries elective because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the democrats decided to nominate </v>

2192
01:40:53.651 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 1>somebody</v>

2193
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.813
<v Speaker 3>who in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the democratic voters already told you </v>

2194
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:59.380
<v Speaker 3>they didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't trust women,</v>

2195
01:40:59.381 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 3>didn't trust her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just men.</v>

2196
01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Women didn't trust her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at the end of the day,</v>

2197
01:41:03.701 --> 01:41:04.600
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2198
01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:08.230
<v Speaker 3>the democrats put up a candidate that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people didn't trust.</v>

2199
01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.660
<v Speaker 3>They just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just had a history oF tufts.</v>

2200
01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:13.750
<v Speaker 3>She talked anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Award came out of her mouth.</v>

2201
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:17.740
<v Speaker 3>I didn't believe anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just the most insincere bad actors</v>

2202
01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.810
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her husband,</v>

2203
01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.490
<v Speaker 3>he was mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was believable.</v>

2204
01:41:21.491 --> 01:41:23.560
<v Speaker 3>You wanted to believe bill clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was.</v>

2205
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:26.590
<v Speaker 3>He was just better at line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's terrible at line,</v>

2206
01:41:26.591 --> 01:41:28.080
<v Speaker 3>right it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's terrible.</v>

2207
01:41:28.110 --> 01:41:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in talking you about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is?</v>

2208
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:32.013
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to imagine that the system is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so fucked up that it's missing key </v>

2209
01:41:36.941 --> 01:41:41.230
<v Speaker 3>players so badly that someone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>flawed could get to a position where the</v>

2210
01:41:41.231 --> 01:41:42.064
<v Speaker 3>country has to choose whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>this insanely flawed person gets to run </v>

2211
01:41:45.401 --> 01:41:47.980
<v Speaker 3>the country like that's crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>

2212
01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Many people vicious and our chat and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these smart people,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

2214
01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:56.680
<v Speaker 3>and that's the problem and rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you want that shitty job?</v>

2215
01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm pro slavery.</v>

2216

<v Speaker 3>is it pro trump or against trump?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This worship to me sounds like a,</v>

2278
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:41.200
<v Speaker 3>like a boss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2279
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:44.090
<v Speaker 3>he's a talker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's up in the guide.</v>

2280
01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:44.953
<v Speaker 3>Then I went back and watched the ct was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying while he was running against ted </v>

2281
01:44:47.301 --> 01:44:48.134
<v Speaker 3>cruz and rubio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys seem like they seem like </v>

2282
01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:53.033
<v Speaker 3>they'Re hypnotized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like mk ultra know what they're </v>

2283
01:44:55.161 --> 01:44:56.270
<v Speaker 3>going to say.</v>

2284
01:44:59.630 --> 01:45:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had a problem with trump of what</v>

2285
01:45:01.101 --> 01:45:03.220
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my product that's robberies,</v>

2286
01:45:03.221 --> 01:45:05.410
<v Speaker 3>that he doesn't totally real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2287
01:45:05.411 --> 01:45:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My worry about trump is that he's.</v>

2288
01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.590
<v Speaker 3>I think he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very narcissistic,</v>

2289
01:45:09.591 --> 01:45:10.424
<v Speaker 3>but I also think he doesn't seem that </v>
<v Speaker 3>informed or that interested in knowing </v>

2290
01:45:14.331 --> 01:45:16.120
<v Speaker 3>what he doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was always my way.</v>

2291
01:45:16.130 --> 01:45:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Surround yourself with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2292
01:45:17.610 --> 01:45:20.000
<v Speaker 3>it could be a double cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sold on trump,</v>

2293
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 3>but the one thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank god it's not drunk.</v>

2294
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:26.510
<v Speaker 3>All the payments in the past and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen you do that in a long time.</v>

2295
01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:27.753
<v Speaker 3>I've been here for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to get here from meeting an hour </v>

2296
01:45:29.811 --> 01:45:32.180
<v Speaker 3>early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've been drinking my hit my wall.</v>

2297
01:45:32.630 --> 01:45:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I was just happy that hillary didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>

2298
01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.373
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could have been anybody on the </v>

2299
01:45:36.081 --> 01:45:36.914
<v Speaker 3>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just all the shit on hillary and her </v>

2300
01:45:38.901 --> 01:45:40.790
<v Speaker 3>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that run her shit,</v>

2301
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:42.110
<v Speaker 3>that's too dark for me.</v>

2302
01:45:42.110 --> 01:45:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing.</v>

2303
01:45:43.530 --> 01:45:45.530
<v Speaker 3>So she could have been running against </v>
<v Speaker 3>bozo the clown.</v>

2304
01:45:45.531 --> 01:45:47.050
<v Speaker 3>I would have been bozos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bozo,</v>

2305
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.903
<v Speaker 3>bozo or deez nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a lot of people did just to just </v>

2306
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:53.040
<v Speaker 3>two things that are good about having </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone like trump in order in,</v>

2307
01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:53.933
<v Speaker 3>in office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing is that people are going to </v>

2308
01:45:55.371 --> 01:45:56.204
<v Speaker 3>get energized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they realize that voting works and </v>

2309
01:45:57.591 --> 01:45:58.424
<v Speaker 3>there's real consequences to not voting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the person that you maybe didn't </v>

2310
01:46:01.461 --> 01:46:02.294
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then also we have to reexamine our </v>

2311
01:46:03.561 --> 01:46:04.394
<v Speaker 3>electoral college system that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>created back when people couldn't </v>

2312
01:46:06.471 --> 01:46:08.990
<v Speaker 3>fucking communicate with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>representatives.</v>

2313
01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.153
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't get to Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you just vote on your email or your </v>

2314
01:46:13.551 --> 01:46:15.650
<v Speaker 3>computer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are 100 percent.</v>

2315
01:46:15.651 --> 01:46:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Should be a way that you vote online </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like you can just email,</v>

2316
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.113
<v Speaker 3>email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your email because you have a </v>

2317
01:46:24.471 --> 01:46:25.220
<v Speaker 3>social security number.</v>

2318
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.053
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you should be able to enter </v>

2319
01:46:27.810 --> 01:46:29.750
<v Speaker 3>to enter into an app that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets.</v>

2320
01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:31.280
<v Speaker 3>You have a photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stand there.</v>

2321
01:46:31.281 --> 01:46:33.290
<v Speaker 3>It takes a photo of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes your fingerprint like it does when</v>

2322
01:46:33.291 --> 01:46:36.030
<v Speaker 3>you order something with apple pay or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit and vote.</v>

2323
01:46:36.110 --> 01:46:38.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard to do.</v>

2324
01:46:38.061 --> 01:46:38.894
<v Speaker 3>They can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't want to invest anytime </v>

2325
01:46:40.670 --> 01:46:41.503
<v Speaker 3>and they can control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way easier to control controlled </v>

2326
01:46:44.181 --> 01:46:45.014
<v Speaker 3>groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>AS soon as you have everybody that's </v>

2327
01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:49.250
<v Speaker 3>over 18 having access to vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously,</v>

2328
01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.193
<v Speaker 3>their phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna get a different result and </v>

2329
01:46:51.631 --> 01:46:53.910
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get people like justin </v>
<v Speaker 3>bieber becoming president,</v>

2330
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:57.630
<v Speaker 3>like really like you don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we have a popularity contest.</v>

2331
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:59.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what being the president.</v>

2332
01:46:59.850 --> 01:47:02.340
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the amount of people that</v>

2333
01:47:02.341 --> 01:47:03.174
<v Speaker 3>are on instagram or on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people that have like 49 million </v>

2334
01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:06.774
<v Speaker 3>followers at any given time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those motherfuckers can string </v>

2335
01:47:09.331 --> 01:47:11.430
<v Speaker 3>together some really good sentences and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

2336
01:47:11.431 --> 01:47:13.800
<v Speaker 3>george clooney for president will </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking do it.</v>

2337
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.870
<v Speaker 3>We don't even care if you're good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Katy perry,</v>

2338
01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 3>we'd be so powerful and so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know she can do it.</v>

2339
01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:24.030
<v Speaker 3>Lady gaga could be the fucking president</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the United States.</v>

2340
01:47:24.031 --> 01:47:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Mark my words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was on the superbowl.</v>

2341
01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:31.190
<v Speaker 3>She said she was $100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2342
01:47:31.921 --> 01:47:34.110
<v Speaker 3>Selena gomez can be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll vote for right now.</v>

2343
01:47:34.130 --> 01:47:36.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know who she is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's dating the weekend.</v>

2344
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm so lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so out of the former.</v>

2345
01:47:39.250 --> 01:47:40.083
<v Speaker 3>Next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem you can solve with the </v>

2346
01:47:41.101 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 3>electoral college is that if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just by popular vote like that,</v>

2347
01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.253
<v Speaker 3>then that's one issue with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the fact that states that are </v>

2348
01:47:49.711 --> 01:47:53.130
<v Speaker 3>not very populated would get ignored by </v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

2349
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:56.600
<v Speaker 3>by the government because they don't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignored when it comes.</v>

2350
01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:57.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would do when it comes ignored when </v>

2351
01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:01.320
<v Speaker 3>it comes to passing bills that help </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2352
01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.153
<v Speaker 3>We're getting funding or subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also maybe they'd have to stop god </v>

2353
01:48:04.441 --> 01:48:05.274
<v Speaker 3>fucking card and putting it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and get with the times that </v>

2354
01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:10.360
<v Speaker 3>he's dying from corn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

2355
01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:14.000
<v Speaker 3>there's hope that corn fed on hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

2356
01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never liked the spark that was.</v>

2357
01:48:16.630 --> 01:48:21.180
<v Speaker 3>I was under the impression that pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian brother,</v>

2358
01:48:21.181 --> 01:48:22.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pretty conservative guy,</v>

2359
01:48:22.661 --> 01:48:25.140
<v Speaker 3>but there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no good choices.</v>

2360
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:27.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't pick what he wants to do it.</v>

2361
01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm down to give trump a chance to turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy around.</v>

2362
01:48:31.090 --> 01:48:33.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might after.</v>

2363
01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:35.610
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of programs going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>after them,</v>

2364
01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:39.000
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sold on trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I liked what he said.</v>

2365
01:48:39.090 --> 01:48:41.670
<v Speaker 3>I like that he's honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely,</v>

2366
01:48:42.090 --> 01:48:45.500
<v Speaker 3>he never said he never called mexicans </v>
<v Speaker 3>wetbacks or anything like that.</v>

2367
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:46.343
<v Speaker 3>He just said the same shit clinton said </v>
<v Speaker 3>about immigration in more of a abrasive </v>

2368
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:52.950
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

2369
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:54.590
<v Speaker 3>He was more abrasive about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2370
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.433
<v Speaker 3>it bill clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said all the same shit that people </v>

2371
01:48:57.751 --> 01:49:01.200
<v Speaker 3>are upset sucked in the lighthouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a big deal and it's not a big</v>

2372
01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:01.950
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2373
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:03.870
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let him go.</v>

2374
01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:05.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a political.</v>

2375
01:49:05.110 --> 01:49:05.943
<v Speaker 3>Jfk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jfk had an affair with Marilyn Monroe </v>

2376
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:08.910
<v Speaker 3>was married.</v>

2377
01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:17.440
<v Speaker 3>He had an 11 affairs during.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be bullshit.</v>

2378
01:49:17.461 --> 01:49:18.620
<v Speaker 3>That could be disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2379
01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:22.670
<v Speaker 3>well here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my question though.</v>

2380
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:23.743
<v Speaker 3>Get chlamydia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should Donald Trump say anything </v>

2381
01:49:26.041 --> 01:49:28.380
<v Speaker 3>positive happens from this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be.</v>

2382
01:49:28.381 --> 01:49:29.214
<v Speaker 3>It's going to inspire other people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like unconventional type candidates </v>

2383
01:49:32.371 --> 01:49:34.990
<v Speaker 3>to run that might be better or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to time.</v>

2384
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

2385
01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump thinks the economy is doing well.</v>

2386
01:49:39.181 --> 01:49:40.430
<v Speaker 3>He'll get another shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2387
01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:42.300
<v Speaker 3>it's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2388
01:49:42.301 --> 01:49:45.660
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I like about trump is the cia is so</v>

2389
01:49:45.661 --> 01:49:47.620
<v Speaker 3>against him.</v>

2435
01:51:58.061 --> 01:52:00.460

<v Speaker 2>don't know if you guys know I'm an alpha</v>

2436
01:52:00.461 --> 01:52:01.294
<v Speaker 2>male,</v>

<v Speaker 2>She had a tear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:06.160
<v Speaker 2>You could tie your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2440
01:52:06.161 --> 01:52:06.994
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd sit in a chair and theRe was a </v>

2441
01:52:07.811 --> 01:52:11.980
<v Speaker 2>hole in the chair and your balls and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cock would hang between the chair.</v>

2442
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.883
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet she would put a a a ring at the </v>

2443
01:52:15.941 --> 01:52:18.460
<v Speaker 2>base of your life where you're cocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>your balls,</v>

2444
01:52:18.461 --> 01:52:19.294
<v Speaker 2>meat and then you'd be chained to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor and then she'd do whatever the </v>

2445
01:52:22.241 --> 01:52:25.390
<v Speaker 2>fuck she wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she said that her biggest clientele</v>

2446
01:52:25.391 --> 01:52:27.130
<v Speaker 2>were all lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly lawyers.</v>

2447
01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:29.050
<v Speaker 2>There were something about lawyers like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be dominant.</v>

2448
01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Did she kick you in the balls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be a.</v>

2449
01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:33.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do with you today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of.</v>

2450
01:52:33.671 --> 01:52:34.504
<v Speaker 2>Those guys brought me there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're super superintendent </v>

2451
01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:39.230
<v Speaker 2>seeing those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>brian,</v>

2452
01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 2>both they're guys.</v>

2453
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:47.383
<v Speaker 1>When I worked at the strip club as a dj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was guys that would come in and </v>

2454
01:52:50.421 --> 01:52:51.254
<v Speaker 1>they would sit in the lap dance booth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and want the girls in nam and the ball </v>

2455
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:58.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck is wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one a year.</v>

2456
01:52:58.130 --> 01:52:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One free.</v>

2457
01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys like to be caught.</v>

2458
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:04.370
<v Speaker 1>They liked to be electrocuted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to like to feel.</v>

2459
01:53:04.371 --> 01:53:05.204
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also some real </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific inquiry into this and they </v>

2460
01:53:09.261 --> 01:53:11.480
<v Speaker 1>think there's some people feel pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

2461
01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:12.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can be born with something wrong </v>

2462
01:53:16.731 --> 01:53:17.570
<v Speaker 1>with your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2463
01:53:17.571 --> 01:53:19.910
<v Speaker 1>If you could be born with some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth defect,</v>

2464
01:53:19.911 --> 01:53:20.744
<v Speaker 1>why can't you be born with some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a defect in the way your body senses </v>

2465
01:53:24.111 --> 01:53:26.360
<v Speaker 1>pain and apps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just assuming like,</v>

2466
01:53:26.361 --> 01:53:27.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like pain.</v>

2467
01:53:27.111 --> 01:53:28.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't like pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2468
01:53:28.071 --> 01:53:28.640
<v Speaker 1>fuck payments.</v>

2469
01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:29.473
<v Speaker 1>be off with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some people are numb and pain </v>

2470
01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:36.710
<v Speaker 1>gives them like a vital shot in the arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>to let them know they're still alive.</v>

2471
01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:39.080
<v Speaker 1>That's why people a lot of depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like tattoos.</v>

2472
01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to richard,</v>

2473
01:53:41.811 --> 01:53:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Richard Walter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a big time profiler for sadism,</v>

2474
01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:47.900
<v Speaker 1>he's guy wrote the double helix </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically on,</v>

2475
01:53:48.230 --> 01:53:51.080
<v Speaker 1>on serial killers and what makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how a serial killer becomes,</v>

2476
01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he solves a lot of these cold cases,</v>

2477
01:53:53.511 --> 01:53:56.030
<v Speaker 1>but he's an fbi profiler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deals with the worst cases,</v>

2478
01:53:56.031 --> 01:53:57.510
<v Speaker 1>like the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real estate.</v>

2479
01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And he said every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always so certain.</v>

2480
01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:02.000
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2481
01:54:02.010 --> 01:54:04.670
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people that get off on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the act of killing,</v>

2482
01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:07.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact they'll almost kill you then</v>

2483
01:54:07.281 --> 01:54:08.960
<v Speaker 1>bring it back to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real sick fuckers.</v>

2484
01:54:08.961 --> 01:54:13.040
<v Speaker 1>But he said all of those people eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>including cannibals and things.</v>

2485
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:17.600
<v Speaker 1>They all are getting a sexual charge out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whatever it is.</v>

2486
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:18.583
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They Do.</v>

2487
01:54:18.690 --> 01:54:20.990
<v Speaker 1>So regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2488
01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:24.350
<v Speaker 1>it's power over the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to him,</v>

2489
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:25.940
<v Speaker 1>there's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2490
01:54:25.941 --> 01:54:29.440
<v Speaker 1>there's always a sexual drive for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2491
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:31.930
<v Speaker 1>like the one guy who they found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2492
01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.100
<v Speaker 1>this terry was a cannibal and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>

2493
01:54:34.330 --> 01:54:36.500
<v Speaker 1>he killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed his two wives and they caught him</v>

2494
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:37.161
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2495
01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:37.994
<v Speaker 1>he just would do all these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and he couldn't feel when you </v>

2496
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:42.260
<v Speaker 1>found him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had add happens.</v>

2497
01:54:42.261 --> 01:54:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is in the forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>

2498
01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:46.880
<v Speaker 1>They had hat pins in his ass and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

2499
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:47.803
<v Speaker 1>He had pins in his balls and hat pins </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffed in his ass and he was walking </v>

2500
01:54:51.681 --> 01:54:55.490
<v Speaker 1>around and he said that basically he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble feeling anything,</v>

2501
01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:56.653
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he would stick these needles in </v>

2502
01:54:59.091 --> 01:55:01.070
<v Speaker 1>his balls and they found him with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there was cops that were outside while </v>

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.610
<v Speaker 1>See if that's true,</v>

2526
01:55:56.611 --> 01:55:57.444
<v Speaker 1>that it was such a gruesome horrific </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene that some first responders </v>

<v Speaker 1>committed suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people like I,</v>

2528
01:56:03.511 --> 01:56:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I got in like debate with people online </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

01:56:05.851 --> 01:56:06.361
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>takes his medication will be fine,</v>

2531
01:56:09.850 --> 01:56:10.471
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2532
01:56:10.471 --> 01:56:11.304
<v Speaker 1>even if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that someone could ever in </v>

2533
01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:15.054
<v Speaker 1>their existence and their time and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness on earth be capable of </v>

2534
01:56:17.821 --> 01:56:21.570
<v Speaker 1>sawing someone's head off with a knife </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then eating their eyeballs on a bus.</v>

2535
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't ever let them out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sight because he never did that until he</v>

2536
01:56:25.891 --> 01:56:26.724
<v Speaker 1>did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never did that until he did it once </v>

2537
01:56:28.590 --> 01:56:29.423
<v Speaker 1>and then he did it once.</v>

2538
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Now you know he can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for you to let him go,</v>

2539
01:56:32.161 --> 01:56:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you say about mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness that is so irresponsible,</v>

2540
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not have a relapse.</v>

2541
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:39.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to react to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

2542
01:56:39.210 --> 01:56:41.130

<v Speaker 1>Then it happened,</v>

2543
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:43.860
<v Speaker 1>which means it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way about pedophiles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2545
01:56:44.941 --> 01:56:48.900
<v Speaker 1>if you raped a child and you go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the therapy in the world,</v>

2549

<v Speaker 1>that people ate the eyeballs and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know any better.</v>

01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:42.240
<v Speaker 1>You can get arrested if you say things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about certain people,</v>

2566
01:57:42.450 --> 01:57:44.660
<v Speaker 1>like they don't have freedom of speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we have it.</v>

2567
01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:45.893
<v Speaker 1>They have like these human rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>councils that decide whether or not you </v>

<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>

2575
01:58:12.110 --> 01:58:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Pearson is a big part of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>push back.</v>

2576
01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.113
<v Speaker 1>Without him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that would have just been </v>

2577
01:58:16.381 --> 01:58:19.680
<v Speaker 1>swallowed up by the academics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the first academics to stand</v>

2578
01:58:19.681 --> 01:58:20.880
<v Speaker 1>up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

2579
01:58:20.970 --> 01:58:21.803
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking crazy and this is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling people and when you start </v>

2580
01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.073
<v Speaker 1>controlling people like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes down this dirty road and this </v>

2581
01:58:27.331 --> 01:58:28.164
<v Speaker 1>dirty road is a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's dirty road is like ideologies </v>

2582
01:58:32.401 --> 01:58:33.234
<v Speaker 1>and dominating your patterns of speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole marketplace of somebody </v>

2583
01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:37.433
<v Speaker 1>say genda exactly what the agenda of </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality that great fuzzy in topeka and </v>

2584
01:58:42.131 --> 01:58:43.720
<v Speaker 1>the sky and if you listen to Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>

2585
01:58:43.721 --> 01:58:46.720
<v Speaker 1>he knows so much about marxism that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows you like,</v>

2586
01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:49.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a pattern of human thinking.</v>

2587
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:52.750
<v Speaker 1>It starts off by people that were really</v>
<v Speaker 1>well intentioned.</v>

2588
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:55.270
<v Speaker 1>they're intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very kind,</v>

2589
01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:56.860
<v Speaker 1>they're sympathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're progressive,</v>

2590
01:58:56.861 --> 01:58:57.694
<v Speaker 1>and they want everyone to be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the ways they do it is to be </v>

2591
01:59:00.941 --> 01:59:03.010
<v Speaker 1>really evil to people they think are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>

2592
01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:04.083
<v Speaker 1>and then you create this fucking war </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they look at them as predators </v>

2593
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:10.690
<v Speaker 1>and they're sort of like infantiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>date.</v>

2594
01:59:10.691 --> 01:59:12.940
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that people on the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side don't look at it that way.</v>

2595
01:59:12.941 --> 01:59:13.774
<v Speaker 1>So you're starting this thing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating to shored up defenses in walls </v>

2596
01:59:18.191 --> 01:59:19.280
<v Speaker 1>of offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2597
01:59:19.281 --> 01:59:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push in,</v>

2598
01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 1>you start multisoft cocktail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities that have given speeches by</v>

2599
01:59:24.341 --> 01:59:26.300
<v Speaker 1>guys who were republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You create a like that.</v>

2600
01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Uc Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened with milo?</v>

2601

<v Speaker 1>fucking building to save his life like </v>

<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

2604

<v Speaker 1>I thought berkeley was so tolerant on </v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2611
01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Not nothing compared to the reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's getting nothing.</v>

2612
01:59:55.901 --> 01:59:56.734
<v Speaker 1>He's mostly a half of a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like half of a comedian when he </v>

2613
02:00:00.231 --> 02:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>says things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's bitchy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It is one of the funniest things ever.</v>

2616
02:00:07.661 --> 02:00:08.494
<v Speaker 1>They're calling this guy nazi and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>white supremacist slogan of his tour </v>

2617
02:00:10.801 --> 02:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 10th a dangerous faggot tour,</v>

2618
02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:15.070
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gay,</v>

2619
02:00:15.190 --> 02:00:16.023
<v Speaker 1>he's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he talks about his love of black </v>

2620
02:00:17.441 --> 02:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2621
02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:22.900
<v Speaker 1>he taLks about how the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a writer and a troll,</v>

2622
02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>but like an intelligent troll and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>british guy who's got people on.</v>

2623
02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>If you look at what they said it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he said a rude,</v>

2624
02:00:32.261 --> 02:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>racist shit organized some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack on leslie jones,</v>

2625
02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2626
02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>if you look at what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2627
02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>if how responsible is someone who cracks</v>
<v Speaker 1>a joke about someone.</v>

2628
02:00:44.650 --> 02:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Like he said something about leslie </v>
<v Speaker 1>jones wouldn't be the first time I was.</v>

2629
02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I was turned down by a black man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2630
02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>like something along those lines like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitchy but funny.</v>

2631
02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>And for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for that,</v>

2632
02:00:55.451 --> 02:00:56.284
<v Speaker 1>for saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she was mad at his review or </v>

2633
02:00:57.641 --> 02:00:58.474
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was his followers started sending her </v>

2634
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>horrible come maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

2635
02:01:01.961 --> 02:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>how much of that can you push onto him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't control that.</v>

2636
02:01:05.110 --> 02:01:05.943
<v Speaker 1>You can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not with what I'm saying is if </v>

2637
02:01:07.781 --> 02:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>you look at what he actually said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's grounds for a band,</v>

2638
02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with some extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship.</v>

2639
02:01:13.570 --> 02:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to figure out like when is</v>
<v Speaker 1>he responsible?</v>

2640
02:01:16.211 --> 02:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>So he did he say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

2641
02:01:17.561 --> 02:01:18.610
<v Speaker 1>go get him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no he didn't,</v>

2642
02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>but you know who did do that is leslie </v>
<v Speaker 1>jones.</v>

2643
02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:22.083
<v Speaker 1>There was a tweet where leslie jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was attacking her and she was </v>

2644
02:01:24.461 --> 02:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get them to that person.</v>

2645
02:01:26.530 --> 02:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is like,</v>

2646
02:01:27.491 --> 02:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's her prerogative too.</v>

2647
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And started attacking this woman who's a</v>

2648
02:01:31.811 --> 02:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>very hilarious comedian for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2649
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:35.323
<v Speaker 1>I think she should be able to say fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and do it publicly and say go get </v>

2650
02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:38.893
<v Speaker 1>him her fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my point is my low never said that </v>

2651
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:42.793
<v Speaker 1>milo literally never said go get him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet he was sort of held responsible </v>

2652
02:01:47.690 --> 02:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>for things that other people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

2653
02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:50.653
<v Speaker 1>There's so many crazy people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you can control them and </v>

2654
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>then you could just like say like people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who like bryan county,</v>

2655
02:01:56.061 --> 02:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>you are responsible for those people.</v>

2656
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:58.603
<v Speaker 1>You have to set a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to kick you off our </v>

2657
02:01:59.661 --> 02:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially what they're saying.</v>

2658
02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Crazy sweared Their prerogative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pull up to what he asks.</v>

2659
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you're not going to change</v>

2660
02:02:09.130 --> 02:02:09.963
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always have to remember that if you </v>

2661
02:02:10.821 --> 02:02:11.654
<v Speaker 1>disagree with the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is to try to get them to agree </v>

2662
02:02:14.541 --> 02:02:15.374
<v Speaker 1>with you or try to come up with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a consensus so you can move </v>

2663
02:02:17.451 --> 02:02:18.284
<v Speaker 1>ideas forward to move the world forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we have with this kind of </v>

2664
02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>reaction to milo is if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do $100,000</v>

2665
02:02:23.901 --> 02:02:24.734
<v Speaker 1>worth of damage in your protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's fine and milo have to be </v>

2666
02:02:27.681 --> 02:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>escorted out and you won't listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you close your mind.</v>

2667
02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You're not moving anything forward or </v>
<v Speaker 1>making anything better though.</v>

2668
02:02:32.871 --> 02:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>You're juSt creating a big old division.</v>

2669
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And I guess you guys can stay in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>echo chamber.</v>

2670
02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:38.853
<v Speaker 1>They all stay in their echo chamber and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody will listen to each other and we </v>

2671
02:02:40.851 --> 02:02:41.684
<v Speaker 1>won't learn anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just a product of being </v>

2672
02:02:43.821 --> 02:02:44.654
<v Speaker 1>raised in this system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this two party system and this </v>

2673
02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous idea that there's us and them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now that they're in,</v>

2674
02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:52.191
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2675
02:02:52.191 --> 02:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>all people have to fight back and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to punch nazis.</v>

2676
02:02:54.990 --> 02:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>So this crazy shit that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

2677
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>But when you listen to what milo </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually says,</v>

2678
02:02:59.181 --> 02:03:01.550
<v Speaker 1>even if you disagree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I do all the time,</v>

2679
02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.140
<v Speaker 1>like I disagree witH a lot of what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

2680
02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sam harris put it best.</v>

2681
02:03:05.541 --> 02:03:07.670
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of it is like a performance.</v>

2682
02:03:08.090 --> 02:03:08.923
<v Speaker 1>It's like he seems insincere a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the times and he's very acutely aware </v>

2683
02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:12.884
<v Speaker 1>that is generating response and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that he's saying that they're </v>

2684
02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:16.320
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2685
02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>that they're saying that he's racist or </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

2686
02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:23.060
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible white nationalists or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this is just making stuff</v>

2687
02:03:23.061 --> 02:03:26.870
<v Speaker 1>up so that they can start attacking him </v>
<v Speaker 1>more freely because it's easier.</v>

2688
02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:28.610
<v Speaker 1>What he said is definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>

2689
02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Controversial he said is some of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely rude.</v>

2690
02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it doesn't make any sense.</v>

2691
02:03:34.641 --> 02:03:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pro circumcision because he doesn't</v>

2692
02:03:37.041 --> 02:03:38.960
<v Speaker 1>want dicks to have extra skin hanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>off of him.</v>

2693
02:03:38.961 --> 02:03:41.270
<v Speaker 1>He says he'll fight with you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2694
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:42.020
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2695
02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:43.820
<v Speaker 1>he's a catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he is.</v>

2696
02:03:43.821 --> 02:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2697
02:03:44.410 --> 02:03:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I Believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2698
02:03:46.071 --> 02:03:48.170
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catholicism is the best religion.</v>

2699
02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:49.650
<v Speaker 1>it's the moSt amazing religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super,</v>

2700
02:03:49.690 --> 02:03:50.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy.</v>

2701
02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.393
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you started making in front of jones </v>

2702
02:03:53.331 --> 02:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>and we wrote an article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2703
02:03:54.951 --> 02:03:57.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say one thing that he wrote an </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

2704
02:03:57.130 --> 02:03:59.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he did a horrible,</v>

2705
02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:02.810
<v Speaker 1>mean critique of the new ghost busters </v>
<v Speaker 1>for women.</v>

2706
02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:03.853
<v Speaker 1>and he said essentially that it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a feminist film and he pointed out some </v>

2707
02:04:06.381 --> 02:04:07.250
<v Speaker 1>really important shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2708
02:04:07.251 --> 02:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>every guy in the movie is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot and every woman's saves the world.</v>

2709
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of ridiculous.</v>

2710
02:04:12.051 --> 02:04:14.330
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

2711
02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:15.573
<v Speaker 1>I'm so he writes this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was getting hate mail from his </v>

2712
02:04:17.841 --> 02:04:19.520
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess from his thing,</v>

2713
02:04:19.521 --> 02:04:22.220
<v Speaker 1>racial abuse that she was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2714
02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:24.800
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets hate mail for fuck's for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck sake.</v>

2715
02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:28.460
<v Speaker 1>One tweet read another one called jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely literate.</v>

2716
02:04:28.670 --> 02:04:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she shared fake screenshots.</v>

2717
02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:32.173
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shared frakes screenshots that made </v>

2718
02:04:33.291 --> 02:04:34.124
<v Speaker 1>it appear of jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're making profane and offensive </v>

2719
02:04:36.111 --> 02:04:39.440
<v Speaker 1>postings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter didn't saY exactly why it band.</v>

2720
02:04:39.441 --> 02:04:40.274
<v Speaker 1>He annapolis only telling breitbart </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer that he was permanently banned </v>

2721
02:04:42.721 --> 02:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>for violation of the company's rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibiting participation in or exciting</v>

2722
02:04:46.591 --> 02:04:50.730
<v Speaker 1>targeted use of individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what makes that like,</v>

2723
02:04:50.731 --> 02:04:51.564
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see like if he was post </v>

2724
02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.820
<v Speaker 1>retweeting things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were very rude,</v>

2725
02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see what those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

2726
02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Probably pretty see how rude they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they were silly.</v>

2727

2777
02:06:45.961 --> 02:06:47.280
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a cool thing to do,</v>

2778
02:06:47.610 --> 02:06:51.570
<v Speaker 1>but what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he insights talk and because of that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His book is now number one on the amazon</v>

<v Speaker 1>really interesting guy in a lot of ways.</v>

2783
02:07:04.110 --> 02:07:06.210
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him off air.</v>

2784
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:08.580
<v Speaker 1>He's a very intelligent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very cordial,</v>

2785
02:07:08.581 --> 02:07:09.414
<v Speaker 1>very good to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed talking to him and we </v>

2786
02:07:11.551 --> 02:07:12.384
<v Speaker 1>joked around a lot when we did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast together because I grilled them </v>

2787
02:07:14.371 --> 02:07:16.770
<v Speaker 1>about certain things I think are </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and eventually gives them.</v>

2788
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Starts laughing with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy,</v>

2789
02:07:19.951 --> 02:07:20.784
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is a real as the </v>

2790
02:07:23.101 --> 02:07:23.934
<v Speaker 1>real him or if this is him doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance or if it's combination of </v>

2791
02:07:26.221 --> 02:07:27.054
<v Speaker 1>both or if he's finding himself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>midst of this hurricane of negativity </v>

2792
02:07:30.331 --> 02:07:31.164
<v Speaker 1>and popularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would it be just assuming that </v>

2793
02:07:32.821 --> 02:07:35.830
<v Speaker 1>he's bullet proof that he can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by this fucking crazy or deal</v>

2794
02:07:35.831 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>that he's</v>

2795
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:38.500
<v Speaker 2>going through and occasionally do shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he shouldn't have done.</v>

2796
02:07:38.501 --> 02:07:41.110
<v Speaker 2>like reposting some horrible racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2797
02:07:41.530 --> 02:07:43.750
<v Speaker 2>He's young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's maybe 30 something.</v>

2798
02:07:43.751 --> 02:07:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old is he made a point.</v>

2799
02:07:45.611 --> 02:07:46.444
<v Speaker 2>That's a really interesting point you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just said that made about if this is </v>

2800
02:07:48.821 --> 02:07:50.790
<v Speaker 2>like in transition like so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure he is.</v>

2801
02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:51.633
<v Speaker 2>He's a growing just like all of us are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even like it depends on how you can </v>

2802
02:07:54.311 --> 02:07:55.144
<v Speaker 2>catch somebody in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a moment where they can sound if you </v>

2803
02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:01.030
<v Speaker 2>already sound like themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's young.</v>

2804
02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:03.430
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you.</v>

2805
02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like,</v>

2806
02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:05.593
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely disagree With retweeting </v>

2807
02:08:06.551 --> 02:08:09.490
<v Speaker 2>that racist picture of leslie jones </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking like a gorilla.</v>

2808
02:08:09.550 --> 02:08:12.640
<v Speaker 2>This one guy who said something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was at the when,</v>

2809
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:16.150

<v Speaker 2>shot up during a performance?</v>

2810
02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:18.330
<v Speaker 2>He was in the band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe christ.</v>

2811
02:08:18.610 --> 02:08:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Remember when?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When those guys opened fire,</v>

2814
02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:26.913
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said something about islam right </v>

2815
02:08:30.971 --> 02:08:31.950
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2816
02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:32.813
<v Speaker 2>he's in and he was emotional and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>had died and it was this concert and he </v>

2817
02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:40.360
<v Speaker 2>saw some all kinds of stuff and he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they picked up and he did</v>

2818
02:08:40.361 --> 02:08:41.194
<v Speaker 2>an inteRview because they just did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary on it and he said something </v>

2819
02:08:43.481 --> 02:08:44.980
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

2820
02:08:44.981 --> 02:08:48.640
<v Speaker 2>you said something about islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have any regret about that?</v>

2821
02:08:48.641 --> 02:08:50.050
<v Speaker 2>And it was pretty racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he saId,</v>

2822
02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:50.770
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

2823
02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:52.630
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love people.</v>

2824
02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:53.493
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of muslims fans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else said what happened there </v>

2825
02:08:56.081 --> 02:08:59.410
<v Speaker 2>was my emotions were so heightened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

2826
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:00.573
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a span of time where I was </v>

2827
02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:04.473
<v Speaker 2>thinking in a very emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncharacteristic way that I usually am </v>

2828
02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:11.950
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

2829
02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:16.210
<v Speaker 2>I was hot off of something tragic and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even know how to make sense of it</v>

2830
02:09:16.590 --> 02:09:17.423
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to reread what I said </v>

2831
02:09:18.941 --> 02:09:22.870
<v Speaker 2>because that's not who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that sliver of time,</v>

2832
02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:25.810
<v Speaker 2>that's how I was feeling and I lashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in paint.</v>

2833
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:29.080
<v Speaker 2>It's very honest way of putting it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought that that's why we have to</v>

2834
02:09:29.081 --> 02:09:29.914
<v Speaker 2>be careful about taking quotes and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>applying that to a peRson's entire </v>

2835
02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:34.353
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

2836
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:38.860
<v Speaker 2>This was a guy in the band after he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said something about islam,</v>

2837
02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:40.420
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it made me think about that.</v>

2838
02:09:40.421 --> 02:09:41.254
<v Speaker 2>We do this all the time where we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said that one thing you said a </v>

2839
02:09:43.061 --> 02:09:44.110
<v Speaker 2>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2840
02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:47.440
<v Speaker 2>let's highlight that and let's just say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who the man is.</v>

2841
02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:48.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be careful.</v>

2842
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:51.700
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes you'll be held accountable </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what you're tweeting.</v>

2843
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:53.740
<v Speaker 2>You're doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't always give everyone a pass,</v>

2844
02:09:53.741 --> 02:09:55.270
<v Speaker 2>but all he's just going through a rough </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2845
02:09:55.271 --> 02:09:57.700
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's held accountable too.</v>

2846
02:09:57.701 --> 02:09:59.260
<v Speaker 2>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true too,</v>

2847
02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:02.860
<v Speaker 2>but we also have to recognize that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>at 33 years of age,</v>

2848
02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:04.280
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2849
02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:05.133
<v Speaker 2>I was a moron when I was 33 and if I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten drunk and I decided to retweet </v>

2850
02:10:08.441 --> 02:10:09.274
<v Speaker 2>some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank god twitter wasn't arounD theN I </v>

2851
02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:13.510
<v Speaker 2>want to say the student is that young </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if he's a smart,</v>

2852
02:10:13.511 --> 02:10:15.340
<v Speaker 2>yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We say stupid shit all the time.</v>

2853
02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Who was doing stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've know.</v>

2854
02:10:16.890 --> 02:10:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Retweet anything raCist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty three.</v>

2855
02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not racist,</v>

2856
02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:23.530
<v Speaker 2>but with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a pattern.</v>

2857
02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't get a free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

2858
02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:27.093
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's his whole thing is courting </v>

2859
02:10:29.021 --> 02:10:29.854
<v Speaker 2>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's essentially what he's doing by </v>

2860
02:10:31.661 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 2>saying feminism is cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's</v>

2861
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.813
<v Speaker 1>organizing a fistfight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's calling them out and he's </v>

2862
02:10:36.861 --> 02:10:39.950
<v Speaker 1>organizing a verbal fiscal saves </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably on adderall,</v>

2863
02:10:39.951 --> 02:10:40.784
<v Speaker 1>so he's talking to 100 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really articulate and he's gay and </v>

2864
02:10:44.211 --> 02:10:45.044
<v Speaker 1>he looks fabulous and he's got bleached </v>
<v Speaker 1>blonde hair and he wears clothes and </v>

2865
02:10:48.411 --> 02:10:49.910
<v Speaker 1>when he's killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on stage,</v>

2866
02:10:49.911 --> 02:10:50.744
<v Speaker 1>he's a very good orator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's engaging them in these debates </v>

2867
02:10:53.751 --> 02:10:55.910
<v Speaker 1>that he's got carefully thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>responses,</v>

2868
02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.060
<v Speaker 1>carefully thought out sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely knows what he's doing.</v>

2869
02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:01.383
<v Speaker 1>He definitely knows what he's talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was your conversation with Henry </v>

2870
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Rollins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of articles,</v>

2871
02:11:06.531 --> 02:11:08.950
<v Speaker 1>kitten little pony with this racism </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2872
02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

2873
02:11:11.331 --> 02:11:13.250
<v Speaker 1>He's a good looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Handsome fellow.</v>

2874
02:11:13.251 --> 02:11:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's profound love of black dick.</v>

2875
02:11:15.441 --> 02:11:16.274
<v Speaker 1>He talks about all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also one more way that they </v>

2876
02:11:18.321 --> 02:11:22.730
<v Speaker 1>have a hard time attacking him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a gay jew that loves black dick.</v>

2877
02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got the spectrum covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2878
02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:27.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a triangle sensibility that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>around him.</v>

2879
02:11:29.690 --> 02:11:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Brian's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are good talking.</v>

2880
02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:40.080
<v Speaker 1>One time brian know you're all right </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2881
02:11:42.670 --> 02:11:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I think you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

2882
02:11:44.290 --> 02:11:47.750
<v Speaker 1>This is what fascism is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't enforce your view of the world</v>

2883
02:11:47.751 --> 02:11:48.584
<v Speaker 1>on people through violence because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing when you're a </v>

2884
02:11:50.181 --> 02:11:52.400
<v Speaker 1>fascist and that's what people need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

2885
02:11:52.401 --> 02:11:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just use the word fascist</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it applies to right wing people.</v>

2886
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:57.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're keeping people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating,</v>

2887
02:11:57.710 --> 02:11:58.543
<v Speaker 1>you're keeping a gay jew from talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit on your stage and you can't just </v>

2888
02:12:01.491 --> 02:12:04.100
<v Speaker 1>counter what he saying with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's better at talking shit.</v>

2889
02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:05.053
<v Speaker 1>That is better points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead you want to throw a chair </v>

2890
02:12:06.981 --> 02:12:09.110
<v Speaker 1>through the window at fucking starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2891
02:12:09.111 --> 02:12:10.860
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are fascist,</v>

2892
02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:13.250
<v Speaker 1>fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you think you're right,</v>

2893
02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:15.680
<v Speaker 1>the way you're doing it is 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2894
02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:18.800
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the guys on a nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not someone who's,</v>

2895
02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:21.380
<v Speaker 1>even if he has said a racist thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

2896
02:12:21.381 --> 02:12:22.370
<v Speaker 1>he's not the first.</v>

2897
02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking comedian has said racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2898
02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:27.800
<v Speaker 1>let's Dog herself had a bunch of racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2899
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:31.130
<v Speaker 1>They pulled off her twitter page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't hate her for that.</v>

2900
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:32.690
<v Speaker 1>She had a bunch of shit about white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2901
02:12:32.691 --> 02:12:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Just generalizing about white people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

2902
02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:38.570
<v Speaker 1>If you ever did that about black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get blackballed from hollywood</v>

2903
02:12:38.571 --> 02:12:39.404
<v Speaker 1>for life of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we will allow a certain amount of </v>

2904
02:12:41.811 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit to come out of people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouths if we think that you're not a bad</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll say it again.</v>

2908
02:12:49.401 --> 02:12:52.580
<v Speaker 1>The way you beat a bad idea is with </v>

<v Speaker 1>He's lucky to get maced in the face on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trailer.</v>

2920
02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.770
<v Speaker 1>You need more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need more than mace to fight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jake shields got problem with macy's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see.</v>

2922
02:13:35.731 --> 02:13:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And if people just jump on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't look.</v>

2923
02:13:37.351 --> 02:13:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably jack,</v>

2924
02:13:38.671 --> 02:13:39.504
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of them that come anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>near him you can't see and someone hits </v>

2925
02:13:42.331 --> 02:13:43.560
<v Speaker 1>you over the back of the head with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2926
02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:44.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucking people are doing exactly </v>

2927
02:13:46.501 --> 02:13:48.390
<v Speaker 1>what they would hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I see people,</v>

2928
02:13:48.391 --> 02:13:49.224
<v Speaker 1>like there's people that are calling out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for who they're calling out for a </v>

2929
02:13:51.841 --> 02:13:53.910
<v Speaker 1>military coup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're calling out for them.</v>

2930
02:13:54.090 --> 02:13:54.923
<v Speaker 1>I've seen more than one person say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the military needs to step in and </v>

2931
02:13:57.841 --> 02:13:58.950
<v Speaker 1>take our country back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2932
02:13:59.100 --> 02:13:59.933
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is patrick swayze movie from the </v>

2933
02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:03.383
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're thinking exactly the way of </v>

2934
02:14:04.401 --> 02:14:07.650
<v Speaker 1>fastest would or a tyrant would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have a different target.</v>

2935
02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:08.533
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I always say to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how many people think </v>

2936
02:14:11.281 --> 02:14:14.170
<v Speaker 1>exactly like their enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly like their enemy.</v>

2937
02:14:14.190 --> 02:14:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I want to kill all of them or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet they're just.</v>

2938
02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:19.080
<v Speaker 1>The only difference is they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different target.</v>

2939
02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:21.630
<v Speaker 1>But it's crazy when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate contest,</v>

2940
02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:22.493
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a legitimate popularity contest </v>

2941
02:14:23.731 --> 02:14:26.370
<v Speaker 1>and one guy wins and you're not happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the guy wins.</v>

2942
02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:29.550
<v Speaker 1>So you want to start riots like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might.</v>

2943
02:14:29.610 --> 02:14:33.300
<v Speaker 1>You might have fucked up and not voted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you might not have done such good job</v>

2944
02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:35.430
<v Speaker 1>picking a candidate or you might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the wrong campaign,</v>

2945
02:14:35.850 --> 02:14:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but you have to accept when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>wins.</v>

2946
02:14:38.701 --> 02:14:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise there's no fucking point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And having his contest,</v>

2947
02:14:41.730 --> 02:14:44.820
<v Speaker 1>we have this contest every four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't accept to one,</v>

2948
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:47.040
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cheating,</v>

2949
02:14:47.041 --> 02:14:50.100
<v Speaker 1>whatever the cheating happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably happened on both sides.</v>

2950
02:14:50.190 --> 02:14:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Whatever legal shit they got away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever shenanigans and the pr they did</v>

2951
02:14:54.811 --> 02:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>to him with the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2952
02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:57.840
<v Speaker 1>grab them by the pussy thing and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2953
02:14:57.841 --> 02:14:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2954
02:14:58.350 --> 02:15:00.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a tax left and right on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>

2955
02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.970
<v Speaker 1>He came out ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People aren't happy.</v>

2956
02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I might understand that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>

2957
02:15:04.471 --> 02:15:05.304
<v Speaker 1>but you can't think that you can start a</v>
<v Speaker 1>riot now because you didn't want him to </v>

2958
02:15:08.791 --> 02:15:09.510
<v Speaker 1>be in there.</v>

2959
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:13.320
<v Speaker 1>They had a stupid fucking contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won stupid fucking contest.</v>

2960
02:15:13.410 --> 02:15:14.243
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're having a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking contests to see who runs the </v>

2961
02:15:16.621 --> 02:15:18.840
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it's important to have a little</v>

2962
02:15:18.841 --> 02:15:21.300
<v Speaker 1>compassion for the other side in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

2963
02:15:21.450 --> 02:15:22.283
<v Speaker 1>Like I constantly hear trump voters </v>
<v Speaker 1>being characterized as homophobes </v>

2964
02:15:25.290 --> 02:15:26.123
<v Speaker 1>rednecks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb hillbillies and all that stuff </v>

2965
02:15:28.190 --> 02:15:29.790
<v Speaker 1>because they're in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in the mix.</v>

2966
02:15:29.791 --> 02:15:31.420
<v Speaker 1>There's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're there.</v>

2967
02:15:31.421 --> 02:15:34.350
<v Speaker 1>They're in the mixing on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the categories.</v>

2968
02:15:34.351 --> 02:15:35.184
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might also be worth taking a little </v>

2969
02:15:37.321 --> 02:15:40.020
<v Speaker 1>bit of a human approach and looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump voters and um,</v>

2970
02:15:40.021 --> 02:15:40.854
<v Speaker 1>maybe a lot of trump voters may be a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trump voters who are good people </v>

2971
02:15:43.261 --> 02:15:47.100
<v Speaker 1>didn't like trump that much either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they liked hillary way less or maybe</v>

2972
02:15:47.101 --> 02:15:50.190
<v Speaker 1>hillary's talking the way obama has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the past eight years and their lives</v>

2973
02:15:50.191 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 1>haven't changed for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were desperate to seat anything</v>

2974
02:15:53.221 --> 02:15:53.430
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2975
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:54.263
<v Speaker 1>Work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a little compassionate on why a lot </v>

2976
02:15:56.341 --> 02:15:57.174
<v Speaker 1>of people voted for trump because </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember this country voted a black </v>

2977
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:02.100
<v Speaker 1>president in and a lot of those voters </v>
<v Speaker 1>were white,</v>

2978
02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:04.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>t two times in a row.</v>

2979
02:16:04.090 --> 02:16:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order for him to have one,</v>

2980
02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:10.650
<v Speaker 1>you have to have some people that voted </v>
<v Speaker 1>for obama last term that voted for trump</v>

2981
02:16:10.651 --> 02:16:11.484
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

2982
02:16:11.610 --> 02:16:12.443
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a better thing to have him </v>

2983
02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:15.990
<v Speaker 1>other than her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2984
02:16:16.050 --> 02:16:18.090
<v Speaker 1>so there were no racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not all,</v>

2985
02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:19.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobes they,</v>

2986
02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:20.413
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was always really careful </v>

2987
02:16:21.331 --> 02:16:22.950
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always critical of trump.</v>

2988
02:16:22.951 --> 02:16:23.784
<v Speaker 1>I was very careful not to be critical of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump voters because you know there are </v>

2989
02:16:26.991 --> 02:16:27.824
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not being honest because </v>

2990
02:16:28.471 --> 02:16:30.880
<v Speaker 1>there are dummies in there too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like there's dummies in the.</v>

2991
02:16:30.881 --> 02:16:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Hillary cannot present there on this.</v>

2992
02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:33.123
<v Speaker 1>That's why those stereotypes exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about the latte sipping </v>

2993
02:16:36.251 --> 02:16:37.084
<v Speaker 1>hillary supporters who literally know </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing about what the negative things </v>

2994
02:16:39.781 --> 02:16:40.614
<v Speaker 1>she's Done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say anything about or you're a </v>

2995
02:16:41.470 --> 02:16:42.303
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of that going on </v>

2996
02:16:43.691 --> 02:16:44.524
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are real people like the real </v>

2997
02:16:45.881 --> 02:16:47.530
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous people on the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2998
02:16:47.531 --> 02:16:48.670
<v Speaker 1>They're all real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2999
02:16:48.671 --> 02:16:50.510
<v Speaker 1>so the hillbillies that love trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look dude,</v>

3000
02:16:50.530 --> 02:16:51.191
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3001
02:16:51.191 --> 02:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I saw a video where this guy got pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>over in an altercation with this guy hit</v>

3002
02:16:55.061 --> 02:16:55.894
<v Speaker 1>and this other guy had gotten some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a traffic altercation and this guy </v>

3003
02:16:58.631 --> 02:16:59.464
<v Speaker 1>comes uP to his window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's calling them the n word and he's </v>

3004
02:17:01.561 --> 02:17:02.261
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

3005
02:17:02.261 --> 02:17:03.130
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with trump.</v>

3006
02:17:03.131 --> 02:17:03.964

<v Speaker 1>And it's that type of person that like </v>

3007
02:17:07.090 --> 02:17:07.923
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people like that that want to </v>

3008
02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:12.033
<v Speaker 1>let you know that this is their guy now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're white and that this is </v>

3009
02:17:15.731 --> 02:17:16.750
<v Speaker 1>like a racist thing.</v>

3010
02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:17.613
<v Speaker 1>You think their races winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think there was kkk people that voted </v>

3011
02:17:20.321 --> 02:17:24.260
<v Speaker 1>for hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a special group kkk for hillary.</v>

3012
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:28.060
<v Speaker 1>The kkk people are there like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest,</v>

02:17:28.061 --> 02:17:30.510
<v Speaker 1>how many just straight up racists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how many kkk?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I thought I saw that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't doubt if there was a million </v>

3016
02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:42.513
<v Speaker 1>in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely probably a </v>

3017
02:17:44.381 --> 02:17:48.820
<v Speaker 1>million racists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to fish clan members.</v>

<v Speaker 1>many ufc fans are.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but if you had to join an organization </v>

3020
02:17:54.581 --> 02:17:57.270
<v Speaker 1>to be a ufc fan will be far less of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean buying the paper,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They've been told something,</v>

3035
02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:40.744
<v Speaker 1>they don't do any research and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just dicks and there a lot of just </v>

3036
02:18:43.631 --> 02:18:45.670
<v Speaker 1>shitheads who want to be part of a hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

3037
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:46.663
<v Speaker 1>A lot of problem with black versus white</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the same problem as left versus </v>

3038
02:18:49.571 --> 02:18:51.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black versus white,</v>

<v Speaker 1>left versus right.</v>

3041
02:18:55.301 --> 02:18:57.070
<v Speaker 1>people want to think that they're on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

3042
02:18:57.460 --> 02:18:58.293
<v Speaker 1>Black people want to think they're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>another team and we fuck each other up </v>

3043
02:19:00.401 --> 02:19:02.020
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so human.</v>

3044
02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

3045
02:19:02.890 --> 02:19:04.960
<v Speaker 1>human beings are very tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3046
02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:06.550
<v Speaker 1>anthropologists tell you that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3047
02:19:06.551 --> 02:19:07.700
<v Speaker 1>that human beings are tribal.</v>

3048
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:09.640
<v Speaker 1>EveryThing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about time,</v>

3049
02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:12.340
<v Speaker 1>like this generation is cut that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3050
02:19:12.610 --> 02:19:14.140
<v Speaker 1>this is literally not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3051
02:19:14.141 --> 02:19:15.760
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's aBout time.</v>

3052
02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:17.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with jared diamond who's,</v>

3053
02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.240
<v Speaker 1>who wrote guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>germs and steel,</v>

3054
02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:20.350
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing guy.</v>

3055
02:19:20.590 --> 02:19:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And he Said that he fascinating that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were studying different tribes</v>

3056
02:19:24.551 --> 02:19:27.070
<v Speaker 1>in papa new Guinea that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated so they were,</v>

3057
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:29.210
<v Speaker 1>they weren't really influenced By </v>
<v Speaker 1>western culture at all.</v>

3058
02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:30.553
<v Speaker 1>And what would happen was they have two </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribeS that would get along really well </v>

3059
02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:36.380
<v Speaker 1>and they even inner married and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3060
02:19:36.381 --> 02:19:37.214
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shared things and everything else </v>

3061
02:19:38.181 --> 02:19:39.014
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as there became scarce </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources like water or game and one </v>

3062
02:19:45.531 --> 02:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>side's very existence started to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened for.</v>

3063
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:49.063
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this one tribes closer to a water </v>

3064
02:19:51.171 --> 02:19:53.990
<v Speaker 1>source and the other water source dried </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

3065
02:19:54.410 --> 02:19:56.900
<v Speaker 1>So what'll happen is it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

3066
02:19:56.900 --> 02:20:01.670
<v Speaker 1>It's very quickly the tribes will start </v>
<v Speaker 1>making up stories about each other.</v>

3067
02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:02.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this before on </v>

3068
02:20:03.291 --> 02:20:05.750
<v Speaker 1>another podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know we talked about this,</v>

3069
02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:06.633
<v Speaker 1>you talked about how they decided in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very short amount of time the other </v>

3070
02:20:09.321 --> 02:20:10.570
<v Speaker 1>people were bad and they went over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill.</v>

3071
02:20:10.571 --> 02:20:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's human nature,</v>

3072
02:20:12.141 --> 02:20:13.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when you start talking about</v>

3073
02:20:13.970 --> 02:20:15.290
<v Speaker 1>getting along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting along,</v>

3074
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you can't afford certain people you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

3075
02:20:18.171 --> 02:20:20.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right now,</v>

3076
02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:22.273
<v Speaker 1>life has never been easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is it's about time </v>

3077
02:20:24.891 --> 02:20:29.300
<v Speaker 1>that this generation like figure out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just people that it's fucking</v>

3078
02:20:29.301 --> 02:20:32.570
<v Speaker 1>stupid for all redheaded people to join </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and form clan,</v>

3079
02:20:32.770 --> 02:20:34.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fellow people working.</v>

3080
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just getting through.</v>

3081
02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3082
02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:39.473
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more getting through today I think </v>

3083
02:20:41.331 --> 02:20:43.720
<v Speaker 1>than ever before in history because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one that,</v>

3084
02:20:43.721 --> 02:20:44.090

3085
02:20:44.090 --> 02:20:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like,</v>

3086
02:20:44.810 --> 02:20:48.140
<v Speaker 1>even like if you go back and watch those</v>
<v Speaker 1>old bugs bunny cartoons,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3102
02:21:35.061 --> 02:21:37.310
<v Speaker 1>we think of them as the ground nesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>birds.</v>

3103
02:21:37.311 --> 02:21:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Rats,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We chased them off though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stunk up my whole fucking yard.</v>

3107
02:21:44.390 --> 02:21:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know how to show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birds.</v>

3110
02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:49.813
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird that you could be driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the god damn freeway with your </v>

3111
02:21:52.521 --> 02:21:57.260
<v Speaker 1>windows rolled up eric tight and pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a cloud of skunk smell?</v>

3112
02:21:57.320 --> 02:21:58.153
<v Speaker 1>How does it do the gods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you exactly how the same way </v>

3113
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:07.730
<v Speaker 1>the with the skunk smells so strong that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reaction to it is like a bloodhound</v>

3114
02:22:07.731 --> 02:22:10.450
<v Speaker 1>reaction to persons sent like </v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity when you.</v>

3115
02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:11.533
<v Speaker 1>That's how we can understand like how </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodhound works and probably </v>

3116
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:15.050
<v Speaker 1>bloodhounds probably even better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3117
02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:16.820
<v Speaker 1>but parts per million.</v>

3118
02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:17.653
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you can detect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skunk smells so bad that in parts per </v>

3119
02:22:20.991 --> 02:22:21.824
<v Speaker 1>million they can shoot it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard and you could smell it like </v>

3120
02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:25.320
<v Speaker 1>literally a mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3121
02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Well that's how a dog works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3122
02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:31.080
<v Speaker 1>like a good bloodhound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll fucking smell you a mile away.</v>

3123
02:22:31.081 --> 02:22:33.360
<v Speaker 1>They just got to figure out where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from.</v>

3124
02:22:33.361 --> 02:22:34.710
<v Speaker 1>They'll run that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3125
02:22:34.711 --> 02:22:37.300
<v Speaker 1>It's getting weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go run that way stronger.</v>

3126
02:22:37.330 --> 02:22:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's electro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a smell.</v>

3127
02:22:38.810 --> 02:22:41.610
<v Speaker 1>It smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to go through the glass.</v>

3128
02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:43.350
<v Speaker 1>So jetson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3129
02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:44.193
<v Speaker 1>how do you breed that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would run out of air if that thing </v>

3130
02:22:45.691 --> 02:22:46.524
<v Speaker 1>was airtight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that you're coming </v>

3131
02:22:47.661 --> 02:22:49.820
<v Speaker 1>into your filter's not airtight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3132
02:22:49.821 --> 02:22:51.500
<v Speaker 1>how come you don't feel it when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving?</v>

3133
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Because it goes through a whole system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's inside your dash breach?</v>

3134
02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:55.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3135
02:22:55.211 --> 02:22:56.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets backed up,</v>

3136
02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:58.620
<v Speaker 1>it gets backed up and then it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>through filters.</v>

3137
02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Like you can open the filters to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vents,</v>

3138
02:23:00.811 --> 02:23:01.644
<v Speaker 1>come through and then you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel the breeze blow on you when you're </v>

3139
02:23:03.690 --> 02:23:05.580
<v Speaker 1>on the highway where you can close that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3140
02:23:05.581 --> 02:23:08.070
<v Speaker 1>But air still gets in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets into the cabinet.</v>

3141
02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to guess that it's electrical.</v>

3142
02:23:11.430 --> 02:23:12.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should definitely guess driving a </v>

3143
02:23:13.711 --> 02:23:17.870
<v Speaker 1>flintstone.</v>

3202
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:56.410
<v Speaker 1>In China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have at least maybe in one plant.</v>

3203
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:57.423
<v Speaker 1>They're up to 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial engineers to help the </v>

3204
02:25:59.321 --> 02:26:00.570
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

02:26:08.051 --> 02:26:08.884
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing it for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you started that up in the United </v>

3207
02:26:11.410 --> 02:26:12.243
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there'd be a lot of trial and </v>

3208
02:26:12.461 --> 02:26:14.170
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be willing to throw away a</v>

3209
02:26:14.171 --> 02:26:16.460
<v Speaker 1>lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phones would be shit.</v>

3210
02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

3211
02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Feel like an american car in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>

3212
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:25.540
<v Speaker 1>The iphone in America first to build it </v>
<v Speaker 1>now costs $2,000.</v>

3213
02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:27.043
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does the cross now it costs a </v>

3214
02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:29.910
<v Speaker 1>thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3215
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3216
02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Now the phone's like $700.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the comparison that.</v>

3217
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:36.690
<v Speaker 1>What is an iphone seven s?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that crossed?</v>

3218
02:26:37.010 --> 02:26:41.260
<v Speaker 1>They haven't made that seven plus rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

3219
02:26:41.450 --> 02:26:43.450
<v Speaker 1>The next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they going to ever bring that back?</v>

3220
02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:49.040
<v Speaker 1>But you can get an adapter or use </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapters.</v>

3221
02:26:49.530 --> 02:26:50.363
<v Speaker 1>You know you get a lightning adapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks it in as a regular hole in the </v>

3222
02:26:52.361 --> 02:26:55.140
<v Speaker 1>bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that the iphone eight,</v>

3223
02:26:55.220 --> 02:26:58.570
<v Speaker 1>there's supposed to be flipped capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bring about the flip flip.</v>

3224
02:26:58.670 --> 02:27:02.260
<v Speaker 1>That's going to make it a book no plugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3225
02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It's all wireless charging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe or maybe not true,</v>

3226
02:27:04.871 --> 02:27:05.704
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be terrible with </v>

3227
02:27:06.010 --> 02:27:07.840
<v Speaker 1>electricity is going to be in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to die.</v>

3228
02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:11.470
<v Speaker 1>That's when tesla was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting electricity in the air.</v>

3229
02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.130
<v Speaker 1>You create habitat out there like radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna generate things.</v>

3230
02:27:15.131 --> 02:27:15.964
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be walking around with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like tesla coils bouncing off of that </v>

3231
02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:20.613
<v Speaker 1>could have been real if they already </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't we already walking through a sea </v>

3232
02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:24.713
<v Speaker 1>of electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a lot of electricity </v>

3233
02:27:28.421 --> 02:27:31.270
<v Speaker 1>around us and there's definitely wifi in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this room.</v>

3234
02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:34.720
<v Speaker 1>We might be in the ocean of electro </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnetism,</v>

3235
02:27:34.721 --> 02:27:35.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's water that's important.</v>

3241
02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Electricity that conducts through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

3291
02:30:08.931 --> 02:30:09.764
<v Speaker 1>side is where a cell phone was and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why she thought that it was from </v>

3292
02:30:12.410 --> 02:30:15.180
<v Speaker 1>doing press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She get to go hippo face.</v>

3293
02:30:15.370 --> 02:30:17.900
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back when there was no internet,</v>

3294
02:30:17.930 --> 02:30:20.780
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had to do press for radio or for</v>

3295
02:30:20.781 --> 02:30:21.614
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had to do press for an album </v>

3296
02:30:23.211 --> 02:30:24.020
<v Speaker 1>that was coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3297
02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:25.690
<v Speaker 1>You just call people up and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>

3298
02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:27.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you did.</v>

3299
02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:28.613
<v Speaker 1>Leave this sheryl crow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brain tumor maybe related to cell </v>

3300
02:30:30.591 --> 02:30:31.424
<v Speaker 1>phone use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the chosen fucked up picture or </v>

3301
02:30:33.980 --> 02:30:34.813
<v Speaker 1>tuition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's been trumped that doug just </v>

3302
02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:41.800
<v Speaker 1>fucking spray or no doctors that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirm that crow said monday.</v>

3303
02:30:42.561 --> 02:30:43.394
<v Speaker 1>Well appealing on the premier of katie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new syndicated talk show hosted </v>

3304
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:49.400
<v Speaker 1>hosted by katie couric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

3305
02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:50.413
<v Speaker 1>I do have a theory that it's possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's related to that she spent </v>

3306
02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:56.630
<v Speaker 1>hours on the old archaic cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3307
02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:57.523
<v Speaker 1>she's probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doctors that will even </v>

3308
02:30:59.170 --> 02:31:04.170
<v Speaker 1>confirmed it's part of a brain where she</v>
<v Speaker 1>often held her phone.</v>

3309
02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been.</v>

3310
02:31:07.770 --> 02:31:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk you up to something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be true be,</v>

3311
02:31:11.690 --> 02:31:13.400
<v Speaker 1>but it could be that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

3312
02:31:13.430 --> 02:31:14.263
<v Speaker 1>That's totally possible that she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>that phone up to her head and broader </v>

3313
02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:19.840
<v Speaker 1>brand stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More about what your.</v>

3314
02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a couple of days maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>there a cover to cover and there's a lot</v>

3315
02:31:25.771 --> 02:31:27.780
<v Speaker 1>of people are trying to test it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's.</v>

3316
02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the other.</v>

3317
02:31:28.510 --> 02:31:29.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing,</v>

3318
02:31:29.911 --> 02:31:31.290
<v Speaker 1>but radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The doctor.</v>

3319
02:31:31.580 --> 02:31:33.210
<v Speaker 1>We're to just talk over them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you gonna?</v>

3320
02:31:33.211 --> 02:31:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Let them talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to him,</v>

3321
02:31:34.281 --> 02:31:35.670
<v Speaker 1>but he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's getting me thinking about something</v>

3322
02:31:35.671 --> 02:31:38.060
<v Speaker 1>because he's got them out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go like a cover up.</v>

3323
02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the middle of the talk.</v>

3324
02:31:40.020 --> 02:31:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I would just force over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just bullshitting.</v>

3325
02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be right.</v>

3326
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:44.543
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the grappler on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to know what happened to </v>

3327
02:31:48.241 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would think it is.</v>

3328
02:31:49.951 --> 02:31:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I would believe that it is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3329
02:31:52.410 --> 02:31:54.180
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's not,</v>

3330
02:31:54.470 --> 02:31:55.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all bullshit.</v>

3331
02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:57.030
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does anybody fucking.</v>

3332
02:31:57.040 --> 02:32:00.030
<v Speaker 1>No where they haven't been around that </v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

3333
02:32:00.850 --> 02:32:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Like how long have people been using </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones?</v>

3334
02:32:02.761 --> 02:32:05.310
<v Speaker 1>The way we're using them now where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly on them.</v>

3335
02:32:05.311 --> 02:32:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it been eight years now?</v>

3336
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes.</v>

3337
02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smartphones were the thing that did it.</v>

3338
02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Was it o seven?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

3339
02:32:18.401 --> 02:32:19.234
<v Speaker 1>Eight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3340
02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:20.183
<v Speaker 1>So from then on people are like slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>but surely getting more and more </v>

3341
02:32:23.521 --> 02:32:24.354
<v Speaker 1>integrated into using that electronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>device and constantly being either </v>

3342
02:32:26.731 --> 02:32:27.564
<v Speaker 1>because before that there was no twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>or facebook or instagram or any of that </v>

3343
02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:31.840
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3344
02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:33.990
<v Speaker 1>there was no like answering questions on</v>
<v Speaker 1>google.</v>

3345
02:32:33.991 --> 02:32:37.560
<v Speaker 1>So you and also you get taxed and send </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls forever.</v>

3346
02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:38.513
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no internet until 2007 and </v>

3347
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:45.000
<v Speaker 1>nobody was going online with a trio </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of shit.</v>

3348
02:32:47.221 --> 02:32:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3349
02:32:47.730 --> 02:32:48.563
<v Speaker 1>it was falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why black pain was so important </v>

3350
02:32:51.661 --> 02:32:55.560
<v Speaker 1>because the email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was on the phone a ton.</v>

3351
02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:56.433
<v Speaker 1>Texts actually people have had their </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones at their heads for longer since </v>

3352
02:32:59.581 --> 02:33:03.350
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since probably 92.</v>

3353
02:33:05.920 --> 02:33:08.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheryl crow became popular in 94.</v>

3354
02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:09.533
<v Speaker 1>I remember that because I had just come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to la and all I want to do is have some </v>

3355
02:33:12.361 --> 02:33:14.490
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was like on the radio back then it was a</v>

3356
02:33:14.491 --> 02:33:15.324
<v Speaker 1>big jam so those phones were just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might as well been plutonium and a </v>

3357
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:21.450
<v Speaker 1>fucking a lot of gold cup where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

3358
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:25.170
<v Speaker 1>He held those pitches ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually I read this thing about how</v>

3359
02:33:25.171 --> 02:33:28.020
<v Speaker 1>when radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from a phone or whatever,</v>

3360
02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess the idea is that it can break </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart certain like mitochondria or d dna</v>

3361
02:33:36.931 --> 02:33:37.681
<v Speaker 1>strand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>

3362
02:33:37.681 --> 02:33:39.450
<v Speaker 1>where it sounds like some bullshit it'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

3363
02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:42.380
<v Speaker 1>It disrupts certain from the library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

3364
02:33:42.390 --> 02:33:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It disrupts things in that process.</v>

3365
02:33:45.361 --> 02:33:46.194
<v Speaker 1>Can actually cause sometimes cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty hard to kind of draw a </v>

3366
02:33:51.451 --> 02:33:53.500
<v Speaker 1>through line because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different calls to.</v>

3367
02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:54.333
<v Speaker 1>So there's the reality that what causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer to use not going to cause cancer </v>

3368
02:33:57.481 --> 02:33:59.310
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to cause cancer to another</v>

3369
02:33:59.311 --> 02:34:00.144
<v Speaker 1>person and my would make you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's in their own weird </v>

3370
02:34:03.061 --> 02:34:04.440
<v Speaker 1>biological makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3371
02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:05.503
<v Speaker 1>Some people are super susceptible to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of weird diseases that other </v>

3372
02:34:07.741 --> 02:34:08.574
<v Speaker 1>people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also environmental factors </v>

3373
02:34:09.781 --> 02:34:12.150
<v Speaker 1>like maybe what you work is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up too,</v>

3374
02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:14.490
<v Speaker 1>but maybe working in a gas station or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

3375
02:34:14.491 --> 02:34:15.324
<v Speaker 1>or you doing the auto repair and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking breathe it in paint fumes and </v>

3376
02:34:17.831 --> 02:34:18.664
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on top of that you're dealing </v>

3377
02:34:19.991 --> 02:34:20.750
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3378
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:23.740
<v Speaker 1>That that could just be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a combination of factors.</v>

3379
02:34:23.741 --> 02:34:25.780
<v Speaker 1>It kills your immune system factors </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

3380
02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:27.043
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you smoke cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody who smokes even a lot for </v>

3381
02:34:29.801 --> 02:34:32.140
<v Speaker 1>a lifetime gets lung cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people just don't.</v>

3382
02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:34.320
<v Speaker 1>They live into their nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke considered crazy,</v>

3383
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:35.583
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>living anywhere in high population </v>

3384
02:34:37.931 --> 02:34:39.790
<v Speaker 1>centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're being poisoned.</v>

3385
02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Everybody around us is being poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not a whole lot to fuck.</v>

3386
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

3387
02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:45.833
<v Speaker 1>You come over that hill and you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>down into the valley and everything is </v>

3388
02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:49.233
<v Speaker 1>brown as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are breathing that you are 100 </v>

3389
02:34:53.591 --> 02:34:56.950

<v Speaker 1>You see it when you get down,</v>

3390
02:34:56.951 --> 02:34:59.920
<v Speaker 1>but you know how I can tell because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place near,</v>

3391
02:34:59.921 --> 02:35:00.754
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a place where you drive </v>

<v Speaker 1>soda,</v>

3393
02:35:08.081 --> 02:35:08.914

<v Speaker 1>over and you could see tHe mountains </v>

<v Speaker 1>could get lost on and die in and you </v>

3399
02:35:28.241 --> 02:35:29.630
<v Speaker 1>don't see it all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You see brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's digital breathing that.</v>

3401
02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:36.150

<v Speaker 1>It's been like that forever.</v>

3402

<v Speaker 1>And la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the valley.</v>

3403
02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:41.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole mixture to but it's way </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

3404
02:35:41.650 --> 02:35:42.483
<v Speaker 1>It's way worse now than it was like back</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are on horses and shit been </v>

3405
02:35:47.690 --> 02:35:51.230
<v Speaker 1>told me in front of our producer guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that uh,</v>

3406
02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:56.200
<v Speaker 1>before people even settled in southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

3407
02:35:56.201 --> 02:36:00.760
<v Speaker 1>the indians called southern California </v>
<v Speaker 1>that landed the smoke smoke or something</v>

3408
02:36:00.761 --> 02:36:01.594
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3409
02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:02.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see,</v>

3410
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed this since I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can't see the mountains.</v>

3411
02:36:06.581 --> 02:36:10.780
<v Speaker 1>There's too much smog and then a storm </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and then evidence clear and then</v>

3412
02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:13.610
<v Speaker 1>it just a cycle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that that was.</v>

3413
02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:16.840
<v Speaker 1>We were going to come to a day where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would never clear up.</v>

3414
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:21.870
<v Speaker 1>It would just be so bad after 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually way better.</v>

3415
02:36:22.330 --> 02:36:23.163
<v Speaker 1>The air quality in los angeles is way </v>
<v Speaker 1>better because cars are way better at </v>

3416
02:36:25.441 --> 02:36:29.260
<v Speaker 1>cars are cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so eventually the wind just.</v>

3417
02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:30.720
<v Speaker 1>We'll clean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

3418
02:36:30.850 --> 02:36:33.390
<v Speaker 1>here's something real crazy flip </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

3419
02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:34.283
<v Speaker 1>A porsche nine slash 11 turbo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The air that comes out is cleaner than </v>

3420
02:36:36.701 --> 02:36:38.290
<v Speaker 1>the air that goes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you drive it in la.</v>

3421
02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:39.593
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really a porsche nine slash 11 </v>

3422
02:36:42.341 --> 02:36:43.180
<v Speaker 1>turbo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's carbon.</v>

3423
02:36:43.181 --> 02:36:44.014
<v Speaker 1>It's carbon emissions are so low that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air that it takes in until those </v>

3424
02:36:46.901 --> 02:36:47.734
<v Speaker 1>turbo charges goes through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>combustion engine and comes out the </v>

3425
02:36:49.361 --> 02:36:52.390
<v Speaker 1>exhaust is actually cleaner than the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's taking in.</v>

3426
02:36:52.510 --> 02:36:55.170
<v Speaker 1>How about this crazy statistic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average carter,</v>

3427
02:36:55.390 --> 02:36:56.223
<v Speaker 1>the average car on the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made it more pollution sitting </v>

3428
02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:00.513
<v Speaker 1>without its engine on in a driveway </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of fuel of operation than the </v>

3429
02:37:04.031 --> 02:37:06.520
<v Speaker 1>average car on the highway today in los </v>
<v Speaker 1>angeles.</v>

3430
02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:07.713
<v Speaker 1>That's brand new.</v>

3431
02:37:07.850 --> 02:37:10.180
<v Speaker 1>You remember we used to hear the gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>slosh around back there.</v>

3432
02:37:10.181 --> 02:37:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you had a car,</v>

3433
02:37:11.861 --> 02:37:13.450
<v Speaker 1>like an old car and you like took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn.</v>

3434
02:37:13.451 --> 02:37:14.284
<v Speaker 1>He went a little sideways here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gas slosh around fucking shitty car </v>

3435
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:22.490
<v Speaker 1>carburetors before we had catalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>converters smelled it inside the car.</v>

3436
02:37:22.491 --> 02:37:24.590
<v Speaker 1>He had a roll the windows down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're on the highway,</v>

3437
02:37:25.250 --> 02:37:25.881
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3438
02:37:25.881 --> 02:37:28.860
<v Speaker 1>so magic markers a dig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff shouldn't be.</v>

3439
02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:29.713
<v Speaker 1>They'll smell a sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anybody that's worried about being </v>

3440
02:37:31.191 --> 02:37:32.024
<v Speaker 1>poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely be employed and we're </v>

3441
02:37:33.051 --> 02:37:36.680
<v Speaker 1>breathing in brake dust 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you and it's gonna.</v>

3442
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:40.280
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna shorten your life and might </v>
<v Speaker 1>only short your life by a few years.</v>

3443
02:37:40.281 --> 02:37:42.650
<v Speaker 1>It might make the last few years of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life more uncomfortable,</v>

3444
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:45.230
<v Speaker 1>but if you go somewhere where this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the case,</v>

3445
02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you go to like fucking deer valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utah.</v>

3446
02:37:48.090 --> 02:37:50.960
<v Speaker 1>You go hang out up there and look out </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the mountains.</v>

3447
02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather there than live there and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents just kill me.</v>

3448
02:37:56.901 --> 02:38:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Threatened parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I brought it up.</v>

3449
02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:01.830
<v Speaker 1>You fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other.</v>

3450
02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:03.440
<v Speaker 1>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful,</v>

3451
02:38:03.650 --> 02:38:05.090
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to visit.</v>

3452
02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:06.013
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is we got to get more cool </v>

3453
02:38:06.901 --> 02:38:08.710
<v Speaker 1>people to live up in a place like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3454
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:10.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're in the wrong spot.</v>

3455
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Like the people that we know are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome,</v>

3456
02:38:12.771 --> 02:38:13.604
<v Speaker 1>but we're definitely in the wrong spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's good about this </v>

3457
02:38:15.651 --> 02:38:19.340
<v Speaker 1>spot is it warm is no bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem is it's warm.</v>

3458
02:38:19.341 --> 02:38:20.174
<v Speaker 1>There's no bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the reasons why the indians </v>

3459
02:38:23.331 --> 02:38:26.240
<v Speaker 1>call this valley to smoke is like fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fucking normal for here.</v>

3460
02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Things are supposed to burn down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they build back better.</v>

3461
02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

3462
02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:31.473
<v Speaker 1>it clears out entire forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like controlled burns is something that </v>

3463
02:38:35.901 --> 02:38:39.650
<v Speaker 1>forest service is due because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to burn down a certain amount of the old</v>

3464
02:38:39.651 --> 02:38:40.484
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it just becomes kindling and </v>

3465
02:38:41.811 --> 02:38:42.644
<v Speaker 1>then when the fires do come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unmanageable and then on top of </v>

3466
02:38:45.021 --> 02:38:45.854
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carbon needs to fucking be </v>

3467
02:38:46.401 --> 02:38:49.700
<v Speaker 1>recirculated into the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a good thing.</v>

3468
02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:50.773
<v Speaker 1>These burns and that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened for millions of years and </v>

3469
02:38:53.181 --> 02:38:54.014
<v Speaker 1>now because there's no burn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it changes the environment </v>

3470
02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:56.893
<v Speaker 1>like this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Places that the used to have burns and </v>

3471
02:38:58.251 --> 02:38:59.084
<v Speaker 1>now they control them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like the force goes away and </v>

3472
02:39:01.041 --> 02:39:01.874
<v Speaker 1>then just go with these big dry ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>grassy shitty areas over hundreds of </v>

3473
02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:08.490
<v Speaker 1>years of doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3474
02:39:08.700 --> 02:39:10.010
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3475
02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:11.143
<v Speaker 1>It's like the way people live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think that we could just stay in one </v>

3476
02:39:14.361 --> 02:39:16.040
<v Speaker 1>spot and this spot is going to be fine.</v>

3477
02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:19.790
<v Speaker 1>That's never been the case anywhere on </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth switches supposed to move.</v>

3478
02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.330
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be nomadic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to move back to find out,</v>

3479
02:39:23.350 --> 02:39:25.490
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't stay right next to the ocean.</v>

3480
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:28.130
<v Speaker 1>That fucking that malibu coast is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

3481
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Those people with the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man pose.</v>

3482
02:39:31.370 --> 02:39:32.203
<v Speaker 1>This is my spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bet you're on the edge of the great </v>

3483
02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:37.970
<v Speaker 1>water next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3484
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:41.720
<v Speaker 1>giant monster of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's miles deep.</v>

3485
02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Three quarters of the surface of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and your life on the edge.</v>

3486
02:39:45.881 --> 02:39:47.330
<v Speaker 1>His mind get off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you?</v>

3487
02:39:47.331 --> 02:39:48.164
<v Speaker 1>Frisbee in front of my hedge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like pick a spot like some crazy </v>

3488
02:39:51.591 --> 02:39:52.424
<v Speaker 1>stupid crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like locked itself on a reef and </v>

3489
02:39:54.741 --> 02:39:57.470
<v Speaker 1>it's claiming to revise its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're like.</v>

3490
02:39:57.471 --> 02:39:59.870
<v Speaker 1>We're like standing by the ocean with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your $20,000,000</v>

3491
02:39:59.871 --> 02:40:02.720
<v Speaker 1>house in malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kicking surfers off your front,</v>

3492
02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:07.940
<v Speaker 1>but you're by the great water the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3493
02:40:08.050 --> 02:40:08.883
<v Speaker 1>Go to the hills at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be an earthquake and the big </v>

3494
02:40:11.601 --> 02:40:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Wave way to Arizona</v>

3495
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:17.640
<v Speaker 3>to come over the malibu and checked in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the houses out.</v>

3496
02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:19.700
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived there for awhile.</v>

3497
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:21.580
<v Speaker 3>You didn't like dude?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3498
02:40:21.581 --> 02:40:21.851
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3500
02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:23.273
<v Speaker 3>My daughter broke her arm at school and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't stay at this place because </v>

3501
02:40:26.401 --> 02:40:27.234
<v Speaker 3>it had staircases that were really steep</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was one that went down to the </v>

3502
02:40:30.361 --> 02:40:31.194
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of them electric stairs and </v>

3503
02:40:32.221 --> 02:40:34.900
<v Speaker 3>it was broken and so it only went like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3504
02:40:34.901 --> 02:40:36.720
<v Speaker 3>So you've got a climate like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ladder.</v>

3505
02:40:36.721 --> 02:40:37.554
<v Speaker 3>It was sketcHy as fuck to get down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean and it just was too dangerous </v>

3506
02:40:41.161 --> 02:40:42.230
<v Speaker 3>where her arm was broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love the looking at the ocean,</v>

3509
02:40:48.091 --> 02:40:48.924
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to live there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to live next to the big </v>

3510
02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:52.033
<v Speaker 3>water ties because when you're at high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened with me and the </v>

3511
02:40:54.811 --> 02:40:55.500
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's this downstairs to this house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like literally the water's coming </v>

3514
02:41:01.231 --> 02:41:05.280
<v Speaker 3>in right under carrie and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in,</v>

3515
02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:07.990
<v Speaker 3>me and her were like looking out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>window and I and I looked on her,</v>

3516
02:41:08.180 --> 02:41:10.140
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this place.</v>

3517
02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:12.510
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3518
02:41:12.511 --> 02:41:12.811
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3519
02:41:12.811 --> 02:41:13.644
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You realize what it really is like when </v>

3520
02:41:15.631 --> 02:41:20.490
<v Speaker 3>you're right there at night in a house </v>
<v Speaker 3>overlooking the ocean.</v>

3521
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:21.383
<v Speaker 3>It's real nature reveals itself to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can be really complacent </v>

3522
02:41:26.281 --> 02:41:29.070
<v Speaker 3>when you see everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See when it's light out,</v>

3523
02:41:29.250 --> 02:41:31.590
<v Speaker 3>you see everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look up,</v>

3524
02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:34.320
<v Speaker 3>the sun is shining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the clouds are moving.</v>

3525
02:41:34.321 --> 02:41:38.460
<v Speaker 3>You see birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look down at the ocean and you go,</v>

3526
02:41:38.461 --> 02:41:39.840
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so cool.</v>

3527
02:41:39.841 --> 02:41:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It's so calling being by the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you're at night,</v>

3528
02:41:43.130 --> 02:41:46.230
<v Speaker 3>it's black and there's nothing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you realize,</v>

3529
02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:48.870
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all water.</v>

3530
02:41:49.250 --> 02:41:52.470
<v Speaker 3>That's all water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>water to do it.</v>

3531
02:41:52.471 --> 02:41:54.030
<v Speaker 3>We stayed there and we rented it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>three months.</v>

3532
02:41:54.031 --> 02:41:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I stayed there five times.</v>

3533
02:41:58.030 --> 02:41:59.940
<v Speaker 3>What part of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because my daughter broke her arm,</v>

3534
02:41:59.941 --> 02:42:01.500
<v Speaker 3>but part of me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh god,</v>

3535
02:42:01.501 --> 02:42:03.810
<v Speaker 3>so high that I realized the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3536
02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:07.470
<v Speaker 3>It is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark monster of water.</v>

3537
02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:10.980
<v Speaker 3>They're totally unfeeling and teeming </v>
<v Speaker 3>with life.</v>

3538
02:42:11.010 --> 02:42:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most likely.</v>

3539
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:13.703
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the habits of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely when things become too </v>

3540
02:42:16.501 --> 02:42:17.334
<v Speaker 3>dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something comes along and tries to take </v>

3541
02:42:18.541 --> 02:42:19.374
<v Speaker 3>them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When things take too much from one </v>

3542
02:42:20.941 --> 02:42:22.860
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wind up starving,</v>

3543
02:42:22.861 --> 02:42:25.860
<v Speaker 3>are going extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like the constant cycle of life,</v>

3544
02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:27.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fellows.</v>

3545
02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:28.673
<v Speaker 3>Here we are standing next to this great </v>
<v Speaker 3>wall of life that will been sucking out </v>

3546
02:42:35.070 --> 02:42:36.690
<v Speaker 3>with nets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill it,</v>

3547
02:42:36.691 --> 02:42:37.524
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you could go back 500 years </v>

3548
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:40.463
<v Speaker 3>and just look under the water and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it looked like and then go back to </v>

3549
02:42:43.081 --> 02:42:45.400
<v Speaker 3>today and look under the water and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the fish are gone.</v>

3550
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:49.680
<v Speaker 3>How many fish there must've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>

3551
02:42:50.310 --> 02:42:51.143
<v Speaker 3>She meant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how clean it must've been </v>

3552
02:42:52.171 --> 02:42:53.004
<v Speaker 3>everywhere before we were pumping our </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and when I was scuba diving into </v>

3553
02:42:57.790 --> 02:43:00.180
<v Speaker 3>hedy by a couple months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

3554
02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:04.530
<v Speaker 3>You look out and all you see is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools of fish.</v>

3555
02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like finding the va.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no difference.</v>

3556
02:43:06.421 --> 02:43:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I swear to god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see sharks.</v>

3557
02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:10.350
<v Speaker 3>I looked into the literature for sharks </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3558
02:43:10.390 --> 02:43:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Lemon sharks don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds cool.</v>

3559
02:43:11.501 --> 02:43:12.310
<v Speaker 3>I was always like,</v>

3560
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:13.143
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like tying in with life probably </v>

3561
02:43:15.150 --> 02:43:16.490
<v Speaker 1>the whole ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3562
02:43:16.491 --> 02:43:18.790
<v Speaker 1>At one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coral when you touch the coral,</v>

3563
02:43:18.791 --> 02:43:20.410
<v Speaker 1>like there are things in the corner like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3564
02:43:20.411 --> 02:43:24.190
<v Speaker 1>he told me to just just put your fingers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was this big flower was beautiful</v>

3565
02:43:24.191 --> 02:43:25.024
<v Speaker 1>and it just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a magic thing that it's the </v>

3566
02:43:28.441 --> 02:43:29.274
<v Speaker 1>most scuba diving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was down there for so long that I </v>

3567
02:43:31.271 --> 02:43:33.760
<v Speaker 1>almost got nitrogen poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really pleasant way to die actually.</v>

3568
02:43:33.761 --> 02:43:35.160
<v Speaker 1>You just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just.</v>

3569
02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:36.123
<v Speaker 1>People will take their regular out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it to the fish so they can breathe </v>

3570
02:43:38.450 --> 02:43:41.410
<v Speaker 1>and die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys super slim a bitch.</v>

3571
02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:45.330
<v Speaker 1>But I was down there for two hours man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm telling you,</v>

3572
02:43:45.350 --> 02:43:47.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never see when you scuba dive.</v>

3573
02:43:47.290 --> 02:43:48.400
<v Speaker 1>What fish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

3574
02:43:48.401 --> 02:43:49.930
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What aniMal do you never see?</v>

3575
02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Chickens you never see.</v>

3576
02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Not at blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can see whales.</v>

3577
02:43:56.500 --> 02:43:59.680
<v Speaker 1>You never see dolphins because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like the bubbles.</v>

3578
02:43:59.681 --> 02:44:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to dr.</v>

3579
02:44:01.130 --> 02:44:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Has been scuba diving for 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said you ever seen dolphins?</v>

3580
02:44:03.821 --> 02:44:06.130
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never now to smart.</v>

3581
02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:06.993
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they see the bubbles and that was </v>

3582
02:44:07.631 --> 02:44:09.190
<v Speaker 1>probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like it.</v>

3583
02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:10.053
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then probably they probably don't </v>

3584
02:44:11.621 --> 02:44:13.310
<v Speaker 1>like it that you could stay under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3585
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:15.990
<v Speaker 1>don't go to the top and then get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of there.</v>

3586
02:44:15.991 --> 02:44:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3587
02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw a whole school of them as soon as</v>

3588
02:44:19.781 --> 02:44:20.820
<v Speaker 1>we got up in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all.</v>

3589
02:44:21.050 --> 02:44:21.883
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the little ones to the gray </v>

3590
02:44:22.721 --> 02:44:25.480
<v Speaker 1>ones ever seen the malibu all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they hunt them.</v>

3591
02:44:25.910 --> 02:44:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some people do.</v>

3592
02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:29.230
<v Speaker 1>They hunt them because they killed tuna.</v>

3593
02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:31.150
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>japanese do.</v>

3594
02:44:31.151 --> 02:44:31.984
<v Speaker 1>They're not really eating them as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they're killing them in order to </v>

3595
02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:34.533
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they,</v>

3596
02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:36.070
<v Speaker 1>they get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3597
02:44:36.071 --> 02:44:37.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got hundreds of dolphins.</v>

3598
02:44:37.241 --> 02:44:40.620
<v Speaker 1>They find a school to another decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these tuna men,</v>

3599
02:44:40.850 --> 02:44:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you know that like they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watched jiro dreams of sushi,</v>

3600
02:44:44.201 --> 02:44:46.570
<v Speaker 1>have you seen the doc on netflix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

3601
02:44:46.571 --> 02:44:49.600
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that really struck</v>
<v Speaker 1>me was how he was talking about how when</v>

3602
02:44:49.601 --> 02:44:50.434
<v Speaker 1>he first became a sushi chef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how easy it was to get the tuna and how </v>

3603
02:44:52.901 --> 02:44:55.540
<v Speaker 1>much tuna there was and how it stuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically diminished.</v>

3604
02:44:55.850 --> 02:44:57.910
<v Speaker 1>We got famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You silly bitch.</v>

3605
02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:59.040
<v Speaker 1>We all weighed in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3606
02:44:59.050 --> 02:44:59.883
<v Speaker 1>His place is a tiny little ass place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm talking about from the time he </v>

3607
02:45:01.751 --> 02:45:02.584
<v Speaker 1>was a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's like in the seventies or </v>

3608
02:45:04.661 --> 02:45:05.140
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3609
02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he might be dead actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3610
02:45:07.450 --> 02:45:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son runs.</v>

3611
02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's no longer alive.</v>

3612
02:45:09.911 --> 02:45:11.800
<v Speaker 1>He died after the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

3613
02:45:13.250 --> 02:45:14.083
<v Speaker 1>I think he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know his son was supposed to go next </v>

3614
02:45:16.361 --> 02:45:18.170
<v Speaker 1>in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have that job.</v>

3615
02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3620
02:45:26.861 --> 02:45:27.694

<v Speaker 1>meticulous process of creating the </v>

3621
02:45:29.651 --> 02:45:31.300
<v Speaker 1>perfect food.</v>

02:45:46.270 --> 02:45:46.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3630
02:45:46.930 --> 02:45:47.763
<v Speaker 1>do you think that that's different </v>
<v Speaker 1>though than eating at a restaurant or </v>

3631
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:51.580
<v Speaker 1>you go to a steakhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waiter comes,</v>

3632
02:45:51.581 --> 02:45:53.860
<v Speaker 1>everybody's pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes the experience better.</v>

3633
02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:55.150
<v Speaker 1>You sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cut up your food,</v>

3634
02:45:55.151 --> 02:45:55.984
<v Speaker 1>you have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're sitting in front of that </v>

3635
02:45:57.401 --> 02:45:58.600
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very different.</v>

3636
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:59.440
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gee,</v>

3637
02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:01.690
<v Speaker 1>this is a completely different sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3638
02:46:01.950 --> 02:46:02.783
<v Speaker 1>This guy is crafting some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culinary artwork for you in the form of </v>

3639
02:46:07.451 --> 02:46:10.220
<v Speaker 1>these bite sized morsels of perfectly</v>

3640
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:11.083
<v Speaker 2>aged fish with a perfect sauce on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a perfectly cooked rice and he's </v>

3641
02:46:15.111 --> 02:46:17.210
<v Speaker 2>been meticulous about this process for </v>
<v Speaker 2>so long.</v>

3642
02:46:17.211 --> 02:46:18.044
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking in Some sort of a weird </v>

3643
02:46:18.921 --> 02:46:20.690
<v Speaker 2>vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to do it all the time.</v>

3644
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:23.300
<v Speaker 2>No one wants once every 10 years be </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

3645
02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:24.193
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is you're going to walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>away starving dogs a form of mastery </v>

3646
02:46:28.461 --> 02:46:29.760
<v Speaker 2>that you should always experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

3647
02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it's mastery and artist rates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fat sushi.</v>

3648
02:46:32.601 --> 02:46:35.420
<v Speaker 2>That's trends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It transcends rice.</v>

3649
02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rice.</v>

3650
02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:38.980
<v Speaker 2>You see the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3651
02:46:39.250 --> 02:46:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

3652
02:46:39.780 --> 02:46:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Nice fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like saying anything you can do,</v>

3653
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:43.383
<v Speaker 2>you can simplify it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think that life is about </v>

3654
02:46:46.491 --> 02:46:47.324
<v Speaker 2>the variety of choices that you have and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good that you could go to a place </v>

3655
02:46:49.881 --> 02:46:50.714
<v Speaker 2>like this and have these weird bites of </v>
<v Speaker 2>clam mixed with a weird sort of a </v>

3656
02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:55.753
<v Speaker 2>seaweed wrap on top of it and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly cooked rice with a little bit </v>

3657
02:46:59.390 --> 02:47:02.550
<v Speaker 2>of you listening to benihana.</v>

3658
02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:05.200
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ron is when the steakhouse,</v>

3659
02:47:05.650 --> 02:47:06.990
<v Speaker 2>they cook in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3660
02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:08.290
<v Speaker 2>benihana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cook in front of that.</v>

3661
02:47:08.330 --> 02:47:10.540
<v Speaker 2>This would be like a sweet fish or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>

3662
02:47:11.130 --> 02:47:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Sugar fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3663
02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:15.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a little art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

3664
02:47:15.470 --> 02:47:19.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like I liked it that I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked classical music sometimes.</v>

3665
02:47:19.521 --> 02:47:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

3666
02:47:20.631 --> 02:47:22.700
<v Speaker 2>It exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I went to a Henry Rollins concert</v>

3667
02:47:22.701 --> 02:47:25.220
<v Speaker 2>or something like that and someone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing classical music,</v>

3668
02:47:25.221 --> 02:47:25.611
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3669
02:47:25.611 --> 02:47:26.720
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3670
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:27.583
<v Speaker 2>You go see metallica and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical music band that opens up for </v>

3671
02:47:29.811 --> 02:47:30.171
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3672
02:47:30.171 --> 02:47:31.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3673
02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or the opposite.</v>

3674
02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:35.180
<v Speaker 2>They have to go on after like slayer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slayer,</v>

3675
02:47:35.181 --> 02:47:36.320
<v Speaker 2>and then classical music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3676
02:47:36.390 --> 02:47:37.880
<v Speaker 2>What doesn't mean the classical music </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>

3677
02:47:37.910 --> 02:47:39.680
<v Speaker 2>It means it's like right now it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the place for it.</v>

3678
02:47:39.681 --> 02:47:40.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not my frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that in my life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and experience I've ever had.</v>

<v Speaker 1>phone in the United States,</v>

3736
02:50:06.451 --> 02:50:11.070
<v Speaker 1>but the phone might be a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonky and cost 500 bucks more,</v>

3737
02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:14.280

<v Speaker 1>in America can enjoy their football game</v>

3743
02:50:30.241 --> 02:50:31.074
<v Speaker 1>on sunday and get their fucking coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>break and by their ram truck and have a </v>

3744
02:50:35.491 --> 02:50:40.491
<v Speaker 1>good house in a suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't pay $500 more for your fucking</v>

3745
02:50:41.701 --> 02:50:42.534
<v Speaker 1>phone that you got attached to your hip </v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you bone cancer while you drive </v>

3746
02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:52.740
<v Speaker 1>your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You faggot american $500.</v>

3747
02:50:53.370 --> 02:50:54.203
<v Speaker 1>The exact same phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact same exact 100 percent on 500 </v>

3748
02:50:56.671 --> 02:50:57.504
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3749
02:50:57.510 --> 02:51:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person would pay $50 more?</v>

3750
02:51:01.690 --> 02:51:02.523
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think $50 more as an achievable </v>

3751
02:51:04.621 --> 02:51:08.190
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like $800.</v>

3752
02:51:08.191 --> 02:51:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Difference between the 800 and 1100 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time it's getting subsidized</v>

3753
02:51:12.211 --> 02:51:14.270
<v Speaker 1>by your cell phone company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the times,</v>

3754
02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:16.770
<v Speaker 1>like you buy a contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a phone for a discount,</v>

3755
02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:19.350
<v Speaker 1>like you buy an iphone from verizon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>

3756
02:51:19.350 --> 02:51:22.320
<v Speaker 1>You're not spending the full 1200 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is at cost.</v>

3757
02:51:22.590 --> 02:51:23.423
<v Speaker 1>You're spending a part of that and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of it gets paid off over the years </v>

3758
02:51:26.731 --> 02:51:27.650
<v Speaker 1>of your contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3759
02:51:27.660 --> 02:51:29.370
<v Speaker 1>you can get a five year contract or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>

3760
02:51:29.430 --> 02:51:31.380
<v Speaker 1>but no one ever keeps the funnier it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>traded back in.</v>

3761
02:51:31.381 --> 02:51:32.214
<v Speaker 1>That restarts jack you back up and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a year so he can get a new phone </v>

3762
02:51:36.391 --> 02:51:38.160
<v Speaker 1>for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can upgrade for free.</v>

3763
02:51:38.161 --> 02:51:39.990
<v Speaker 1>they want to keep you hooked to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tit.</v>

3764
02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:40.953
<v Speaker 1>some the things I don't see how you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get better at certain things like I </v>

3765
02:51:43.351 --> 02:51:44.184
<v Speaker 1>don't like that tests out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you make a better </v>

3766
02:51:47.340 --> 02:51:49.530
<v Speaker 1>technological car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be better.</v>

3767
02:51:49.531 --> 02:51:50.364
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

3768
02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:54.150
<v Speaker 1>The first edition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll well,</v>

3769
02:51:54.151 --> 02:51:57.870
<v Speaker 1>they'll have much more integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigation systems,</v>

3770
02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:00.450
<v Speaker 1>navigation systems that have augmented </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

3771
02:52:00.451 --> 02:52:01.284
<v Speaker 1>This is a big thing to do and now with </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones where they're coming up with </v>

3772
02:52:03.541 --> 02:52:04.374
<v Speaker 1>applications where you could hold a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone up and you a little bit of a scan </v>

3773
02:52:07.451 --> 02:52:09.640
<v Speaker 1>your neighborhood and find out where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stores are,</v>

3774
02:52:09.850 --> 02:52:10.683
<v Speaker 1>who could lift it up and like you can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the mall and it'll give you </v>

3775
02:52:12.880 --> 02:52:16.690
<v Speaker 1>reviews of each store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like augmented put balloons,</v>

3776
02:52:16.691 --> 02:52:20.080
<v Speaker 1>like cartoon balloons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the juice factory.</v>

3777
02:52:20.081 --> 02:52:21.520
<v Speaker 1>They have awesome orange juice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3778
02:52:21.530 --> 02:52:24.000
<v Speaker 1>and won't point right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

3779
02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is going on right now.</v>

3780
02:52:25.990 --> 02:52:28.090
<v Speaker 1>like this is like ready to launch stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3781
02:52:28.091 --> 02:52:29.800
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is just out of your phone,</v>

3782
02:52:29.801 --> 02:52:31.330
<v Speaker 1>just looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting up with your phone.</v>

3783
02:52:31.570 --> 02:52:34.000
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get in your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's going to be in your car.</v>

3784
02:52:34.330 --> 02:52:37.010
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be way better internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3785
02:52:37.011 --> 02:52:39.160
<v Speaker 1>like podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the stuff that you guys are doing,</v>

3786
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:44.380
<v Speaker 1>it's going to replace radio essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be no reason to hire someone</v>

3787
02:52:44.381 --> 02:52:45.214
<v Speaker 1>to rent a building to broadcast a signal</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can just get all the </v>

3788
02:52:49.061 --> 02:52:49.894
<v Speaker 1>information from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's our combat sports podcast </v>

3789
02:52:52.841 --> 02:52:56.560
<v Speaker 1>or news podcast or government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be on the internet,</v>

3790
02:52:56.561 --> 02:52:58.900
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be like a direct line </v>
<v Speaker 1>right into your car.</v>

3791
02:52:58.901 --> 02:53:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous that it's not there on </v>
<v Speaker 1>every car already because it's free.</v>

3792
02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody wants something for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's right.</v>

3793
02:53:04.811 --> 02:53:07.660
<v Speaker 1>You can get it at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be 100 percent the case.</v>

3794
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be very difficult to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio or even the idea of a radio signal</v>

3795
02:53:12.250 --> 02:53:15.430
<v Speaker 1>and just a few decades it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like Payphones.</v>

3796
02:53:15.610 --> 02:53:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Payphones don't exist anymore and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like block.</v>

3797
02:53:18.020 --> 02:53:20.890
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about with manufacturing is I think it's</v>

3798
02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:25.630
<v Speaker 1>more likelY that we're going to end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a three d printers,</v>

3799
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:28.720
<v Speaker 1>massive three d printers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll be able to order what we want.</v>

3800
02:53:28.721 --> 02:53:31.960
<v Speaker 1>That'll be made right in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our jurisdiction and our town,</v>

3801
02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:33.440
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

3802
02:53:33.450 --> 02:53:34.283
<v Speaker 1>It's a three minute drive to your house </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that or you come and pick it up at </v>

3803
02:53:36.911 --> 02:53:38.170
<v Speaker 1>this main depot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3804
02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that's the number one problem</v>

3805
02:53:39.791 --> 02:53:40.624
<v Speaker 1>with automated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these artificially intelligent </v>

3806
02:53:42.431 --> 02:53:43.264
<v Speaker 1>computers and all the different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have where they have </v>

3807
02:53:45.160 --> 02:53:45.993
<v Speaker 1>robots are building cars and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number one problem is going to be </v>

3808
02:53:48.701 --> 02:53:49.534
<v Speaker 1>the loss of jobs for skilled workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all these people that are currently </v>

3809
02:53:51.761 --> 02:53:52.594
<v Speaker 1>doing these things like automated trucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to replace truck drivers to </v>

3810
02:53:56.510 --> 02:53:57.343
<v Speaker 1>ups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drivers,</v>

3811
02:53:58.240 --> 02:53:59.660
<v Speaker 1>truck drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shake.</v>

3812
02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:04.660
<v Speaker 1>A bulk of a huge bulk of mosT male male </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blue collar employment is think they</v>

3813
02:54:05.980 --> 02:54:08.320
<v Speaker 1>can go from san francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York with no sleep.</v>

3814
02:54:08.350 --> 02:54:09.183
<v Speaker 1>I mean your packages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't hit things that literally </v>

3815
02:54:13.631 --> 02:54:16.150
<v Speaker 1>they see have cameras all around the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The backoff.</v>

3816
02:54:16.151 --> 02:54:20.430
<v Speaker 1>They've shown a diminished rate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents with automated cars versus how</v>

3817
02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drive my cAr,</v>

3818
02:54:22.860 --> 02:54:25.330
<v Speaker 1>my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still not to do that though.</v>

3819
02:54:25.331 --> 02:54:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said it all the time.</v>

3820
02:54:27.070 --> 02:54:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Do pay attention or you just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>

3821
02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:30.893
<v Speaker 1>I come to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you put porn on that big flat </v>

<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just likes running mascara and snotty </v>

02:54:56.621 --> 02:54:57.454
<v Speaker 1>noses and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy's spitting on his own dick </v>

3833
02:55:00.881 --> 02:55:01.714
<v Speaker 1>on the highway.</v>

3834
02:55:04.610 --> 02:55:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those window,</v>

3835
02:55:06.150 --> 02:55:06.983
<v Speaker 2>he's called brian count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you jump in the back seat like can </v>

3836
02:55:10.430 --> 02:55:13.930
<v Speaker 2>you show now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently I think what was happening,</v>

3837
02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:16.160
<v Speaker 2>this is what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true,</v>

3838
02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:17.293
<v Speaker 2>but guys would get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would put there and that their </v>

3839
02:55:19.911 --> 02:55:22.370
<v Speaker 2>address into their navigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the take them home.</v>

3840
02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there'd be.</v>

3841
02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:27.830
<v Speaker 2>They crawl in the back seat and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>tesla found out about that.</v>

3842
02:55:28.070 --> 02:55:30.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a big liability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not ready.</v>

3843
02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:33.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not ready yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3844
02:55:33.230 --> 02:55:37.370
<v Speaker 2>but if you let someone decide that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can press automatic driver,</v>

3845
02:55:37.371 --> 02:55:39.890
<v Speaker 2>you can't decide when they compress it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they can.</v>

3846
02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Like either it can drive itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly or it can't.</v>

3847
02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:44.840
<v Speaker 2>It's got to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're drunk,</v>

3848
02:55:44.841 --> 02:55:45.674
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it does get better and you're </v>

3849
02:55:46.131 --> 02:55:46.964
<v Speaker 2>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it irresponsible to let it drive </v>

3850
02:55:48.111 --> 02:55:48.620
<v Speaker 2>home?</v>

3851
02:55:48.620 --> 02:55:49.453
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems like it doesn't really </v>

3852
02:55:51.111 --> 02:55:52.310
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it really work?</v>

3853
02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:54.830
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't really work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck do you sell in it?</v>

3854
02:55:55.310 --> 02:55:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Why are you selling automated car that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't 100 percent of the time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't have released it.</v>

3857
02:56:03.771 --> 02:56:04.604
<v Speaker 2>When it can kind of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You currently can only do it if you're </v>

3858
02:56:06.201 --> 02:56:09.750
<v Speaker 2>in car pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're over 70 to case you gotta,</v>

3859
02:56:09.860 --> 02:56:10.693
<v Speaker 2>you gotta let drunk shabbat.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You click the thing twice towards you </v>

3865
02:56:24.530 --> 02:56:28.730

<v Speaker 2>it's like you have a freaky girlfriend,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but every now and then she turns you </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>gonna get mad at me for no fucking </v>

<v Speaker 2>reason whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keeping you on your toes.</v>

3870

<v Speaker 2>That's why don't we get done all these </v>

3871
02:56:41.391 --> 02:56:45.060
<v Speaker 2>tussles about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really.</v>

3872
02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Don't like the tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3873
02:56:48.801 --> 02:56:51.290
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we wrap this bitch up and fun.</v>

3874
02:56:51.291 --> 02:56:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I want everybody to know we didn't talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about fights at all.</v>

3875
02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:55.220
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3876
02:56:55.220 --> 02:56:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Let's go over to feel drained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drained,</v>

3877
02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:59.743
<v Speaker 2>germane to rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me should have one or do you think that </v>

3878
02:57:01.251 --> 02:57:03.980
<v Speaker 2>she should have been deducted points?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She should've been it.</v>

3879
02:57:04.370 --> 02:57:05.203
<v Speaker 2>Worst case should have been a draw a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the right thing to do was holly </v>

3880
02:57:08.591 --> 02:57:10.620
<v Speaker 2>should have won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even deducting those point.</v>

3881
02:57:10.621 --> 02:57:11.454
<v Speaker 2>You have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those points and I think even germane </v>

3882
02:57:12.891 --> 02:57:13.724
<v Speaker 2>realized that when she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give holly a rematch right away </v>

3883
02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:16.473
<v Speaker 2>because tainted.</v>

3884
02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:17.840
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a dirty fighter.</v>

3885
02:57:17.841 --> 02:57:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Like she knows what she did was fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3886
02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Only won that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

3887
02:57:21.261 --> 02:57:23.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well holly definitely got the only legit</v>

3888
02:57:23.811 --> 02:57:24.980
<v Speaker 2>knocked down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3889
02:57:24.981 --> 02:57:26.880
<v Speaker 2>she got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She landed that question mark kick.</v>

3890
02:57:26.881 --> 02:57:28.170
<v Speaker 2>That was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

3891
02:57:28.171 --> 02:57:31.450
<v Speaker 2>She hid it behind the shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came over the top planning.</v>

3892
02:57:31.580 --> 02:57:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I gave holly the wind for octagon </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

3893
02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:37.590
<v Speaker 2>let you landed more leg kicks and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the only significant strike in the,</v>

3894
02:57:37.670 --> 02:57:40.280
<v Speaker 2>like the big st,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like germain to random.</v>

3895
02:57:40.281 --> 02:57:43.970
<v Speaker 2>He did more damage when she connected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she didn't connect as much.</v>

3896
02:57:44.090 --> 02:57:47.270
<v Speaker 2>But then holly did do more damage in two</v>
<v Speaker 2>instances.</v>

3897
02:57:47.271 --> 02:57:48.104
<v Speaker 2>One with the question mark kick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>another time she dropped her with a </v>

3898
02:57:50.061 --> 02:57:50.894
<v Speaker 2>straight left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3899
02:57:51.050 --> 02:57:53.600
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the best punches of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and that was in the,</v>

3900
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the fourth round last </v>
<v Speaker 2>round was.</v>

3901
02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:58.700
<v Speaker 2>IT might have been the fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She dropped her and it was a.</v>

3902
02:57:58.790 --> 02:58:02.040
<v Speaker 2>It was a big moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say that that and the head</v>

3903
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:05.130
<v Speaker 1>kick round two different rounds or both?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easily 10.</v>

3904
02:58:05.131 --> 02:58:06.060
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3905
02:58:06.290 --> 02:58:10.110
<v Speaker 1>You dropped him with a head kick and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with you don't think so,</v>

3906
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:13.520
<v Speaker 1>but you understand there's new rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new rules will give them.</v>

3907
02:58:13.610 --> 02:58:15.970
<v Speaker 1>See which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one's off balance ahead.</v>

3908
02:58:16.150 --> 02:58:16.411
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3909
02:58:16.411 --> 02:58:16.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3910
02:58:16.980 --> 02:58:18.570
<v Speaker 1>She said herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was nasty,</v>

3911
02:58:18.780 --> 02:58:20.730
<v Speaker 1>she said herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was days and there's a picture of it</v>

3912
02:58:20.731 --> 02:58:23.550
<v Speaker 1>on mike winkeljohn or jackson </v>
<v Speaker 1>winkeljohn.</v>

3913
02:58:23.610 --> 02:58:28.320
<v Speaker 1>John's a instagram account where you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well it connected.</v>

3914
02:58:28.650 --> 02:58:30.230
<v Speaker 1>It's over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just shindig.</v>

3915
02:58:30.280 --> 02:58:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went down from that.</v>

3916
02:58:32.941 --> 02:58:33.774
<v Speaker 1>That was Legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But holly almost kicked her in the face </v>

3917
02:58:35.161 --> 02:58:39.840
<v Speaker 1>while she was down so she might've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to kick them in the chest</v>

3918
02:58:39.841 --> 02:58:40.674
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is like if she saw </v>

3919
02:58:42.031 --> 02:58:42.864
<v Speaker 1>that her hands were down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could've just changed the angle a </v>

3920
02:58:45.031 --> 02:58:45.810
<v Speaker 1>little bit and hit her.</v>

3921
02:58:45.810 --> 02:58:48.720
<v Speaker 1>He or she has the skill to do just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good rule or a bad room.</v>

3922
02:58:48.810 --> 02:58:51.060
<v Speaker 1>I think the new one handed rule is </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

3923
02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that.</v>

3924
02:58:52.991 --> 02:58:55.290
<v Speaker 1>What does that one hands down you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>still kick them,</v>

3925
02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:59.190
<v Speaker 1>but if two hands or as soon as one hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up,</v>

3926
02:58:59.191 --> 02:59:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you can kick him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think?</v>

3927
02:59:01.290 --> 02:59:02.123
<v Speaker 1>I think to get rid of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gouging a hitting after the bell and </v>

3928
02:59:05.970 --> 02:59:06.803
<v Speaker 1>even growing kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's zero tolerance policy where if </v>

3929
02:59:09.991 --> 02:59:10.824
<v Speaker 1>it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to the point 100 percent up to </v>

3930
02:59:12.271 --> 02:59:15.240
<v Speaker 1>the ref anymore because ralph's don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to change outcome with the fight.</v>

3931
02:59:15.241 --> 02:59:17.160
<v Speaker 1>So there they're so skewed to deduct a </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

3932
02:59:17.280 --> 02:59:20.820
<v Speaker 1>What she did to holly is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's been twice already.</v>

3933
02:59:20.910 --> 02:59:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Too many fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hit her so hard.</v>

3934
02:59:23.041 --> 02:59:24.280
<v Speaker 1>It changed outcome of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3935
02:59:24.460 --> 02:59:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Holding onto one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>she rocked her with a giant righthand at</v>

3936
02:59:27.271 --> 02:59:28.104
<v Speaker 1>the end of the bell and it was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bad to the point where we all </v>

3937
02:59:30.301 --> 02:59:30.991
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3938
02:59:30.991 --> 02:59:32.880
<v Speaker 1>like daniel cormier was next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

3939
02:59:33.110 --> 02:59:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time I did commentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>with cormier and uh,</v>

3940
02:59:36.091 --> 02:59:38.310
<v Speaker 1>an annex like the three of us together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really good.</v>

3941
02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:40.050
<v Speaker 1>chromium was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was interesting.</v>

3942
02:59:40.510 --> 02:59:42.940
<v Speaker 4>pens will kind of judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got judged in the fight,</v>

3943
02:59:42.941 --> 02:59:46.300
<v Speaker 4>but some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some judges would look at it the way you</v>

3944
02:59:46.301 --> 02:59:48.370
<v Speaker 4>guys are looking at based on what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys said.</v>

3945
02:59:48.450 --> 02:59:50.110
<v Speaker 4>And some would say the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then someone said,</v>

3946
02:59:50.111 --> 02:59:50.944
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when others would look at it </v>

3947
02:59:51.821 --> 02:59:52.451
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3948
02:59:52.451 --> 02:59:56.020
<v Speaker 4>holly was trying to take her down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look like she was avoiding the standup,</v>

3949
02:59:56.170 --> 02:59:58.720
<v Speaker 4>couldn't take her down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had her against the cage.</v>

3950
02:59:58.721 --> 02:59:59.554
<v Speaker 4>It was like some judges will look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as she doesn't want to fight </v>

3951
03:00:02.351 --> 03:00:04.870
<v Speaker 4>standing and she's not able to get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight to the ground.</v>

3952
03:00:05.080 --> 03:00:07.690
<v Speaker 4>She's kinda just holding against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cage for safety.</v>

3953
03:00:07.810 --> 03:00:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Some people look at that as losing </v>
<v Speaker 4>around and not winning around.</v>

3954
03:00:11.080 --> 03:00:12.230
<v Speaker 4>You'll know what I mean.</v>

3955
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>she wants to get free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's octagon control.</v>

3956
03:00:16.100 --> 03:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>She wants to get free and she can't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

3957
03:00:17.941 --> 03:00:22.941
<v Speaker 1>That been holly's holding her against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules.</v>

3958
03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they judge a fight.</v>

3959
03:00:25.411 --> 03:00:26.244
<v Speaker 1>That's one way to judge a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that that referee </v>

3960
03:00:29.130 --> 03:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to change that come to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3961
03:00:30.601 --> 03:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>They're so scared of the backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

3962
03:00:32.820 --> 03:00:33.653
<v Speaker 1>They don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to take that power out of </v>

3963
03:00:34.981 --> 03:00:35.814
<v Speaker 1>their hands and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three was separating people when they </v>

3964
03:00:38.041 --> 03:00:38.874
<v Speaker 1>were clenching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more on the New York </v>

3965
03:00:41.791 --> 03:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>should not Have those big fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe what you just said.</v>

3966
03:00:44.430 --> 03:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised they let him even do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>title fight.</v>

3967
03:00:47.730 --> 03:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's New York state.</v>

3968
03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:49.913
<v Speaker 1>New york state is going to appoint their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own referees and a certain amount of </v>

3969
03:00:52.651 --> 03:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>fights and I don't know how many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it works.</v>

3970
03:00:55.140 --> 03:00:55.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the agreement is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's often the case when you go </v>

3971
03:00:58.021 --> 03:01:00.490
<v Speaker 1>into state athletic commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Joe Mccarthy,</v>

3972
03:01:00.491 --> 03:01:01.324
<v Speaker 1>herb dean levine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to some of the best in the </v>

3973
03:01:05.441 --> 03:01:06.274
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mccarthy or herb dean come out and make </v>

3974
03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>a statement and John John Mccarthy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3975
03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>they should have issued a warning bride </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

3976
03:01:12.851 --> 03:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>like a strict warning on that first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I disagree with,</v>

3977
03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and he goes on the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have took a point.</v>

3978
03:01:17.380 --> 03:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>They should take an appointment right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

3979
03:01:19.300 --> 03:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3980
03:01:20.110 --> 03:01:20.943
<v Speaker 1>I agree for absolutely the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the first one was so </v>

3981
03:01:23.261 --> 03:01:28.261
<v Speaker 1>egregious crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom combo to take the point.</v>

3982
03:01:29.081 --> 03:01:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not buying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

3983
03:01:31.131 --> 03:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>like I get the heat of the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't let that happen.</v>

3984
03:01:33.940 --> 03:01:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I get that you're in the heat of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

3985
03:01:35.381 --> 03:01:36.214
<v Speaker 1>you want to kill and destroy it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're to random me and you've got 46 </v>

3986
03:01:38.850 --> 03:01:39.683
<v Speaker 1>million more tie and you're a 10 time </v>
<v Speaker 1>more thai champion cause you're a </v>

3987
03:01:41.651 --> 03:01:42.490
<v Speaker 1>fucking killer.</v>

3988
03:01:42.610 --> 03:01:44.590
<v Speaker 1>She's a killer man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what she is.</v>

3989
03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>But there's a rule that was the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3990
03:01:47.201 --> 03:01:48.880
<v Speaker 1>you know what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what was going on.</v>

3991
03:01:48.910 --> 03:01:51.640
<v Speaker 1>You've been in 46 fights before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never did that.</v>

3992
03:01:51.641 --> 03:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>So all of a sudden you do in the heat of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment to see immediately,</v>

3993
03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>twice immediate rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one $45.</v>

3994
03:01:57.400 --> 03:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

3995
03:01:58.511 --> 03:02:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I would say you have to have immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>rematch too,</v>

3996
03:02:00.820 --> 03:02:04.060
<v Speaker 1>but germane to randomly look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows the cyborg is looming in</v>

3997
03:02:04.061 --> 03:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3998
03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>cyborg is always going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no winner in this.</v>

3999
03:02:07.931 --> 03:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean holly should have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to fight cyborg next.</v>

4000
03:02:10.300 --> 03:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4001
03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to be really no winter.</v>

4002
03:02:13.391 --> 03:02:15.460
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be really interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what the choice is.</v>

4003
03:02:15.461 --> 03:02:16.294
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not to go straight to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rematch or whether or not they let </v>

4004
03:02:19.601 --> 03:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>cyborg five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 and nightmare for her to suck down to</v>

4005
03:02:22.900 --> 03:02:25.210
<v Speaker 1>know 40 years she's done 45 many times.</v>

4006
03:02:25.210 --> 03:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

4007
03:02:26.321 --> 03:02:28.240
<v Speaker 1>As you get older and you do it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>

4008
03:02:28.241 --> 03:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>your body resists it more and more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and the fact that they make her.</v>

4009
03:02:31.931 --> 03:02:32.764
<v Speaker 1>I still maintain to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have never asked her to go </v>

4010
03:02:35.771 --> 03:02:36.604
<v Speaker 1>to 1:40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should never have been trying to </v>

4011
03:02:37.841 --> 03:02:38.674
<v Speaker 1>get her to 1:35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have just either have a </v>

4012
03:02:41.471 --> 03:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>featherweight division or don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said she could do it though.</v>

4013
03:02:43.890 --> 03:02:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's so crazy.</v>

4014
03:02:44.980 --> 03:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Met with her and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4015
03:02:45.881 --> 03:02:47.710
<v Speaker 1>we can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's cool man.</v>

4016
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>There's so many fighters that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped down a couple of weight classes.</v>

4017
03:02:50.581 --> 03:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a normal thing in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So big.</v>

4018
03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:57.610
<v Speaker 1>So big brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get smaller and smaller people.</v>

4019
03:02:57.890 --> 03:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Forty five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>48 class.</v>

4020
03:02:59.951 --> 03:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>She could make 45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's done it before,</v>

4021
03:03:01.751 --> 03:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>but even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as people get older again,</v>

4022
03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:05.393
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot.</v>

4023
03:03:05.980 --> 03:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>It gets tougher and tougher and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do it anymore.</v>

4024
03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys just can't do it anymore.</v>

4025
03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:10.353
<v Speaker 1>Just hendrix is exactly the johnny.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to survive the onslaught of that first </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's got nothing to prove.</v>

4079
03:05:37.041 --> 03:05:38.570
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done this thing.</v>

4080
03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:39.583
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's a way where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell how long a guy should take off </v>

4081
03:05:43.580 --> 03:05:47.210
<v Speaker 1>after they get a severe knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a wonder if there's tests that they</v>

4082
03:05:47.211 --> 03:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>can do where they can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4083
03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:52.910
<v Speaker 1>you fuck up your meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you a scope and they go look.</v>

4084
03:05:52.970 --> 03:05:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Just be real easy on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4085
03:05:55.860 --> 03:05:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like a time limit and they can</v>

4086
03:05:57.471 --> 03:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>look at it and then they can do an mri </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

4087
03:05:59.241 --> 03:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking good brendon.</v>

4088
03:06:00.570 --> 03:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to authorize some light </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

4089
03:06:02.511 --> 03:06:05.190
<v Speaker 1>but please take it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how we can do it.</v>

4090
03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:06.990
<v Speaker 1>The reaction drill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny,</v>

4091
03:06:07.020 --> 03:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4092
03:06:07.730 --> 03:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a test reaction to in football we </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to do,</v>

4093
03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>if you've got concussed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4094
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>before the season you do the test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how fast you are,</v>

4095
03:06:14.190 --> 03:06:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and then if you got concussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make you do it.</v>

4096
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>See how fast you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

4097
03:06:17.150 --> 03:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And then you do it two weeks later to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what is it comprised of?</v>

4098
03:06:20.680 --> 03:06:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

4099
03:06:21.450 --> 03:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different objects and you have</v>

4100
03:06:25.431 --> 03:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>to touch it when they blink and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to put patterns together.</v>

4101
03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:29.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4102
03:06:29.271 --> 03:06:30.250
<v Speaker 1>lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta like that.</v>

4103
03:06:30.280 --> 03:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>What was that game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon?</v>

4104
03:06:32.590 --> 03:06:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go simon.</v>

4105
03:06:34.491 --> 03:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>But with shapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shapes and colors,</v>

4106
03:06:37.340 --> 03:06:39.700
<v Speaker 1>and then you'd have a certain timeline </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't.</v>

4107
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Forty six seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a concussion,</v>

4108
03:06:41.870 --> 03:06:42.703
<v Speaker 1>did in two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it two weeks later you're back to </v>

4109
03:06:44.481 --> 03:06:45.314
<v Speaker 1>your normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting that we have </v>

4110
03:06:46.851 --> 03:06:47.684
<v Speaker 1>it that way because some people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue that there's some stupid </v>

4111
03:06:49.761 --> 03:06:51.790
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if they're concussed,</v>

4112
03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:53.570
<v Speaker 1>there's still going to suck at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst than you are.</v>

4113
03:06:53.600 --> 03:06:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they say,</v>

4114
03:06:54.220 --> 03:06:57.070
<v Speaker 1>let me back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and guys a moron,</v>

4115
03:06:57.080 --> 03:06:59.610
<v Speaker 1>he can't remember his own fucking name </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you let him play every week.</v>

4116
03:06:59.620 --> 03:07:00.453
<v Speaker 1>We're shooting coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's better ways brain we </v>

4117
03:07:03.211 --> 03:07:04.890
<v Speaker 1>just can't get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the thing is,</v>

4118
03:07:04.891 --> 03:07:05.724
<v Speaker 1>is not better ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the scariest things about cte is </v>

4119
03:07:07.890 --> 03:07:08.723
<v Speaker 1>they can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really check to see what you have until </v>

4120
03:07:10.741 --> 03:07:12.990
<v Speaker 1>after dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that the case?</v>

4121
03:07:13.110 --> 03:07:17.180
<v Speaker 1>How come they can't see that with mris </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that mri just aren't as effective yet</v>

4122
03:07:17.250 --> 03:07:19.320
<v Speaker 1>that matter doesn't show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

4123
03:07:19.530 --> 03:07:21.870
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of issues in the mris </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

4124
03:07:21.900 --> 03:07:25.560
<v Speaker 1>They did an mri on a dead salmon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain parts of the brain lit up.</v>

4125
03:07:25.860 --> 03:07:27.630
<v Speaker 1>So you got to be very obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

4126
03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's gone,</v>

4127
03:07:29.500 --> 03:07:31.270
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4128
03:07:31.470 --> 03:07:32.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they say,</v>

4129
03:07:32.490 --> 03:07:33.323
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this part of your brain lit up when you </v>

4130
03:07:34.171 --> 03:07:36.300
<v Speaker 1>were doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were thinking about this,</v>

4131
03:07:36.740 --> 03:07:38.310
<v Speaker 1>this a little bit misleading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

4132
03:07:38.810 --> 03:07:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Why is that like a shock that like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>area of their brain,</v>

4133
03:07:42.960 --> 03:07:43.793
<v Speaker 1>even though the body's dead might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird connection to the great </v>

4134
03:07:47.791 --> 03:07:52.590
<v Speaker 1>beyond while they're sitting there at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fulton fish market on a pile of ice,</v>

4135
03:07:52.591 --> 03:07:53.424
<v Speaker 1>like there's some part of their brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuning into the god force of the </v>

4136
03:07:57.781 --> 03:08:00.750
<v Speaker 1>universe and we just say it's over four </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

4137
03:08:00.750 --> 03:08:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Look no gills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already go to him.</v>

4138
03:08:03.510 --> 03:08:04.343
<v Speaker 1>It's over and he's there and his little </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fish head traveling through </v>

4139
03:08:09.610 --> 03:08:12.300
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wondered why when they cut your</v>

4140
03:08:12.301 --> 03:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>head off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

4141
03:08:13.390 --> 03:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>when to kill a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they cut your head off,</v>

4142
03:08:15.500 --> 03:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>they'd see people mouthing prayers while</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were still doing it.</v>

4143
03:08:18.180 --> 03:08:19.013
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you are you conscious of your </v>

4144
03:08:20.581 --> 03:08:23.430
<v Speaker 1>brain as oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your head cut off right away,</v>

4145
03:08:23.470 --> 03:08:24.303
<v Speaker 1>but who are you looking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible for your head and your </v>

4146
03:08:27.301 --> 03:08:30.270
<v Speaker 1>brain to be looking at your headless </v>
<v Speaker 1>body?</v>

4147
03:08:30.420 --> 03:08:31.231
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4148
03:08:31.231 --> 03:08:32.064
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal because when you head </v>

4149
03:08:32.911 --> 03:08:33.744
<v Speaker 1>gets cut off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood's not pumping through your </v>

4150
03:08:35.491 --> 03:08:36.090
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>

4151
03:08:36.090 --> 03:08:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4152
03:08:37.471 --> 03:08:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Your second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just some of it's going to spill out.</v>

4153
03:08:39.570 --> 03:08:40.403
<v Speaker 1>whatever's there is going to carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen to your fucking stupid brain for </v>

4154
03:08:43.051 --> 03:08:46.200
<v Speaker 1>as long as you stay alive and it's only </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be a few seconds,</v>

4155
03:08:46.290 --> 03:08:48.870
<v Speaker 1>so if you're lying there and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still blood in your brain,</v>

4156
03:08:48.871 --> 03:08:50.100
<v Speaker 1>you're looking over at your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

4157
03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:50.993
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and coming out of your mouth because </v>

4158
03:08:53.251 --> 03:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>you're not attached to your lungs </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

4159
03:08:55.290 --> 03:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they did.</v>

4160
03:08:57.400 --> 03:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Shot in the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You die like right away,</v>

4161
03:09:00.360 --> 03:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>like you have all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4162
03:09:01.801 --> 03:09:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't die right away.</v>

4163
03:09:03.450 --> 03:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>You guys really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body takes a few seconds.</v>

4164
03:09:06.300 --> 03:09:08.550
<v Speaker 1>it takes a few seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he had a shotgun,</v>

4165
03:09:08.551 --> 03:09:10.200
<v Speaker 1>just blow a hole through your chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would.</v>

4166
03:09:10.410 --> 03:09:11.420
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Texas.</v>

4167
03:09:12.290 --> 03:09:15.030
<v Speaker 1>You still get the oxygenated blood in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>

4168
03:09:15.060 --> 03:09:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Although when you get your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4169
03:09:16.180 --> 03:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>your head blown off the road when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be severed that quickly.</v>

4170
03:09:19.231 --> 03:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't knock you out though </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

4171
03:09:21.780 --> 03:09:22.613
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure in some cases there were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that the the size of the head </v>

4172
03:09:26.460 --> 03:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>would still be mouthing prayers as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

4173
03:09:29.160 --> 03:09:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4174
03:09:31.110 --> 03:09:31.943
<v Speaker 1>It was just always a well known that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you her head cut off to be saying </v>

4175
03:09:37.741 --> 03:09:38.574
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bet there's a book called a </v>

4176
03:09:40.630 --> 03:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>history of the guillotine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you have imagined this doctor?</v>

4177
03:09:43.090 --> 03:09:43.923
<v Speaker 1>Imagine being a town square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided some fucking pickpocket </v>

4178
03:09:46.470 --> 03:09:49.140
<v Speaker 1>needs to get his head caught off in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of everybody and get to see.</v>

4179
03:09:50.040 --> 03:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>That was the containment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

4180
03:09:51.961 --> 03:09:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but how crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine watching</v>

4181
03:09:54.130 --> 03:09:54.963
<v Speaker 2>that big thing dropped down on someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>head and the fucking head hit the </v>

4182
03:09:57.041 --> 03:10:00.940
<v Speaker 2>basket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still in to it.</v>

4183
03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Those ices vetoes are bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort.</v>

4184
03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:05.340
<v Speaker 2>It's more views than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't Mississippi?</v>

4185
03:10:05.350 --> 03:10:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Just it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it Mississippi?</v>

4186
03:10:07.001 --> 03:10:09.640
<v Speaker 2>They just passed a law allowing firing </v>
<v Speaker 2>squad executions.</v>

4187
03:10:09.641 --> 03:10:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some redneck shit.</v>

4188
03:10:11.380 --> 03:10:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Sipping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be Mississippi.</v>

4189
03:10:14.170 --> 03:10:15.003
<v Speaker 2>Every message y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they having problems getting the </v>

4190
03:10:17.591 --> 03:10:18.940
<v Speaker 2>medicine or the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4191
03:10:18.941 --> 03:10:20.470
<v Speaker 2>so they just plenty of bullets down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4192
03:10:20.471 --> 03:10:21.304
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it mean it is kind of weird that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a good way in a bad way to </v>

4193
03:10:23.831 --> 03:10:24.664
<v Speaker 2>kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People still have public executions and </v>

4194
03:10:27.401 --> 03:10:28.234
<v Speaker 2>they had the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really the sword and he comes </v>

4195
03:10:30.641 --> 03:10:34.080
<v Speaker 2>out and you brought out and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there,</v>

4196
03:10:34.310 --> 03:10:35.440
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4197
03:10:35.920 --> 03:10:36.753
<v Speaker 2>somebody says a blessing over you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were able to say some prayers and </v>

4198
03:10:39.371 --> 03:10:42.730
<v Speaker 2>then I believe my dad witnessed this a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple times.</v>

4199
03:10:43.180 --> 03:10:45.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a public thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you squat down.</v>

4200
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Dad witnessed this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4201
03:10:47.141 --> 03:10:49.300
<v Speaker 2>because there's officers right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get on your knees.</v>

4202
03:10:49.301 --> 03:10:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So he's just sat up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why did he go out and watch it?</v>

4203
03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.610
<v Speaker 2>He could actually see some of it from </v>
<v Speaker 2>his window.</v>

4204
03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Apparently his office window but prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>

4205
03:10:56.650 --> 03:10:59.920
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was there and he saw it and my mother</v>

4206
03:10:59.921 --> 03:11:02.740
<v Speaker 2>saw it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the guy would be his hands,</v>

4207
03:11:02.741 --> 03:11:03.574
<v Speaker 2>I believe were tied behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His back is forced to squat and what </v>

4208
03:11:05.201 --> 03:11:08.530
<v Speaker 2>they'll do is if they're good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll jab you a little bit.</v>

4209
03:11:08.531 --> 03:11:11.140
<v Speaker 2>So you stiffen and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really quickly the head comes off.</v>

4210
03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:14.050
<v Speaker 2>so they jab me in the back and they say </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body so you don't sway.</v>

4211
03:11:14.110 --> 03:11:14.830
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4212
03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:17.800
<v Speaker 2>and then it comes right off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they still do.</v>

4213
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:19.830
<v Speaker 2>They still have the death penalty in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

4214
03:11:19.900 --> 03:11:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last ad they do,</v>

4215
03:11:21.131 --> 03:11:23.180
<v Speaker 2>but they haven't killed anybody here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a while.</v>

4216
03:11:23.420 --> 03:11:26.620
<v Speaker 2>We're these the kill people with gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>chambers is the most evil,</v>

4217
03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:31.760
<v Speaker 2>not extra city electricity when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>

4218
03:11:32.860 --> 03:11:36.340
<v Speaker 2>What's weird is that like real violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bullets is what we frowned upon the</v>

4219
03:11:36.341 --> 03:11:37.174
<v Speaker 2>real effective way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like shooting someone that had put a </v>

4220
03:11:38.261 --> 03:11:39.094
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4221
03:11:39.340 --> 03:11:40.121
<v Speaker 2>Blow it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4222
03:11:40.121 --> 03:11:43.530
<v Speaker 2>The most cheapest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easiest way for some.</v>

4223
03:11:43.540 --> 03:11:46.510
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should attend humane for sure.</v>

4224
03:11:46.511 --> 03:11:47.344
<v Speaker 2>What works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so a gas chamber is supposed to be </v>

4225
03:11:49.541 --> 03:11:51.100
<v Speaker 2>humane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying shoot him.</v>

4226
03:11:51.101 --> 03:11:52.740
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously cheaper than the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

4227
03:11:52.890 --> 03:11:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Are they doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they using the gas chamber because I</v>

4228
03:11:55.631 --> 03:11:57.610
<v Speaker 2>try to be humane or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or are they trying to be evil?</v>

4229
03:11:58.290 --> 03:12:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Get figure out a way to do it where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems more systematic than a bullet will</v>

4230
03:12:03.401 --> 03:12:04.234
<v Speaker 2>also be more injections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think now lethal injection is the </v>

4231
03:12:07.271 --> 03:12:08.104
<v Speaker 2>most common.</v>

4232
03:12:08.430 --> 03:12:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Was the gas chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

4233
03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:10.983
<v Speaker 2>was it to be humane in California or is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be an evil and we're going to get </v>

4234
03:12:15.131 --> 03:12:16.160
<v Speaker 2>revenge on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kill.</v>

4235
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I believe that public execution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it was done in this country,</v>

4236
03:12:19.931 --> 03:12:22.840
<v Speaker 2>whether it was through anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was hanging,</v>

4237
03:12:22.841 --> 03:12:25.420
<v Speaker 2>whether it was electric chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was gas chamber,</v>

4238
03:12:25.660 --> 03:12:26.493
<v Speaker 2>there was always the idea that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be done at least by the </v>

4239
03:12:29.921 --> 03:12:32.110
<v Speaker 2>state in a dignified manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough,</v>

4240
03:12:32.140 --> 03:12:32.973
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in a way that constitutes cruel and </v>

4241
03:12:35.651 --> 03:12:37.160
<v Speaker 2>unusual punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

4242
03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:38.140
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's uh,</v>

4243
03:12:38.390 --> 03:12:40.350
<v Speaker 2>so you would never talk to somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

4244
03:12:40.380 --> 03:12:42.670
<v Speaker 2>You try to make it as quickly as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

4245
03:12:42.671 --> 03:12:45.220
<v Speaker 2>as systematic as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The state says you have to die.</v>

4246
03:12:45.430 --> 03:12:46.263
<v Speaker 2>You give your life up for the crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You committed an eye for an eye and </v>

4247
03:12:48.491 --> 03:12:51.010
<v Speaker 2>that's done in a very sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>antiseptic,</v>

4248
03:12:51.020 --> 03:12:52.010
<v Speaker 2>systematic way,</v>

4249
03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:54.560
<v Speaker 1>but you fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4250
03:12:54.561 --> 03:12:55.394
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up when you're strapped to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chair and you're looking up and all the </v>

4251
03:12:58.251 --> 03:12:59.084
<v Speaker 1>people that were friends with the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who killed are staring at you and </v>

4252
03:13:02.661 --> 03:13:03.494
<v Speaker 1>they're about to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go about to fucking screw this </v>

4253
03:13:05.991 --> 03:13:10.991
<v Speaker 1>electrical down on your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't listen to even more fucked up,</v>

4254
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.983
<v Speaker 1>but you can't see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason they don't shoot you </v>

4255
03:13:21.471 --> 03:13:22.940
<v Speaker 1>in the head is to that you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

4256
03:13:22.941 --> 03:13:24.860
<v Speaker 1>If the family wants to have an open </v>
<v Speaker 1>casket,</v>

4257
03:13:24.861 --> 03:13:27.730
<v Speaker 1>funeral and all that goes out the window</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you killed.</v>

4258
03:13:27.880 --> 03:13:28.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

4259
03:13:28.490 --> 03:13:29.323
<v Speaker 1>We know what's really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was that they give you </v>

4260
03:13:31.070 --> 03:13:33.680
<v Speaker 1>your choice of what you get to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4261
03:13:33.860 --> 03:13:36.430
<v Speaker 1>You get a last meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick your last meal.</v>

4262
03:13:36.650 --> 03:13:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fuck you in ell sandwich.</v>

<v Speaker 1>choice?</v>

4266
03:13:44.780 --> 03:13:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Electric chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas chamber or lethal injection.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so that in there as well.</v>

4268
03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Lethal injection because they put you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

03:13:51.291 --> 03:13:54.410
<v Speaker 1>first 50 will run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about between electric chair or gas</v>

4272
03:13:56.810 --> 03:13:58.130

<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You foam at the mouth.</v>

4276
03:14:06.500 --> 03:14:07.333
<v Speaker 1>I like how they have to hit you again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes hit them again with the </v>

4277
03:14:10.731 --> 03:14:13.070
<v Speaker 1>electric chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work and they tried it twice.</v>

4278
03:14:13.420 --> 03:14:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work on the dude and now they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't kill them.</v>

4279
03:14:15.770 --> 03:14:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you bleed to death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this before.</v>

4280
03:14:18.651 --> 03:14:23.651
<v Speaker 1>Those killings and faces of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are definitely.</v>

4281
03:14:23.900 --> 03:14:26.990
<v Speaker 1>They're all real creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are definitely real.</v>

4282
03:14:27.130 --> 03:14:29.630
<v Speaker 1>There was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really real one where they have this guy</v>

4283
03:14:29.631 --> 03:14:30.464
<v Speaker 1>from the middle east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tied them to two different trucks </v>

4284
03:14:31.881 --> 03:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>and pull them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's real documentary.</v>

4285
03:14:36.311 --> 03:14:37.144
<v Speaker 1>It was on youtube that set the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about the guys who put it </v>

4286
03:14:40.281 --> 03:14:41.660
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being interviewed.</v>

4287
03:14:41.661 --> 03:14:42.494
<v Speaker 1>The guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do everything and they show you </v>

4288
03:14:45.171 --> 03:14:47.360
<v Speaker 1>how they did the monkey brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

4289
03:14:47.420 --> 03:14:48.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely fake.</v>

4290
03:14:48.770 --> 03:14:50.160
<v Speaker 1>It's all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of it.</v>

4291
03:14:50.360 --> 03:14:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Where they eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had.</v>

03:14:53.180 --> 03:14:54.013
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second 80.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true because like that </v>

4293
03:14:55.071 --> 03:14:57.410
<v Speaker 1>fucking judge shot himself on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

4294

<v Speaker 1>guy really shut the fucking ones.</v>

4297
03:15:06.320 --> 03:15:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which one he was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw something with the guys who put it</v>

4298
03:15:10.341 --> 03:15:12.230
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that directors or they put it together,</v>

4299
03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:13.153
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about different people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the scenes and they're going through </v>

4300
03:15:14.421 --> 03:15:15.254
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a guy who jumped off and he </v>

4301

<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a lot of people that dIed.</v>

4302
03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I think the whole thing was faked.</v>
